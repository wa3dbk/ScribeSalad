00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Hey! This episode was sponsored by Head &amp; Shoulders.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:13.040
A hundred and twenty-five million years ago in what is now China, dinosaurs walked the earth.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.360
and a few species of small feathered dinosaurs climbed trees

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.300
This is Sinornithosaurus

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.960
Although they couldn't truly fly, they could glide, which helped them evade predators and catch prey

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.580
What makes these dinosaurs unique is how well-preserved their fossils were.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.740
Normally when you find a dinosaur it's just a pile of bones and that's all there is.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.620
In between the feathers and the parts of the feather we saw little bits of skin

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.200
And you can tell that they are skin - they're not just random bits of rock or broken up bone or something

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.620
because they have a particular kind of cells within the structure

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.880
which are just like the skin cells that we find in humans today

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.860
Well, my first thought when I saw these was this is dinosaur dandruff

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.400
and I was already planning to write the paper with the headline of we have discovered dinosaur dandruff,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.800
I thought great.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.920
So these dinosaurs may have had the first known case of dandruff.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.700
But it certainly wasn't the last

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.360
Our skin cells are constantly replenishing themselves

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.880
in fact every second 500 new skin cells are created

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.700
and as they move up through the outer layer of your skin, the epidermis

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.800
They flatten out and harden until they fall off one by one

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.440
In fact over your lifetime you will shed about a hundred pounds of dead skin

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.740
But we don't really notice this because skin falls off in such tiny microscopic pieces

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.180
except for some people from some parts of the body skin comes off in larger flakes

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.300
typically from the skin under the hair the scalp and this is what's known as dandruff

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.540
Now around half of everyone on earth suffers from it.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.040
So there are actually a lot of scientists who study this condition.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.060
and I'm flying to Cincinnati to Head &amp; Shoulders headquarters to visit their lab

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.800
Okay.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.060
Do you need a break or something?

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.200
No, it's funny like 'cause I'm not really sure what I'm getting myself into right

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.320
No. No.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.400
I am going to have my head swabbed

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.880
Mm-hmm. You are

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.160
What what is that all about? I mean, this is something you do to people all the time?

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.540
Oh, yeah. Every day.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.120
--You're gonna cotton swab my scalp. --Yes

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.140
And we're looking for what？

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.000
So we are gonna be looking for the malassezia that is on your scalp.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.220
Okay, so what do I need to do?

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.420
So I need you to have a seat here.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.380
Let's see and I just put my head in here?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.320
Yeah, put your head face forward. Okay. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna part your hair.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.340
So now I'm gonna take my swab I'm basically gonna grab off your scalp. Mm-hmm

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.640
So then what I do is I take this

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.360
These are sticky plates here that I can plate the malassezia on

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.400
and what I can do is I can add a stain

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.300
throw this under the microscope and this is the individual cells of malassezia here.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.380
Malassezia globosa is a fungus that lives on your scalp

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.840
it thrives in the warm moist environment under your hair

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.640
and it is thought to be one of the causes of dandruff. So, how did my swab come back?

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.120
Well, I have malassezia living on my head.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.420
This is actually what the fungus looks like. This is a lawn of the Malassezia globosa fungi.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.100
You say a lawn. It's a lawn.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.780
So basically you can see those little dots they're all individual colonies

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.640
and when they grow really close together like that, that's a lawn, Kind of like a bunch of grass

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.900
Now that I'm close to and actually smell it it smells like bread

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.780
Yeah, well, you know, it's a yeast

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.400
 You know it's a free, living fungus just like the Saccharomyces that are used to make bread and make beer with

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.780
So, could you make bread with this?

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.540
Uh.. No. I wouldn't want to make bread with the yeast off of your scalp. Not right now.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.420
-- Have you been tested? -- I've been tested. Yes. -- And what did it come out to?

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.420
I have a decent amount. So... But we all do. So...

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.360
It's on everyone's head.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.400
It's on everyone's head as long as you have hair. --Right

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.560
But if everyone has Malassezia, why do only half of us get dandruff?

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.520
Well Malassezia lives on the oils called sebum secreted by your skin

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.540
The fungi release enzymes called lipases that break down fat molecules

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.320
Oh, so this is one of the lipases that Malassezia produces

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.120
So this is something that Malassezia uses to get food

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.840
But unfortunately as a byproduct of that it also attacks your scalp

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.840
because it produces free fatty acids that irritate the scalp

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.400
for some of us those molecules are perceived as invaders if you will

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.360
and all the defensive forces that we have will get turned on to repel essentially these invading molecules

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.740
and those defensive forces end up causing this collateral damage

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.660
that we interpret as an unhealthy scalp and dandruff

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.020
One of the scalps defenses is to speed up the turnover of skin cells

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.180
So instead of taking a month for skin cells to mature and reach the surface they take as little as seven days

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.800
When you know they get to the surface the adhesive function from one cell to the other hasn't been lost

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.580
And so they shed as these clumps of skin cells three or four hundred together, which we see as a dandruff flake

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.820
the dandruff flakes are just an indicator of a fundamentally unhealthy scalp underlying it

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.980
by any measure you can dream of making

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.760
Dandruff skin samples show elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.840
Histamines which cause itching, and blood proteins on the surface of the scalp

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.980
Indicating that the skin is not acting as a good barrier between your insides and the outside world

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.380
But it goes even further than that down to the level of gene expression

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.520
Scientists took swabs from healthy scalps and dandruff scalps and then they extracted the RNA

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.360
Effectively markers of which genes are being expressed and how strongly

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.280
and then they compared the two groups

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.140
and they found that there were nearly 4000 genes which were systematically

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.500
either up-regulated or down-regulated in the dandruff scalps  compared to the healthy scalps

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.340
for example immune and inflammatory response genes were up-regulated,

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.420
things like lipid metabolism were down regulated and it all kind of makes sense

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.280
But now that you know that there's a difference at the level of gene expression,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.960
How do you actually treat dandruff?

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.220
So this is the the lawn of Malassezia.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.360
This is the Malassezia with a spot of the Head &amp; Shoulders active put on it

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.280
The Malassezia just doesn't grow where that Head &amp; Shoulders active actually is

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.900
These active ingredients can be zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, or piroctone olamine.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:03.780
They are controlling the metabolism of those Malassezia cells that are leading to irritating substances

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.200
so the idea is to suppress their bio activity to some extent

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.920
so that we're reducing the level of irritating substances on our scalp

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.980
that trigger the irritation and hyperproliferation and buried destruction that we talked about

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.840
now that we understand like these clusters in these genes signatures of dandruff is

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.040
Can we reverse these gene signatures if we treat with Head &amp; Shoulders?

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.480
So this is the group of dandruff at baseline and these genes are all down-regulated

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.280
and then these genes are up-regulated

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.980
You can see if you treat with just a cosmetic shampoo that you really don't make a difference in those genes

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.900
But if you treat with Head &amp; Shoulders after three weeks

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.060
This signature looks just like somebody who doesn't have dandruff.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.740
And so you're looking at 3,700 genes have all clustered all on here,

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.820
And you're seeing them flip around. They're going from an unhealthy signature to a healthy signature

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.640
So Head &amp; Shoulders reduces the Malassezia irritants on the scalp,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.880
changing your scalp‘s response, and ultimately reducing skin flakes

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.200
So unlike dinosaurs, we don't have to live with dandruff

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:10.740
But in their case the presence of skin flakes reveals something important about their biology

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:16.260
They had evolved warm-bloodedness and hence feathers as a way to keep warm

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:23.140
But once they had feathers skin could no longer be shed in one piece like a snake but instead in tiny pieces

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:30.100
So in fact, although it's an amusing discovery it actually had quite an important or profound point

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.580
because it tells us that dinosaurs while commonly called reptiles

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:40.000
are on the side of the birds and the mammals in terms of physiology. They were definitely warm-blooded

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.160
Hey, I hope you learned something from watching this video I certainly learned a lot making it.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.100
and if you want to find out more about Head &amp; Shoulders research or about how to get rid of dandruff

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.790
I will put a link to their website down in the description

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.940
so I want to say a big thanks to Head &amp; Shoulders for supporting this episode of Veritasium

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.220
and I want to thank you for washing. Or, watching
