00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.730
Let's talk about the science of climate change.
Don't you mean Global Warming?

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.830
How'd you get in here?
I'm the Internet, I never left. Now why'd

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.600
you change the name? Global warming wasn't
happening so you had to call it "Climate Change"?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.140
The overall average temperature of the planet
is increasing so Global Warming is technically

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.109
correct, but that doesn't mean it's going
to be warmer everywhere all the time.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.300
And that leads to some confusion, like on
a cold winter's day, you might say...

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.929
So much for global warming!
Exactly.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.940
So the term climate change indicates that
the problem is more intense storms, droughts

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.930
and floods, ocean acidification, not just
that the globe is warming.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.870
But it's not.
What?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.820
The globe's not warming.
Since when?

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.719
1995
Um, that's not how you draw a trendline through

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.539
data.
If the slope is nil, the climate's chill.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.719
Y'know thirteen of the fourteen hottest years
occurred this century and the graph you're

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.620
using is old, it doesn't include satellite
data. If you take that into a count, the trend

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.480
is obviously continuing upwards.
Oh, so now you say it's warming. In the past

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.180
scientists told us it was cooling. Why can't
they just admit that they have no idea what's

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.260
going on?
It's true in the 1970's there were some papers

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.820
published predicting cooling, but over that
same time period there were six times as many

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.090
papers predicting warming. So scientists really
haven't changed their tune.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.550
Well just judging by temperatures, I say they're
wrong. The Earth is cooling.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.220
But you don't just have to go by temperatures.
There are plenty of other signs that the globe

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.900
is warming, like sea levels are rising three
millimetres a year. That's an indication that

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.390
the oceans are getting warmer and so are expanding.
Ice on Antarctica and Greenland is melting

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.630
at unprecedented rates and arctic sea ice
continues to decline.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.860
Nuh-uh. Arctic sea ice increased forty percent
in the last two years.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.910
That last little uptick? That's what you focus
on? What about the general downward trend?

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.190
It could mean anything. You know if the Earth
is warming the most likely source of the problem

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.220
is the sun. The sun is getting brighter. Did
you ever think of that?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.099
The sun was getting brighter, in the 1930's,
and it probably contributed to some warming

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.459
then. But since the 50's the sun has been
getting dimmer and temperatures continue to

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.010
rise.
Oh, so you automatically assume it's man-made

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.569
CO2.
You know humans only emit a tiny fraction

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.430
of the CO2 released into the atmosphere every
year.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.180
That's true. People emit about 30 gigatonnes
compared with 780 gigatonnes from natural

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.180
land and ocean processes.
So you admit it, humans aren't the problem.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.540
No! Before us the system was in balance with
the land and oceans absorbing that same amount

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.310
- 780 gigatonnes a year.
This balance kept the carbon dioxide levels

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.969
in the atmosphere between 180 and 280 part
per million for 800,000 years. Now it's at

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:57.209
400 parts per million and still rising.
But our small contribution couldn't have caused

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.810
that.
Well the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.959
increasing by about fifteen gigatonnes or
two parts per million every year.

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.689
But how do you know that's man-made CO2?
Because the isotope carbon-13 is less common

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.780
in fossil fuels than it is naturally in the
atmosphere. And over time we're seeing the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.060
concentrations of carbon-13 are decreasing.
But volcanoes emit way more CO2 than humans.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.999
No they don't. They emit about 0.25 gigatonnes
annually. That's less than one percent as

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.609
much as humans.
OK, well even if we are responsible for the

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.389
rise in CO2, it doesn't matter because water
is by far the most potent greenhouse gas.

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.569
Yes it is.
I win.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.029
No you don't!
Water in the atmosphere is increasing as well.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.799
But that can't be due to human activity.
The only way for the atmosphere to hold more

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.529
water vapour is if it gets warmer. So...
Hang on, you're not saying...

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:56.689
Yes! It all comes back to CO2. A doubling
of CO2 on its own would increase the temperature

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.870
of the globe by one degree Celsius. But that
warming means there will be more water vapour

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.029
in the atmosphere and ice will melt reducing
the reflectivity of Earth's surface. So it's

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:11.669
a positive feedback loop, which a bunch of
different sources of evidence all indicate

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.430
will lead to about a 3 degree Celsius rise
in temperature.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.959
But if this is true, why have all the predictions
failed. In actuality most of the predictions

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.220
show remarkable agreement with observations.
But you're probably thinking of the model

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.720
from 1988, back when we thought climate sensitivity
was higher. If you re-run that model with

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.860
3 degrees of warming for every doubling of
CO2, the predictions match exactly the warming

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.630
that we've observed.
But the Earth has warmed and cooled in the

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.150
past. So who was releasing CO2 then, aliens?
We understand that past changes in the climate

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.340
were triggered at regular intervals by Milankovitch
cycles, that is the periodic oscillation of

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.460
the Earth's tilt, precession of the tilt,
and stretching and squishing of Earth's elliptical

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.800
orbit.
During every warming cycle, CO2 and temperature

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.290
rise together.
Ah, but if you look closely at that graph,

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.050
you'll see that CO2 lags behind the temperature
rise, so it can't be causing the warming.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.970
The CO2 doesn't cause the first warming. The
Milankovitch cycles change the way the sunlight

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.190
hits the Earth and that causes a little bit
of warming decreasing the solubility of CO2

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.880
in the oceans. So some of that CO2 is released
and that is a positive feedback loop, which

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.010
amplifies the warming. In fact over 90% of
the increase happens after the CO2 starts

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.000
to rise.
Let's say you're right, and the CO2 we're

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.540
releasing is warming the planet. What's so
bad about that? The planet gets a little warmer,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.670
big deal.
I'm not claiming it's going to be some sort

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.130
of crazy catastrophe, but we are going to
get more intense storms, more droughts and

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.530
floods, the oceans will become more acidic,
sea levels will rise and my point is it would

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.440
be better for all species on this planet and
probably cheaper for us if we just started

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.570
reducing emissions now than if we wait and
pay the consequences later.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:04.570
No thanks.
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.740
Global warming.

spread misinformation about certain topics

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.920
like how cigarettes cause lung cancer, or
how CFC's cause the ozone hole, or now how

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.760
CO2 is causing the planet to warm. So if you
want to find out more about that you can download

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.370
