00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.820
Today, we’re trying something that’s never
been done before.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.230
I have made this video and Destin has made
a video on Smarter Every Day and we want you

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.519
to play them both at the same time.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.660
So there’s a link to his video down in the
description so find a way to load both of

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:30.019
these videos and then synchronize them on
my mark in 5 4 3 2 1

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.880
In Sydney, Australia we are at 34 degrees
South Lattitude.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.240
Which is the opposite side of the world from
Huntsville, Alabama.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.520
So, which way do the toilets flush?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:55.880
That is the question.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.050
The Simpsons did a whole episode based on
toilets flushing the opposite direction in

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.050
Australia.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:18.180
Plus, other shows have supposedly demonstrated
this effect.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.110
So is this a real effect or not?

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.150
“The application of this principle to water
draining in Earth's two hemispheres is just

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.960
bunk.”

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.390
If you try it yourself, you’ll find inconsistent
results.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:49.960
This sink sometimes drains one way and sometimes
the other way

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.990
In any container of water there's always going
to be some rotation.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.360
The water is not perfectly still.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.250
And it is this, rather than the hemisphere
that determines which way the water will swirl

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:09.090
down the drain.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.670
But what if we could eliminate all motion
from the water?

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.050
I have here a five foot wide kiddy pool

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:31.560
I actually filled the pool in the anticlockwise
direction to be sure any clockwise motion

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.639
we see is not due to how I filled the pool.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.810
I’ve left this water sitting here for 24
hours.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.079
So it seems like I've damped all of the motion
from the filling.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:56.109
I 
really hope this works.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.989
Destin, wish me luck!

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.190
I'm about to pull the plug 3...

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.180
2...

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.170
1...

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:19.079
And the pool is draining, but you can't see
any motion of the water just yet.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.680
To help us see where the water is flowing
I'm going to put some food colouring in on

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:40.849
the four cardinal directions around the pool.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.319
You can clearly see that the water is flowing
clockwise, in this direction and that makes

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:54.959
sense because that's how it should flow in
the southern hemisphere due to the Earth's

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.540
rotation.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.579
But you can see what a tiny little effect
it is and what extraordinary lengths I had

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.139
to go to to see this effect.

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.489
So really you're not going to see it in a
bathtub or in a toilet or in a sink because

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:19.060
there are other sources of angular momentum
that totally wash out this effect.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.440
The Coriolis effect.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.319
There you have it...

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.759
It works!

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:31.580
To understand how it works, imagine a pool
with one edge touching the south pole.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.560
The pool is stationary relative to Earth,
but every day it’s actually completing one

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.370
full revolution.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.190
You can see the side of the pool furthest
from the pole travels much farther every day

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:55.240
than the side right next to the pole.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.611
So the outer side of the pool is moving fastest
towards the East and as you get closer to

00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:06.400
the pole the velocity decreases down to zero.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.960
Now imagine we drain the pool.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.560
Water from the far side is moving too fast
relative to the drain and so it gets out ahead,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:31.930
whereas water from near the pole is going
too slow and so it lags behind.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.110
So when the water approaches the drain, it
swirls clockwise.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:51.319
And this is the reason cyclones swirl clockwise
in the Southern hemisphere.

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.830
The higher pressure air rushes into the eye
of the storm and, just like in our pool, swirls

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:04.050
in the direction dictated by the hemisphere
And that’s the truth about toilet swirl

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.330
I definitely learned something and if you
did too then you should share these videos

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.560
with your friends.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.219
So you should subscribe to this guy.

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.539
Subscribe to Destin, Smarter Every Day.

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:19.629
Okay.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.910
Ah, you're here!

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.370
That's what we're gonna do.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:37.190
We are going to subscribe to Veritasium en
mass because it's an awesome channel.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.190
Oh, oh look.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.260
Where is the subscribe button?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.229
But seriously, have you subscribed to Smarter
Every Day yet?

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:51.349
Destin has made some of the best videos on
the internet, like the backwards bicycle,

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.080
Prince Rupert's Drop, and what it looks like
to get a tattoo in slow motion.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.960
I've been friends with Destin for about three
years and I'm pretty much convinced that the

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.580
man is superhuman.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.909
Not only does he run a remarkably successful
YouTube channel, he also has a wife and four

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.849
kids AND he has a full time job.

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:11.840
The man is literally a rocket scientist.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.229
And he's friends with astronauts and when
he asks them questions, they answer him from

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:18.229
space.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.360
"you are getting smarter every day".

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.419
This man deserves your subscription.

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.380
If you're not subscribed to him already I
don't know what you've been doing with your

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.139
life, but go over to his channel right now
and subscribe to Smarter Every Day and trust

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:32.590
me, you will thank me later.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.469
And I want to thank you for watching.

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:39.439
Y'know we have been working on this collaboration
for about three years and it feels so good

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.340
to have it finally out there in the world.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.470
I hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed
making it.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:50.199
All right, I'll see you next time.
