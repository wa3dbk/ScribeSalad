00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.360
On November 22, 2014

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.280
a burst of x-rays was detected by ASASSN

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.500
that's the All Sky Automated Survey for Super Novae

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.880
but this was no supernova

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.520
the signal came  from the center of a galaxy around 290 million light-years away

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.300
and what we now belive happened was a star came too close to a supermassive black hole

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.460
with a mass millions of times that of our Sun and it was eaten

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.960
The black hole fed on the star

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.080
and yes, this is the actual termenology astrophysicists use to describe it

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.400
Events like these are thought to be rare

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.560
occurring maybe once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in a galaxy

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.460
they're called Tidal Disruption Events, or Tidal Disruption Flares

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.460
as the star approached the side closest to the black hole experienced a much gravitational pull than the other side,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.620
ripping the star to shreds

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.240
matter spiraling into the black hole formed an accretion disk

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.520
an annular ring of gas and dust

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.460
that's accelerating and heating up emitting visible light

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.380
UV and X-rays observable from Earth

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.080
Now what's remarkable about this event is that it transformed a dormant

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.580
or quiescent black hole

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.380
one that wasn't really feeding into one that we can observe

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.880
thanks to the matter falling in from that star

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300
and is what it looked like

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.540
Okay if you're disappointed,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.300
check out these artists renditions of the same event

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.960
but if you're cynical you might say

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.660
"Well how do we know that's what really happened?

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.360
what if the scientists are just making this up to get more grant funding

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.780
or to inspire people to go into science"

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.500
well I'll explain how we know this is actually what went down

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.020
but first things got wierder

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.960
scientists trained three X-ray telescopes to observe this part of the sky for years after the event

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.000
and what they found was a strong and regular pulse of X-rays

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.700
brightening and dimming every 131 seconds

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.740
and it shows up in the data from all three telescopes

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.520
they observed periodically over 450 days

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.580
but the pulse maintained this rhythm and didn't get weaker

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.120
in fact as time went on the relative strength of the pulse got stronger

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.160
modulating the X-ray signal by around 40%

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.980
and what was causing these periodic flashes of X-rays

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.740
and what could it tell us about the black hole

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.320
well let's back up

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.900
because black holes are some of the simplest objects in the Universe

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.920
by that I just mean that they are characterized by only two attributes

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.860
Mass and Spin

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.520
Okay, there's also charge

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.860
but since black holes should essentially be neutral mass and spin

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.200
are the two that count

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.640
mass is relatively easy to determine

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.180
far away from a black hole, you can even use Newtonian physics.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.780
By measuring the gravitational effects of the black hole on other bodies，

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.180
you can estimate the mass of of the black hole

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.700
this has been done and black holes been found with masses ranging from

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.320
just few times our Sun, stellar-mass black holes,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.240
up to billions of solar masses -- supermassive black holes

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.620
it's generally accepted that there is a supermassive black hole at the centers of most galaxies, including our own.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.560
But what about spin?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.440
since black holes form from collapsing stars and all known starts rotate,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.160
all black holes should also be rotating

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.580
I mean, what are the chances that a bunch of matter just collapses into a point perfectly with no rotation?

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.580
It's just not going to happen.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.560
And then additional matter falling into the black hole contributes its angular momentum.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.960
So like a figure skater pulling their arms into a... point object,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.980
You can imagine black holes get spinning pretty fast.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.000
But spin is harder to measure because unlike mass, it only affects objects relatively close to the black hole.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.440
But there is a way to do it. Actually, 3 ways.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.880
To understand all of them, you have to understand isco.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.940
In Newtonian physics, around a compact mass,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.240
you can place an object in a circular object at any radius and it will be stable.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.320
It doesn't matter how close you get.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.140
This is not the case according to general relativity.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.120
Here, there is an innermost stable circular orbit,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.900
With a radius know as r-isco.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.240
Closer than this, and no orbits are stable: they all fall into the black hole.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.840
So when you're looking at a black hole that is feeding, the innermost edge of the accretion disk is at r-isco.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.320
What's useful for our purposes is that r-isco depends on the spin of the black hole.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.140
The faster it's spinning, the smaller r-isco becomes.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.840
Assuming it's spinning in the same direction as the matter in the accretion disk.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.900
The rotation enables particles to orbit closer to the black hole,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.520
than they'd be able to for a non-spinning black hole.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.580
So you can kind of think of it as though the spin is supporting the particles against the relentless pull of gravity.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.420
Now spin is normally discussed in terms of a dimensionless parameter

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.080
that ranges from 0, no spin, to 1, maximum spin.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.520
Though I guess you could also have spins down to -1 if the black hole is spinning in the opposite direction from the accretion disk.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.240
Now, as spin increases, r-isco decreases.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.540
by a factor of 6, shrinking down to the size of the event horizon.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.740
And this sets what many scientists think is the maximum spin a black hole can have.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.860
Because if the minimum stable orbit were the size of the event horizon,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.440
Then light could escape from the black hole, allowing us to see into the singularity.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.940
This is called a naked singularity, and it makes a lot of scientists uncomfortable.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.940
As yet, there isn't a strong theoretical reason why a black hole can't exceed this maximum spin,

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.680
It's just that we haven't seen one, and the thought of an exposed singularity just kind of... feels wrong.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.660
Most suspect the maximum real-world spin parameter is around 0.998.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.260
So how can you use r-isco to measure the spin of a black hole?

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.580
Well first, let's think of how we measure the size of anything far away from us in deep space, like the radius of a star

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.960
Most stars are so far away that they're simply point objects in our telescopes.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.660
So how can you figure out their radii?

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.180
Well, first, look at the spectrum of their light.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.020
By seeing how red-shifted absorption lines are, you can determine how far away the star is.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.700
The spectrum also tells you the temperature of the star --

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.960
Because it should approximate a black-body curve.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.860
And now the power radiated per unit area is strongly dependent on its temperature.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.700
So if you know how bright the star appears from Earth,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.700
how far away it is, and how much power its radiating per unit area,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.820
Well, then you could work out its area and hence its radius.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.460
You can actually so something very similar for a black hole's accretion disk.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.080
Just instead of estimating the radius of a glowing sphere,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.240
you're estimating the radius of the dark circle, r-isco, in the middle of the glowing accretion disk.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.160
Then you can use r-isco to find the spin parameter.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.840
This has been done for a number of black holes, revealing spin parameters from around 0.1 up to close to the maximum.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:51.400
But this method only works if the radiation from the black hole is dominated by black-body radiation from the accretion disk.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.140
which, often, it's not.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.050
Another approach involves looking at x-rays emitted by iron around a black hole.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.280
Some black holes show a distinct iron emission line.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.650
But instead of the single frequency you'd expect,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.280
the line is broadened by factors like the Doppler shift due to the high velocity of the iron in the accretion disk.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.310
and gravitational redshift, due to the extreme gravitational fields close to the black hole.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.310
By looking at the low-energy limit of the iron emission line,

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.820
you can determine how close the black hole it was emitted.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.370
And hence, r-isco.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.020
But what if there is no bright iron emission line?

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.170
Well, luckily, there is a third way.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.710
And that, is to look for periodic oscillations in the data.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.600
Like the repeated x-rays observed every 131 seconds.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.770
The thinking is, these cycles must be caused by clumps of matter orbiting the black hole.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.880
And at frequencies that high, they must be orbiting very close in, probably near r-isco.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.710
Even that close, they'd be going half the speed of light.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.820
But what kind of clumps or objects would these be?

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.570
Well the study's authors argue that the best candidate involves an unlikely scenario:

00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:01.910
Years before the tidal disruption event, they propose that there was a white dwarf start in orbit around this black hole.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.280
Now, it might be stable, orbiting in this way, for perhaps one or two hundred years.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.020
By itself it wouldn't be visible from Earth.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.850
But then the other star wondered by, and was ripped apart in the tidal disruption event.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.310
Its mass fell in towards the black hole forming an accretion disk.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:22.020
With the addition of this stellar debris, the white dwarf was cloaked in glowing matter,

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:28.680
creating an x-ray hotspot orbiting the black hole, and its period would directly relate to the spin of the black hole.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:36.020
In this case, the measured spin parameter turned out to be at least 0.7 and possibly as high as the theoretical maximum of 0.998,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.880
meaning objects in the accretion disk were going at least half the speed of light.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:45.020
This is the first measurement of spin made possible by a tidal disruption event.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.480
The implication is that this could provide a method for determining the spin of black holes.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.020
Particularly ones that have been dormant, which is about 95% of supermassive black holes.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.450
If they shred a star, we get insight into their spin.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:04.910
Now why is this important? Well, because it helps us understand the origins of black holes.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:11.710
If supermassive black holes grow in size mainly by feeding on a steady stream of matter from within their own galaxy,

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:17.600
You'd expect their spins to be very large, because the angular momentum of that matter would be more or less aligned.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.600
so it would add up over time.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.970
But if instead, supermassive black holes grow predominantly by merging with other black holes,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:31.710
You might expect their spins to be lower, because the spins of two black holes are likely to be randomly oriented rather than aligned.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.420
As we are able to measure the spins of more black holes in different ways, farther out and therefore further back in time,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.000
We should be able to better understand their growth.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.820
And since supermassive black holes lie at the center of most galaxies,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:52.080
They also lie at the center of an understanding of how those galaxies have formed and evolved over billions of years.
