00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.660
What do I have to push, sub-basement?
&gt;&gt;Woman: Sub-basement.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.060
[Buzzing safety alarm]

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.960
I'm at the National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology
in Washington D.C.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.120
and I'm going to the sub-basement.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.220
It's getting dark down here.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.800
We're going to find out how they're going to
redefine a kilogram.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.980
The kilogram is in trouble.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.520
Since 1799, it's been defined as
the mass of a metal cylinder,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.760
in a locked vault
in a basement in Paris.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.000
But over the last century, careful measurements
of this international prototype kilogram

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.320
and in-theory-identical national standards
from around the world,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.840
have shown that their masses are diverging.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.900
The spread has grown to around
50 micrograms, or 50 parts per billion.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.200
And having a standard of mass that changes
is unacceptable.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.700
Plus, the kilogram is the last of the base SI units
to still be defined by a physical object.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.920
The metre, for example, used to be defined
as the length of a platinum bar in Paris,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.540
but in 1983 it was redefined
as the distance light travels

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.840
in 1/299,792,458 of a second.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.440
This definition means that the speed of light
is set to exactly 299,792,458

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.440
point 00000...

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.300
et cetera, metres per second.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.140
Note how this works:
first, you take the existing definition,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.020
say, the length of that metre bar,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.700
and you measure as carefully as you can
how it relates to a physical constant of the universe:

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.880
the speed of light.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.140
Then you set the exact value of that constant

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.640
and use *it* to redefine how long a metre is.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.280
I know this might seem circular,
but, importantly, it moves the point of truth

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.540
off of the physical object,
and onto the unchanging constant of the universe.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.100
So, naturally, the thought is
to do the same thing with the kilogram.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.960
But... using which constant, and how?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.060
[Heavy mechanical noises]

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.760
Well, there are a number of
different strategies that were attempted

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.280
but the two that achieved
the greatest success were:

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.300
1) using a silicon sphere to determine and set
Avogadro's number

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.340
and 2) to use a Watt balance
to determine and set Planck's constant.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.360
&gt;&gt;DEREK: Hi, how ya' doin'? I'm Derek.
&gt;&gt;JON: Pretty good.
&gt;&gt;DEREK: Nice to meet you.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.740
&gt;&gt;DEREK: Where is the Watt balance?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.300
&gt;&gt;STEPHAN: The Watt balance is
behind these closed doors, and...

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.340
&gt;&gt;DEREK: It's in there?

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.140
&gt;&gt;STEPHAN: It's correct,
and right now the problem is that...

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.480
We are in a crunch to get a number
by the end of May.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.640
&gt;&gt;DEREK: What's the number?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.940
&gt;&gt;STEPHAN: The Planck's constant.
This is what we measure with the Watt balance.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.940
In 2011,
the General Conference on Weights and Measures

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.280
decided that the kilogram should be redefined
based on Planck's constant,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.420
but that doesn't mean that
the Avogadro approach was futile.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.700
I mean, you can use Avogadro's number
to calculate Planck's constant and vice-versa.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.020
So, ultimately, both approaches
are going to be used to redefine

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.180
Planck's constant and
Avogadro's number simultaneously.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.480
&gt;&gt;STEPHAN: One good thing about
having silicon spheres,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.840
is that you only want to redefine if you have
agreement between different numbers, right?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.500
And the silicon sphere method is a method
in my mind that comes out of chemistry.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.040
You measure Avogadro's constant, which is
a constant that comes out of chemistry.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.560
This method comes out of physics,
we measure Planck's constant.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.480
So if they both agree, it's a pretty strong sign, right?
Because you know chemistry and physics agree.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.780
Now, since I've already discussed the
Avogadro approach in a previous video,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.080
here I want to focus on the Watt balance.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.760
It's actually now called a Kibble balance
in honor of its inventor, Bryan Kibble,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.860
who actually passed away in 2016.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.280
You know, traditional balances work by equating
the gravitational forces on objects in two pans.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.460
The Kibble balance looks kind of similar,
but all of the balancing happens on the left-hand side,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.780
where a mass pan is attached
to a coil of wire in a magnetic field.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.300
On the right-hand side is a motor.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.820
The whole apparatus is sealed
and operated in vacuum.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.120
The balance operates in two modes:

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.520
Weighing mode and velocity mode,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.800
and both are required
to determine Planck's constant.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.220
In weighing mode, a kilogram mass standard
is placed on the mass pan

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.980
and then current is passed
through the coil in the magnetic field

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.260
and adjusted until the weight of
the kilogram is equal and opposite

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.320
to the electromagnetic
force on the coil.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.500
The equation for this is
Mass times the local gravitational acceleration

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.960
is equal to the Magnetic field, times the length of wire in the coil, times the current flowing through it

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.040
In this equation the variables that are difficult to measure exactly are the magnetic field strength, and the length of wire in the coil

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.600
But luckily the Kibble balance allows us to get around this problem using velocity mode

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.500
In velocity mode the kilogram mass is lifted off the mass pan and now the motor on the other side of the balance is used to

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.240
Move the coil back and forth at constant velocity through the magnetic field.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.060
This motion induces a voltage in the coil which is equal to the magnetic field,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.080
times the length of wire in the coil, times its velocity.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.840
Now we have two equations which we can solve for B times L and so we can set them equal to each other and

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.980
eliminate these variables without having to know precisely what their values are

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.940
and if we rearrange a little bit you get voltage times current equals mass times gravity times velocity.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.900
on the left hand side, there is electrical power and on the right hand side, mechanical power,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.120
and that's why this was called the Watt, the unit of power, balance

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.600
But how do you go from this to Planck's constant the number that relates a photon's frequency to its energy?

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.760
Well it turns out there's actually a way of measuring voltage accurately using a macroscopic quantum effect that involves Josephson junctions

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.100
so a Josephson junction consists of two superconductors separated by a thin piece of insulator

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:34.720
Now if you apply a microwave radiation to that junction, you create a voltage across the device and its value is precisely known to be

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.360
hf over 2 e. Where h is Planck's constant, f is the frequency of the radiation, and e is the charge on an electron

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.860
Now by tuning that frequency and stacking as many of these Josephson junctions as you want in series

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.820
you can create virtually any voltage you like very very precisely.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.820
The way this is used in the Kibble balance is a stack of hundreds of thousands of Josephson junctions

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.600
are put into the circuit with the coil as it is moved through the field

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.060
and so you exactly balance the voltage which is induced in the coil using those Josephson junctions

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.920
So you can measure that voltage very very accurately.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.680
But how do we measure current?

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.240
Well it turns out this voltage measuring method is so good that instead of trying to measure current directly

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.860
we instead measure V on R which is the same thing

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.860
So this current is passed through a resistor, and we measure that voltage again using Josephson junctions

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.140
And then to measure resistance we use another macroscopic quantum effect called the quantum hall effect.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.480
Which is Beyond the scope of this video but,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.420
suffice is to say that the resistance measurement will be an integer fraction, one over p

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.000
times Planck's constant divided by the charge on the Electron squared

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.600
So if we sub all of this into our equation and solve for h, we have that Planck's constant is equal to four

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:55.480
over p n squared, those are all constant numbers that we know, times the local acceleration due to gravity times velocity

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.660
divided by frequency squared times the mass which is one kilogram.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:06.480
So here we have a very precise equation for Planck's constant in terms of the mass of one kilogram

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.280
Now to get an answer that's good to say, ten parts per billion

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.960
You need to know all of these values very accurately

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.680
So to measure V for example the velocity of the coil as it moves through the Magnetic field,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.780
we use a laser interferometer

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.160
as the distance to the coil changes the interference Fringes pass over a detector

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.080
And essentially by counting how many fringes go past in a certain period of time

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.900
you can determine the speed of the coil very accurately

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.040
To measure g, a device called a gravimeter was used

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.960
to map out the local acceleration due to gravity in the balance room before it was built in there

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.000
The gravimeter actually drops a corner reflector down a vacuum tube and measures its acceleration

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.600
again through interferometry, counting the fringes as they pass

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.400
This is a 3D printed map of the acceleration due to gravity in the Kibble balance room

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.220
The bump is due to the mass of the powerful and very heavy permanent magnet that's in the balance

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.820
The acceleration due to gravity must continually be measured because it can be affected at this level of precision

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.860
By the positions of the sun and moon and even the water table underneath the building

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.460
In 2018 the kilogram will no longer be defined by an object in Paris

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.220
Instead it will be defined based on the fixed value of Planck's constant

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:23.440
which is being finalized right now as a result of all these measurements from the Kibble balances and silicon spheres

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.820
So right now what we do is, we put the mass in, and we get h out

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.600
and in 2018, after redefinition, h will be fixed and you use that to realize the unit of mass

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.840
&gt;&gt;STEPHAN: Easy
&gt;&gt;DEREK: Yeah, just that-- just that easy.
&gt;&gt;STEPHAN: Yeah -

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.520
&gt;&gt;DEREK: Just that simple.
