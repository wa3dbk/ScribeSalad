00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.020
So this is like the world's most important freezer?

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.560
It is. Really. *laughs*

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.060
The most important room in the world, someone has said.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.040
These are pretty big claims for a place located

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.900
just 1300 km, or 800 miles

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.260
from the north pole.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.400
But then, this is no ordinary place.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.440
It's the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.800
Well, actually, this is just it's front door.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
Inside the seed vault are a series of tunnels.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.780
It's not actually that cold right here, but

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.900
as we go deeper, it is only going to get colder.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.580
This is Bente

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.620
You're an engineer, Bente?

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.120
Yes, I am

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.540
Are you gonna show us where to go?

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.220
*chuckles* Yeah

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.940
Fantastic

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.520
How many doors are there?

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.460
One, two, three, four, five doors

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.020
until we are into the secret room.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.940
Five doors to the secret room

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.900
Woah.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.920
That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.000
These are the lenghts of tunnel that take you down

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.120
into the seed vault.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.140
This facility was built to last around 200 years

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.880
and withstand earthquakes and explosions.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.820
It was placed on the side of a mountain

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.800
so even if all the ice on earth melts

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.740
it will still be above sea level.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.540
There are three separate vault rooms where seeds are stored

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.660
but only one of them is in use right now.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.440
And it's buried over 120 meters from the front door.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.000
The whole point of putting the vaults so deep in this mountain

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.560
is to put it within permafrost.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.180
So, all around me, the earth naturally stays

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.480
around -4 or -5 all year round.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.800
And, that way, if something did happen

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.400
and the cooling stopped flowing here, there was no power.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.200
Then, well, behind these doors

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.880
it would still remain probably, you know,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.120
-4 or -5 Celsius, forever.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.340
Assuming, of course, global temperatures don't rise that much.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.640
This place is sometimes called "The Doomsday Vault",

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.660
because even in a worst case scenario

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.820
it should preserve the diversity of the world's food crops.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.060
Now we are really in the mountain.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.900
Surrounded by permafrost.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.040
And, here's a cross tunnel

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280
that leads to three vault doors.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.440
Vault number 1 is up there

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.720
Vault number 2,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.080
and this is the one that is actually being used.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.860
And then, vault number 3.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.500
It's pretty amazing to look up and see

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.480
ice covered ceilings and walls everywhere.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.960
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault works essentially like a bank vault?

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.720
Yes, it's almost, yeah, because

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.140
the seeds lay in the boxes like this.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.860
These boxes are sealed when they come to Svalbard.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.000
And none of us can open it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.120
We put it through the security system at the airports

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.980
just to check that it isn't any explosives or anything in it.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.580
But it works like a bank box.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.100
We can't open this.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.360
Only the depositor can open and take out their seeds

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.100
So you don't open any of the seeds, any of the boxes that come here?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.680
No.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.640
Well. How do you know that people are really deposing the seeds,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.360
like barely they say they are not, and other things?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.640
Just because they have signed the contract. That's it.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.500
We can't be sure about it. Of course, we trust them.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.220
Would there be seeds for some crops that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.980
people might consider illicit, like marijuana

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.340
That is said that that shall not be in here.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.940
No drugs and also no gene-modified material

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.260
No genetically modified seeds go in here?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.200
Yeah, Norway has asked for that no genetical material is kept in here.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.160
Are there any particularity strange crops?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.140
Has anyone deposited anything that is really odd or weird?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.380
Ahhh.. No, nothing weird is in here,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.920
but we get some questions from people that wants to put in their own private seeds.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.220
I've also has had letters from men wanting to put their gene material in here.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.040
That is really strange and we don't answer those.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.680
This is the door to the vault and behind here, there are nearly a million different varieties of seeds,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.020
from all over the world,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.120
kept at minus 18 degrees Celsius.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.040
You know how I can tell that it's minus 18°C in here?

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.460
You can actually feel the moisture in your nose freeze so,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.560
Your nostrils get all stiff...

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.760
Yeah,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.920
And I see behind you we have some Canadian seeds,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.120
which is exciting for me because I am Canadian.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.940
So what sort of things do we have... From Canada,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.140
I'm really not... Not sure because... This box... On the outside doesn't tell what's in it,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.460
but,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.360
These numbers here are connected to a database on the internet so you can go in there afterwards.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.360
Derek: There you go.  Bente: Yeah

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.400
You can go find out what has Canada got stored in the Seed Vault.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.220
What are we looking at right here.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.800
It's like a bank vault except everything that you've put in there is publicly available.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.900
Yeah, it is. (chuckles)

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.060
These are the coolest boxes I think. They are from North Korea.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.340
Derek: Oh my goodness!                                                                         Bente: Wooden hand made boxes

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.460
Derek: They look like they come from the 1960s or something. Do you think?

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.960
Bente: Yeah, they do.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.960
Derek: They built them specially.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.600
Bente: They built them specially because they got the measurements of how big should the boxes be

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.800
and these are built exactly of those measurements.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.400
And here you see that North Korea is placed on the same shelf as USA, it's just on the back there.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.160
It's on the back side.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.020
And you have South Korea, just on the back.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.520
So here there are like in a small United Nations, deep in the mountains of Svalbard.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.520
(Chuckles)

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.600
So these are the last few bare shelves in Vault 2.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.040
Once the other two vaults are full, there will be around 3 million different species of plants stored here

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.620
with over 500 seeds per sample.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.960
So one day, there may be over a billion seeds stored inside this mountain,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.640
representing the vast majority of Earth's agricultural diversity.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.520
And you don't know today what kind of seeds that you can grow in 20, 30, 40 years from now,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.720
because of the climate change.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.840
Perhaps you have to use another type of seed

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.320
thirty years from now that can handle warmer climate, dryer climate, wetter climate,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.320
whatever is going to happen.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.020
So that is why it's so important to have a backup of all the seeds

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.160
so that you are sure that you can also grow the food we need,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.160
for the next generations to come.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.120
But this isn't the only seed bank on Earth.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.580
There are around 1700 other gene banks around the world,

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.560
run by different countries and organizations.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.420
And, at a cost of $9 million to build the Svalbard seed vault

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.700
and millions more to run it,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:05.880
it's worth asking whether this is a costly redundancy, or a valuable insurance policy.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.080
And perhaps, the best people to answer this question are the Syrians, who, last year, were the first

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.080
to make a withdrawal from the seed vault.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.920
The gene bank in Aleppo, in Syria, is now out of order, it's been bombed.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:25.220
So one third of the material that is kept in here is now taken down to Morocco and Lebanon.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.400
And this is some of the material that now has been returned, so to get the material going again.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.400
So that's why it's empty.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.820
Will those seeds actually be used to grow crops?

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.620
Yeah, they will. Yeah.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.880
Over the last 13 thousand years we have cultivated millions of species of plants.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.340
The agricultural revolution underpinned the technological and population explosions

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.860
that made our modern lives possible.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.100
The risk of a real Doomsday scenario is incredibly remote.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.340
But, whatever happens, thanks to this outpost at the top of the world

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.980
at least our seeds are safe.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.620
Hey, I'm currently on a train traveling from Washington, D.C. to New York City so I can't talk to loud.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:18.700
And actually after Norway, I went to Seoul, South Korea, Los Angeles, Boston , New York and Washington,

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.940
so it's been some crazy travels for me.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.980
And on all these travels I've been listening to audio books from Audible

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.300
who also support Veritasium which I am very thankful for.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.000
If you didn't know already, Audible has like 250,000 titles in all areas of literature,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.540
including fiction, non-fiction and periodicals.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.320
And if you go to Audible.com/veritasium you can get a 30 day free trial of the website

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.320
where you can just try out listening to a book.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.300
So if you are at all interested in listening to audio books, I highly recommend you check them out.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.120
And there is a book I can recommend to you, it is my favorite fiction book of all time.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.400
It's called "Everything is Illuminated" by Jonathon Safran Foer.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:00.280
It is-  I don't know, its just such a complex interwoven novel, you have to

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.160
read it or listen to it to know what i mean.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.120
But you can check it out. You can download that book for free for a one month trial

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.120
or you can pick any other book of your choosing.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.400
So, I really want to thank Audible for supporting me and helping me go to all these amazing places.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.660
And I want to thank you for watching.
