00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.460
Okay...

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.440
Hello. Hey.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.820
So, this is good, this is good. You - you're working, can you see me?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.540
I can see you.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.940
Do you know what went wrong in-uh.. during the launch..?

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.680
Yes - it's not complicated, but, it's a long chain of events..

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.660
On august, 21., 2014, two satellites were launched by the European Space Agency.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.000
They're called Galileo Satellites 5 and 6.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.560
They were intended to become part of the Global Navigation Satellite System, or GNSS.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.340
This is the European version of the American GPS systems.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.840
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.780
Now, after successfully blasting off into space,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.340
The satellites were launched with the Russian 5-6 rockets;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.440
The final stage of the rocket was set to inject the satellites into circular orbit around 23000 kilometers above the Earth.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.380
But that - - is when something went wrong

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.240
Uhh. there was thermal breach between a line of cold helium, and a line of propellant.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.820
So, the propellant, it froze;

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.720
This caused the failure of the altitude control thrusters.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.160
The satellites seemed to have been injected into some random direction.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.960
It was launched, but in the wrong direction.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.920
This sent the satellites into highly elliptical, and seemingly useless orbits.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.940
At their low point, the satellites didn't really get a full view of earth..

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.880
Earth sensors, which enabled them to orient their navigation antennas - stopped working,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.180
because the earth just filled their field of view.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.560
At the other extreme, the satellites went too high, experiencing significant radiation exposure

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.000
due to the van Allen belts.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.180
There was a threat, that they would just shut them off..

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.500
Okay, who do we have to talk to, to make sure they keep these satellites alive?

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.260
They had an idea, for how to use them to make the best tests of general relativity to date;

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.300
This was a strike of luck for us, we had been proposing such missions.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.580
When we saw that this accident happened, we were very happy about it, of course.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.200
Now, the satellites did have propellant on board,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.160
intended to allow for periodic course corrections over their planned 10 year lifespan.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.660
 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.700
And they could use that fuel to attempt to correct their orbits.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.260
So they used the propellant on board -

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.855
They did some of these maneuvers to bring them into stable orbit -

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.940
But they didn't have enough to completely turn their elliptical orbits into circular ones.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.840
They couldn't circularize completely, thankfully for our project.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.640
According to general relativity, relative to a reference clock, clocks tick slower in stronger gravitational fields.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.580
That is to say, closer to large masses, like the Earth, deeper in gravitational wells,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.080
 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.080
so, clocks in satellites should tick faster relative to those on Earth,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.920
because they're in weaker gravitational fields

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.420
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.660
Here, I'm ignoring the special relativistic effect that works the other way -

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.720
making clocks in satellites tick slower than those on Earth,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.940
because they're moving so much faster.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.060
This velocity effect is very well tested, so we focused on the gravitational parts.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.320
The gravitational effect is hard to measure precisely, for satellites in circular orbit,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.660
but satellites in elliptical orbit, have an advantage - -

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.820
In every orbit -

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.680
they go from their lowest position - perigee,

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:12.585
to the highest position - apogee, and back.

00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:15.325
If you want to test the gravitational red-shift of a clock, you need two things - -

00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:20.020
you need a very accurate clock, and you need a large change in gravitational potential.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.380
The satellite goes from 17000 to 26000 kilometers.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.440
The difference in altitude is almost 9000 (!!!) kilometers,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.580
meaning they are rapidly, and repeatedly going from lower gravitational potential,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.760
to higher gravitational potential, and back.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.600
So clocks on board, should be ticking slower when they're closer to the Earth,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.140
and then faster when they go to their high point,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.200
and they'll keep oscillating back and forth; slower and faster relative to clocks on Earth.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.980
 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.000
If you compare a clock on the ground, and a clock on the satellite,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.620
then you will have this variation of time..

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.560
Now, what's great about this, is it allows you to eliminate a lot of sources of error -

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.900
because, you don't really care about the absolute accuracy of the clocks;

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.980
All you want to know, is the difference between the rate of ticking

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.660
at the low point compared to the high point.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.000
And since it's the same clock making the measurements at both locations,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.100
you can eliminate a lot of errors, like the noise in the clock, or a systematic drift,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.680
and that's what allows the scientists to achieve such incredible precision.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.080
Why we could do it - is because it's a very predictable effect.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.960
Due to the eccentricity of the orbit - the signal we were looking for, is really the modulation.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.220
All the other effects - that are at other periods - they will not have an influence on your measurements.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.640
Now, I should point out, that if you were traveling with the satellite,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.500
for you - time would not speed up and slow down; time would be passing at a constant rate.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.380
You wouldn't be able to measure any change in the rate the clock is ticking.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:02.080
The relativity comes when you compare two clocks which are distant enough to feel the curvature of space and time.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.800
The clocks on the satellites - there are a couple of different types - are all atomic clocks.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.740
The primary clock typically is a passive hydrogen MASER clock.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.000
A MASER - is just like a laser, except it uses microwaves.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.920
Atoms of hydrogen interact with one specific frequency of microwaves -

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.800
A photon of precisely this frequency, will flip the spin of an electron.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.460
 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.360
So by tuning the microwaves, so that they best interact with the hydrogen atoms,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.160
and then counting up exactly this number of cycles of that radiation,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.240
that's one second. You can keep track of time with incredible stability.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.500
In fact, over a 30 million years, a clock like this -

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.900
would not be out by more than a second.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.400
 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.860
Again, if you were traveling with the satellite, you would always observe the frequency of this radiation to be

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.920
the same. But, if you sent this radiation out - -

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.425
 

00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:57.125
to a distant observer -

00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:59.460
who is not in a strong gravitational field,

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.540
they would observe the frequency of your microwaves to be slightly lower than those from their hydrogen maser.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.720
In other words - red-shifted.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.360
And the closer the satellite is to Earth, the more red-shifted the microwaves would appear.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.820
And hence the slower time would pass, relative to that distant  observer.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.280
Locally, you can not see any relativistic effect

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.780
This is called the equivalence principle.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.540
It's only when you compare the satellite clock to one on Earth,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.880
that you would find the yo-yo-ing rate of the satellite's clock due to it's oscillation back and forth

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.800
in Earth's gravitational well.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.900
This gravitational redshift was previously measured most precisely in 1976.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.520
That's right, for over 40 years, we haven't improved our measurement of the gravitational effect on time.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.800
In 1976, Gravity Probe A was launched aboard a sub-orbital rocket -

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.020
it went up in a parabolic trajectory, reaching a maximum altitude of 10000 kilometers,

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.500
and then it came down

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.600
That gives you quite a lot of modulation

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.800
and gravitational potential.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.280
The whole time it was in contact with the Earth, through the microwave signal of the on-board hydrogen maser.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.140
And then they did a direct frequency comparison, so they really did a two-way microwave link.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.980
This allowed for a direct comparison of the rate of which a clock would tick on a rocket,

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.920
relative to a clock on Earth.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.120
The results matched the predictions of general relativity down to a 140 parts per million.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.580
The scientists I'm talking to were eventually able to convince those in charge of the satellites,

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.820
to let them use their misfortune to test the gravitational redshift predictions of general relativity.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:41.640
But actually carrying out the tests, wasn't easy; one of the biggest sources of error was the positions of the satellites.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.560
You'd think, in the emptiness of space, the satellites would perfectly

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.760
maintain their orbits.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.100
But that neglects the power of sunlight.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:57.840
The photons of the sun, bouncing on the satellites, is the biggest source of error.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.660
That's right, the momentum of photons hitting the satellites was enough to significantly impact

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:08.280
the measurements. Careful modeling plus laser ranging to the satellites, brought the orbital uncertainties

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.420
down to an acceptable level.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.800
One way to improve the statistics was by collecting data over more than a thousand days.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.655
That's almost 3 years

00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:19.355
Unlike Gravity Probe A, which spent only

00:08:19.355 --> 00:08:20.395
2 hours in space

00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:21.535
So .. what did they find?

00:08:24.465 --> 00:08:27.585
I think that we both agree that we did not prove Relativity

00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:31.065
There isn't that we confirm the General Relativity

00:08:31.185 --> 00:08:32.305
Unfortunately

00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:36.615
They were able to reduce the uncertainty in the measurement

00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:38.115
by a factor of 5

00:08:38.735 --> 00:08:41.865
over Gravity Probe A
So it's a new high score

00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:44.915
the first in over 40 years

00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:47.585
But what is the point?
You saying 'unfortunately'

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:49.125
Yeah

00:08:49.655 --> 00:08:52.395
You know what we're looking for, is deviation from

00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:55.405
General Relativity. Because we know

00:08:55.405 --> 00:08:58.105
this is not the ultimate error.

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:01.155
History has taught us that, new physics always lies at the boundaries.

00:09:01.155 --> 00:09:04.175
that more and more precise tests sometimes

00:09:04.175 --> 00:09:07.285
reveal brand new aspects of nature, that we never would've observed

00:09:07.565 --> 00:09:10.485
if we had not made efforts to look

00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:13.935
and there are good reasons to believe that General Relativity may not be the whole story

00:09:13.935 --> 00:09:16.955
Both it and Quantum Mechanics are spectacularly

00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:19.795
successful theories in their own rights

00:09:19.795 --> 00:09:22.885
But for nearly a century, all attempts to merge the two

00:09:22.885 --> 00:09:25.845
have been more or less failures. Plus

00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:26.845
our current

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:30.015
world view includes dark energy and dark matter which make up more than 90% of

00:09:30.015 --> 00:09:33.045
everything there is in the universe.
The fact that this is all down

00:09:33.045 --> 00:09:35.975
is not understood, tells me that maybe, we don't know

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:39.005
everything about gravity already.
When more tests are planned

00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:42.035
to further prove the General Relativity and determine if there's a test it can pass

00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:46.025
a cold cesium atom clock is set to fly in the international

00:09:46.025 --> 00:09:48.955
space station and it aims to reduce the deviation

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:51.785
by a further factor of 10.
As for the satellites,

00:09:51.785 --> 00:09:54.685
their orbits were made more circular using the propellants on board

00:09:54.685 --> 00:09:57.575
though they are still elliptical.
The navigation signals have

00:09:57.575 --> 00:10:00.615
been tested and are within acceptable parameters.

00:10:00.615 --> 00:10:03.365
For the moment, they are restricted to 'test mode'

00:10:03.365 --> 00:10:06.495
awaiting some new software and modifications on the ground, but

00:10:06.495 --> 00:10:09.505
the hope is that they will be useful for navigation after all

00:10:09.505 --> 00:10:12.345
and in the meantime, they hold the record for achieving

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:15.705
the best test yet of General Relativity

00:10:16.055 --> 00:10:17.345
 

00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:21.595

Now

00:10:35.345 --> 00:10:38.385
the book, I wanna recommend to you today is called

00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:41.435
'Atomic Habits' by James Clear.
We are

00:10:41.435 --> 00:10:44.425
approaching that time of year when everyone makes new year's resolutions

00:10:44.425 --> 00:10:47.055
and wants to change some big things

00:10:47.055 --> 00:10:50.515
about their lives. But what this books recommends, is actually making

00:10:50.515 --> 00:10:53.075
tiny changes consistently is

00:10:53.075 --> 00:10:56.095
the best way to achieve the long term changes that you

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.080
wanna see in your life and I have found this book already, just a few chapters in

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.920
