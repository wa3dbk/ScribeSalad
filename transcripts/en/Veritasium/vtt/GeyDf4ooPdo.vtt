00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.190
I am here at the University of Sydney where
the mechanical engineering shop has built

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.570
this incredible piece of apparatus for me.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.160
It is a forty pound, that is nineteen kilogram
flywheel on the end of a meter long shaft.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.720
Can you imagine trying to hold this out horizontally
with just one hand at this end?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.369
It is virtually... it is impossible, ok?

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.380
No I'm going to let go.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.310
You going to be able to hold this at all?

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.740
I hope so.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.171
Can you lift it out?

00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:31.590
Make it horizontal - hold it, hold it, hold
it.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.590
Come on.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.880
Just try to - I want you to hold it out horizontal.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.880
See if you can.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.880
Hold it, hold it!

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880
Ahh, come on!

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.880
No.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.230
What I'm going to do is I am going to spin
this up to a few thousand RPM and then I'm

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.190
going to attempt just that, to hold it from
one end and have it out horizontally.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.990
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.550
Boom.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.550
I'm going to let go with my left hand.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.630
What you'll see is that the shaft remains
horizontal, see it going around there.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.200
It almost looks as though the wheel is weightless.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.459
How does this work?

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.140
Well instead of pulling the wheel down to
the ground as you'd expect, the weight of

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.659
the wheel creates a torque which pushes it
around in a circle.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.479
You may recognise this as gyroscopic precession.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.049
For a more detailed explanation, click the
annotation, or the link in the description

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.540
to see my video on the topic.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.049
Here I want to try something more extreme.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.549
I'm going to try to lift it over my head with
one hand while it's spinning.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:38.549
Wish me luck.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.549
But before I make the attempt, Rod wisely
suggests that I first check if I can lift

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.389
the wheel above my head without it spinning.

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:48.400
OK, let's prove that I could lift it, just
this end, without it spinning.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.829
Here we go.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.700
agggh
I mean it's just kind of awkward with the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.770
hand.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.850
Careful!

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.090
Ah, che
Careful!

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.249
Ha
Oooohhh

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.409
Just barely.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.859
Oh goodness, do you even lift?

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:08.859
Clearly I do not.

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:13.450
Undaunted by my lack of strength, I'm going
for it, but I want to make sure the wheel

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.590
is spinning as fast as possible to give me
the best chance of success.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.219
Give it ten more seconds.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:25.489
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.489
Pull!

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.489
Go.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.489
That was perfect.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.100
Now I'm going to release my left hand and
holding only with my right hand at the end

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.980
of the shaft, I'll try to lift it up over
my head.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.469
This is a forty pound, nineteen kilogram flywheel.

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.629
Ready?

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:50.580
Here we go: three, two, one.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.739
Beautiful!

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:59.840
Let's go again in three, two, one.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.000
Nice!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.159
Smooth.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.640
Three, two, one.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:34.239
It feels incredibly, incredibly light as I
do that.

00:03:34.239 --> 00:04:02.029
When you said it felt incredibly light,
yeah

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:04.269
you mean when you're lifting it feels light?

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.269
Yeah.

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.529
It shouldn't!

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:09.529
I know.

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:11.510
Hahahaha
Honestly, I have lifted it up with one hand

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.609
when it's not spinning.

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.609
Yeah.

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.049
And it feels really hard to lift it up, like
it's a big effort.

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.049
Yeah.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.930
But with this, when it's spinning it honestly
felt like it was just...

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.580
wanting to go up by itself.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.580
Yes.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.680
It felt like I was not struggling like I was
not putting in the amount of force that you'd

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.449
think to lift that kind of weight.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.350
I bet if you let it go, it'd crash down to
the ground.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.389
It's not weightless!

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.520
We can't do that though.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.020
We can't do that part of the experiment.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.520
What we could maybe do is I could stand on
a scale and we could see what the weight of

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.270
me plus that apparatus does, while I'm lifting
it up over my head, see if I get lighter in

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.270
essence.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.500
You can see that just my weight is about 72
kilograms.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.970
Now when I pick up the flywheel it goes up
to about 91 kilograms, which makes sense because

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.610
the flywheel itself is about 19 kilos, that's
about 42 pounds.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.280
Now we're going to spin it up and I want you
to make a prediction.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.229
As I'm lifting it over my head, do you think
the scale reading will be more, less than,

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.420
or equal to 91 kilograms.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.370
What do you think?

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.180
You can make your prediction by clicking on
one of the on-screen annotations or if you're

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.050
on mobile you can click a link in the description.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:30.039
Five, four, three, two, one.
