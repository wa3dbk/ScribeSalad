00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.890
What are evolutionarily stable strategies?

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.540
&gt;&gt; In many cases it is kind of clear what
is the best thing for an individual to do,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.759
the best thing it can do to increase its survival
with deduction.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.050
But there are times when what is the best
thing to do depends on what other individuals

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.060
in the population are doing, what, in particular,
the majority of individuals in the population

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.060
are doing.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.660
A hypothetical example we could call fishers
and pirates.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.580
And I am talking now about some kind of birds
where there are two ways of getting fish.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.580
These are sea birds.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.540
Either you can fish for fish.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.500
You either dive in a sea of catfish or you
hang about waiting for a bird that has caught

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.820
a fish and steal it.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.739
Those are pirates.

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.489
And these are two ways of making a living.

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.300
Now what is the best thing to be?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.570
A fisher or a pirate?

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.032
And the answer is that it is not obvious,
because it depends on what the rest of the

00:00:55.032 --> 00:00:57.699
population are doing.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.769
If the whole population is fishing then it
could very well be that an individual could

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.479
mutate and become a pirate, because there
are plenty of fishing going on.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.060
And it is easy to steal a fish.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.990
So then you might say: Well, natural selection
then favors piracy, the gene for being a pirate

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.060
spreads through the population.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.600
In a few generations now everybody is a pirate.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.000
And there is no fish.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.189
So piracy is not stable.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.200
It is an unstable... it is evolutionary unstable.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.630
Fishing might also be unstable, because if
the whole population is fishing then a mutant

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.950
pirate invades, so a stable strategy is a
strategy such that when all the population

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.080
is doing it no mutant individual could arise
which would do better.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.260
So neither fisher nor pirate in my hypothetical
sort of game is evolutionarily stable.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.060
What might be evolutionarily stable is some
kind of ratio.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.580
It might be 80 percent fishers and 20 percent
pirates, something of that sort.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.050
And the definition of stability in this case
is when they are doing equally well.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.350
A well known example is the sex ratio where
any departure from the stable sex ratio is

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.630
penalized by natural selection.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.570
If there are too many males an individual
is better off having daughters.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.330
And if there are too many females in a population
an individual is better off having sons.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.320
And so the stable ratio is 50-50, or, strictly
speaking, it is 50 percent investment, economic

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.020
investment in sons and economic investment
in daughters.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.130
So an evolutionarily stable strategy is a
strategy which cannot be bettered by any other

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.940
strategy provided that everybody else in the
population is doing it.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.090
&gt;&gt; You know, two years ago when this channel
reached half a million subscribers, you guys

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.520
asked me who would I like to meet.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.890
And I answered: Bill Nye, Neil DeGrasse Tyson,
Richard Dawkins.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.520
And since then, Bill Nye has taught me how
to tie a bow tie.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.470
I got to interview Richard Dawkins and on
August 22nd and 23rd I will be hosting Neil

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.200
DeGrasse Tyson in Sydney and Canberra.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.820
Link in the description.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.570
And I really want to thank you guys, because
I think it is your support that has made this

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.570
all happen.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.050
You know, this video was animated by the Lyosax
who is a viewer, but also runs his own channel.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.750
So you should check it out if you like those
animations.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.010
Plus, Audible.com has been the long term sponsor
of this channel and what I love is that they

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.140
are sharing information just like I like to.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.220
You know, this week it makes sense to share
a Richard Dawkins book.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.610
My favorite is The Selfish Gene, because it
is not about a gene for selfishness.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.010
It is about how genes themselves behave in
selfish ways.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.930
And sometimes that means the organism that
contains those genes behaves in strange ways,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.590
ways you might not imagine.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.970
And that was a real consciousness raiser for
me.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.390
So you should definitely check out this book
if you haven’t read it already.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.590
You can actually download it for free, read
by Richard Dawkins, by going to Audible.com/Veritasium.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.130
Or you can pick any other book of your choosing
for a one month free trial.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.250
Audible is an awesome audio book website with
over hundreds of thousands of titles in all

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.510
areas of literature including fiction, no
fiction and periodicals.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.870
So really you should check them out if you
are at all into audio books.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.970
Most of all I want to say thank you to you
for making it possible for me to meet my idols.
