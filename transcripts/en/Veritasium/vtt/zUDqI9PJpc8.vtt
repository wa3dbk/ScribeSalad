00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.230
Have you ever noticed that people speaking
Spanish sound like they're talking really

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.690
fast?
Does this mean they are able to communicate

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.570
information faster than English speakers?
One reason why Spanish sounds so fast is because

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.279
more syllables are spoken per minute than
in English. However analysis has shown that

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.999
each Spanish syllable contains less information
than each English syllable so the information

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.020
per minute is almost identical.
But what about written language? The square

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.510
format of Chinese characters appears to fit
better into our central visual field than

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.600
the longer, slimmer words of English. This
led linguists to suspect that Chinese would

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.500
be read faster than English. But experiments
show that English readers can perceive seven

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.350
to eight letters at once, compared to just
2.6 characters for Chinese. However those

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.410
Chinese characters are denser in meaning than
the English letters and so both languages

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.670
have basically an identical reading rate of
380 words equivalent per minute.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.970
This suggests that what limits the speed of
our communication is not language but our

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.910
cognitive ability to process information.
But how can you really quantify information?

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.130
Well the smallest amount of information you
can have is the answer to a yes/no question,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.920
like have you seen the movie Frozen?
Yes or no, heads or tails, we can represent

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:32.240
this single outcomes with a one or a zero.
One binary digit - it's one bit of information.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.070
A roll of the dice has six possible outcomes
so three bits of information are required

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.490
to cover all the options.
To uniquely represent all 26 letters of the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.000
English alphabet requires five bits of information.
But if you include lower case, punctuations,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.110
specially characters and number, that takes
the total number of symbols to 95. So you

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.140
actually need seven bits of information to
encode all these symbols.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.530
That was first done in 1963 as the American
Standard Code for Information Interchange,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.580
or ASCII for short.
Now as the next closes power of two, computers

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.840
adopted eight bits as the fundamental unit
of computation, and they called it the bite,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.590
where they intentionally replaced the i with
a y so that it couldn't accidentally be confused

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.520
with a bit.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.400
So how much information does it take to make
you? Well your entire genetic code is contained

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.819
in the sequence of four molecules, represented
by the letters T, A, G, and C in your DNA.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.099
Each of these four options can be encoded
by two bits of information. And multiplying

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.069
by the six billion letters of genetic code
in your genome, and dividing by eight bits

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.170
per byte, that yields 1.5 GB of information.
So you could fit your entire genetic code

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.551
on a single DVD with room to spare. Now your
body has an estimated 40 trillion cells in

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:55.170
it and each one contains a full copy of your
DNA. So you actually contain sixty zettabytes

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.440
of information. That's sixty followed by 21
zeroes.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.140
Just to put this in perspective, by the year
2020, all of the digital information in the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.819
world is estimated to be equal to forty zettabytes
of information. You could store all of that

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.280
on 100 grams of DNA. That is less than you
have inside your body.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.840
But now consider this, you share 99.9% of
your genetic information with everyone else

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.659
on Earth, meaning that less than one part
in a thousand is unique. So the information

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.319
that makes you you could be stored in less
than a megabyte. You could put it on one of

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.989
these, a floppy disk, in case you don't know
what that is.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.499
In contrast video can contain a lot of information.
To specify the colour of each of two million

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:48.590
pixels thirty times a second for this entire
video would require 100 gigabytes of information.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.069
But you can watch this video in HD on Youtube
with just a thousandth that amount. Now the

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.530
reason you can send such a big video with
such a small file size is because video, like

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.739
Spanish, has a lot of parts that are redundant.
Hey Michael, you know what I've been thinking

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.889
about.
What have you been thinking about Derek?

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.390
Information.
Go on.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.439
It's a physical thing. It's embodied in actual
objects.

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.110
How's that?
Well you know like the words we say, they

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.600
are actual vibrations in the air, right? They're
not just concepts. They are real physical

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.310
things that you could measure and detect.
That's true and they don't go away, they don't

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.090
disappear even after they've, for instance,
moved through the air.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.560
Right. After we've said these words, they
have actually interacted with everything around

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.840
us.
So you're saying that technically, I could

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.660
look at the world and if I knew enough about
it and the position of its particles, I could

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.290
trace back and extrapolate all the information
that's ever occurred through them or at them?

00:04:51.290 --> 00:05:02.590
That's right. You could in principle figure
out exactly what we've said here, today.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.280
Woah.
This episode of Veritasium was inspired by

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.300
already read The Information you may want
to check out Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.400
by Richard Feynman. It's my favourite book
by a scientist. It is absolutely hilarious
