"How do children aspire to
careers they don't know exist?"

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.484 align:start position:0%

We're not trying to push
kids into STEM fields.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:37.483 align:start size:84% position:16%
We do believe that STEM
capability will be critical

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:41.787 align:start size:94% position:6%

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:59.339 align:start position:0%
I like to synchronize the class
before we get started.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:04.276
How we do that is we get in
one circle and hold hands.

<i>(Naderi)
We use this giant battery,</i>

<i>and I explain a circuit only
works as a complete circuit,</i>

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.654 size:84% position:42%
<i>so they have to hold hands.</i>

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:17.957 align:start position:0%
<i>They see immediately
what a complete circuit does</i>

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:21.794 align:start position:0%
<i>and how, if you let go,
it'll stop working.</i>

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:24.196 align:start position:0%
<i>That's just how
the circuit works.</i>

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.364 align:start position:0%
Disconnect.

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
Oh, it is not conductive
through cloth.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.537 align:start position:0%
But it's only because
there's not enough voltage.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:35.941 align:start position:0%
If the voltage was higher,
it may be going through cloth.

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:40.479 size:88% position:44%
The longer one is positive.
The shorter one is negative.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.849 size:78% position:39%
<i>From there, we have them
building a basic circuit,</i>

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.285 size:84% position:42%
<i>which is an LED turning on.</i>

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:47.920 size:81% position:41%
<i>It's actually really cool.</i>

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.189 align:start position:0%
<i>Never underestimate
an LED turning on,</i>

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.692 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>how exciting that is

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.692 align:start size:31% position:69% line:21%
<i> I did it!</i>

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:57.029 align:start position:0%
Engineers will come in
'cause they're curious,

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:58.530 align:start position:0%
<i>so we introduce them.</i>

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.233 align:start position:0%
<i>This engineer works

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.102 size:88% position:44%
<i>that's in the latest phones,</i>

<i>or who created
the 4K technology.</i>

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:09.308 align:start position:0%
<i>So really bringing
that kind of abstract idea</i>

<i>I like this part of the day</i>

00:05:46.144 --> 00:05:51.950 align:start position:0%
<i>because we not only expose them
to engineering and coding,</i>

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.752 align:start position:0%
<i>but also challenge them</i>

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:56.021 align:start position:0%
<i>with something

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:59.658 align:start position:0%
That's it.
That is all my code.

00:05:59.658 --> 00:06:03.696 align:start position:0% line:0%
They've learned basics of
the Arduino and the breadboard

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.464 align:start position:0%
<i>and how to code.</i>

00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:09.635 size:78% position:39%
<i>The idea of what was code
was very foreign to them</i>

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.570 align:start position:0%

<i>You're telling

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.676 align:start position:0%
<i>and then coding it
into this Arduino</i>

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:19.478 align:start position:0%
<i>and actually
seeing an LED blink</i>

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:22.347 align:start position:0%

<i>(Naderi)

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:38.297 align:start position:0%
that it's not as hard
as they thought,

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:43.569
and that it was a lot more fun
than they thought it would be.

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:46.906 size:84% position:42%
I get the "I-thought-this-
would-be-boring" impression

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:51.410 align:start position:0%
and can't tell you how many
times I've heard kids tell me,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.046 align:start position:0%
"This was more fun
than I thought."

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:58.917
One girl whispered, "I thought I

This is fun."

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.890 align:start position:0%
I was like, "I don't know why
you're whispering, but awesome!"

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.859 size:81% position:59%
So this one is
a regular servo.

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:10.696 align:start position:0%
<i>From there,
we go into servos immediately</i>

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:15.567 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> and try to get both the servos
 to work a full rotation.</i>

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:18.937
The full rotation goes around.
Regular ones go back and forth.

00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:22.642 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> And so then after
 that exercise, it's free game.</i>

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:26.979 align:start position:0%
<i>They choose one servo
and go to the craft store</i>

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.882 align:start position:0%

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.852 align:start position:0%

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:30.242 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> or would be creating
 a robotic craft.</i>

00:08:30.242 --> 00:08:32.411 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> When they exit the lab,</i>

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:36.215 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> they are almost more energized
 than when they came in.</i>

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:40.753
Kids that walk in like this...

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:42.755 align:start position:0%
"Yeah, I can do that."

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:45.524 align:start position:0%
And they leave like...

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:50.162 align:start position:0%
It's like this ginormous smile,
like they are just lit up.

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:55.233
<i> I think this space can provide
 proof to our peers in society</i>

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:58.270 size:75% position:38%
<i>that you can ease people</i>

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.540 align:start position:0%
<i>into traditionally difficult
subject matters.</i>

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.309 align:start position:0%
<i>And not only is it fun,</i>

00:09:04.309 --> 00:09:05.811 align:start position:0%
<i>the kids like it,</i>

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:08.781 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> the adults putting it together
 like it,</i>

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:12.651 align:start position:0%
<i>and it really is
a win-win-win situation.</i>

00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:16.422
Many schools have said, "Since
coming to the Thinkabit Lab,

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:19.057 align:start size:69% position:31%
we're motivated
to create our own lab.

00:09:19.057 --> 00:09:20.559 align:start size:56% position:44%
That was our hope,

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.996 align:start size:88% position:13%
that schools would be
interested to create a space

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:26.699 align:start size:75% position:25%
dedicated to engineering
and science and coding,

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.968 align:start size:69% position:31%
so students could have
regular accessibility.

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:30.502 size:88% position:56%
Schools like Monarch School,

00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:33.739 align:start size:66% position:34%
e3 Charter,
Feaster Team Charter,

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:36.508 align:start size:66% position:34%
those schools
are making inroads

00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:39.178 align:start size:59% position:41%
to create their own
maker spaces.

00:09:40.979 --> 00:09:44.483 align:start size:91% position:9% line:0%
<i> (Motsinger)
 What we're doing at Feaster
 is exciting,</i>

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:47.086 line:0%
<i>it's innovating, it's engaging,</i>

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:51.223 size:88% position:44% line:0%
and it's exposing our kids
to a variety of opportunity.

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:54.960 size:84% position:58%
They wanted to get involved
right from the beginning.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.396 align:start size:66% position:34%
Their superintendent,
their principal,

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:59.398 align:start size:63% position:38%
their staff
have been phenomenal

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:02.767 align:start size:91% position:9%
because they've been open
to listening to our thoughts,

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:05.770 align:start size:72% position:28%
as we've been open
to listening to theirs.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.573
It's a perfect collaboration.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:10.943 align:start position:0%
As we've grown,
we have helped each other both.

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:15.347 align:start position:0%
They came here and helped us
develop our own engineering lab.

00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:19.685 size:84% position:42%
<i>We are so fortunate to send
some students to Qualcomm,</i>

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:21.953 size:84% position:42%
<i>but we have 1,200 students,</i>

00:10:21.953 --> 00:10:24.923 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> and our kindergartners,
 first-graders, second-graders,</i>

00:10:24.923 --> 00:10:28.293 align:start position:0%
<i>all of our kids wanted
to have that experience.</i>

00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:32.431
A lot of what I've been working
with is constructive struggle.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.666 align:start size:63% position:38%
<i> They have problems.</i>

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:36.568 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> Things don't work out
 as planned,</i>

00:10:36.568 --> 00:10:39.972 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> and so it's how do we
 figure this out</i>

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:45.444 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> and trying let them think
 and work through it.</i>

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:49.548 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> (girl)
 It gave me a way
 to see things differently</i>

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:54.653 align:start position:0% line:0%
and to work in hard situations
where you have to show grit

00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:58.857 align:start position:0%
and have another way
to look at things,

00:10:58.857 --> 00:11:02.294 align:start position:0%
instead of being,
"I'm done. I can't do that."

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:05.297 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
I want them to
take away the process.

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:09.301 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%
It isn't one thing or
one project or one idea.

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:13.071 size:88% position:56%
<i> It's more about the process
 that they go about thinking</i>

00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:16.841
<i> because it translates so well
 from what they're doing here</i>

00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:19.378 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> into real-world,
 real-life situations.</i>

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:22.981 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> (girl)
 When you're stuck and see
 somebody building something,</i>

00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:26.352 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
you can take that
and put it into yours,

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.621 align:start size:56% position:44% line:0%
then take part
of something else,

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:31.223 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> and it would
 significantly help you</i>

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:34.926 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> because it just builds
 your creativity off of them.</i>

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:40.566 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> (Motsinger)
 I walk in, and eyes don't turn
 to see who came in the door.</i>

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.467 align:start position:0%
<i>They are focused,
they're engaged,</i>

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:45.103 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> they're talking to each other,
 they're communicating,</i>

00:11:45.103 --> 00:11:46.572 align:start position:0%
<i>they're collaborating.</i>

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:51.610 align:start position:0%
<i>Three years ago, if I asked
a child what they wanted to be,</i>

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
you'd hear "football player"
or "basketball player,"

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.615 align:start position:0%
"a dancer."

00:11:56.615 --> 00:12:00.452 size:84% position:42%
Things that they relate to
and see in their community.

00:12:00.452 --> 00:12:04.289 align:start position:0%
Now we hear kids saying
they want to be engineers,

00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:08.794
or they want to be scientists
or want to work in forensics.

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:11.797 align:start position:0%
This type of vocabulary
they didn't have before

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:13.699
nor this type of inspiration.

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:16.101 align:start position:0%
They didn't have
the knowledge before

00:12:16.101 --> 00:12:18.370 align:start position:0%
because they weren't
exposed to it.

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:23.142 align:start position:0%
<i>Success to me means
that we've inspired a child</i>

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
<i>who may not have known before
what they wanted to do.</i>

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:31.050 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>I feel successful
if a kid comes back excited</i>

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.420 size:78% position:39% line:0%
<i>and wanting to learn more
about a specific topic</i>

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.156
<i>or wanting to work on a project</i>

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
<i>that before they saw as
just a task or assignment.</i>

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:42.427 align:start position:0%
<i>When they're engaged,</i>

00:12:42.427 --> 00:12:44.730 align:start position:0%
<i>when they're excited
about something,</i>

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.032 align:start position:0%
