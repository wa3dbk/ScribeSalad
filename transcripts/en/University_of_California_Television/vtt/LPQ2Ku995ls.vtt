00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:53.119 align:start size:91% position:9%

 growing up in the Midwest,</i>

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.755 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> she never imagined
 her interest in computers</i>

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.124
<i> would take her to California.</i>

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.393 align:start size:59% position:41%
<i> (Beth)
 I went to a small,</i>

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:04.263 align:start size:72% position:28% line:0%
primarily undergraduate
institution in Ohio.

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.532 align:start size:53% position:47% line:0%
And really,
people from there

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:10.336
didn't tend to go to graduate
school in computer science.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:13.339 align:start size:72% position:28%
But my professors
took an interest in me,

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.241 align:start size:63% position:38%
and they recommended
I apply

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.543 align:start size:63% position:38%
for a summer program
for undergraduates

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:20.546 align:start size:63% position:38%
that would give them
the chance to see

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:23.716 align:start size:72% position:28%
what graduate school
was like, so I applied.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:27.220 align:start size:78% position:22%
I had no idea
where they would send me,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.688 align:start size:78% position:22%
and interestingly enough,

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:32.124 align:start size:84% position:16%
they selected me and
assigned me to Fran Berman,

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.393 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> a professor
 in the computer science</i>

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:36.095 size:88% position:56% line:0%
<i> and engineering department.</i>

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:39.298 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
<i> Fran always worked in
 high-performance computing.</i>

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:42.702 line:0%
<i> Later she became director
 of the Supercomputer Center.</i>

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:46.172 align:start size:94% position:6%
That was my first introduction
to California and UCSD.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.942 align:start size:81% position:19%
I always remember it
as a kid from the Midwest.

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:54.079 align:start size:81% position:19%
On the first day, I was in
graduate student housing--

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.949 align:start size:59% position:41%
these apartments
with window walls--

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.951 align:start size:69% position:31%
and I phoned my mother
and said,

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:02.789 align:start size:75% position:25%
"A guy walked by with
a surfboard on his head!

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.490 align:start size:59% position:41%
I'm in California!"

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.394 align:start size:81% position:19%
Once I came here,
it was too great to leave,

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:12.532 align:start size:94% position:6%
and that's what got me to
come here for graduate school.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:18.604 align:start position:0% line:0%
So I know that females today
only are awarded 18%

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:22.175 size:88% position:44% line:0%
of the Bachelor of Science
degrees in computer science.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.110 size:88% position:44%
That number has not changed.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
It's gone down a little
the last couple decades.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.815 size:84% position:42%
What was that like for you?

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:32.217 align:start size:66% position:34%
My father was
a computer scientist.

00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:34.086 align:start size:72% position:28%
When he got his degree,

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:37.457 align:start size:78% position:22%
you couldn't get a degree
in computer science yet.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:40.826 align:start size:88% position:13%
But he got a master's degree
in computer science.

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:43.829 align:start size:91% position:9%
He encouraged me
to play around with computers

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.831 align:start size:63% position:38%
and give this a try.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.834 align:start size:81% position:19%
As an undergrad,
I also majored in Spanish,

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.838 align:start size:88% position:13%
in case this computing thing
didn't work out.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:56.842
But it's something that's been
part of my life going forward.

00:02:56.842 --> 00:03:01.848 align:start size:78% position:22%
Even fewer women get PhDs
in computer science.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:05.851 align:start size:78% position:22%
You really are very aware
that you're in a room,

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:08.854 align:start size:66% position:34%
one of the only women
in the room.

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:12.858 align:start size:91% position:9%
I've taught classes
as the only woman in the room

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:14.860 align:start size:53% position:47%
as the professor.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.197 align:start position:0%
That makes you
an important role model today.

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:22.868 align:start position:0%
I also know that you have had
a passion for teaching,

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:25.572 size:88% position:44% line:78%
I think, your entire career.

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:25.572 align:start size:25% position:75%
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:29.875 size:78% position:39%
You also are very curious
about how students learn.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:32.277 align:start position:0%
You have a unique
teaching style.

00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:34.146 size:78% position:39%
You flip your classrooms,

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.782 align:start position:0%
you use a lot
of peer instruction,

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
so what does this mean
for your students?

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:44.890
Well, it really means that
they can have a very special,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.926 align:start size:63% position:38%
very personal
learning experience,

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.794 align:start size:81% position:19%
even in a large classroom.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:52.164 align:start size:75% position:25%
This is where my passion
for teaching came from.

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:54.466
I went to this
small university,

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:57.169
where class sizes
were capped at 20.

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.472 align:start size:63% position:38%
I'd always learned
in that environment.

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:02.608 align:start size:84% position:16%
Here I come
to graduate school at UCSD.

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:05.244 align:start size:66% position:34%
I sat in on some
undergraduate courses

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:08.914 align:start size:75% position:25%
with hundreds of people,
and I thought, "My gosh.

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:11.917 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is an awful experience
that they're having."

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:16.555 align:start position:0%
I also knew, because I had been
a graduate student at UCSD,

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:19.158 align:start size:59% position:41%
that most PhDs
in computer science

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:21.661 align:start size:81% position:19%
got no training whatsoever
in teaching--

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:23.930 align:start size:72% position:28%
not even
a T.A. training course.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.464 align:start size:78% position:22%
We've since changed that.

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:29.702 align:start size:84% position:16%
But it is common that PhDs,
in general,

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.938 align:start size:81% position:19%
would not really get much,
if any,

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:36.942 align:start position:0%
training whatsoever in both
the practicalities of teaching,

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start size:78% position:22%
let alone in the theories
of how people learn.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.784 size:84% position:58%
And so really it's one of
the most challenging things

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.219 align:start size:56% position:44%
because two things
come into play.

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.855 align:start size:66% position:34%
PhD's, or professors,
know what it's like

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:52.825 align:start size:59% position:41%
to be an expert
in a field.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:57.497 align:start size:72% position:28%
They know it takes time
and effort and practice

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:01.968 size:78% position:61%
and feedback to become
an expert in their field.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:06.238 align:start position:0%
They also know they're supposed
to be experts at teaching,

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:09.241 align:start size:75% position:25%
just because that's what
professors are and do,

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:12.645 align:start size:78% position:22%
but know they've had
none of those four things

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.647 align:start size:75% position:25%
in preparation to teach.

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:18.417
They feel uncomfortable because
they know the meaning of expert,

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:21.987 align:start position:0%
but they know this isn't
something they necessarily have.

00:05:21.987 --> 00:05:25.524 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> The other thing is,
 especially for scientists,</i>

00:05:25.524 --> 00:05:27.694 align:start size:81% position:19%
we're trained to use data,

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:31.998 align:start size:88% position:13%
to look at data and use that
to reflect and improve,

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.500 align:start size:88% position:13%
whether we're optimizing
compilers and architectures,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.503 align:start size:88% position:13%
as I did here
at the Supercomputer Center,

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.939 align:start size:72% position:28%
or whether you optimize
your teaching.

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.809 align:start size:75% position:25%
But there's
so little data available

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start size:56% position:44%
when you are
teaching students.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.616
How do you know how much they
learned from your lecture?

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:53.252 align:start size:63% position:38%
How do you know
if they're confused,

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start size:75% position:25%
especially in
really large classrooms?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.891 size:84% position:58%
It's a pretty brave student
that would raise their hand

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.492 align:start size:78% position:22%
and say they're confused.

00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:03.930 align:start position:0%
Then how do you
get feedback?

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.799 align:start size:56% position:44%
One way is through
this approach

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.568 align:start size:66% position:34%
that I use with
my flipped classroom.

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:12.271 align:start size:75% position:25%
I use an approach called
<i> peer instruction.</i>

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:15.674 align:start size:72% position:28%
The general view is
that students can learn

00:06:15.674 --> 00:06:19.044 align:start size:94% position:6%
the basic stuff people
lecture about in the classroom

00:06:19.044 --> 00:06:20.679 size:84% position:58%
on their own.

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:24.750 align:start size:78% position:22%
They can read a book
or watch a video lecture.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.554 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> But you really want to take
 advantage of the time</i>

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:31.290 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> that students are with you,
 the expert,</i>

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.994 size:84% position:58%
<i> to enable them to go deep
 and get feedback from you,</i>

00:06:35.994 --> 00:06:39.498 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> which also allows you
 to get feedback from them</i>

00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:42.201 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> about what they understand
 or don't understand.</i>

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:46.705 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> In a class that I teach
 for an hour and 20 minutes,</i>

00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:50.509
<i> students will spend about 45
 minutes talking to each other</i>

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.580 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> or talking to me
 at the front of the classroom.</i>

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.017 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> I'm not standing there
 talking most of the time.</i>

00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> This contributes to
 an incredible difference</i>

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:02.721
<i> in the classroom experience.</i>

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:05.724 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> Students know they're
 supposed to come to class</i>

00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:07.827 size:88% position:56%
<i> and engage with each other,</i>

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.096 align:start size:81% position:19%
<i> to talk
 and figure something out.</i>

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:14.099 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> And I do this by giving them
 challenging questions,</i>

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:16.101 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> which are
 multiple-choice questions.</i>

00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:20.106 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> They vote on them using
 this device called a</i> clicker.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:23.476 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> And the great thing
 about using this technology</i>

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:27.813 size:81% position:59%
<i> and asking people to try
 a question and vote on it</i>

00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:31.384 size:84% position:58%
<i> is that it causes people's
 brains to actively engage.</i>

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:35.587 size:88% position:56%
<i> They have to commit to some
 answer and think about it.</i>

00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:39.792 align:start position:0%
<i>I get, immediately in the
class, the results of that poll</i>

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:42.227
<i>and see how students are doing.</i>

00:07:42.227 --> 00:07:46.365
You might think it just sounds
awful in the inverted classroom.

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.368 align:start size:72% position:28%
"What? She's going
to quiz me every time?"

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:52.371 align:start size:72% position:28%
It's not the goal
to get questions right.

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.007 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> I hope they don't
 get them right</i>

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.875 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> because
 they should be hard.</i>

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:58.777 align:start size:59% position:41%
<i> After people
 answer a question,</i>

00:07:58.777 --> 00:08:03.482 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> I actually have them all
 talk to each other in groups.</i>

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:05.284 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> Students come to class</i>

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:08.654 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> and sit next to
 the same people every day.</i>

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:11.523 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> They will be talking
 with those students,</i>

00:08:11.523 --> 00:08:13.793 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> trying to figure out
 this stuff,</i>

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:16.796 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> then they will have
 the opportunity to learn</i>

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:20.166 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> and to meet other people
 as they're doing it.</i>

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:24.103 align:start position:0% line:0%
This is very different
than the "sage on the stage,"

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:27.105 align:start position:0% line:0%
the approach that most
professors make at universities.

00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:29.908 align:start position:0% line:0%
Is it rare
in computer science

00:08:29.908 --> 00:08:32.911 align:start position:0%
that other professors
use this method?

00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:34.513 align:start size:63% position:38%
Not so much anymore.

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:38.518 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%
When I started doing it,
I was the first person

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:41.520 align:start size:72% position:28% line:0%
in the computer science
department here at UCSD

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.021 align:start size:78% position:22%
to adopt peer instruction

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:46.758 align:start size:69% position:31%
and one of the first
in the nation as well,

00:08:46.758 --> 00:08:49.795 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> with the goal of trying
 to increase retention</i>

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.696 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> in our introductory
 programming courses.</i>

00:08:51.696 --> 00:08:54.566 align:start size:66% position:34%
This became something
that people noticed.

00:08:54.566 --> 00:08:56.869 size:84% position:58%
I wrote publications on it,

00:08:56.869 --> 00:09:00.072 align:start size:75% position:25%
and people saw
and came to my classroom

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:02.475 size:88% position:56%
and saw how engaging it was.

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:04.443 align:start size:81% position:19%
Honestly, for a professor,

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:09.148
it's more fun to work with them
in answering their questions,

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:13.118 align:start size:94% position:6%
rather than repeating the same
things you've said before.

00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:16.621 align:start size:81% position:19%
It wasn't hard to convince
faculty to do it.

00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:18.523 size:78% position:39%
I know that your teaching

00:09:18.523 --> 00:09:21.626 size:75% position:38%
and emphasis on teaching
this kind of learning,

00:09:21.626 --> 00:09:23.829
it goes outside the university.

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:27.867
You also have a passion for
helping high school students.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:31.236 size:78% position:39%
We're involved in a grant
with funding from NSF.

00:09:31.236 --> 00:09:35.373 align:start position:0%
We now are training high school
teachers in San Diego,

00:09:35.373 --> 00:09:39.044
in three districts: Sweetwater,
San Diego Unified, and Vista.

00:09:39.044 --> 00:09:42.848 size:88% position:44%
You've had a profound effect
on a teacher in particular,

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:46.652 align:start position:0%
Art Lopez, a high school teacher
at Sweetwater District.

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:50.556 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>Can you talk about him
and how he has embraced</i>

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:53.892 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>your computer science
principles class?</i>

00:09:53.892 --> 00:09:57.529 align:start size:66% position:34%
It's almost
impossible to explain

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:02.902
how much we at the university
need colleagues like Art Lopez.

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:06.271 align:start size:72% position:28%
We really can't make
the impact that we need

00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:10.842 align:start position:0%
without these dedicated teachers
in the local communities

00:10:10.842 --> 00:10:14.713
because they're on the ground
and what makes things work.

00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:18.584 align:start size:84% position:16%
I got to know Art
when I first developed

00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:22.221 align:start size:81% position:19%
one of the first five
national university pilots

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:24.490 align:start size:78% position:22%
of a new
advanced placement course

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.126 align:start size:72% position:28%
that we were developing
in computer science

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:28.293 align:start size:66% position:34%
called<i> CS Principles.</i>

00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:31.963 align:start size:69% position:31%
I knew that I had
to develop this course

00:10:31.963 --> 00:10:34.967 align:start size:81% position:19%
that would serve
a broad range of students,

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.636 align:start size:78% position:22%
students with varying
backgrounds in computing,

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:40.672 align:start size:88% position:13%
perhaps even computer-phobic
starting off.

00:10:40.672 --> 00:10:43.675 align:start size:72% position:28%
With that in mind,
I developed this course

00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:45.311
based around peer instruction

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:48.681 align:start size:91% position:9%
and getting students to think
about how computers work

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:51.317 align:start size:69% position:31%
and believe they
had control over them.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:56.521 align:start position:0%
We were able to recruit a group
of teachers in San Diego.

00:10:56.521 --> 00:10:59.525 align:start size:69% position:31%
Art Lopez was
one of the first ones.

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:02.594 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> Now, Art was a standout
 from the beginning.</i>

00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:04.863 align:start size:66% position:34%
<i> We had an eight-week
 training course.</i>

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:09.068 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> He found out that I was
 teaching Tuesday and Thursday</i>

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:12.070 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i> and said,
 "Can I come to your class?"</i>

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start size:56% position:44%
Almost every class
for that quarter,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.241 align:start size:75% position:25%
Art attended my lectures

00:11:16.241 --> 00:11:19.244 align:start size:78% position:22%
and sat there
and behaved as a student,

00:11:19.244 --> 00:11:21.547 align:start size:72% position:28%
experienced a classroom
as a student

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:24.182 align:start size:75% position:25%
and loved the engagement
that he saw,

00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:27.152 align:start size:88% position:13%
loved the concepts
that students were learning.

00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:30.055 size:84% position:58%
He took this back
to his classroom,

00:11:30.055 --> 00:11:34.192 align:start size:94% position:6%
and instead of doing what
most courses do in high school

00:11:34.192 --> 00:11:36.094 size:84% position:58%
and is considered the norm,

00:11:36.094 --> 00:11:38.363 align:start size:72% position:28%
where kids work
on their computers,

00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:41.333 align:start size:78% position:22%
and you stand behind them
and help,

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.736 align:start size:75% position:25%
he adopted this
flipped classroom model,

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:46.372 align:start size:63% position:38%
<i> where he would have
 the students do--</i>

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:49.175 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> We created an online textbook
 for students.</i>

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:51.610 align:start size:63% position:38%
<i> He worked with them
 through that</i>

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.879 align:start size:84% position:16%
<i> and ran these
 peer instruction questions</i>

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.747 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> with his students
 having clickers.</i>

00:11:55.747 --> 00:11:57.249 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> Now in his classroom,</i>

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:59.251 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> students aren't
 silently sitting there,</i>

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:01.387 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> staring at a computer,
 typing.</i>

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.221 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> They are talking.</i>

00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:05.157 align:start size:59% position:41%
<i> They're gathering
 around each other,</i>

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:06.725 align:start size:78% position:22%
<i> arguing about something.</i>

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:09.361 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> The thing
 will be on the screen,</i>

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:11.230 size:84% position:58%
<i> they'll be pointing at it,</i>

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.367 align:start size:94% position:6%
<i> and he will listen in and
 hears what people talk about.</i>

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:17.202
<i> Students learn that computing</i>

00:12:17.202 --> 00:12:20.272 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> isn't just about boring people
 staring at computers.</i>

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:22.540 size:88% position:56%
<i> You have to talk about code</i>

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.810 align:start size:72% position:28%
<i> because software
 is developed in teams.</i>

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.446 align:start size:59% position:41%
You need to be able
to communicate

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:29.314 align:start size:53% position:47%
and collaborate
with other people

00:12:29.314 --> 00:12:32.685 align:start size:78% position:22%
in order to be successful
in the computing field.

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:35.520 align:start position:0%

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.655 align:start position:0%

Art has a lot
of Latina students,

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:42.795 align:start size:97% position:3%
<i> so he's brought in female

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
<i>and majoring

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.070 size:75% position:38%
You and I were back East

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.439 align:start position:0%

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:01.180 line:0%
We should build

Computer Science For All,

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:34.980 align:start position:0% line:0%

this Computer Science For All

00:13:49.394 --> 00:13:53.499 size:88% position:56% line:0%
It's absolutely imperative

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:56.501 size:84% position:58% line:0%
It has the potential
to do amazing things.

00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:58.770 align:start size:72% position:28%
Just think about it
this way.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start size:69% position:31%
We know the three R's:

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:02.974 size:84% position:58%
reading, writing,
and arithmetic.

00:14:02.974 --> 00:14:05.277 align:start size:69% position:31%
These are critical

but to get to the fact
that we are going to need

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:46.578 size:88% position:56%
many, many more high school
teachers teaching computing,

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:49.447 align:start size:78% position:22%
I think online
has an opportunity there.

00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:53.284 align:start size:88% position:13%
So let's just set the stage.
People may be unaware.

00:15:53.284 --> 00:15:55.554 align:start size:72% position:28%
Think about
your local high school.

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:57.823 align:start size:69% position:31%
How many math teachers

00:15:57.823 --> 00:16:01.193 size:78% position:61%
Every student is taking

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:03.896 size:84% position:58%
You expect a lot
of math teachers.

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:06.965 align:start size:69% position:31%
Your local high school
may have zero teachers

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:09.234 align:start size:66% position:34%
who are trained
to teach computing.

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:11.870 align:start size:84% position:16%
Zero teachers. Forget
trained to teach computing.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.506 align:start size:84% position:16%
They may have zero teachers
teaching computing.

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:18.276 align:start position:0%
Here in the state of California,
up until very recently,

00:16:18.276 --> 00:16:21.646 align:start size:94% position:6%
if you took a computing class,
it actually counted--

00:16:21.646 --> 00:16:24.649 align:start size:75% position:25%
It didn't count toward
graduation requirements,

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:26.919 align:start size:66% position:34%
which means
it counts against it,

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:30.422 align:start size:81% position:19%
and their parents
wouldn't let them take it.

00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:35.794
But the thing is we're really
starting from ground zero,

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:38.430 align:start size:66% position:34%
and I don't know
of another discipline

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.968 align:start size:84% position:16%
where an advanced,
massive educational system,

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:45.971 align:start size:63% position:38%
like the K-12 system
in the U.S.,

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.973 align:start size:91% position:9%
is bringing something all-new
for the first time

00:16:48.973 --> 00:16:50.475 align:start size:72% position:28%
that would be required.

00:16:50.475 --> 00:16:53.244 align:start size:69% position:31%
<i> Another major problem
 that we have</i>

00:16:53.244 --> 00:16:57.048 align:start size:75% position:25%
is that we believe that,
first off,

00:16:57.048 --> 00:16:59.985 align:start size:75% position:25%
we don't have enough
computer science majors,

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:03.789 align:start size:94% position:6%
and although we don't actually
have evidence for this,

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:06.424 align:start size:72% position:28%
but we believe
it would be challenging

00:17:06.424 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start size:72% position:28%
to convince those
computer science majors

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.295 align:start size:63% position:38%
to teach in schools,

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:13.665 size:78% position:61%
like math majors choose
to teach math in schools,

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.700 align:start size:72% position:28%
because the pay is low,

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.371 align:start size:88% position:13%
compared to what they can
command working in industry.

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:23.574 align:start size:81% position:19%
But we do have are
very smart schoolteachers,

00:17:23.574 --> 00:17:26.811 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we have very interested
teachers who,

00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:30.148 align:start size:94% position:6%
given the opportunity with
their great experience already

00:17:30.148 --> 00:17:31.416 align:start size:56% position:44%
at being teachers,

00:17:31.416 --> 00:17:34.052 align:start size:66% position:34%
could get up to speed
more quickly

00:17:34.052 --> 00:17:37.656 align:start size:81% position:19%
teaching computing content
if they just had access

00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:41.460 align:start size:91% position:9%
to the disciplinary knowledge
that we can provide them,

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:46.531
as well as the shared knowledge
that we'll have to be developing

00:17:46.531 --> 00:17:50.034 align:start size:78% position:22%
in how to teach computing
at various grade levels.

00:17:50.034 --> 00:17:54.272 align:start size:91% position:9%
So I think online has
the potential for scaling out

00:17:54.272 --> 00:17:57.275 align:start size:81% position:19%
and help building up these
communities of teachers--

00:17:57.275 --> 00:18:01.079 align:start size:84% position:16%
maybe one in one school
and one in another school--

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:04.749 align:start size:84% position:16%
and make them
more of an online community

00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:08.753 align:start position:0%
because we know online education
doesn't work very well

00:18:08.753 --> 00:18:12.590 align:start size:88% position:13%
for what we would call
novice or beginner students.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.727 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know, 10-year-olds,
14-year-olds, 18-year-olds,

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:17.062 align:start size:75% position:25%
there's evidence showing

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:20.065 align:start size:78% position:22%
that what we're doing now
in online learning

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:21.767 size:88% position:56%
often isn't very successful,

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.602 align:start size:69% position:31%
especially
if we think of a MOOC.

00:18:24.602 --> 00:18:27.005 align:start size:78% position:22%
That's because
students need motivation.

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:31.509
They need to have a real desire
for wanting to learn something

00:18:31.509 --> 00:18:34.212 size:84% position:58%
to be successful at a MOOC.

00:18:34.212 --> 00:18:39.718
Well, teachers who are looking
forward to teaching a course,

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:42.421 align:start size:75% position:25%
they're pretty masterful
learners themselves,

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:48.126 align:start position:0%
and that might be a way to
give them access and opportunity

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:52.264
to develop the skills that they
need to teach these courses.

00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:55.801 align:start position:0%
So what's next for you
in computer science education?

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:58.837 align:start position:0%
What do you see
on the horizon?

00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:01.472 align:start size:84% position:16%
Right now
in the state of California,

00:19:01.472 --> 00:19:04.742 align:start size:75% position:25%
we're in an amazing time
of opportunity.

00:19:04.742 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start size:72% position:28%
Just April 1st of 2016,

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.882 align:start size:69% position:31%
they adopted a new,

00:19:10.882 --> 00:19:12.617 align:start size:72% position:28%
what's called
supplemental credential

00:19:12.617 --> 00:19:15.686 align:start position:0%
to actually credential teachers
to teach computing

00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:18.190
in the schools in California.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:23.061 size:84% position:58%
There had been an old one,
but you can tell it was old

00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:26.898 align:start size:91% position:9%
'cause it talked about things
like modems and dial-up.

00:19:26.898 --> 00:19:30.368 align:start size:63% position:38%
<i> So this is
 a modern credential</i>

00:19:30.368 --> 00:19:32.904 align:start size:75% position:25%
with modern goals to it,

00:19:32.904 --> 00:19:37.008 align:start size:69% position:31%
and there's currently
no existing curriculum

00:19:37.008 --> 00:19:40.545 align:start size:91% position:9%
in universities in California
for teaching teachers

00:19:40.545 --> 00:19:44.650
so that they can get accredited
in the supplemental credential.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.485 align:start size:81% position:19%
So I'm looking forward
to working collaboratively

00:19:47.485 --> 00:19:50.121 align:start size:72% position:28%
with friends
in the Cal State system

00:19:50.121 --> 00:19:52.023 align:start size:63% position:38%
and in the UC system

00:19:52.023 --> 00:19:55.493 align:start size:91% position:9%
to develop and begin offering
courses here at UCSD

00:19:55.493 --> 00:19:58.296
and for teachers
here in San Diego.

00:19:58.296 --> 00:19:59.798 align:start position:0%
Fantastic.
Thank you, Beth.

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:03.168 align:start position:0%
Thank you for your passion
