Good evenening every one. Welcome again to our penultimate class in this semesters' course on nutrition

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.220
a reminder that next week we will be talking about vitamins and minerals and vitamin and mineral supplements so please join us for that last class

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.080
Dr Jeffrey Thais will be the professor joining us that evening

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.800
tonight we have what I guess for some of you has been the lecture you've been waiting for since the beginning

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.740
Dr Lustig gave a similar lecture in 2009

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.180
little did we know at the time that it would have 3.5 million downloads

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.360
since then but also in this room at a course very similar to this that I also chaired

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.120
and it's really... I think changed his life more than anything else but I think the hope is, that… it's also

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.730
changed the field and the topic and the policies and the politics that we are going to talk about tonight

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.330
many of you know Dr. Lustig is an internationally known neuroendicronologist in pediatrics

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:18.830
he trained for part of his time at UCSF then went back east to do a clinical neuroendicronology and came back to UCSF in 2001

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.430
where he's continued to do his clinical science

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.630
on factors that control appetite, particularly the interaction between

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.460
the hormones of insulin, leptin, ghrelin,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.830
and appetite control and metabolic syndrome and obesity

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.200
more recently… in part around the time of the video and certainly in the four years since

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.700
Rob has become an international leader

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.800
in the efforts to improve our nutrition not only in the United States but around the world

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.900
he's focused a larger part by putting a real microscope on the issues of

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.360
fructose and sugar in general and refined foods in general

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.530
the relationship of the dietary fiber and the many of the other topics

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.730
that we've been talking about over the course of the course

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.860
Rob just returned from Europe

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.260
this morning, in fact arrived here at 5 o'clock this evening

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.630
we think he had dinner, we know he hasn't had sleep, it's 4 o'clock Europe time for him so

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.460
this was really a heroic effort

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.100
our fingers were crossed that all the flights would be on time

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.000
and I'm very pleased more than you can imagine

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.660
that he's here tonight, 'cause I didn't wanna give this lecture as well

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.430
but in addition to his work, Rob recently took a sabbatical

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.460
in order to further this work and spend a large part of that time at his ? school of law

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.660
getting a Master of studies in Law

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.900
and part of his aspiration I think is really to add his legal training now

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.900
to his science and medical training

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.060
to continue to advocate for good nutrition around the world so

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.230
we're very anxious to hear about his newest thoughts on this topic

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.760
we've entitled the talk the same title as his best selling book

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.560
"Fat Chance" and added the subtitle "Fructose 2.0", Rob

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:41.700
Thank you Bobby and thank all of you for coming, you know, to some extent this is sort of like déjà vu all over again

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.900
you know having done this 4 years ago and it really did change my life and hopefully changed a few peoples' lifes

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.030
in the audience and certainly around the world

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.830
I still get emails from that video today, ah, you know, people who've seen it for the first time

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.460
that video we are gonna refer back to it in some, to some extent tonight

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.160
'cause I am not gonna redo the biochemestry, there's no point in doing it twice

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.460
what we're gonna talk tonight about is primarily the physiology

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.900
so, in essence, the two videos will end up being complementary on youtube

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.930
and hopefully people who watch it will end up watching both, so keep that in mind
so, in essence, the two videos will end up being complementary on youtube

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.600
and hopefully people who watch it will end up watching both, so keep that in mind

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:34.360
all right, well, a lot's happened in four years, and the data just keeps rolling in, and unfortunately for us all the data is pretty awful

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.060
so you'll see why as we go and I will try to delineate that as we go

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.930
so first of all I have no disclosures, no food industry is putting me up to this

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.300
you be sure of that

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.260
so here's the past, this is 2001

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.860
6 million kids are seriously overwheight, well

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.800
with all of the media attention, with all of the NIH money, with all of the clinical programs

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.900
and with Michelle Obama's vegetable gardens we are now up to 20 million

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.130
here's the present

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.660
currently there are 30% more obese people on the planet than undernourished people

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.960
and this has happened only within 15 years because 15 years ago was exactly the opposite

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.200
and it's occurring in countries that still have under nutrition

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.760
so how do you explain that, other than to say

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.800
that can't be behaviour, that's gotta be an exposure

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.500
this looks like any standard pandemic

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.060
influenza, typhoid, etc

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:43.530
this looks like a microbial phenomenon rather than a behavioral phenomenon, we're gonna go there

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.800
366 million diabetics walking the earth, that's 5% of the worlds' population

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.100
and they are chewing through all the health-care resources

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:59.500
this was just three months ago, diabetics cost the US 24 billion dollars

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.230
now if we could recoup even a fraction of that we wouldn't even need health-care reform

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.560
in fact it's been suggested that we wouldn't even need financial reform

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.330
ok, 41% rise in 5 years, this is going up so fast it makes your head spin

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.800
and here's the future if we do nothing

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:24.360
experts predict 165 million Americans, 42% would be obese by the year 2030

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.730
100 million Americans, that'll be 33%, will have diabetes by 2050

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.300
but fear not, because it won't really matter because Medicare will be broke by 2026

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.800
so, as the Soup Nazi once said: "No health-care for you"

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:45.930
well, the fact of the matter is, I'm gonna be 69 in 2026 and I want my fricking Medicare

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.260
and… so should you all

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:54.930
the point is, we have to do something different, and you know the old's adage, right?

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:59.900
the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.700
well I'm here to tell you for the last 30 years we've done the same thing over and over and over again

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.900
and there has been no change in the result

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:13.660
so we have to rethink this, we have to reframe the argument and that's what we are gonna try to do tonight

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.000
and I'm'a do it right now

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.860
so here's the way people view this issue

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.430
this is a Venn diagram of all the adults in America

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.400
30% obese over here, and 70% normal weight over here

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.260
and everybody assumes that the problem is this group over here because

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.130
80% of the obese population is sick in some fashion

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:42.460
with type-2 diabetes, lipid problems, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.960
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovarian disease, etc, etc

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.560
so, if you do the math on this, that's 80% of 30% of 240 million, that's 57 million sick

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.030
and it's those 57 million that are bankrupting the country

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.900
and so it's the obese person's fault only

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.160
and that's the way everyone views this

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:09.060
this is wrong, this is a mistake, this is a disaster actually, because it is not correct

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:16.630
here's the real story, in fact, 20% of the obese population is completely metabolically normal

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:21.060
they have normal insulin dynamics, they don't get sick,

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.230
they will live a completely normal life, die at a completely normal age,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.960
cost the taxpayer nothing, they're just fat

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:37.060
conversely, up to 40% of the normal weight population have the exact same metabolic dysfunction

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:42.630
that the obese do, they are just normal weight, and so they don't even know they are sick, until it's too late

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:50.660
because, normal weight people get type-2 diabetes, they get hypertension, they get dyslipidemia, they get cardiovascular disease, they get cancer, they get dementia, etc, etc

00:09:50.660 --> 00:10:01.400
and so when you do the math on that, that's another 67 million, so that's actually outclassing the obese, and so the total is 124 million, that's more than half of all of America

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.430
Now, you may remember HIV

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:12.030
Remember HIV? When did HIV become a public health crisis?

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.000
No, not in the 80s

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.630
In the, in 1991

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:24.160
1991, 1979 patient zero, so we first learned about the, you know

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.930
the diagnosis, throughout the entire 80s it was all about the gays and the addicts

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:35.700
and it was always, it's their problem, their personal responsibility, their behavior, their fault

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.130
and then something happened in 1991, anybody remember what it was?

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.700
Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson got HIV

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.800
and all of a sudden everyone went "Holly Mother…" you know what

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:54.060
and everybody realized, you know what? everyone's at risk, and all of a sudden it became a public health crisis

00:10:54.060 --> 00:11:00.060
so when does a personal responsibility issue become a public health crisis? and that's what we're gonna talk about tonight

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.400
because this is a public health crisis

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.030
here's the slide that demonstrates the phenomenon

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.560
so here are two equally weighted adult men

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.300
which one's healthy and which one's sick

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.400
anybody know?

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.230
the one on the bottom is sick, right, he's sick

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.930
why? All that visceral fat, all that fat surrounding the organs

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.730
see this guy over here he's got big love handles, but you know, so what?

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:35.400
in fact, this is perfectly healthy, it's no problem, because subcutaneous fat is actually kinda good for you

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.860
there are actually studies that show more subcutaneous fat, more longevity

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.960
whereas this stuff, this is the bad stuff, this is the poison stuff over here

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.160
so, the fact is, standing on a scale doesn't tell you where your fat is

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.860
what does?

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:58.400
well your waist circumference is a good start, and then there's some lab tests you can do as well, the bottom line is there are a lot of normal weight people who have this phenomenon called TOFI

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.400
Thin in the outside fat on the inside

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.400
ok? Probably some right here in the audience

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.230
and they get type-2 diabetes, they get dyslipidemia, they get hypertension, etc, etc, you get the picture?

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:14.730
everyone's at risk, because everyone's exposed, the question is, what it is you're exposed to?

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.230
because obesity is not the problem, it never was

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.930
they want you to think it's the problem, but it ain't the problem

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.300
what is the problem? Metabolic syndrome is the problem

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.400
the cluster of diseases that I've just described you, 'cause that's where all the money goes

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:36.060
obesity cost almost nothing, metabolic syndrome is 75% of all health-care cost today

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:42.000
and there's the list right there, everyone with me now? Ok, do I have your attention? Ok

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.360
So how does this work? So this actually is a redundancy from the previous Youtube video so I apologize for that

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:54.230
it has to do with how you view the question of obesity and what does it mean, so

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:58.200
of course obesity obeys the first law of thermodynamics, and I don't argue that

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.230
the total energy inside a closed system remains constant. It's a law

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:11.760
ok, if I didn't believe in the first law of thermodynamics you'd have me written out on the rail, I'd be the ultimate heretic and zealot and I would be discredited

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.930
of course I believe in the first law of thermodynamics, it's a law

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:22.100
the question is, as I've learned from my legal training, who's truth, which interpretation

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:27.460
you know the Supreme Court always comes down 5-4 on everything, right, right?

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:33.630
True, ok, because there are two interpretations, I mean, basically that's what the Supreme Court is for, interpreting the law

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.600
the law is the law, but the interpretation is something else, so here are the two interpretations

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.430
If you eat it, you better burn it, or you gonna store it

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:48.630
if that's true, then this is a matter of energy balance

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.530
energy balance, that's what everyone will tell you

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:58.560
and it's the result of two aberrant behaviors, calories in - gluttony, calories out - sloth

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.800
and that's what everybody assumes, is, if you're obese, well you must eat too much or exercise too little, or both

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.700
and therefore, it's your fault

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:13.500
and that's what we believe and to this day we still don't have insurance for obesity

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:19.460
although just today, you know that the AMA finally said "obesity is a disease"

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.300
so it's funny, because actually in 2004 HHS said obesity is a disease

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:29.060
it took the AMA 9 years to catch up with HHS, figure that out

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:37.360
so the do… it's based on this dogma, the dogma is, that if you eat more than you burn you'll gain weight, if you eat less than you burn you'll lose weight

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.400
because all calories are the same, a calorie is a calorie

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:47.360
this is the biggest… pile of you-know-what there is

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.630
this is absolute not true

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:54.060
but if you believe it then the corollaries of a calorie is a calorie are

00:14:54.060 --> 00:15:02.200
that this is free will, you get to choose what you get to put in your mouth, it's personal responsibility because if you are obese you chose to be

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.560
gluttony and sloth that is your problem and diet and exercise will fix it

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.400
that's what everyone believes from a calorie is a calorie

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.500
and who says that a calorie is a calorie, well?

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:20.100
the food industry says a calorie is a calorie, and that's 'cause it serves them well, so this is the fiction

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:25.260
this is Coca-Cola's coming together video on Youtube

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:33.430
released just before the Superbowl, that says: "Beating obesity will take action by all of us based on one simple common sense fact"

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:40.030
common sense fact, all calories count, no matter where they come from, including Coca-cola and everything else with calories, a calorie is a calorie

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:45.460
why pick on Coca-cola, why pick on Burger King, why pick on any individual

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.000
because it serves them well, because it diffuses the issue

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:57.400
so, is that what we've got? We've just gut a caloric bachanalia? Oh, sorry, wait, this is wrong, that's better, ok

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:03.360
Indeed we are all eating more, I don't argue that, 187 calories per day more for men,

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.960
335 calories per day more for women, 275 calories more per day for teen boys

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.160
than 25 years ago, we are all eating more, I don't argue that, of course we are, question is why

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:25.030
so you'd say, well this is why, this is the evolution of fast food over here, 1957 we had the original White Castle hamburger, 210 calories right there, 1 ounce

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.660
over here we have today's Bob's Big Boy over here at 618 calories

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:36.300
and of course in the midst of the obesity epidemic hardies had the temerity to offer us the Thickburger at 1420 calories

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:42.360
and of course you can go to Carls' Junior and get the 6$ burger, which is 2000 calories, that's the entire caloric allotment for the day

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.760
and people are proud to go do it, right?

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.660
How? Anybody here had a Trenta?

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.200
A Trenta, yes, no? Ok, so that's this guy over here

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.360
so it's not hot coffee, it's a cold coffee drink

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.960
flavored with you-know-what, and it is 916 cc

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.260
well, your stomach is 900cc, it's bigger than your stomach

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.600
so you'd say, well there's your answer, Q.E.D, it's all over right?

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.000
How about this? I love this, it's came in the mail

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.730
"Free chicken sandwich from KFC with the purchase of a 30 ounce drink"

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:23.800
the food's gotten so cheap we're are giving it away? That's where we are, ok

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.100
Or is it the opposite side of the equation? Is it an activity famine?

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.060
So this is a study that was done looking at physical activity here on the Y axis

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:37.730
against age, 9-years old to 19-years old, for white girls and black girls

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:42.560
so you can see that by the time they hit age 15 the black girls are just lying prostrate on the floor

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.330
'cause there's no physical activity whatsoever

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.460
so you say, well there's your answer, that's why everyone's obese

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.560
because they're eating too much and they're exercising too little, gluttony and sloth, diet and exercise

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.230
just like common sense tells you

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:01.630
well, you know what? I don't believe in common sense, I believe in data

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.400
Ok? And that's why we do research

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.260
because education consists mainly of what we have unlearned

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.630
in fact, if everything that we knew were true, there would be no reason for research, would there?

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:17.300
I would never have to do any research 'cause everything we knew was already right

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:22.630
In fact, everything we learned 10 years ago is already wrong, and everything we know today will be wrong 10 years from now

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:27.930
and that's why you do research, and the fact is the research tells us something very different

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.930
so, is this behavior, is this personal responsibility? What do you think?

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.700
there are 6 reasons to doubt this

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.160
Number 1: no child chooses to be obese

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.260
the quality of an obese… life of an obese child is the same as a patient on cancer chemotherapy

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.400
why would anyone choose this, in fact, children are ostracized

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.130
Does, second, does diet work? Now everybody knows somebody who lost weight on a diet

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.630
and then of course they gained it all back, and that's what all the data shows

00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:02.460
and the number of people who can actually maintain their weight loss for any length of time is vanishingly small

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:08.260
and if it weren't true you wouldn't be sitting here listening to me, because you'd say, well why do I have to listen to him?

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.530
Does exercise work? So,

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:19.730
here are studies of exercise and this is the identity line here and you can see when compared with no treatment exercise resulted in very small weight loss across the board

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.600
one BMI point, bigger exercise 1.5 BMI points

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.160
considering, we are all 7 to 8 BMI points more than we should be

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:35.900
you know, that ain't gonna cut it, because exercise does not cause weight loss. Does not cause weight loss.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.560
What does exercise do? It causes muscle gain, and that's good

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.660
because muscles have mitochondria, mitochondria burn energy

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:50.900
so you stay insulin sensitive because you have a place to put your energy instead of in your liver where it causes problems

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:58.330
so, exercise is the single best thing you can do for yourself, but if you think it's gonna show up on the scale, think again

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:03.330
So when you stand on the scale, what are you measuring? You're measuring 4 compartments at once

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.300
Bone, more is better

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.000
Muscle, more is better

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.260
Subcutaneous fat, more is better, I just showed you

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.430
and finally visceral fat, more is worse

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.230
Now the visceral fat usually accompasses about 4 to 6 percent of your total body weight

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:26.660
so when you stand on the scale, what are you measuring? You don't know, you can't possibly know

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:33.900
So, we have all these doctors telling their patients, well if you'd only exercise you'd lose weight, and then of course they don't

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.500
because they've built muscle, which is good, but it doesn't show up on the scale

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:45.860
and then they get depressed, because, oh, I was doing this to lose weight and it didn't work, and so I might as well stop because obviously it doesn't work for me

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:52.900
this is the single most egregious thing doctors do to their patients today, and as far as I'm concerned, that's almost malpractice

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.900
because the data say otherwise

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.230
Number 3, this isn't just about America

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:07.360
and it's not just about UK, it's not just about Australia, yes we are the 3 fattest countries

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.300
and we spent the least amount of our GDP on food, that's true

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:18.600
but it's going on everywhere, every country, every single country on the planet has shown an uptick in obesity

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.260
some have shown an uptick in diabetes and some have shown a downtick

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:28.760
but for obesity, everybody's going up, doesn't matter where you look, every country has shown an increase

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.830
Number 4, the poor are disproportionately affected

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:37.030
and they don't have access to choices, they can't even leave their house for fear of crime

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:43.400
how they'gonna exercise, how they're gonna let their kids out, to go play in the yard, when they might, you know, face a straight bullet

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:50.960
they don't have a supermarkets, they live in food desserts, so if you don't have a choice, how can you call it personal responsibility?

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.900
You know, this is one of the most egregious, pejorative statements that there is

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:02.460
Number 5, the prevalence of obesity is going up in the group

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.560
that you can least ascribe personal responsibility to, the toddler

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.960
the 2-5 year old group is going up the fastest, you wanna say that that's personal respons… oh you say

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.460
the personal responsibility of the parent, right, for letting them have the sugar pops and

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.000
and you know, and the sodas, and the fruit juices, and everything else is, parents' fault

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.460
except for one thing, we've been having an epidemic of obese 6 months olds, and they don't diet and exercise

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:31.060
so any hypothesis you wanna proffer, you have to explain this as well

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.760
and it's even worse than that, because we have obesity in newborns

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:42.360
newborns, ok? Birth weights gone up by 200 grams all over the world

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:49.030
all over the world over the last 25 years, and when you look at, when you do dexa scans to figure out what the body composition is

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.630
it's all fat, it's all fat

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:57.760
so there, these babies are laying down more fat before they're ever born and fat cells wanna get filled

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:04.960
that's why we have obese 6 months old, because everybody is laying down more fat, so the question is how? Why?

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.200
Why they are laying down more fat today?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.100
Most clearly, mother's diet

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.960
But you wanna blame the newborn for that problem?

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.760
Is that their problem? Is that their fault?

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:22.530
So you wanna blame the pregnant mother? Well you know… then, just go backwards like that, so basically blame everybody

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:28.930
or blame nobody, I blame nobody. Actually I do blame somebody but you're gonna get there by the end

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:35.100
So we are talking about behavior, right? Behavior, so this is the definition of behavior, this is all from the original video

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.100
A stereotyped motor response to a physiological stimulus, so let's take that apart

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.100
Stereotyped, same every time, so, yes, eating is a behavior

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.200
motor, muscles have to move, a thought is not a behavior

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.830
and finally, physiological, and that's where I come in

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:56.630
What's the physiology behind the obesity epidemic? Why do you eat too much and exercise too little?

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.730
Because all behaviors have a biochemical basis

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.130
Now sometimes we are smart enough to know what it is and sometimes we are not smart enough to know what it is

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.130
give you an example: schizophrenia

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:15.330
For a 100 years schizophrenia was behavioral disorder, now we know it's a defect in dopamine neuro transmission, and probably actually a defect in glucose transport across the brain

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:22.930
Ok? These are biochemical problems, that ultimately manifest themselves as a behavioral disorder, this is no different

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:29.260
So what are the biochemical underpinnings behind gluttony and sloth? That's the question, and that's what we're gonna try to answer now

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:35.330
So in order to answer that we have to know some science, and I'm gonna make this very brief and very quick

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.760
We're gonna talk about these two hormones right over here, called leptin and insulin

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:48.260
so leptin is a hormone that comes from your fat cell, goes to your brain and tells your brain, you have enough energy on board, to engage in normal, expensive metabolic processes

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.500
you can burn energy at a normal rate and feel good doing it

00:24:52.500 --> 00:25:00.730
ok? And tells your brain, you've got enough energy on board, if your leptin goes down, or if your brain doesn't see your leptin, then your brain sees that as starvation

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.300
Everybody got that?

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:10.600
Insulin is equally interesting, because insulin tells your fat cell one thing, it says, store energy

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.860
and it tells your brain something else, it tells your brain: stop

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:21.300
I'm in the middle of metabolizing a meal, I don't need any more, let me deal with what I've got, and so it's part of the satiety signal

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:28.230
so it tells you… fat cell, get bigger and it tells your brain, stop feeding your fat cell

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:33.000
so, it's got a dichotomist role, and it's that dichotomist role that is the linchpin

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.400
in terms of understanding the physiology of obesity

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:42.230
and I'm gonna get… we're gonna go there. So here's how it works, let's… we have to explain a paradox, here's the paradox

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.200
Who has children?

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.630
Enough of you. What happens if you give a 5 year old kid a cookie?

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:54.830
Yeah, they eat it, yeah, I know they eat it, what happens after that…

00:25:54.830 --> 00:26:02.630
they bounce of walls, is what they do, ask any kindergarten teacher what happens when the cupcakes roll out for the birthday party

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:07.030
ok? That's the end of the lesson, ok? They are bouncing off walls, is known as the sugar high

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.960
so what's going on, the fat cell gets filled, you know, because of the coookie,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:19.160
the leptin goes up, tells the brain "hey, I've got extra energy on board", it tells the sympathetic nerve system, the fighter/flight part of the nerve system

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:29.160
that innervates your muscles, and innervates your fat cells, "hey, I got too much energy", so what happens? you burn it off, so the sympathetic nerve system tone to the muscles give you the fidgeting

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:34.460
and the sympathetic nerve system tone to the fat cells releases the extra fat

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.330
and that gets used for energy later, and so this is a nice negative feedback pathway

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.760
that keeps you in energy balance as long as your brain can see its leptin

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:52.230
so far so good, so here's the paradox? What happens if you give an obese 5 year old kid a cookie instead?

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.400
They are in the pantry looking for more cookies

00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:00.700
Anybody ever see a sugar high in an obese kid? Doesn't exist, doesn't exist

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:06.430
and that's why they are obese, it's because they don't get the sugar high, because they can't see their leptin

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:11.430
'cause if they could see their leptin they'd have a sugar high. But they don't, that's the point

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:16.960
so something is blocking that leptin signal, that's the paradox, the question is, what is it?

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.930
So we learned about leptin from this patient over here, ok?

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:27.430
This is the obi obi mouse, the leptin deficient mouse, who has a gene defect in the leptin gene, so this

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.360
animal's leptin is zero

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.400
so his brain thinks he's starving all the time, so he'll eat anything in sight

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.860
not only will he eat anything in sight, but this animal is the ultimate couch potato

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:45.160
because his brain can't see his leptin, so he thinks he's starving, so he doesn't want to burn energy, he wants to store it

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:51.530
so, the only reason this animal ever gets off his hind is if you put the food on the other side of the cage, and they'll waddle over to that

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:57.260
sit down, eat it there, and stay there instead. Ok, everybody got it? Now,

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:02.360
the reason? Because leptin tells the hypothalamus that you've got the energy to burn

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:10.230
so if the hypothalamus sees the leptin signal, then this diamond over here gets activated

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:15.800
anorexigenesis, that is, I'm not hungry, I don't need any more, and I can burn energy effectively

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:21.600
and so it tells the sympathetic nerve system turn on to fidget and to release fat from the fat cell

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:31.230
and it tells the vagus nerve, the energy storage nerve, "hey, I'm not hungry, appetite down, and stop releasing insulin". Everybody with me?

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:36.860
Conversely if the leptin doesn't reach the hypothalamus, because there is a gene deletion or there is something blocking it

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.700
then you get this diamond instead, which is orexigenesis

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:50.360
"I'm hungry, I need more food, because I'm starving, and because I'm starving I'm going to try to conserve"

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:55.900
and so that means your sympathetic nerve system tone goes down, which means you sit on a log

00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:06.430
and your vagus nerve goes up to increase your appetite, so that you'll generate more calories in order to put more into the fat cells to try to get more of a leptin signal, everybody with me?

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:11.930
and this is that same negative feedback pathway I showed you before, now schematized

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.300
and there are leptin deficient people, 14 at last count, 14

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:23.230
and they're all of consanguineous marriages and they're all of Pakistani or Turkish ancestry

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.060
and when they're born the are perfectly normal weight

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.060
and by age six months they are already massively obese

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.500
because their brain is constantly starving, it doesn't matter how much weight they gain

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:38.300
their brain can't see it, because it ain't there, because they have a leptin gene defect

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:44.160
so here's a patient, 220 pounds by age 9

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.230
but you start giving them shots of leptin every day and look what happens, they lose weight on a dime

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.830
and it's all fat mass that they are losing too

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:59.260
hormone replacement therapy, because now the brain can see leptin because we are giving it to them from a bottle instead of from their own fat cell

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.660
hormone replacement therapy, that's what I do as an endocrinologist, that's my job

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:08.160
and here's an example, here's the patient at 3 and half years of age, looking pretty awful

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.360
and here's after a shot of leptin every day for 4 years, indistinguishable from normal

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.760
because we fixed the problem, great right? For those 14 people

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:23.000
The problem is the rest of us are not leptin deficient, the rest of us are leptin resistant

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.300
we got boatloads of leptin, and the leptin correlates with how much body fat we have

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:32.230
but if our brain could see that leptin we wouldn't be obese

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.760
because we'd burn it off in the sugar high, right? Everybody got it?

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.830
So there's something blocking that signaling right there, that X

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:46.160
that's the holy grail of obesity, right there, what is blocking leptin from working

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:56.160
'cause if you can't… if your hypothalamus can't see it, then you are in this box over here, and you can see things just go in the wrong direction, and there's your gluttony and there is your sloth

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.630
so this is all biochemical

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:05.600
so, what role does insulin play in this leptin debacle? That's the question, remember I told you

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.730
insulin tells your fat cell one thing, and your brain the exact opposite

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:15.600
it tells your fat cell store, and tells your brain stop. That's the problem

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:23.330
So, this is the patient that got me started in obesity research, now 18 years ago, when I worked at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:27.910
this was a 15 year old boy, who weights 364 pounds in this photo

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:35.510
and at age 7 this kid was perfectly normal weight for height, and then he developed this brain tumor sitting in the middle of his energy balance pathway

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:41.910
and he required surgery, and he required radiation to kill this astrocytoma, tumor of the brain

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:46.840
and he started gaining weight at the rate of 30 pounds per year non stop

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.820
for 8 years until he was 364 pounds and I saw him, ok, everybody with me?

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.930
now, this form of intractable obesity due to a brain lesion

00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:00.930
now that area of the brain that controls this energy balance is dead

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:06.170
so you can have all the leptin in the world but if those neurons are dead, your brain thinks its starving

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.220
because it can't transduce that signal

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:14.170
so this is called hypothalamic obesity and this is how I got started in obesity research many many years ago, ok?

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:18.660
So the question is how does this happen, well here are two different hypothesis

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:25.510
This hypothesis says well you damage the hypothalamus and you get obesity because it releases a satiety center

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:33.200
so now you become hyperphagic, except the data actually doesn't support that, the date doesn't support that there's hyperphagia, that there is too much food intake

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:33.280
actually it supports that there's too little burning, that's what it shows
so now you become hyperphagic, except the data actually doesn't support that, the date doesn't support that there's hyperphagia, that there is too much food intake

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.280
actually it supports that there's too little burning, that's what it shows

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:43.600
and that the obesity occurs and then, because of the obesity you have to secret more insulin to tend all that fat

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.620
and so that the insulin here is a result of the obesity

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:51.550
but there's this other hypothesis over here that says, the damage to the hypothalamus yes, it leads to obesity,

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.640
but because it turns on that vagus nerve, because you can't see your leptin

00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:02.080
and when you turn on the vagus nerve that tells your pancreas to release more insulin, and that extra insulin drives energy into fat

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.460
energy deposition, not energy balance

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:10.750
because of the high insulin, and the insulin is driving the obesity, so which is true?

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:15.280
Well if this is true, nothing I can do about it, 'cause I can't fix a brain

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:22.400
If this is true it gives me a place I can potentially intervene, right between the vagus nerve and the pancreas

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.680
and we have a drug that does that, and it's called Octeotride, and it's an endocrine drug that I know how to use

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.440
and so we asked the question, if we take these kids who have this intractable obesity due to brain tumors

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:38.350
and we give them this drug to suppress their insulin, might it help? That was the question

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:45.910
So here's that same patient I showed you, 364 pounds, and here is a year later 326 first time he took a picture with his shirt off

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:51.680
so he did pretty well, ok, I'm gonna show you the ??? over here, this isn't even my patient

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:58.040
this is a beautiful 13 year old girl from Hawaii, notice the flower, ok?

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:03.950
who, like a month after this picture was taken, was in a very severe car accident

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:09.280
on a Honolulu road, and she was in the intensive care unit for a month

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:15.460
and she survived but she struck her hypothalamus, and so this is her a year later

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.040
now, does anybody wanna tell me that this is gluttony and sloth?

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.640
This kid now can't see her leptin because those neurons are dead

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.220
now just so happens I happened to be giving ground rounds at Kaiser Honolulu in 2008

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:32.040
and so they invited the patient and her mother to come to the talk

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.710
because they were thinking about putting this kid on octreotide even though she'd never' a brain tumor

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.820
because she might have the same disorder, and so there I am with her

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:44.750
and here she is a year and a half later, on the drug, at her high school graduation

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:50.840
Now, who here wants to tell me that this is gluttony and sloth?

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.880
Do I have your attention? Ok, it's never gluttony and sloth

00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:01.550
It's always biochemical, the question is are you smart enough to figure out what the biochemistry is

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:08.310
So we said, maybe this could be true in adult obesity without brain tumors or without hypothalamic damage?

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:12.530
So we did a study, actually 2 studies, double blind placebo controlled,

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:17.280
this is a patient, adult, Christmas 1998 holding up food

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:24.620
and here she is 35 pounds later, in her jogging togs, showing me that she wanted to exercise

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:29.460
she actually wanted to exercise, and the reason was because she wasn't storing it

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.480
because her insulin went down, because the drug suppressed her insulin

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.680
and when her insulin when down, she had the energy to burn

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.660
and she wanted to, and she did

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:45.730
and she's showing you, right here, that the change in the biochemistry changed her behavior

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:49.280
the biochemistry drives the behavior

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:55.110
so, the cause of leptin resistance, that X up here? It's insulin

00:35:55.110 --> 00:36:01.330
and there's actually numerous studies now, biochemical, molecular, genetic, that show

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:06.970
that insulin blocks leptin signaling by acting on the same neurons in the brain as leptin does

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:12.620
and that's the point, insulin blocks leptin signaling, now why?

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.620
What's in it for us, why would God do this to us?

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:21.680
And the answer is because there are two times in your life you actually have to gain weight, what are they?

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.130
Pregnancy is one, and the other is puberty

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:30.260
Puberty and pregnancy, both necessary for survival of the species

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:35.510
If your leptin worked right all the time, you could never gain the weight

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:40.310
because you'd be in the sugar high, you'd be burning it off before you ever had a chance to actually gain weight

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:44.440
you'd be the 97 pound weakling on the beach who couldn't bulk up

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.800
and the species would die out

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:53.200
so there are two times in your life you actually have to gain weight, and both puberty and pregnancy are insulin resistant states

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.110
where your insulin goes high very specifically to cause the weight gain

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:01.600
then, you cut the cord, baby's out, sex hormones go back down,

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.910
the insulin resistance goes away, you lose the weight and you can start all over again

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:11.200
So it actually makes perfect Darwinian sense that insulin should block leptin

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.950
Twice in your life

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.730
Twice in your life, insulin should block leptin

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.880
Problem is, now it blocks leptin all the time

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.880
'Cause our insulins are high, 24/7/365

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:30.930
so the question is, how come? Where did the increased insulin come from?

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:34.260
That's the question, the 64 zillion dollar question

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.260
why are we all hyperinsulinemic today

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.480
If you look at glucose tolerance tests done today vs ones that were done 35 years ago

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:45.460
we're releasing double to triple the amount of insulin today that we were 35 years, and the question is why?

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.350
I'm not gonna tell you

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:51.460
I'm gonna let Will Smith tell you

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.040
"What?"

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.000
"Guess I owe you some answers, hoss"

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.350
"What, you're feeling chatty all of a sudden?"

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.080
"Sorry, I can't talk right now. I got some secret cases of my own I'm working on"

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.970
"I hate to tear you away from your video game"

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.710
"All right, I'm hanging up"

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:16.530
"You know the most destructive force in the universe?"

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.200
"Sugar?"

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.800
You know, if Hollywood knows this why don't you?

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.330
Indeed, he's got it right, ok?

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:41.680
So, we know that there are substances out there that are addictive and hazardous to our health

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.880
here's a perfect example, and we regulate it

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.880
well, guess what

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.130
it's not the only one, this is too

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:55.280
and I'll show you why, so there are the two papers… you know, popular press items

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:02.220
this was from the New York Times magazine in 2011, is sugar toxic, from Gary Taubes based our work here at UCSF

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:07.020
and this is a, Comment, that we had Nature, last year, that got quite a bit of heat

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:14.970
more than light unfortunately, called "The toxic truth about sugar" that I wrote with my colleagues here, Laura Schmidt and Claire Brindis at the Institute for Health Policy Studies

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:19.280
So, hazardous to your health, and the reason is because

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.330
that common sense notion, a calorie is a calorie

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:27.860
it ain't true, 'cause a calorie is not a calorie

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:32.040
So, what are we talking about? Here we're talking about this stuff called High Fructose Corn Syrup

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.880
55% fructose, so they say

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:40.660
there are actually some studies that suggest that dispenser sugar, like from McDonald's, or Burger King, or 7eleven

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:44.840
might actually have 65% fructose sometimes, and that would be a problem

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.040
but most of the time it's 55%

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.840
one glucose, one fructose

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.640
six membered ring, five membered ring

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.710
Now this stuff? Is essential for life

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:02.170
Every cell on the planet utilizes glucose for energy

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:07.600
It's so important that if you don't eat it your body makes it, that's how important it is

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.710
This guy over here is completely vestigial, there's not one biochemical reaction in the body that requires it

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:16.000
but it's very sweet, and we like it a lot

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.660
The question is, what do we do with it if we don't need it for any biochemical reaction?

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:25.060
That's one of the key questions

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.240
But over here is sucrose, this is table sugar, cane sugar… the stuff you put in your coffee

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.420
one glucose, one fructose

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.770
O-glycosidic linkage linking the two

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:37.240
The enzyme in your intestine, sucrase, cleaves this in about a nanosecond

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.020
so when you absorb the two moieties they are exactly the same and that's what all the data say

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:46.970
is that they are exactly the same, high fructose corn syrup and sucrose are metabolically equal

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:52.800
Metabolically bad, metabolically equally bad, ok?

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:59.370
This is what our consumption of fructose, so double it for sugar, has done over the last 100 years

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:05.550
so our ancestors, getting foods and vegetables out of the ground with the occasional honey, got about 15 grams of fructose a day

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:10.840
prior to WW2 with the nascent candy and soft drink industries in the country we got to about 20 grams per day

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:17.060
by 1977 we got up to 37 grams per day, this is just before high fructose corn syrup invaded our shores

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:23.240
at 8% of total caloric intake, by 1994 we are up to 55 grams a day, that was 10% of total caloric intake

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.910
and adolescents currently consume 75 grams per day, that's 12% of caloric intake

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:31.730
and 25% of adolescents consume 100 grams of fructose per day

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:38.260
double that for sugar, that's 200 grams of sugar, multiple by 4.1 calories per gram, that's 840 calories in sugar

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:43.150
so for 2000 calorie allotment, that's 40% of calories are sugar, the question is

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:48.040
Can you handle it? Can your liver handle it?

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.200
Can you metabolize all that sugar before something bad happens?

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.460
Remember what Paracelsus told us: "The dose determines the poison"

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.400
Could this be an overdose?

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.440
And could that be hazardous to your health? Indeed

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.330
So as far as I'm concerned, our entire food supply has been adulterated, fructoselated

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:11.150
because the addition of fructose for palatability, especially with decrease fat

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.370
and also sensibly as a browning agent

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:18.530
because, food browns better, right? You paint it on your barbecue ribs

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:22.930
to brown it better, right? And the caramelization, actually you know, we like that

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.460
and the removal of fiber for shelf life and freezing

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:30.000
we also have substituted trans fats, but those are coming down 'cause we know those are poison

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.420
although they are still legal and they are still on the generally recognized as safe list of the FDA

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.130
figure that out, 'cause we know they are poison

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:43.150
Now, does sugar cause obesity? Yes, no

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:48.750
Food industry will tell you "Everything causes obesity", and you know what? They are right, it's true

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:53.150
because if you look at this study from Mozzaffarian at New… Harvard School Public Health

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.930
looking at what foods cause the most weight gain

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:58.930
potato chips and french fries

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:00.880
indeed, I agree with that

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.550
those are the bad guys, in terms of weight gain

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:06.970
Sugar? Distant third

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:13.330
And when… a meta analysis was done earlier this year, from the University of Otago,

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:18.080
you'll notice, the diamond doesn't cross the identity line

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.930
that means that it's significant

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:25.110
so there is a significant increase in weight, but when you actually look at the… do the math

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.480
it's only 0.8 BMI points

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.480
remember I told you, we got 7 or 8 BMI points to deal with

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.770
so, does sugar cause weight gain?

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.060
Yes

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:41.420
Does sugar cause obesity?

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:46.620
A factor. Is sugar THE cause of obesity?

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:48.750
Not even remotely close

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:54.970
Ok? And the problem is, it's not about obesity, remember? It's about metabolic syndrome

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:58.530
and that's where the money goes. I don't even care about obesity

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:03.150
what I care about is people getting sick, 'cause I'm a doctor, ok?

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:10.880
here's the problem: common wisdom says that sugar is just empty calories and you can get your discretionary calories from anywhere

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.970
the problem is that hepatic fructose metabolism is completely different that of glucose

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:20.660
and this is what the first Youtube video went into, in exhausting detail and I will not repeat it

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:26.080
but I'm gonna show you very quickly that chronic fructose exposure alone promotes the metabolic syndrome

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.930
so, this again is from that first video

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:34.310
when you consume glucose, say rice, white bread, you know starch

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:39.330
80% of the glucose goes to all the organs of the body, only 20% hits the liver

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.800
and where does it go? It goes to this guy over here, glycogen

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.330
Glycogen is liver starch, and liver starch for lack of a better word is good

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:54.130
because that's your energy store for a rainy day, that's the first energy that's used when you fast

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:58.880
ok, that's what, why marathoners carb load before a marathon race

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:03.110
is to try to build up their glycogen stores, because glycogen is non toxic

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:08.930
so if you can up your glycogen stores, your liver has more energy in reserve, and that's a good thing

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:13.460
now little of it will sneak down here and get metabolized by the mitochondria

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:18.530
and throw off a little of this stuff called citrate, and that will then get turned into liver fat

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:23.680
this process here in orange is called "de novo lipogenesis", new fat making

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:28.220
this is how your liver turns carbohydrates into fat, is through this process here

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.820
but you're not dealing with very much carbohydrate here because it all went to glycogen

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.880
and most of it actually got metabolized elsewhere anyway

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.880
so your liver is protected

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.640
everybody see that? Your liver is protected

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:44.260
so this for a lack of better word is normal, now let's talk about something that's not normal

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:49.510
this guy, alcohol, that's not normal, CH3-CH2-OH

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.930
but alcohol is at toxin, right? It's to toxins in one

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:56.570
you wrap your Lamborghini around the tree, right, acute alcohol toxicity

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.550
and you fry your liver, chronic alcohol toxicity

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.550
we keep it out of the hands of children

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.330
here's acute alcohol exposure

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.130
here's acute sugar exposure

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:13.820
none, why? Because the brain doesn't use fructose for energy, it does use alcohol

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:18.480
but it doesn't use fructose for energy, so you doesn't get any of those CNS symptoms because it doesn't get there

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.770
so let's consume the same number of calories as alcohol,

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:25.820
now most of 'em go to the liver, instead of going to the periphery

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.200
and what happens to it? You see glycogen anywhere?

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:35.060
No glycogen, it bypasses glycogen and goes down to the mitochondria, and since there's so much of it

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:42.310
you get big time fat making, and some of it won't make it out, now you got that lipid droplet, that's alcoholic steatohepatisis

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:46.310
and you're gonna make lot's of triglycerides, and so you are gonna have hypertriglyceridemia

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:49.460
and that's gonna end up in the muscle, now you've got muscle insulin resistance

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:53.020
and it serves as a substrate for weight gain as well

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:57.550
and we also know that alcohol has this dis inhibiting effect on your brain

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:01.550
which causes you to drink more, "oh, I'm just gonna have one drink" and you end up with 5

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:06.170
and of course if you do that too often, maybe you'll live and become and alcoholic

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:08.880
and that's addiction right there, positive feedback effect

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.480
so here's a problem, because this is toxic

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.400
and abused, and so we regulate it

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.460
now let's do fructose, so we are gonna consume sugar now, we are gonna consume orange juice

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:28.040
same number of calories, but glucose does the same 20/80 split it did before, 12 and 48

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:35.110
but all the calories from fructose are gonna go to the liver, because only the liver has the transporter for fructose, called glut-5

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:39.510
and, you see glycogen anywhere? No glycogen

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:42.710
Go straight down to the mitochondria, just like alcohol did

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:48.310
and because there's so much of it, your mitochondria got no choice but to turn the excess into liver fat

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:53.110
there's your lipid droplet, so now you have non alcoholic steatohepatisis

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:56.130
you've got high triglycerides, just like you did with alcohol

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.060
you get the muscle insulin resistance, substrate for obesity

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:02.620
and it tells your insulin receptor not to work

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.710
so now you've got liver insulin resistance, which makes your pancreas have to make more insulin

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:12.000
in order to make the liver do it's job, now the high insulin goes to the brain, blocks leptin

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.860
and now you can't see your leptin, so what does it do? It makes you think you are starving

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.910
So what does it make you do? Consume more fructose

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:29.110
so now you've got a positive feedback effect between a compound that is toxic and abused

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:35.240
causing damage to the liver, damage to the pancreas eventually, and damage to the brain

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.860
but we don't do anything about that

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:45.600
you'd never think about giving your kid a beer, but you don't think twice about giving your kid a coke and they do the same thing

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.370
that's one problem, now there's a second problem

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:54.800
here are 5 photographs, what do they all have in common?

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.440
There's one thing they have all…, they're all

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:03.110
Brown! Good, thank you, they are all brown. This is the browning reaction

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:08.660
The Maillard reaction, anybody you know what HbA1c is?

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:13.510
That's the lab test they do for diabetics to see how they blood sugar control is

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:16.530
that's glucose binding to proteins in the blood

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:19.680
well, that's what this is, this is the Maillard reaction

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.710
glucose binding to proteins in the actual food

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:30.040
so the common link is this browning, or Maillard reaction, or non enzymatic glycation

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.170
so here's the deal, you can think of it this way

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:36.800
you can roast your meat at 375 degrees for an hour

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.660
or you can roast your meat at 98.6 degrees for 75 years

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:43.640
the answer is the same, ok? We all brown

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:49.200
it's part of aging, it's normal aging, and everyone does it, the question is how fast do you do it?

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:54.750
And if you don't believe me, here's just an example, here's newborn rib cartilage nice and white

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:58.660
and here's 88 year old rib cartilage nice and brown

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.820
and if you had orange juice this morning you are browning faster

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:06.000
that's the deal, and we know it, we know it's true

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.080
because every time this reaction occurs you release a hydrogen peroxide

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:16.000
and that hydrogen peroxide does damage inside the cell, unless it's quenched by an antioxidant

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.130
and if you don't take enough antioxidants, you're gonna do damage, and that's what non alcoholic steatohepatisis is

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:25.550
so here's that reaction, here's the aldehyde of glucose

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:29.770
and it binds to the amino group of lysine of the hemoglobin molecule

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:38.440
forms what is known as a shift base, which then… decomposes and develops this mid linkage here

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:43.910
and bottom line is, it's non enzymatic and happens all the time, the question is how much?

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:50.970
and this shows that it's very very specific to fructose in terms of a mapped ?

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:58.480
so this is a animal model of non alcoholic fatty liver disease, called the methionine choline deficient rat

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.910
the MCD rat, not the McDonald's rat, but it might as well be

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:09.370
because what happens is, when you give the animal sugar or starch with normal amounts of methionine choline

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:11.600
no problem, the liver can handle it

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.000
but if you're deficient, which happens when you have a bad diet

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.680
then only sugar causes the problem

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:27.420
starch doesn't, and you can see here in a non alcoholic fatty liver disease clinic

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:30.800
at Duke University, this is Dr. Manal Abdelmalek's work

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.660
showing that the grade of steatosis or fatty liver is dependent on

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:37.820
the…&nbsp;how much fructose consumption, whether it's daily or not

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.570
and the stage of fibrosis same thing

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:44.000
Ok, so two problems:

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.330
fatty liver and cell aging

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:51.820
so far, so good? All right, so now we are gonna get into the weeds

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.420
so here are the 10 most obese states in the nation

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.260
Anybody surprised? Anybody from any of them?

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:02.170
I used to live in Memphis, you know what I'm talking about, right?

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:07.680
North Carolina, you know what I'm talking about, right, …it's those ribs, yeah, I know [laughter]

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.950
10 most obese states, here are the 10 laziest states in the nation

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:16.750
What's going on over there in Nevada?

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:21.510
I guess you can only burn so much energy going like this

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:26.000
Here are the 10 most unhappy states in the nation

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.240
Here's the adult diabetes rate

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.910
Here's the adult heart disease rate

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:39.730
And finally here is soda per capita soda consumption, now what you see?

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:43.640
Pretty significant overlap, wouldn't you say? Ya?

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.930
Well now this is correlation, not causation

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:50.400
and I'm very clear on the difference, we are gonna talk about the difference, ok?

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.200
So the question is which direction does it go?

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.750
Is it that soda causes heart disease and diabetes

00:52:56.750 --> 00:53:00.400
or is it that people with heart disease and diabetes like to drink soda?

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.350
You can't tell

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:07.150
'cause it's one snapshot in time, you can't tell which way the data went

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.620
True

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.020
Here's what happening world wide

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:14.710
So this is global consumption of sugar and sugar crops

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:19.150
here we are at 629 calories availability here in blue

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:27.680
and here's the rest of the world. Now the American Heart Association says 150 to 200 calories in added sugar per day, right? Here this color, blue

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.370
How many countries are above that? How about all of them?

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:36.220
In fact that's why diabetes is skyrocketing everywhere

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:41.460
So here's world sugar consumption tripling over the past 50 years

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.730
Per capita consumption, notice Brazil

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:46.260
Brazil used to be a poor country

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.620
they were always a sugar exporter

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.710
but they couldn't afford their own sugar

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:53.600
but now they can because they are a BRIC country, right? They sell

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:58.570
? jets, and biodiesel, and you know like… world cup… you know, all that stuff

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:05.730
and the fact is that Brazil now has the highest increase in rate of prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the world

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:13.680
doesn't have the highest prevalence, that's reserved for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Malasia

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:19.420
Why them? Why do they have the highest diabetes rates in the world?

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.620
No alcohol, no alcohol

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.440
But they got soft drinks like they are going out of style, why? 'Cause it's hot,

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.420
and the watter supply is a question mark,

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:34.220
and NO ALCOHOL! This is their reward

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:39.770
Now the difference is, alcohol, for lack of a better word, is self limiting

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:44.310
because you end up under the table

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:50.620
but soft drinks? You can drink them all day, right? And they do

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.880
And that's why they have diabetes, now

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.770
how do I know that the sugar ¡cause the diabetes?

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:59.150
Because correlation is not causation but we have causation too

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:03.020
and this is our work, just came out 3 months ago, very proud of it

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:06.750
Sanjay Basu, one of my colleagues at Standford Prevention Institute,

00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.440
took 4 databases and melded them together

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.220
we took the Food and Agriculture Organization or FAO statistics database

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.600
from the World Health Organization

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:18.570
which for the whole decade, 2000 to 2010

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:21.240
which has food supply as total calories

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:28.170
foods excluding wine, oils, roots, tubers, pulses, nuts and vegetables, meat, cereals, and sugar, sugar crops and sweeteners

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:30.080
as separate items

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:34.750
we then linked that to the International Diabetes Federation statistics database

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:37.910
for diabetes prevalence worldwide, for the decade

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:41.680
and then we linked that to the World Bank Gross National Income database to control for

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.620
GDP, urbanization and aging

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:48.260
and then we linked that to a physical activity database, to control for physical inactivity

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.820
and we asked the question: what about the world's diet

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:57.600
predicts diabetes prevalence change over time worldwide?

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.710
That was our question, everybody with me? Ok

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:04.930
So here's what we did, 204 countries, we had complete data for 154,

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:11.550
the 50 that we did not use were no different from the 154 by a very fancy set of statistics

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:15.770
we did a lot of statistics, this is called an econometric analysis

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:21.730
now a standard, percent vs percent, would be called an ecological analysis

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:25.730
this is not an ecological analysis, this is an econometrical analysis

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:31.680
this actually won 2 economists Nobel Prizes for being able to predict stock market crashes

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.750
ok, based on what's happening before, to predict what happens after

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:40.570
ok? Cause there is causation inference in this

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:44.840
Generalized estimating equations with a conservative fixed effects approach, called the Hausman test,

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.820
a hazard model to control for selection bias called the Heckman test,

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:51.370
this is the important one, since we had the whole decade

00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:54.800
we didn't have a snapshot, we had the movie

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:59.330
and you can learn a whole lot more from a movie, than you can from a snapshot, can't you

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:04.930
that's called the Granger causality test, because we can determine what came first

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:09.600
'cause you can't infer causation if something didn't come first, right?

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.750
Proximate cause, you need proximate cause

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:20.040
and period effects to control for secular trends, so we did all of this really really neat statistical analysis and Sanjay Basu is an absolute genius

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:26.620
and what we did was a control for GDP, obesity, urbanization aging and physical activity

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:33.640
so the question was, is it the obesity or is it something specific in the food supply? That was the question

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:41.460
So, during the decade diabetes prevalence rose from 5.5 to 7 percent world wide, not good

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:48.970
and here's the effects model: sugar, sugar plus controls plus period, bottom line, remember that diamond that can't cross the identity line?

00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:51.860
well, it doesn't, it's very significant

00:57:51.860 --> 00:58:00.440
in fact, for every 100 calories you increase your diabetes prevalence worldwide by 0.8%

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:06.000
and here's the adjusted associated when you took all the factors into account between sugar availability

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.640
and diabetes prevalence

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:11.150
here's what you need to take home, this is the take home slide

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:18.970
only changes in sugar availability predicted those changes in diabetes prevalence worldwide, only

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:22.930
if you consumed a 150 calories extra per day,

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:30.040
in total calories, diabetes prevalence only went up by 0.1%, pffft, nothing

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.240
but if those 150 calories happen to be a can of soda

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:36.440
diabetes prevalence went up eleven fold

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:43.150
1.1%, and we are not consuming one can of soda per day, we are consuming two and a half

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:44.970
so that's 2.4%

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:48.040
given that American diabetes rates are 8.3%

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:54.750
that means that 26% of all diabetes in America today is due to sugar and sugar alone

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:58.800
not due to obesity, not due to total calories, sugar and sugar alone

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:05.150
You wanna do something? You want something actionable? You want something that's gonna change how much money we spend

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:09.770
so we can salvage Medicare? Here it is,

00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:15.550
and of course our government is doing absolutely nothing, ok?

00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:21.680
Our data show that 25% of diabetes worldwide is explained by sugar

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.550
and more importantly, this is causation

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:31.150
because these data meet what's known as the Bradford Hill, the Austin Bradford Hill criteria

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:34.530
for what we call causal medical inference

00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:39.200
now, what does that mean, it means that

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.730
you can show dose effect

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:46.260
you can show duration effect, of sugar on diabetes,

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.330
and you can show most importantly directionality

00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:53.420
that is, those countries where sugar went up showed an increase in diabetes rates

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:58.000
those countries, the few of them, where sugar went down showed decreased diabetes rates

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.930
and precedence, 3 year time differential

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:05.640
so every country when their sugar went up

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:09.550
3 years later you saw the change in diabetes, in either direction

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:13.680
that's causal medical inference, now

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.150
it's not scientific proof, so there are different kinds of proofs

01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:21.910
there is anecdotal data, which of course is absolute garbage and you can't do anything with that

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.440
because an N of 1 means nothing

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:28.880
then there's correlation, but correlation suffers from this directionality question

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.530
which came first, 'cause it's a snapshot and you can't tell,

01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:37.420
then there's this thing called causal medical inference, we're gonna talk about that right now

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.910
and then there's this thing called scientific proof that everybody keeps harping on

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:48.350
so, in medicine today, what percentage of what we know

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:55.510
is scientifically based, evidence based, scientific proof, randomized control trials?

01:00:55.510 --> 01:01:02.660
That's the standard. How much of what we know, what percent of what we know today, is due to scientific proof, what do you think?

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:10.260
Wanna give me a percentage? 10, 10? 10% of what we know is due to randomized controlled trials

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:14.350
that means 90% of what we know is causal medical inference

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:18.800
so here's the question, what level of proof do you need?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.200
You tell me. Who here believes in global warming?

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.260
Why? Got any proof?

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:31.600
Causal inference

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:37.240
Can you randomize a controlled trial and show me that that's what's going on? No

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:42.750
Who here believes that football trauma causes Alzheimers?

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:48.530
How come? You got proof?

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:55.280
Causal inference. Who here believes that tobacco causes lung cancer?

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.310
How come? You got proof?

01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:04.130
Who's done the randomized controlled trial where you take naive people

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:08.530
and expose them to cigarette smoke for the next 50 years and see what their lung cancer rates are?

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:12.660
Number 1, it would be too expensive, number 2, it would be damn unethical, wouldn't it?

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.020
In fact most of these studies would be damn unethical

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:19.280
You ever think we are gonna get the actual scientific studies, the scientific proof

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.310
for sugar causing diabetes? Number 1, nobody's got a zero baseline,

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:29.640
nobody's naive, number 2, this is something that happens over 40, 50, 60 years

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:35.150
how are you going to keep people on the same diet for that long

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:40.710
and how are you gonna figure out what they actually ate when we can't even figure it out after one day

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:45.280
Ok? And don't you think that would be a little unethical? To do that to people?

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.550
You'll never get these data, but of course, the food industry says:

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:52.350
"Well, we don't have the data, we need more research"

01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:55.550
We always need more research, of course we need more research,

01:02:55.550 --> 01:03:00.220
the question is, do we have enough proof to act?

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:04.130
Them saying "we need more proof" is them moving the goalposts

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:07.460
because we'll never get enough proof for them

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:10.350
the question is, what do you think? Do you think we have enough?

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:14.930
We have causal medical inference for sugar and diabetes, do we have enough?

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:18.400
It's for you to decide, ok?

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:24.880
Ok, addictive, the last piece of this

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:31.550
Bingeing on high-calorie foods may be as addictive as cocaine or nicotine, and could cause compulsive eating and obesity according to a study, ok

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:35.950
So here are all these books that came out on obesity, and addiction, and reward,

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:38.840
you know, they are all popular books, ok?

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:44.530
based on no data, but what do you think? You think that science could catch up to this?

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:49.020
So here's neuroimaging studies, PET scanning,

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:54.930
of dopamine receptors, dopamine is the feel-good neurotransmitter, the pleasure neurotransmitter in the reward center here

01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:59.680
so here's a control brain with nice hot dopamine receptors, which is good

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.570
and here's a cocaine brain where they've been damped down

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:07.550
This is the neuroanatomic equivalent of the phenomenon of tolerance

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:11.280
Ok? Because dopamine down regulates its own receptor, so

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.060
once this happens you need more substrate to get the same effect, that's called tolerance

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:21.510
Ok? And then of course when you withdraw it, now you get withdrawal and you get symptoms, everybody with me?

01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:25.330
Well here's a control brain, and here's an obese brain, what do you see?

01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:29.550
Same thing, not quite as bad, but same concept

01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:35.510
So here's the reward system, here's the ventral tegmental area here, where the dopamine neurons live

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:40.220
and here's the nucleus Accumbens, where the dopamine information gets received

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.600
and so how fast this gets transduced

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.930
has everything to do with what level of reward you achieve

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:51.860
with any given stimulus, whether be power or gambling, or shopping or

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:56.710
cocaine or alcohol, or for that matter, sugar

01:04:56.710 --> 01:05:00.400
and this just shows what happens, so here's that dopamine neuron

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.820
and you see it's going blip, blip, blip, right?

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:10.040
So you add nicotine, blip blip blip blip blip blip, you get more reward, that's basically what we are talking about, that's why people start smoking

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.420
and then of course the dopamine receptors go down and they can't stop smoking, that's addiction

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:20.570
If an food readout… a food intake is a readout of reward

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:25.820
'cause here's injecting morphine into the reward center

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:29.150
and you can see that as the morphine goes up the food intake goes up

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:32.880
because food intake is a readout of reward

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.770
and you can see that all the reward centers are all linked together

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:42.570
into the nucleus accumbens, including the hypothalamus, which is the starvation area,

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:44.880
the amygdala, which is the fear area,

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:49.020
and of course the reward area, so hunger, reward and stress

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.020
all reasons to eat

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:55.460
and they all conspire against us all at the same time

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.730
so when we see a patient in our clinic

01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:02.620
that's the question we ask ourselves, is this patient obese because they are hungry?

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.880
and I know what to do about that

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:10.660
or is this patient obese because of the reward system, it's defective?

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:15.510
and they are addicted? That's a lot harder to deal with, but we know how to do that too

01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:19.680
Or is this person eating because of stress?

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.240
Which is enormous problem, especially in America

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:28.440
And that one is really a hard one, because it's not the stress, it's the response to stress

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:32.480
So if you think you are stressed, you are stressed, whether you are or not

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.770
and most kids today are stressed like never before

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:39.060
and you know what stresses them the most?

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:44.530
Facebook

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:49.510
And this is going on in every animal, see us humans right there, big dopamines there

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:53.860
receptors here, when obese, dopamine receptors go down

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.730
here are Bonnet macaques, same thing, and here are rats, same thing

01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:01.370
bottom line, obesity means downregulation of dopamine receptors, which means

01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:06.170
you need more food to get the same level of reward, or you might as well crawl in a hole and die

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:07.600
ok, that's what it's all about

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.310
So these people are eating because their brain says they have to

01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:17.510
So, the question is, is fast food addictive? What do you think?

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:23.420
Yes? No? Ok, so we actually looked at that question

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:25.420
So everybody familiar with this book?

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:30.440
Michael Moss put this out, "Salt, sugar, fat, how the giants hooked us", right?

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.060
This is wrong, this is a mistake

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.770
'Cause there is one thing not on the list

01:07:35.770 --> 01:07:35.820
What's missing?
'Cause there is one thing not on the list

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:38.530
What's missing?

01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:40.130
Caffeine

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:45.280
Now we've got fast food! Ok, salt, sugar, fat and caffeine, right?

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.480
So the question is, of these four which are addictive?

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.460
Let's talk about salt. Is salt addictive?

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.330
No, it's not addictive

01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:56.620
In humans the threshold is physiologically fixed

01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:59.110
higher levels are attributable to preference

01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:02.400
but you can alter that preference, lot's of people do

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.530
specially when they have to go low salt for some reason

01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:10.080
and we know because we take care of a disease in endocrinology called "salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia"

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.510
were their kidneys are losing salt non stop

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:17.280
but when we give them the salt retaining hormone that works in the kidney called aldosterone

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.860
their salt intake goes way down

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:22.080
and if they were addicted that wouldn't happen

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.060
so when we fix their physiology their

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:31.420
preference gets a lot better. So salt? Not addictive.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.970
Now let's take fat. Is fat addictive? What do you think?

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:39.370
Nope, rodents binge but show no signs of dependence, and humans

01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:43.680
they always bing on high fat high carb or high sugar

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:50.880
items, like pizza and icecream, you don't binge on high fat per se, otherwise the Atkins diet would have everybody addicted and they'll tell you

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:55.200
you know they are losing weight, how could they lose weight if they are all addicted?

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.950
Energy density actually has a stronger association with obesity and metabolic syndrome than fat does

01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:04.440
so, fat? Not addictive

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.350
So we are left with these two

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:09.280
Caffeine? Oh man, caffeine is addictive

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:13.950
and if you take my Starbucks away from me I'll kill you

01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:17.110
model drug of dependence, gateway drug in fact

01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:23.600
dependence show in children, adolescence, adults, 30% who consume it meet the DSM criteria for dependence

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.930
and physiological addiction is well established with the headache, and the test performance, and everything else

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:30.840
Mega addictive, ok?

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.110
But d'you see anybody going out and regulating Starbucks or Pits or anything like that?

01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:37.770
Why? Because it's not toxic

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:42.660
It's addictive, but not toxic, unless you mix it with alcohol and then you got something called four loco

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:45.200
and that we are banning, everybody got it?

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.060
So when it's toxic and addictive we ban it or we regulate it

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:52.130
And so, caffeine and alcohol together that's a bad deal

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:56.840
but caffeine alone? Keep your hands of my Starbucks, ok

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:59.730
So caffeine? Yes, addictive

01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:04.080
Ok, that leaves this one. Sugar, is sugar addictive? What do you think?

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.280
You know, we've known this for a long time, because, anybody know what this is?

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.550
It's called "sweeties", "sweeties"

01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:19.420
This is a super concentrated sucrose, sugar solution, that you dip the pacifier in

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:24.310
and you put in the newborn baby boy's mount before you do the the circumcision

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:27.910
because it releases opioids and deadens the pain

01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:30.570
and this has been known forever

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:35.460
Ok? Then you mix it with a little wine and then you got a really good cocktail, eh?

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:41.510
So is there really such a thing as sugar addiction, we have to look for similarities to other drugs of dependence like nicotine, morphine, amphetamine, cocaine,

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:43.600
the one I think is most appropriate is alcohol

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:49.150
because after all alcohol and sugar are basically metabolized the same way, because after all where do you get alcohol from?

01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:51.370
Fermentation of sugar, it's called wine

01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:53.860
right? We do it every day, up in Sonoma

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.260
the big difference between alcohol and sugar is that

01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:00.660
for alcohol the yeast does the first step of metabolism called glycolysis

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:03.110
for sugar we do our own first step, but after that

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:06.080
when the mitochondria see it it doesn't matter where it came from

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.950
and that's the point, and that's why they both cause the same diseases

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:12.400
and they do the same thing to the brain

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.440
so for the criteria for addiction in animals are bingeing,

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.550
withdrawal, craving,

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:24.260
and then there is one down here called cross-sensitization with other drugs of abuse, that means

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:28.660
that if you expose an animal to one drug of abuse, like cocaine

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:30.570
for 3 weeks and addict them

01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:35.150
and then you expose them to a second drug they've never seen before, like say amphetamine

01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:38.130
they're addicted to the amphetamine even though they'd never seen it before

01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:43.510
because the dopamine receptors are already downregulated 'cause they are the same dopamine receptors, everybody got it?

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:46.750
Ok? And so, does sugar do this? Absolutely

01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:50.080
Q.E.D. slammed on, sugar is addictive in animals

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.130
What about humans? Who saw this movie?

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:57.330
Right? Did you like it?

01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:58.930
More or less?

01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:03.370
I've a big problem with this movie, because if you watch the movie

01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:06.350
his doctor, Morgan's doctor keeps saying:

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:11.640
"You gotta get off this high fat diet, high fat diet, high fat diet, high fat diet, high fat diet"

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.750
Not the high fat diet, it's the high sugar diet,

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:17.730
high sugar diet, that's what caused all the problems

01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:21.510
So, can sugar be addictive?

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:24.620
Watch. "I was feeling bad"

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:28.080
"In the car, feeling like…", sorry, "…really"

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.910
"I was feeling really, really"

01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:34.080
"sick and unhappy"

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.040
"started eating, feel great"

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.550
"feel really good now"

01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:41.730
"I feel so good as crazy"

01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:45.640
"Ain't that right baby? Yeah you're right darling"

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:48.260
This was on day 18, ok?

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:51.020
of his 30 day ? through McDonald's

01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:54.480
He just described withdrawal, that's withdrawal

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.260
and he needed another hit in order to feel good again

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:02.350
he just described withdrawal, he was a vegan, right? 'cause his girlfriend was a vegan chef

01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:05.680
and in 18 days he's a sugar addict

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:09.280
so, you tell me. So this is what we are dealing with

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.110
We are dealing with an industry that

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:21.060
wants us to consume its product, well gee, every industry wants us to consume their product in some fashion or another, the question is

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:24.570
what if it hurts you? What if it hurts you?

01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:29.020
So… this is an example, this is the Federal Trade Commision vs Sugar Information

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.710
back in 1972, this was an arm of the Sugar Research Association

01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:40.710
"The fat time of day you are really hungry and ready to eat two of everything, here's how sugar can help"

01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:43.280
Any data?

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.770
They are allowed to do… they can advertise any way they want, they are allowed

01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:50.570
How about this one, the birth of the un-cola

01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:54.880
"Why we have the youngest customers in the business" from 7up

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.170
You ok with that? And this is, you know this is going on

01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:03.770
How about this one, this was in Publix supermarket chain in Florida just a year ago

01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:08.530
"Drinks are on us! Publix is rewarding top grades with free apple juice and soda. Students"

01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:11.110
"we salute your thirst for knowledge"

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.530
Well, the American Heart Association gets it

01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:20.310
and I'm a proud member of the American Heart Association

01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:24.620
because they get it, the high fat hypothesis has been debunked

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:30.080
and they have taken it back, 2010 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Krauss et al, ok?

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.260
But this is dietary sugar intake in cardiovascular health

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:37.600
I was a coauthor of this, and very proud to have been so

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.170
and we recommend a reduction in sugar consumption from 22 teaspoons of added sugar per day

01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:45.420
down to either 9 for males or 6 for females

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.620
that's a reduction by two thirds to three quarters

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:52.530
How we gonna do that? How we gonna ever accomplish that?

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:58.170
Especially since we don't even know we are consuming it

01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:05.280
Because only 1/3 of our total added sugar intake comes from sugar sweetened beverages, like soda, juice, sport drinks

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.820
1/6 comes from things we that call desserts, you know, candy, icecream, things like that

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.680
that means one half of our sugar consumption is hidden

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:19.150
in foods that we didn't even know had sugar, like salad dressing, yogurt is a big one

01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:22.750
Anybody here yogurt is healthy?

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:27.680
I got a bridge to sell you

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:33.330
Plain yogurt? Sure! You wanna take some whole fruit and mix it with plain yogurt like they do in Europe?

01:15:33.330 --> 01:15:37.550
No problem! Off you go, ok? But

01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:42.660
processed yogurt? You know, the stuff they are selling on the shelves of the supermarket?

01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:46.530
Take a look, just take a look at the amount of sugar

01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:49.910
Now it's total sugar, so some of it is lactose, which is milk sugar

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:54.800
the question is, how much of it is lactose and how much of it is added sugar

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.800
You can't know. You are not allowed to know.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.950
'Cause the food industry won't let you know

01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:06.660
Because in 1989 the food industry lobbied the Food and Drug Administration

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:11.020
when they were coming out with the nutrition labeling and education act of 1990, and they said:

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:14.930
"If we told our consumers, our customers"

01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:19.460
"how much added sugar we put in each of our processed foods"

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:22.480
"our competitors could duplicate our recipes"

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:27.240
"this is proprietary information and you are not allowed to know it"

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.130
and you know what the FDA said?

01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:34.930
"Eh… ok, sure". That just shows

01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:40.400
Here's what you need to know, of the 600000 items in the American grocery store today

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.680
80% of them are spiked with added sugar

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:48.710
and that's not for our purposes, that's for the industry's, 'cause they know when they add it

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:51.550
you buy more

01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:54.350
for all the reasons that we've just discussed

01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:57.860
and worse yet, there are 56 names for sugar

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:02.220
and you don't know them, and you are not allowed to know them

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:06.080
so, does anybody what florida crystals are?

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.350
Sugar, anybody know what evaporated cane juices

01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:13.950
If you evaporate cane juices what do you get? You get sugar, ok?

01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:16.080
And so that's what they use in yogurt, because

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:21.150
"Oh, cane juice must be healthy, right? Oh, came… juice from cane, right?"

01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:27.240
So here's how your food dollars have been bastardized and reallocated for you

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:31.110
Meats, this is 1982, 30 years ago, here's 2012

01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:35.240
Meats down 10%, because of that little fat directive

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.770
Fruits and vegetables? The same

01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:41.950
so everybody says eat your fruits and vegetables, you know what? We are eating just as much as we were before

01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:48.170
Grains and baked goods, 13 to 14%, everybody says it's all the carbohydrate, it's all up a little bit

01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:54.880
Dairy products, 13 down to 10%, because now everyone is lactose intolerant

01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:00.440
Processed foods and sweets, 11.6 - 22.9

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.770
a doubling in 30 years, that's what's happened

01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:09.280
that's the change, and that's what we are talking about tonight

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.640
because processed foods is high sugar, low fiber

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:17.640
and real food is low sugar, high fiber

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:25.820
and every diet that works is low sugar, high fiber, because every diet that works is real food

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:30.170
that's what this is about, this is a processed foods disaster

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:32.930
but the food industry is making money of it

01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:34.840
in fact, lots of it

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:38.880
because here is the S&amp;P 500 over the last 5 years

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.860
Ok? Here's the economic downturn of 2008 right here

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:45.820
and here's the stock price of Mc Donald's, Coke and Pepsi, they are doing very well, thank you

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:51.730
and here's General Mills, Hormel, ConAgra, Kraft, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Archer Daniels Midland, and

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:55.770
I said Hormel I think already, bottom line, they are all doing better than the S&amp;P

01:18:55.770 --> 01:19:00.220
Wanna make money? Invest in a food company, 'cause they have a winning formula

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:03.600
for getting you to eat more

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.840
so, back to that first law, remember?

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.730
It's not about common sense, it's about the science

01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:13.460
so let's restate it, let's reframe the argument

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:19.330
If you are gonna store it, that is an obligate weight gain due to energy deposition

01:19:19.330 --> 01:19:24.000
the most obvious of which is high insulin, and you know where that came from,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.440
and you expect to burn it, that is normal energy expenditure for normal quality of life

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.460
because energy expenditure and quality of life are synonymous

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:35.820
things that make your energy expenditure go up make you feel good, like a ? off the market

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:38.570
caffeine, for two hours, exercise,

01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:42.840
things that make your energy expenditure go down make you feel lousy

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.440
hypothyroidism, starvation

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:51.550
so, if you gonna store it, energy deposition, and you expect to burn it

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:54.400
then you have to eat it, same first law

01:19:54.400 --> 01:20:00.710
but now reinterpreted based on the science, not the common sense

01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:04.800
because the aberrant behaviors are the result our biochemistry

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.600
and our biochemistry is a result of our changed environment

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:15.280
and the only way we are gonna fix it, is to change the environment back

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:19.860
so, here's a list of diseases

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:23.280
everyone of these was a personal responsibility disease

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:27.600
until the sheer weight magnitude and gravity, and the money that went into it

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:32.800
made it very clear that it was a public health crisis instead

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.860
and here are some more newer ones

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:40.970
and these are very clearly personal responsibility diseases, right?

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:45.510
except they are not, they are public health crises, how about this one down here?

01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:51.110
What do you think about guns? San Francisco so I know what you think about guns, but

01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:56.400
John Howard, the Australian Prime Minister

01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:04.480
perhaps the most conservative politician in the last 100 years in any country

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:09.330
banned assault weapons in Australia, back in the late 90s

01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:13.460
and he was on CNN about two months ago, and they asked him: "I mean, how could you do that?"

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:20.170
"A conservative… you know, politician, how could… libertarian, how could you ban guns", and he said:

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:24.130
"Look, this is not a democratic issue, this is not an republican issue"

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:29.640
"This is not a liberal issue, this is not a conservative issue, this is a public safety issue"

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.530
That's exactly right, even he got it,

01:21:32.530 --> 01:21:34.660
even he got it, but we don't get it,

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:39.680
well this is a public safety issue, because we will have no Medicare

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:43.460
So the questions I'm gonna leave you with, I've two homework assignments for you

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:48.530
Can our toxic food environment be changed without governmental or societal intervention?

01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:51.820
Especially when there are potentially addictive substances involved

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:56.350
Has education worked for any substance of abuse?

01:21:56.350 --> 01:22:01.600
Not one, did Nancy Reagan just said "No work"?

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:08.000
Does the Surgeon General's warning on a pack of cigarettes stop people from smoking

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.370
No, the thing that stop people from smoking was second hand smoke

01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:16.930
when your smoking affected me

01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:19.420
that's when we started getting legislation

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:23.910
and then the tobacco documents came out and we realized there was corporate malfeasance involved

01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:26.220
that's when things changed

01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:29.820
but not one lick of education made any difference

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:35.730
in the amount of tobacco consumed, and Stan Glance ? right here at UCSF showed that very nicely

01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:39.680
Second question: can we afford to wait?

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:43.150
The food industry will say "we need more research"

01:22:43.150 --> 01:22:47.280
"We need more research", of course they're gonna say we need more research, it's moving the goalposts

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:56.800
Can we afford to wait, to enact these public health measures, when health-care will be bankrupt due to chronic metabolic disease in just 13 short years?

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.860
That's your homework assignment

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:03.280
So, this is my second to last slide

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:09.820
This is a paper that just came out in Lancet, in March

01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:17.200
"Profits and pandemics: prevention of harmful effects of tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food and drink food industries"

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.370
And what it says is, that what we used to practice was called the old medicine

01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:27.510
and we focused on infections as the problem and microbes as the vectors

01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:31.060
and now the new medicine is all about chronic disease

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:36.710
and the vector has changed, it is now multinational corporations instead

01:23:36.710 --> 01:23:38.400
that's who we're battling

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:43.460
so for further reading I refer you to a whole bunch of academical articles

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:53.060
and more academical articles,

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:58.080
and finally, non academic, if you choose to pick it up

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:03.020
"Fat chance" which was written for the public, but really to be honest with you, I wrote it for doctors

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:07.280
my publisher says "You cannot write a book for doctors, we won't publish it", I said "Ok, fine"

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.880
"I'll write it for the public"

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.840
but I really wrote it for doctors because the whole medical profession has to change

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:18.130
and the problem is they bought the bill of goods that the industry was selling

01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:23.550
and we gotta fix it, because a calorie is not a calorie, it never was and never will be

01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:23.680
so, lastly we have started a non profit
and we gotta fix it, because a calorie is not a calorie, it never was and never will be

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:27.950
so, lastly we have started a non profit

01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:32.880
very specifically to provide medical nutrition and legal analysis

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:38.440
and consultation to promote personal and public health against Big Food

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.910
called the Institute for Responsible Nutrition, there is our website

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:46.350
and contact me if you'd like any more information

01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:51.240
So I wanna thank my collaborators, here at UCSF, the Weight Assessment for Teen and Child Health Clinic

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:59.550
were we do the actual on the ground, you know boots on the ground, changes in people's lives to actually make kids better

01:24:59.550 --> 01:25:04.350
Stanford Prevention Institute, my colleague Sanjay Basu who is an absolute genius

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:11.150
Touro University, my colleague Jean-Marc Schwarz who is a card carrying fructose biochemist and vetted all the biochemistry on this

01:25:11.150 --> 01:25:16.620
Kathleen Mulligan at the UCSF Clinical Translational Sciences Institute, who is my right hand

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:19.150
Berkeley Department of Nutritional Sciences,

01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:24.880
and also my colleagues Claire Brindis and Laura Schmidt at the Institute for Health Policy Studies, here at UCSF as well.
