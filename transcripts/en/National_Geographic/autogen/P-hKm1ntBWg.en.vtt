00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 align:start position:0%
and I think that's why Hasan has gone to
 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
and I think that's why Hasan has gone to
lie<00:04:24.009><c> where</c><00:04:24.280><c> he</c><00:04:24.490><c> has</c><00:04:24.699><c> I</c><00:04:25.030><c> think</c><00:04:25.690><c> his</c><00:04:26.169><c> patch</c><00:04:26.410><c> where</c>

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 align:start position:0%
lie where he has I think his patch where
 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
lie where he has I think his patch where
he<00:04:26.770><c> was</c><00:04:26.979><c> initially</c><00:04:27.370><c> has</c><00:04:28.120><c> got</c><00:04:28.330><c> quite</c><00:04:28.599><c> warm</c><00:04:28.930><c> and</c>

when she saw it in Ghana from afar and
ran<00:09:49.420><c> and</c><00:09:50.140><c> so</c><00:09:50.260><c> it's</c><00:09:50.380><c> gonna</c><00:09:50.470><c> be</c><00:09:50.560><c> a</c><00:09:50.589><c> bit</c><00:09:50.709><c> tricky</c><00:09:50.740><c> to</c>

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.010 align:start position:0%
ran and so it's gonna be a bit tricky to
 

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.010 align:start position:0%
ran and so it's gonna be a bit tricky to

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
one of them will be on a man somewhere
 

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
one of them will be on a man somewhere
with<00:09:55.000><c> a</c><00:09:55.029><c> bit</c><00:09:55.180><c> of</c><00:09:55.209><c> shade</c><00:09:55.510><c> and</c><00:09:55.540><c> we'll</c><00:09:55.870><c> get</c><00:09:56.050><c> lucky</c>

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:56.230 align:start position:0%
with a bit of shade and we'll get lucky
 

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.840 align:start position:0%

so that's the kind of plan for the
 

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of plan for the

00:31:32.539 --> 00:31:35.409 align:start position:0%
shade and then there's a bit of light on
the<00:31:32.809><c> leaves</c><00:31:33.019><c> and</c><00:31:33.350><c> so</c><00:31:33.950><c> win</c><00:31:34.159><c> and</c><00:31:34.369><c> kudu</c><00:31:35.029><c> is</c><00:31:35.149><c> behind</c>

00:31:35.419 --> 00:31:37.570 align:start position:0%
the leaves and so win and kudu is behind

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:39.950 align:start position:0%
see there helps to break at the outline
 

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.100 align:start position:0%

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:42.110 align:start position:0%
of this kudu so what that means is it
 

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.989 align:start position:0%
of this kudu so what that means is it
basically<00:31:42.320><c> makes</c><00:31:42.860><c> it</c><00:31:42.950><c> very</c><00:31:43.100><c> difficult</c><00:31:43.369><c> to</c><00:31:43.700><c> see</c>

00:31:43.989 --> 00:31:43.999 align:start position:0%
basically makes it very difficult to see
 

00:31:43.999 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%

they are going to find a nice port and
 

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
they are going to find a nice port and

that one with a ball you can see so
let's<00:36:45.250><c> see</c><00:36:45.430><c> maybe</c><00:36:45.700><c> he's</c><00:36:45.940><c> gonna</c><00:36:46.090><c> manage</c><00:36:46.420><c> to</c>

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
let's see maybe he's gonna manage to
 

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
let's see maybe he's gonna manage to
find<00:36:46.780><c> this</c><00:36:47.050><c> one</c><00:36:47.230><c> with</c><00:36:47.770><c> a</c><00:36:47.800><c> ball</c><00:36:48.070><c> here</c><00:36:48.430><c> then</c><00:36:49.150><c> we</c>

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:49.330 align:start position:0%
find this one with a ball here then we
 

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
find this one with a ball here then we
might<00:36:49.480><c> see</c><00:36:49.780><c> another</c><00:36:50.260><c> look</c><00:36:50.800><c> it's</c><00:36:51.040><c> coming</c>

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:51.250 align:start position:0%
might see another look it's coming
 

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.490 align:start position:0%
might see another look it's coming
towards<00:36:51.640><c> that</c><00:36:51.820><c> direction</c><00:36:51.940><c> look</c><00:36:52.870><c> at</c><00:36:52.990><c> that</c><00:36:53.140><c> the</c>

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:53.500 align:start position:0%
towards that direction look at that the

00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
we've got are potentially tin goddess

tracks from this morning before he
crossed<00:50:01.119><c> over</c><00:50:01.239><c> but</c><00:50:01.779><c> I</c><00:50:01.809><c> think</c><00:50:02.140><c> the</c><00:50:02.289><c> ones</c><00:50:02.440><c> from</c>

00:50:02.609 --> 00:50:02.619 align:start position:0%
crossed over but I think the ones from
 

00:50:02.619 --> 00:50:03.809 align:start position:0%
crossed over but I think the ones from
tandy<00:50:02.859><c> they</c><00:50:03.099><c> look</c><00:50:03.249><c> like</c><00:50:03.369><c> they're</c><00:50:03.549><c> on</c><00:50:03.609><c> top</c><00:50:03.789><c> of</c>

00:50:03.809 --> 00:50:03.819 align:start position:0%
tandy they look like they're on top of
 

00:50:03.819 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
tandy they look like they're on top of
his<00:50:04.150><c> and</c><00:50:04.420><c> so</c><00:50:04.869><c> maybe</c><00:50:05.140><c> she's</c><00:50:05.440><c> come</c><00:50:05.680><c> back</c><00:50:05.890><c> to</c><00:50:06.069><c> all</c>

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:06.190 align:start position:0%
his and so maybe she's come back to all
 

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:08.549 align:start position:0%
his and so maybe she's come back to all
they<00:50:06.549><c> the</c><00:50:06.759><c> lumber</c><00:50:07.059><c> was</c><00:50:07.210><c> and</c><00:50:07.569><c> his</c><00:50:07.930><c> going</c><00:50:08.170><c> to</c><00:50:08.349><c> try</c>

00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%

and<00:50:08.769><c> see</c><00:50:08.920><c> if</c><00:50:08.950><c> she</c><00:50:09.130><c> can</c><00:50:09.220><c> pick</c><00:50:09.430><c> her</c><00:50:09.579><c> up</c><00:50:09.730><c> so</c><00:50:09.910><c> I'm</c>

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:09.970 align:start position:0%
and see if she can pick her up so I'm
 

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.849 align:start position:0%

00:50:38.009 --> 00:50:38.019 align:start position:0%
see if we get this right so I'm sure we
 

00:50:38.019 --> 00:50:41.069 align:start position:0%
see if we get this right so I'm sure we
can<00:50:38.259><c> eventually</c><00:50:39.160><c> but</c><00:50:39.759><c> they</c><00:50:40.390><c> track</c><00:50:40.660><c> so</c><00:50:40.809><c> just</c><00:50:40.960><c> on</c>

00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
can eventually but they track so just on
 

00:50:41.079 --> 00:50:42.390 align:start position:0%
can eventually but they track so just on

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
the left hand side yeah I think it's
 

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
the left hand side yeah I think it's
you'll<00:50:42.789><c> see</c><00:50:43.029><c> them</c><00:50:43.239><c> in</c><00:50:43.720><c> the</c><00:50:43.930><c> sand</c><00:50:44.230><c> now</c><00:50:44.619><c> that</c>

00:50:44.819 --> 00:50:44.829 align:start position:0%
you'll see them in the sand now that
 

00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
you'll see them in the sand now that
looks<00:50:45.009><c> like</c><00:50:45.130><c> ton</c><00:50:45.640><c> these</c><00:50:45.999><c> track</c><00:50:46.329><c> that</c><00:50:46.480><c> we've</c>

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:46.630 align:start position:0%
looks like ton these track that we've
 

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.509 align:start position:0%
looks like ton these track that we've

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
strikes maybe there you can just see it
up<00:51:00.850><c> front</c><00:51:01.120><c> and</c><00:51:01.330><c> in</c><00:51:01.450><c> this</c><00:51:01.600><c> one</c><00:51:01.780><c> that's</c><00:51:01.990><c> close</c><00:51:02.200><c> to</c>

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
the car as well over there so that looks
 

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.030 align:start position:0%
