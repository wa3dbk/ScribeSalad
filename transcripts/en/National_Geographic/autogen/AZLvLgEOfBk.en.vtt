what it's supposed to look like in
 

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.710 align:start position:0%
what it's supposed to look like in

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.170 align:start position:0%
flight right so this is what the the the

image when I search images that's in
flight<00:40:23.420><c> now</c><00:40:23.630><c> we</c><00:40:23.690><c> managed</c><00:40:24.140><c> to</c><00:40:24.170><c> while</c><00:40:24.950><c> we</c><00:40:25.190><c> were</c>

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:25.340 align:start position:0%
flight now we managed to while we were
 

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.700 align:start position:0%
flight now we managed to while we were
kind<00:40:25.640><c> of</c><00:40:25.760><c> doing</c><00:40:26.420><c> things</c><00:40:26.870><c> managed</c><00:40:27.260><c> to</c><00:40:27.410><c> get</c><00:40:27.530><c> one</c>

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:27.710 align:start position:0%
kind of doing things managed to get one
 

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
kind of doing things managed to get one
in<00:40:27.860><c> flight</c><00:40:28.100><c> so</c><00:40:28.280><c> that's</c><00:40:28.460><c> a</c><00:40:28.550><c> shot</c><00:40:28.730><c> that</c><00:40:28.850><c> I</c><00:40:28.940><c> got</c><00:40:29.150><c> of</c>

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:29.330 align:start position:0%
in flight so that's a shot that I got of
 

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.210 align:start position:0%
in flight so that's a shot that I got of
this<00:40:29.450><c> bird</c><00:40:29.690><c> in</c><00:40:29.870><c> flight</c><00:40:30.020><c> the</c><00:40:30.650><c> one</c><00:40:30.800><c> we</c><00:40:30.950><c> just</c><00:40:30.980><c> saw</c>

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:31.220 align:start position:0%
this bird in flight the one we just saw
 

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bird in flight the one we just saw
taking<00:40:31.640><c> off</c><00:40:31.760><c> and</c><00:40:31.970><c> to</c><00:40:32.090><c> me</c><00:40:32.210><c> they</c><00:40:32.630><c> look</c><00:40:32.870><c> very</c><00:40:32.900><c> very</c>

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:33.530 align:start position:0%
taking off and to me they look very very
 

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:36.490 align:start position:0%
taking off and to me they look very very
very<00:40:34.220><c> similar</c><00:40:34.630><c> and</c><00:40:35.630><c> so</c><00:40:35.870><c> I</c><00:40:35.900><c> think</c><00:40:36.020><c> it</c><00:40:36.380><c> is</c>

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:36.500 align:start position:0%
very similar and so I think it is
 

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
very similar and so I think it is
actually<00:40:36.740><c> very</c><00:40:37.190><c> special</c><00:40:38.090><c> eagles</c><00:40:38.360><c> so</c><00:40:38.450><c> that</c>

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:38.570 align:start position:0%
actually very special eagles so that
 

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.870 align:start position:0%
actually very special eagles so that
should<00:40:38.720><c> be</c><00:40:38.750><c> a</c><00:40:38.840><c> lifer</c><00:40:39.170><c> for</c><00:40:39.350><c> many</c><00:40:39.530><c> of</c><00:40:39.710><c> you</c><00:40:39.890><c> now</c>

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.360 align:start position:0%

I'll<00:40:41.120><c> make</c><00:40:41.450><c> 100%</c><00:40:41.810><c> sure</c><00:40:42.050><c> and</c><00:40:42.320><c> send</c><00:40:42.500><c> it</c><00:40:42.650><c> off</c><00:40:42.770><c> just</c>

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:43.370 align:start position:0%

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:45.350 align:start position:0%
to double-check but I think that we
 

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:46.570 align:start position:0%

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:21.530 align:start position:0%
going to happen is this should sweep in
 

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:23.530 align:start position:0%
going to happen is this should sweep in

kind of and come along this escarpment
 

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.300 align:start position:0%
kind of and come along this escarpment
it<00:50:23.900><c> often</c><00:50:24.170><c> does</c><00:50:24.350><c> so</c><00:50:24.530><c> it</c><00:50:24.620><c> often</c><00:50:24.860><c> comes</c><00:50:25.070><c> along</c>

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:25.310 align:start position:0%
it often does so it often comes along
 

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:27.130 align:start position:0%

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
then kind of rain along here and if it

anything the other thing is that you're

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:47.570 align:start position:0%
difficult to see and so the Lions then
 

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:49.060 align:start position:0%
difficult to see and so the Lions then
utilize<00:50:47.990><c> that</c><00:50:48.230><c> to</c><00:50:48.350><c> the</c><00:50:48.440><c> advantage</c><00:50:48.830><c> it</c><00:50:48.920><c> also</c>

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:49.070 align:start position:0%
utilize that to the advantage it also
 

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
utilize that to the advantage it also
gets<00:50:49.250><c> a</c><00:50:49.310><c> lot</c><00:50:49.430><c> darker</c><00:50:49.670><c> and</c><00:50:49.910><c> so</c><00:50:50.150><c> they</c><00:50:50.300><c> blend</c><00:50:50.540><c> in</c><00:50:50.750><c> a</c>

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:50.810 align:start position:0%
gets a lot darker and so they blend in a
 

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:52.570 align:start position:0%
gets a lot darker and so they blend in a
little<00:50:50.990><c> bit</c><00:50:51.110><c> better</c><00:50:51.230><c> and</c><00:50:51.620><c> that</c><00:50:52.130><c> could</c><00:50:52.340><c> be</c><00:50:52.460><c> the</c>

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:52.580 align:start position:0%
little bit better and that could be the

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
going to line it up so that we can get
 

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:30.809 align:start position:0%
going to line it up so that we can get
this<00:53:30.549><c> right</c>

00:53:30.809 --> 00:53:30.819 align:start position:0%
this right
 

00:53:30.819 --> 00:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
this right
so<00:53:31.359><c> I</c><00:53:31.390><c> don't</c><00:53:31.569><c> know</c><00:53:31.630><c> how</c><00:53:31.749><c> long</c><00:53:31.930><c> our</c><00:53:32.019><c> rainbow</c><00:53:32.289><c> is</c>

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:32.470 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how long our rainbow is
 

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:34.829 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how long our rainbow is
going<00:53:32.680><c> to</c><00:53:32.799><c> last</c><00:53:32.979><c> so</c><00:53:33.400><c> to</c><00:53:33.759><c> try</c><00:53:34.119><c> now</c><00:53:34.359><c> while</c><00:53:34.630><c> we've</c>

00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
going to last so to try now while we've
 

00:53:34.839 --> 00:53:36.989 align:start position:0%
going to last so to try now while we've

00:53:36.989 --> 00:53:36.999 align:start position:0%
got it's visible and if you guys can
 

00:53:36.999 --> 00:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
got it's visible and if you guys can
actually<00:53:37.119><c> see</c><00:53:37.539><c> it</c><00:53:37.630><c> it's</c><00:53:37.809><c> very</c><00:53:38.229><c> faint</c><00:53:38.589><c> in</c><00:53:38.920><c> the</c>

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:39.130 align:start position:0%
actually see it it's very faint in the
 

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:41.519 align:start position:0%
actually see it it's very faint in the
background<00:53:39.309><c> there</c><00:53:39.880><c> so</c><00:53:40.089><c> kind</c><00:53:40.450><c> of</c><00:53:40.509><c> going</c><00:53:40.809><c> over</c>

00:53:41.519 --> 00:53:41.529 align:start position:0%
background there so kind of going over
 

00:53:41.529 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
background there so kind of going over
the<00:53:41.559><c> left-hand</c><00:53:42.069><c> line</c><00:53:42.279><c> it's</c><00:53:42.519><c> is</c><00:53:43.059><c> where</c><00:53:43.329><c> that</c>

00:53:43.559 --> 00:53:43.569 align:start position:0%
the left-hand line it's is where that
 

00:53:43.569 --> 00:53:47.729 align:start position:0%
the left-hand line it's is where that
rainbow<00:53:43.809><c> will</c><00:53:44.170><c> roughly</c><00:53:44.499><c> be</c><00:53:46.109><c> there</c><00:53:47.109><c> it</c><00:53:47.259><c> is</c><00:53:47.410><c> this</c>

00:53:47.729 --> 00:53:47.739 align:start position:0%
rainbow will roughly be there it is this
 

00:53:47.739 --> 00:53:49.410 align:start position:0%
rainbow will roughly be there it is this
so<00:53:48.069><c> money</c><00:53:48.309><c> is</c><00:53:48.519><c> trying</c><00:53:48.819><c> to</c><00:53:48.940><c> kind</c><00:53:49.059><c> of</c><00:53:49.180><c> get</c><00:53:49.299><c> it</c>

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:49.420 align:start position:0%
so money is trying to kind of get it
 

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
so money is trying to kind of get it
it's<00:53:49.599><c> not</c><00:53:49.720><c> bright</c><00:53:50.079><c> bright</c><00:53:50.410><c> bright</c><00:53:50.440><c> but</c>

00:53:52.739 --> 00:53:52.749 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will brighten up and
 

00:53:52.749 --> 00:53:54.539 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will brighten up and

00:53:54.539 --> 00:53:54.549 align:start position:0%
strengthen a little bit and then don't
 

00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
strengthen a little bit and then don't
you<00:53:54.640><c> think</c><00:53:54.670><c> it</c><00:53:54.940><c> will</c><00:53:55.029><c> be</c><00:53:55.089><c> absolutely</c>

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:51.610 align:start position:0%
and then it just started to kind of
 

01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
and then it just started to kind of
develop<01:18:51.880><c> and</c><01:18:52.150><c> we</c><01:18:52.210><c> just</c><01:18:52.420><c> slightly</c><01:18:52.750><c> positioned</c>

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:53.290 align:start position:0%
develop and we just slightly positioned
 

01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
develop and we just slightly positioned

01:18:57.330 --> 01:18:57.340 align:start position:0%
of get it right so we can actually think
 

01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:58.890 align:start position:0%
of get it right so we can actually think

01:19:00.930 --> 01:19:00.940 align:start position:0%
this all kind of into the right space
 

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:03.390 align:start position:0%
this all kind of into the right space
but<01:19:01.120><c> for</c><01:19:01.570><c> me</c><01:19:01.659><c> that</c><01:19:01.690><c> was</c><01:19:01.870><c> absolutely</c><01:19:02.830><c> beautiful</c>

01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
but for me that was absolutely beautiful
 

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.209 align:start position:0%
but for me that was absolutely beautiful
I'm<01:19:03.969><c> hoping</c><01:19:04.480><c> the</c><01:19:05.380><c> way</c><01:19:05.560><c> the</c><01:19:05.710><c> wind</c><01:19:05.920><c> is</c><01:19:06.100><c> blowing</c>

I'm hoping the way the wind is blowing
 

01:19:06.219 --> 01:19:09.570 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping the way the wind is blowing
we<01:19:06.580><c> might</c><01:19:06.969><c> might</c><01:19:07.739><c> just</c><01:19:08.739><c> squeak</c><01:19:09.040><c> out</c><01:19:09.250><c> of</c><01:19:09.429><c> this</c>

01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:09.580 align:start position:0%
we might might just squeak out of this
 

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.970 align:start position:0%
we might might just squeak out of this
and<01:19:09.909><c> get</c><01:19:10.659><c> lucky</c><01:19:11.110><c> and</c><01:19:11.199><c> not</c><01:19:11.350><c> get</c><01:19:11.530><c> ruit's</c>

01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:11.980 align:start position:0%
and get lucky and not get ruit's
 

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.129 align:start position:0%
and get lucky and not get ruit's
I<01:19:12.070><c> somehow</c><01:19:13.060><c> don't</c><01:19:13.420><c> think</c><01:19:13.719><c> it's</c><01:19:13.870><c> going</c><01:19:14.080><c> to</c>

01:19:14.129 --> 01:19:14.139 align:start position:0%

I somehow don't think it's going to

so I wonder because where we are now
 

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:29.470 align:start position:0%
so I wonder because where we are now
could<01:31:23.540><c> very</c><01:31:24.050><c> well</c><01:31:24.140><c> be</c><01:31:24.590><c> the</c><01:31:27.850><c> window</c><01:31:28.850><c> of</c><01:31:28.970><c> pride</c><01:31:29.180><c> I</c>

could very well be the window of pride I
 

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
could very well be the window of pride I
mean<01:31:29.780><c> we</c><01:31:29.960><c> know</c><01:31:30.080><c> the</c><01:31:30.110><c> pride</c><01:31:30.350><c> that</c><01:31:30.560><c> could</c><01:31:30.860><c> be</c>

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:31.010 align:start position:0%
mean we know the pride that could be
 

01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:33.250 align:start position:0%
mean we know the pride that could be
here<01:31:31.250><c> as</c><01:31:31.400><c> well</c><01:31:31.640><c> so</c><01:31:32.210><c> it</c><01:31:32.510><c> might</c><01:31:32.630><c> even</c><01:31:32.840><c> be</c><01:31:32.960><c> one</c><01:31:33.080><c> of</c>

01:31:33.250 --> 01:31:33.260 align:start position:0%
here as well so it might even be one of
 

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:36.370 align:start position:0%
here as well so it might even be one of
them<01:31:33.440><c> that's</c><01:31:33.950><c> around</c><01:31:34.310><c> which</c><01:31:34.610><c> is</c><01:31:35.380><c> intriguing</c>

01:31:36.370 --> 01:31:36.380 align:start position:0%
them that's around which is intriguing

touch it to activate that smell and

02:32:32.490 --> 02:32:34.130 align:start position:0%
of comes out and it will go down and
it's<02:32:32.640><c> very</c><02:32:32.790><c> sticky</c><02:32:33.030><c> and</c><02:32:33.300><c> it</c><02:32:33.600><c> will</c><02:32:33.750><c> pull</c><02:32:33.930><c> out</c>

02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
it's very sticky and it will pull out
 

02:32:34.140 --> 02:32:36.020 align:start position:0%
it's very sticky and it will pull out
those<02:32:34.650><c> little</c><02:32:34.979><c> insects</c><02:32:35.370><c> and</c><02:32:35.520><c> bring</c><02:32:35.729><c> them</c><02:32:35.910><c> back</c>

02:32:36.020 --> 02:32:36.030 align:start position:0%
those little insects and bring them back
 

02:32:36.030 --> 02:32:37.700 align:start position:0%
those little insects and bring them back
into<02:32:36.210><c> the</c><02:32:36.360><c> mouth</c><02:32:36.510><c> and</c><02:32:36.990><c> they'll</c><02:32:37.140><c> in</c><02:32:37.320><c> feed</c><02:32:37.590><c> off</c>

02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:37.710 align:start position:0%
into the mouth and they'll in feed off
 

02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:39.500 align:start position:0%
into the mouth and they'll in feed off
that<02:32:37.740><c> and</c><02:32:38.100><c> so</c><02:32:38.220><c> that's</c><02:32:38.430><c> probably</c><02:32:38.610><c> why</c><02:32:39.030><c> this</c><02:32:39.090><c> one</c>

02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:39.510 align:start position:0%
that and so that's probably why this one
 

02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:41.570 align:start position:0%
that and so that's probably why this one
is<02:32:39.540><c> out</c><02:32:39.840><c> today</c><02:32:40.050><c> after</c><02:32:40.890><c> the</c><02:32:40.979><c> bit</c><02:32:41.100><c> of</c><02:32:41.190><c> rain</c><02:32:41.370><c> that</c>

02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
is out today after the bit of rain that

02:32:44.060 --> 02:32:44.070 align:start position:0%

going to going to show the soils can be

02:32:51.890 --> 02:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
move slightly so you can see if maybe we
 

02:32:51.900 --> 02:32:54.170 align:start position:0%
move slightly so you can see if maybe we
can<02:32:51.990><c> just</c><02:32:52.229><c> get</c><02:32:52.380><c> a</c><02:32:52.590><c> view</c><02:32:53.130><c> of</c><02:32:53.190><c> any</c><02:32:53.550><c> Lions</c><02:32:54.030><c> that</c>

02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:51.610 align:start position:0%
gonna go round a little bit so that we
 

02:33:51.610 --> 02:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
gonna go round a little bit so that we
can<02:33:51.760><c> see</c><02:33:51.970><c> a</c><02:33:52.000><c> bit</c><02:33:52.180><c> better</c><02:33:53.010><c> so</c><02:33:54.010><c> we're</c><02:33:54.160><c> a</c><02:33:54.220><c> little</c>

02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:54.310 align:start position:0%
can see a bit better so we're a little
 

02:33:54.310 --> 02:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
can see a bit better so we're a little
bit<02:33:54.460><c> higher</c><02:33:54.730><c> than</c><02:33:55.030><c> what</c><02:33:55.360><c> the</c><02:33:55.990><c> grass</c><02:33:56.230><c> is</c><02:33:56.530><c> we</c>

02:33:57.060 --> 02:33:57.070 align:start position:0%
bit higher than what the grass is we
 

02:33:57.070 --> 02:33:58.920 align:start position:0%

should<02:33:57.310><c> be</c><02:33:57.340><c> able</c><02:33:57.490><c> to</c><02:33:57.730><c> see</c><02:33:58.030><c> a</c><02:33:58.300><c> little</c><02:33:58.750><c> bit</c>

02:33:58.920 --> 02:33:58.930 align:start position:0%
should be able to see a little bit
 

02:33:58.930 --> 02:34:00.570 align:start position:0%
should be able to see a little bit

02:40:46.929 --> 02:40:46.939 align:start position:0%
so there was I think at one point there
 

02:40:46.939 --> 02:40:48.519 align:start position:0%
so there was I think at one point there
was<02:40:46.999><c> six</c><02:40:47.239><c> of</c><02:40:47.329><c> them</c><02:40:47.510><c> but</c><02:40:47.659><c> like</c><02:40:48.079><c> I</c><02:40:48.140><c> said</c><02:40:48.199><c> we</c><02:40:48.409><c> had</c>

02:40:48.519 --> 02:40:48.529 align:start position:0%
was six of them but like I said we had
 

02:40:48.529 --> 02:40:49.689 align:start position:0%
was six of them but like I said we had

02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:50.930 align:start position:0%
look like they were grooming each other
 

02:40:50.930 --> 02:40:54.550 align:start position:0%
look like they were grooming each other
and<02:40:51.289><c> it</c><02:40:51.399><c> couldn't</c><02:40:52.399><c> really</c><02:40:52.869><c> see</c><02:40:53.869><c> what</c><02:40:54.350><c> was</c>

02:40:54.550 --> 02:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
and it couldn't really see what was
 

02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:56.109 align:start position:0%
and it couldn't really see what was
actually<02:40:54.739><c> going</c><02:40:54.949><c> on</c><02:40:55.340><c> and</c><02:40:55.520><c> so</c><02:40:55.699><c> I</c><02:40:55.729><c> was</c><02:40:55.909><c> kind</c><02:40:56.090><c> of</c>

actually going on and so I was kind of
 

02:40:56.119 --> 02:40:57.670 align:start position:0%
actually going on and so I was kind of

02:40:57.670 --> 02:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
thinking to myself you know they
 

02:40:57.680 --> 02:40:59.500 align:start position:0%
thinking to myself you know they
grooming<02:40:58.100><c> quite</c><02:40:58.279><c> a</c><02:40:58.310><c> lot</c><02:40:58.489><c> and</c><02:40:58.669><c> then</c><02:40:58.760><c> I</c><02:40:58.850><c> some</c><02:40:59.479><c> of</c>

02:40:59.500 --> 02:40:59.510 align:start position:0%
grooming quite a lot and then I some of
 

02:40:59.510 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
grooming quite a lot and then I some of
them<02:40:59.689><c> started</c><02:40:59.930><c> to</c><02:40:59.959><c> leave</c><02:41:00.229><c> and</c><02:41:00.470><c> others</c><02:41:00.680><c> stayed</c>

02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:00.890 align:start position:0%
them started to leave and others stayed
 

02:41:00.890 --> 02:41:02.469 align:start position:0%
them started to leave and others stayed
behind<02:41:01.069><c> and</c><02:41:01.340><c> I</c><02:41:01.399><c> thought</c><02:41:01.550><c> no</c><02:41:01.850><c> there's</c>

02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
behind and I thought no there's
 

02:41:02.479 --> 02:41:04.210 align:start position:0%
behind and I thought no there's
something<02:41:02.779><c> wrong</c><02:41:02.989><c> here</c><02:41:03.260><c> because</c><02:41:03.619><c> lions</c>

02:41:04.210 --> 02:41:04.220 align:start position:0%
something wrong here because lions
 

02:41:04.220 --> 02:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
something wrong here because lions
typically<02:41:05.029><c> if</c><02:41:05.149><c> one</c><02:41:05.419><c> goes</c><02:41:05.689><c> they</c><02:41:05.989><c> may</c><02:41:06.169><c> all</c><02:41:06.319><c> start</c>

02:41:06.639 --> 02:41:06.649 align:start position:0%
typically if one goes they may all start
 

02:41:06.649 --> 02:41:09.819 align:start position:0%
typically if one goes they may all start
to<02:41:06.770><c> get</c><02:41:06.890><c> up</c><02:41:07.069><c> and</c><02:41:07.249><c> start</c><02:41:07.939><c> to</c><02:41:08.119><c> move</c><02:41:08.149><c> around</c><02:41:08.829><c> but</c>

02:41:09.819 --> 02:41:09.829 align:start position:0%
to get up and start to move around but
 

02:41:09.829 --> 02:41:13.779 align:start position:0%
to get up and start to move around but
yet<02:41:10.069><c> this</c><02:41:10.609><c> one</c><02:41:11.350><c> kind</c><02:41:12.350><c> of</c><02:41:12.439><c> a</c><02:41:13.399><c> lot</c><02:41:13.579><c> of</c><02:41:13.669><c> them</c>

02:41:13.779 --> 02:41:13.789 align:start position:0%
yet this one kind of a lot of them
 

02:41:13.789 --> 02:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
yet this one kind of a lot of them
stayed<02:41:13.999><c> behind</c><02:41:14.319><c> and</c><02:41:15.319><c> so</c><02:41:15.709><c> I</c><02:41:16.039><c> thought</c><02:41:16.909><c> to</c><02:41:16.970><c> myself</c>

02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:17.090 align:start position:0%
stayed behind and so I thought to myself
 

02:41:17.090 --> 02:41:19.210 align:start position:0%

you<02:53:23.579><c> can</c><02:53:23.789><c> actually</c><02:53:23.909><c> see</c><02:53:24.239><c> it</c><02:53:24.329><c> and</c><02:53:24.449><c> the</c><02:53:24.749><c> main</c>

you can actually see it and the main

reason why I wanted to actually move is
 

02:53:26.939 --> 02:53:29.510 align:start position:0%
reason why I wanted to actually move is
that<02:53:27.060><c> you</c><02:53:27.539><c> can</c><02:53:27.749><c> then</c><02:53:27.899><c> listen</c><02:53:28.169><c> to</c><02:53:28.469><c> it</c><02:53:28.589><c> and</c>

02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
that you can then listen to it and
 

02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:31.609 align:start position:0%
that you can then listen to it and

listening to a Pangolin sounds really
 

02:53:31.619 --> 02:53:33.559 align:start position:0%
listening to a Pangolin sounds really
odd<02:53:31.770><c> it's</c><02:53:32.489><c> not</c><02:53:32.669><c> that</c><02:53:32.819><c> they</c><02:53:32.939><c> call</c><02:53:33.209><c> or</c><02:53:33.419><c> make</c><02:53:33.539><c> a</c>

02:53:33.559 --> 02:53:33.569 align:start position:0%
odd it's not that they call or make a
 

02:53:33.569 --> 02:53:36.859 align:start position:0%
odd it's not that they call or make a
noise<02:53:33.810><c> but</c><02:53:34.109><c> when</c><02:53:34.259><c> these</c><02:53:34.379><c> guys</c><02:53:34.589><c> walk</c><02:53:34.909><c> um</c><02:53:35.909><c> they</c>

02:53:36.859 --> 02:53:36.869 align:start position:0%

02:53:40.459 --> 02:53:40.469 align:start position:0%
have the scraping sound as these kind of

have the scraping sound as these kind of

everything is okay it's not like I said
 

02:59:55.359 --> 02:59:57.030 align:start position:0%
everything is okay it's not like I said
it's<02:59:55.449><c> what</c><02:59:55.540><c> did</c><02:59:55.750><c> or</c><02:59:56.109><c> so</c><02:59:56.229><c> many</c><02:59:56.439><c> many</c><02:59:56.800><c> of</c><02:59:56.920><c> you</c>

02:59:57.030 --> 02:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's what did or so many many of you
 

02:59:57.040 --> 02:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
it's what did or so many many of you
might<02:59:57.220><c> have</c><02:59:57.340><c> thought</c><02:59:57.489><c> it</c><02:59:57.550><c> was</c><02:59:57.729><c> dead</c><02:59:57.939><c> but</c><02:59:58.090><c> let's</c>

02:59:58.260 --> 02:59:58.270 align:start position:0%
might have thought it was dead but let's
 

02:59:58.270 --> 02:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
might have thought it was dead but let's
just<02:59:58.390><c> give</c><02:59:58.540><c> it</c><02:59:58.630><c> a</c><02:59:58.689><c> chance</c>

02:59:59.160 --> 02:59:59.170 align:start position:0%
just give it a chance
 

02:59:59.170 --> 03:00:00.990 align:start position:0%
just give it a chance
it's<02:59:59.680><c> definitely</c><03:00:00.279><c> moved</c><03:00:00.580><c> a</c><03:00:00.729><c> little</c><03:00:00.850><c> bit</c>

03:00:00.990 --> 03:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's definitely moved a little bit
 

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.149 align:start position:0%
it's definitely moved a little bit
that's<03:00:01.210><c> the</c><03:00:01.569><c> first</c><03:00:02.229><c> sign</c><03:00:02.500><c> of</c><03:00:02.680><c> movement</c><03:00:02.800><c> we've</c>

03:00:03.149 --> 03:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
that's the first sign of movement we've
 

03:00:03.159 --> 03:00:05.969 align:start position:0%
that's the first sign of movement we've
had<03:00:03.460><c> since</c><03:00:04.029><c> we</c><03:00:04.180><c> first</c><03:00:04.390><c> spotted</c><03:00:04.869><c> it</c><03:00:04.989><c> now</c><03:00:05.739><c> come</c>

03:00:05.969 --> 03:00:05.979 align:start position:0%
had since we first spotted it now come
 

03:00:05.979 --> 03:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
had since we first spotted it now come

03:00:09.790 --> 03:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
maybe<03:00:10.450><c> it's</c><03:00:10.660><c> all</c><03:00:10.779><c> the</c><03:00:10.899><c> Matsu</c><03:00:11.399><c> and</c><03:00:12.399><c> it's</c>

03:00:12.599 --> 03:00:12.609 align:start position:0%
maybe it's all the Matsu and it's
 

03:00:12.609 --> 03:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
maybe it's all the Matsu and it's
listening<03:00:12.819><c> to</c><03:00:13.000><c> us</c><03:00:13.210><c> hopefully</c><03:00:13.420><c> now</c><03:00:14.380><c> we</c><03:00:15.310><c> will</c><03:00:15.490><c> if</c>

03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:16.330 align:start position:0%
listening to us hopefully now we will if
 

03:00:16.330 --> 03:00:18.269 align:start position:0%
listening to us hopefully now we will if
we<03:00:16.420><c> see</c><03:00:16.750><c> it</c><03:00:16.840><c> starting</c><03:00:17.200><c> to</c><03:00:17.229><c> kind</c><03:00:17.770><c> of</c><03:00:17.830><c> move</c><03:00:17.979><c> a</c><03:00:18.040><c> bit</c>

03:00:18.269 --> 03:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
we see it starting to kind of move a bit
 

03:00:18.279 --> 03:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
we see it starting to kind of move a bit
more<03:00:18.490><c> and</c><03:00:18.670><c> a</c><03:00:18.729><c> bit</c><03:00:18.760><c> more</c><03:00:18.910><c> then</c><03:00:19.689><c> eventually</c><03:00:20.020><c> we</c>

03:00:20.340 --> 03:00:20.350 align:start position:0%
more and a bit more then eventually we
 

03:00:20.350 --> 03:00:21.990 align:start position:0%
more and a bit more then eventually we
will<03:00:20.770><c> just</c><03:00:20.979><c> extend</c><03:00:21.220><c> the</c><03:00:21.460><c> show</c><03:00:21.609><c> a</c><03:00:21.640><c> little</c><03:00:21.910><c> bit</c>

03:00:21.990 --> 03:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
will just extend the show a little bit
 

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
will just extend the show a little bit
so<03:00:22.120><c> don't</c><03:00:22.270><c> worry</c><03:00:22.420><c> if</c><03:00:23.350><c> there</c><03:00:23.560><c> is</c><03:00:23.620><c> sign</c><03:00:23.830><c> of</c>

03:00:23.940 --> 03:00:23.950 align:start position:0%
so don't worry if there is sign of
 

03:00:23.950 --> 03:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
so don't worry if there is sign of
movement<03:00:24.279><c> or</c><03:00:24.370><c> not</c><03:00:24.430><c> going</c><03:00:24.640><c> to</c><03:00:24.760><c> cut</c><03:00:24.939><c> you</c><03:00:25.090><c> guys</c>

03:00:25.200 --> 03:00:25.210 align:start position:0%
movement or not going to cut you guys
 

03:00:25.210 --> 03:00:28.469 align:start position:0%
movement or not going to cut you guys
off<03:00:25.270><c> and</c><03:00:25.779><c> leave</c><03:00:26.439><c> you</c><03:00:26.560><c> there</c><03:00:26.800><c> so</c><03:00:27.120><c> hopefully</c><03:00:28.120><c> it</c>

03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
off and leave you there so hopefully it
 

03:00:28.479 --> 03:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
off and leave you there so hopefully it
will<03:00:28.600><c> unravel</c><03:00:29.020><c> but</c><03:00:29.319><c> definitely</c><03:00:29.950><c> little</c><03:00:30.160><c> sign</c>

03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:30.370 align:start position:0%
will unravel but definitely little sign
 

03:00:30.370 --> 03:00:33.150 align:start position:0%
will unravel but definitely little sign
of<03:00:30.399><c> movement</c><03:00:30.790><c> there</c><03:00:31.210><c> slowly</c><03:00:32.170><c> but</c><03:00:32.500><c> surely</c><03:00:32.529><c> it</c>

03:00:33.150 --> 03:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
of movement there slowly but surely it
 

03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
of movement there slowly but surely it
should<03:00:33.310><c> open</c><03:00:33.760><c> a</c><03:00:33.970><c> bit</c><03:00:34.529><c> now</c><03:00:35.560><c> Brent's</c><03:00:36.250><c> is</c><03:00:36.460><c> don't</c>

03:00:36.719 --> 03:00:36.729 align:start position:0%
should open a bit now Brent's is don't
 

03:00:36.729 --> 03:00:38.639 align:start position:0%

03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
struggling a little bit so I think he
 

03:01:15.040 --> 03:01:17.130 align:start position:0%
struggling a little bit so I think he
was<03:01:15.130><c> a</c><03:01:15.160><c> bit</c><03:01:15.279><c> hard</c><03:01:15.460><c> so</c><03:01:15.609><c> on</c><03:01:15.729><c> to</c><03:01:15.880><c> as</c><03:01:16.689><c> much</c><03:01:16.840><c> as</c><03:01:17.020><c> he</c>

03:01:17.130 --> 03:01:17.140 align:start position:0%
was a bit hard so on to as much as he
 

03:01:17.140 --> 03:01:18.980 align:start position:0%
was a bit hard so on to as much as he
probably<03:01:17.350><c> wouldn't</c><03:01:17.830><c> have</c><03:01:17.890><c> said</c><03:01:18.130><c> so</c><03:01:18.370><c> he</c><03:01:18.790><c> I</c>

03:01:18.980 --> 03:01:18.990 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have said so he I
 

03:01:18.990 --> 03:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have said so he I
think<03:01:19.990><c> you</c><03:01:20.710><c> know</c><03:01:20.830><c> there's</c><03:01:21.189><c> a</c><03:01:21.250><c> big</c><03:01:21.399><c> decision</c>

03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:21.670 align:start position:0%
