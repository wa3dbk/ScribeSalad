00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:12.445
( applause )

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.747 line:0%
Hey. Good evening.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.149 line:0%
Get your passports,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.484 line:0%
if you don't have with you
then just lay low in the boat

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.152 line:0%
and we're gonna cross

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:22.388
from Congo to Cameroon.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:26.158
<i>This is one of the last pristine
 wilderness in the world.</i>

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:28.394
<i> So, we're entering
 into this forest.</i>

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.464
<i> One of the largest snake
 on record is on this picture.</i>

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.498
<i> This is the forest floor,</i>

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:33.700
<i> what you've just seen
 from outside.</i>

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.800
<i> Can you find the snake?</i>

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.602
<i> If you find it,
 you're my guest, you know,</i>

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.304
<i> for a beer after the lecture.</i>

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.873
<i> So where is the snake?</i>

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.743
<i> It's very hard to find.
 It's up here.</i>

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.445
<i> I didn't touch the snake,
 I just went above.</i>

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.781
<i> And here you see the head</i>

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.217
<i>and the body it just disappears
 in the leaves.</i>

00:00:52.217 --> 00:00:54.654
<i> It's a huge animal.</i>
( audience gasping )

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:55.955
<i> It's the Gaboon Viper.</i>

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.558
<i> It's the snake which injects
 the most amount of venom,</i>

00:00:58.558 --> 00:00:59.892
<i> a spoonful,</i>

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.860
<i> and has the longest fang,</i>

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.163
<i> up to two inches long.</i>
( audience gasping )

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:07.300
<i>so, you definitely don't want to
 get bitten by one of these.</i>

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.268
And you know, globally

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.971
a 100,000 people die
from snakebite

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.339
and the only reason
why they're dying

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.574
because there is no
antivenom.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.776
We have the perfect technology
to make antivenom

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:20.013
but there is just no
money in some of these
tropical countries.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.615
So 100,000 people
die from snakebite.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.151
But let's go back.
Let's come back from Africa

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.185
here to the US.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.121
<i> And, this is Chicago.</i>

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.255
<i> And we're gonna go to the
 South Side of Chicago.</i>

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:32.291
<i>University of Chicago Hospital.</i>

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:35.128
<i> This patient
 just suffered a heart attack</i>

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.396
<i> the night before.</i>

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:39.432
<i> And his life has been saved
 by this snake.</i>

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.267
<i> This snake is a
 Pygmy Rattlesnake,</i>

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:44.703
<i> the source of a
 top heart attack medication.</i>

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:48.607
In the US, out of the top three
heart attack medications

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:51.243
two of them are coming
from snake venoms.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.680
So, it's a huge, huge impact.

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:57.382
Other than this two medication

00:01:57.382 --> 00:02:00.019
we have 20 different medicines

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:03.389
coming from animal venoms
for high blood pressure,

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:04.757
for cardiac failure,

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.859
for cancer and HIV pain,

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.262
top drug for diabetes.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.963
But still in nature

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:14.666
we have 20 million toxins
left unstudied,

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:16.969
in different spiders,
scorpions and so on.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.172
So, again it's not only snakes,

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.806
<i> it's sea anemones,</i>

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.775
<i> different sort of fishes,</i>

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.744
<i> amphibians,
 even some primates</i>

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:26.478
<i> have toxic secretions.</i>

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:28.481
<i>So what we do as pharmacologist</i>

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.284
<i> is we collect all of these
 venomous creatures</i>

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.752
<i> from all over the world,</i>

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:33.952
<i> we gather their toxins</i>

00:02:33.952 --> 00:02:35.487
<i> and we create toxin libraries,</i>

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:38.891
<i> and we screen that out of
 this massive toxin libraries</i>

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:41.226
<i> which one is the best match</i>

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:43.028
<i> for a target in the human body</i>

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:46.398
<i> because that can be
 a potential future medication.</i>

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:48.768
So, in the next few minutes
just bear with me

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.836
and I'm going to show you
what it takes

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:53.205
to go around the world and
collect these toxins

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.074
because actually the least risky

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.375
of the whole trip

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:57.543
is catching the snake.

00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:59.144
( audience laughter )

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:01.080
<i>So, this is the airport in Fiji</i>

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.848
<i> we landing and at least</i>

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:04.116
<i> somebody is waiting for us.</i>

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:05.384
( audience laughter )

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:08.153
<i> But sometimes we do end up
 in the wrong island.</i>

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:09.922
<i> And you know, here, you know,</i>

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:12.324
<i> my helper and I, you know,
 we find human skulls</i>

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:13.926
<i> instead of snake eggs</i>

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.727
<i> what we were looking for.</i>

00:03:15.727 --> 00:03:17.296
<i> This is in the Arabian desert</i>

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.598
<i> at the
 Saudi Arabia-Yemen border.</i>

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:21.233
<i> And if you follow the news
 you know that</i>

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:23.769
<i>Yemen is not really a safe place
 to travel.</i>

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.672
<i>So I ended up in a military camp</i>

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:26.839
<i> and rented Ahmed.</i>

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.008
<i> This is Ahmed, my bodyguard.</i>

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.043
<i> And he keeps an eye on me,
 you can see him,</i>

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:32.245
<i> you know,
 he's keeping an eye on me.</i>

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:33.512
And in exchange

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:35.081
I had to fed him with Khat,

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.482
which is a local narcotic

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.616
just to keep him high.

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:38.484
( audience laughter )

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.086
But...

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.387
what we did...

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:42.855
of course he was
watching my back,

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:45.991
but also what we did, we showed
pictures for the locals,
you know,

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:48.595
asking have you seen this snake
and so on.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:51.497
<i> You see a very prominent
 presence of the AK-47</i>

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:52.665
( audience laughter )

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:56.535
And there are lots of
military checkpoints in Yemen.

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:58.071
So, every time we cross one
they were asking,

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.239
"Are you American?"
And I said, "No".

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.273
"British?"
"No."

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:02.308
"Australian?"
"No."

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.742
And once they run
out of countries

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:05.277
I told them I am from Hungary.

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:06.679
Nobody ever heard of Hungary.

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:07.646
( audience laughter )

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:09.615
But, but...

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:12.017
everyone had a Nokia phone.

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:14.153
<i> So, I told him
 pop-up the Nokia phone,</i>

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.155
<i> because the Nokia
 was made in Hungary.</i>

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:18.157
( audience laughter )

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.660
So, since there is
not a single person

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.928
in the world who doesn't love
his mobile phone,

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:25.031
so I never ever had a problem
after that

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.665
at military check points
in Yemen.

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:28.935
( audience laughter )

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.170
<i> We are going
 a little bit closer to the US,</i>

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.706
<i> this is, this was just
 a couple of months ago.</i>

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:35.374
<i> The only way to get into
 the rain forest,</i>

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:37.843
<i> either you have to fly in
 or you take a boat.</i>

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:40.746
<i> As you can see here the
 dress code is pretty liberal.</i>

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:41.847
( audience laughter )

00:04:41.847 --> 00:04:45.785
<i> And, the TSA is not really
 in charge here</i>

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.787
<i> because this is a
 deadly blowgun.</i>

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.823
<i>So this is the Guaraní Indians'
 territory at the</i>

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:53.292
<i> Ecuadorian-Peruvian
 border zone.</i>

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:56.295
<i>And they're using these blowguns
 to hunt for monkeys.</i>

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:59.565
<i> But we ended up actually
 traveling with the dead tapir</i>

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:00.833
<i> killed by a jaguar.</i>

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.634
<i> And you know,
 fall into the water,</i>

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:05.771
<i> was rotting and bloated and
 floating on the river.</i>

00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:08.174
<i>So, we chopped it up this tapir</i>

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.342
<i> and this is how
 we continued our trip.</i>

00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:11.911
<i> But take a good look
 of this engine</i>

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.379
<i> because that engine
 was gone by the night.</i>

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.415
<i>It actually fall into the river.</i>

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:17.783
<i> So, I said, God this is great.</i>

00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:20.019
<i> You know, we are in the middle
 of the Amazon and you know,</i>

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.921
<i> this engine just
 falls into this river</i>

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:25.291
<i> and it is as you see it's not
 really crystal clear water.</i>

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.193
<i> So we were trying to
 recover the engine,</i>

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:29.996
<i> couldn't find it,
had to sleep on the river bank.</i>

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.464
<i> Next morning
we're trying to get the engine.</i>

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.600
<i> We're trying really,
 really hard.</i>

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.735
<i> It's pretty hopeless
 but you know, finally</i>

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.137
<i> we actually find it.</i>

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:40.506
<i> And made into the village,</i>

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:42.808
<i> the Guaraní village
 along with the tapir</i>

00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:44.844
<i> you know, he's cooked.</i>

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.480
<i> So the night is coming,
 so we've to consider
 our options.</i>

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.482
<i> And this is the
 typical campsites.</i>

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:52.518
<i> So, here is the--
 my hotel suite.</i>

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.986
<i> This is my bedroom,</i>

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:55.988
<i> this is my study
 and the kitchen.</i>

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.924
( audience laughter )
<i> I'm not picky.</i>

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:59.692
<i> I really sleep anywhere
 you know,</i>

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.727
<i> when the night is coming.</i>

00:06:01.727 --> 00:06:03.262
<i> Talking about cars,</i>

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:05.298
<i> I like to give ride
 for hitchhikers.</i>

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:06.532
<i> This is in Kenya,</i>

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:08.367
<i> the Kenya-Sudan border.</i>

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:09.735
<i>And you can see that this lady,</i>

00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:11.103
<i> this Kalenjin lady</i>

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:12.905
<i> she is all smiles here</i>

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:15.574
<i>and she's a little bit concerned
 on the right side.</i>

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.175
Well, the difference between
the two pictures

00:06:17.175 --> 00:06:19.045
that here I informed her that

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.213
she is sitting next to
13 vipers.

00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:22.248
( audience laughter )

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.184
<i> If you have some
 surgery background it helps,</i>

00:06:26.184 --> 00:06:28.020
<i> you know, to fix the puncture</i>

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.322
<i> in remote places in Africa.</i>

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:32.191
And sometimes we do stay

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:35.127
in hotels until we're
being kicked out
because of the snakes.

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:36.762
<i> And here you can see that</i>

00:06:36.762 --> 00:06:38.831
<i>this is in Yemen, back to Yemen.</i>

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:42.201
<i> And, just in case, the
 AK-47 is standing by.</i>

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:45.371
Alright, so, so we get there

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:47.105
we made friendship
with the locals

00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:49.141
and the military.

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:50.876
So let's,
let's look for some snakes.

00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:53.112
<i> Well, we have still
 other problems</i>

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:56.315
<i> like elephants. This is in the
 Congo basin rain forest again.</i>

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:57.916
<i> So, I was standing on
 a termite hill</i>

00:06:57.916 --> 00:06:59.718
<i> try to take a picture
 of this elephant,</i>

00:06:59.718 --> 00:07:01.854
<i> was eating the
 other part of this bamboo.</i>

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.389
<i> Then it came so close,</i>

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.358
<i> put up the four feet in
 the bottom of the termite hill</i>

00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:07.527
<i> and I was thinking,</i>

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:08.828
"God this is the end
of my life."

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:11.364
I mean it was literally like
a few feet from me.

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:12.932
So then my guide

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.467
who used to be a poacher

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.068
was standing
on the other termite hill

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:18.203
was whispering
something to the elephant.

00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:20.172
So then elephant turned away

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:22.775
and now I had courage to take
a picture of his behind.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.309
( audience laughter )

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:26.378
<i> This is in Solomon Islands,
 Australia.</i>

00:07:26.378 --> 00:07:28.413
<i> The crocodiles are
 a big problem.</i>

00:07:28.413 --> 00:07:30.516
<i> So this is the crocodile nest.</i>

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.551
<i>And the reason why the mother is
 just lunging out</i>

00:07:32.551 --> 00:07:34.653
<i> because I asked
 my field assistant,</i>

00:07:34.653 --> 00:07:36.489
<i> that's a technical term
 for girlfriend,</i>

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:37.923
<i> to check out</i>

00:07:37.923 --> 00:07:40.225
<i> what's happening
 in the crocodile nest.</i>

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:41.693
( audience laughter )

00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:43.829
So then you get into real
problem when you get

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:45.130
bitten by a snake.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.965
So, I was bitten six
times before.

00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:50.002
I had a Spitting Cobra
spat on my face,

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.336
venom.

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:53.038
And I am allergic to snake venom

00:07:53.038 --> 00:07:54.873
and to the snake antivenom.

00:07:54.873 --> 00:07:56.575
<i>This is my last time in Brazil.</i>

00:07:56.575 --> 00:07:59.044
<i> Of course I'm in good hands,
you know, the Brazilian ladies,</i>

00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:00.512
<i> but...</i>

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:03.215
<i> inside you know, I had all
 of this allergic reaction.</i>

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:05.617
Three friends of mine
passed away from snakebites,

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:07.452
so you have to be very careful.

00:08:07.452 --> 00:08:10.322
Anyway,
so after all of this risk taking

00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:12.091
you are in a position
to catch a snake.

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.692
<i> And this is how I did</i>

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:16.094
<i> close to 40 years ago
 back in Hungary.</i>

00:08:16.094 --> 00:08:18.497
<i> And this is what happened
 in Micronesia.</i>

00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:19.865
<i> So ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:22.000
<i> this is the moment
 why we traveling.</i>

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.803
<i> I'm holding
 200 toxins in my hand,</i>

00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:26.572
<i> which has never been studied</i>

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:29.241
<i> and we just don't know what
 kind of possible medications</i>

00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:31.443
<i> can be extracted from it.</i>

00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:32.812
<i> And this is how we
 get the venom.</i>

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.646
<i> We're getting in a form of
 a tissue samples,</i>

00:08:34.646 --> 00:08:37.249
<i> from the DNA we can recreate
 every single toxin,</i>

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:39.118
<i> and then we let the snake go.</i>

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:41.420
Sometimes
I do bring back live snakes

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.189
to the US and whenever I tell
the taxicab driver

00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:45.624
<i> what I got in the box</i>

00:08:45.624 --> 00:08:48.527
<i> those are end up my fastest
 rides from JFK to the city.</i>

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:49.795
( audience laughter )

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:54.066 line:0%
<i> And finally
 I mention the toxin libraries.</i>

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:57.002 line:0%
<i> So what you see here,
 this is a designer toxin.</i>

00:08:57.002 --> 00:08:58.804 line:0%
<i> A toxin which came from</i>

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:01.006 line:0%
<i> a toxin library like that.</i>

00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:03.241 line:0%
<i> And has a promising drug lead</i>

00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:06.111 line:0%
<i> for autoimmune disorders
 like multiple sclerosis</i>

00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:07.312 line:0%
<i> and rheumatoid arthritis.</i>

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:10.049
So, this is why we traveling.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.918
So, I'm finishing my talk with
this incredible creatures.

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:16.722
<i> They hold the key
 for future medications.</i>

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:19.357
<i> And this is the place
 where they live.</i>

00:09:19.357 --> 00:09:22.394
<i> This is the home of the snake,</i>

00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:24.029
<i> which give a medication,</i>

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:25.931
<i> which is one of the
 most successful</i>

00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:28.567
<i> in the history of
 entire medicine,</i>

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:31.770
<i> treating more than
 40 million patients worldwide.</i>

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.138
<i> This is the Iguazu Falls.</i>

00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:35.240
<i> So, next time when you go here</i>

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.176
<i>remember that behind this beauty</i>

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.944
you have these
incredible creatures

00:09:38.944 --> 00:09:40.379
and they can save your life.

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:41.613
Thank you.

00:09:41.613 --> 00:09:43.849
( applause )

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.786
