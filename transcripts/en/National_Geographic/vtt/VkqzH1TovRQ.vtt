[majestic music]

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:19.400
NARRATOR: Pula rules the forest,
the beating heart of the realm,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.533
her torn ear just
one of a decade's

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:34.166
worth of scars from battles
fought and battles won.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:41.867
Not born into royalty, Pula
works hard for her dominion.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.266
But her success is
marred by tragedy.

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:57.834
[suspenseful music]

00:00:57.834 --> 00:01:00.233

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.767
This season could be her final
chance to further her legacy.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.533
She will be strong and ready.

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:26.266
[squirrel chitters]

00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:33.834
The advantage of high
position in paradise--

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:40.834
there's always a seat
at the high table.

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:48.233
[dramatic music]

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.200
[animals groaning]

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.400
Sheer will earns this
humble-born her wealth.

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:56.700
A firm grip ensures
she keeps it.
