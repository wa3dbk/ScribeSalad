00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:04.904
( intro music )

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.703 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:39.272
Juliana: Today I would
like to invite you

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:42.141
on a journey to show
you not judgmentally

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.078
but why we shouldn't
keep wild animals

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.247
from wild species as pets.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.850 line:0%
Wildlife trafficking
globally encompasses

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.553 line:0%
many ways of exploiting wildlife

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.356 line:0%
as it was very well shown here.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.691
From the production
of souvenirs

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.592
to the creation in food items,

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:04.664
luck, religious charms,
fashion accessories.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:08.801
Substances to supply the drug
industry or cosmetic industry.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.637
Rare animals to supply
the international

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:14.239
pet trade for
collectors and zoos,

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.709
and the illegal wild pet trade.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:20.346
Brazilians have a strong
connection to nature.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.650
And as such, they love
to have wild animals

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.417
with them in their houses

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.087
as an accepted cultural trait.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:31.090
Throughout my country,
from urban centers

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.493
to the most remote rural areas,

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.529
the bucolic site of
a house displaying

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.698
cages without wild
animals is very common.

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:43.036
House owners display
their cages with pride

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.538
as they show their
love and admiration

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:48.074
for nature and the animals.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:51.377
They usually buy
these animals from

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.845
normal street markets.

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:55.514
They have no idea
about the relationship

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:57.483
with buying their dear animals

00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.119
with the poaching
and wildlife trafficking.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.056
As a good Brazilian
myself, I too have

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:05.892
a strong connection to nature.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:08.494
Since my early years,
I learned from my parents

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:10.763
a deep love, respect,
and admiration

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.798
for all living things.

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:16.068
I still miss my pet hen today.

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:19.239
I began learning about
wildlife trafficking in Brazil

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.710 line:0%
when I met the organization
SOS Fauna and their work.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.811 line:0%
I could not get over

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:28.013 line:0%
the ridiculous volume of animals

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:31.784
being illegally
collected, transported,

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:35.588
sold, and kept just
so that some people

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:39.058
could have their wild pets.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.293
As a good example,
as you see here,

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:44.330
this cargo was in just one truck

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.200
and it was carrying more
than 4,000 poached animals

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.169
to supply the pet trade.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.471
I had to do something.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.439
I just could not go home
and put my head to rest

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.208
on the pillow at night.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.977
I started volunteering
for the organization.

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:02.515
We don't have one estimate
from the government

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.750
and numbers are
very hard to come by

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.554
but let's try to make the
picture a little bit clearer.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:13.293
From 2002 to 2009,
federal triage facilities

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:16.261
received from collections,
deliveries, and seizures

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:21.701 line:0%
more than 307,000
animals altogether

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.670 line:0%
with a mean of
38,000 per year.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.806 line:0%
However, these numbers
may be even bigger

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:30.342 line:0%
as just the state
of São Paulo alone in 2006

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:33.346 line:0%
seized more than
30,000 animals.

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:37.116
Also, trying to use
scientific methodology

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.617
to try to estimate
these numbers,

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:40.419
two researches from
Brazil analyzed

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.188
eight street markets.

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:44.691
They concluded that
these markets alone

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.959
could be illegally
trading per year

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.762
more than 50,000 poached birds

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:54.167 line:0%
valued at 630,000
dollars per year.

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:59.405 line:0%
If we remember that Brazil
has over 5,000 cities

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:02.508 line:0%
and each one has at least
one of those markets,

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:05.678 line:0%
then we start to be able
to grasp about the volume

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.880 line:0%
that we are talking about.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.848
Withdrawing numerous animals

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:12.918
from a couple of species
from nature on a regular basis

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:15.521
has many consequences.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:19.024
The most obvious is
the lack of animal welfare.

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.360
These creatures endure
so much suffering

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.663
through violent collection
and transportation methods

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:27.266
and then endure
a lifetime captivity

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:30.169
without social interaction
or exercise.

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.072
Most times in places
which are humid, hot,

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:35.808
and without adequate
food sources.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:39.278
But there are more
profound consequences.

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:43.115
I am risking a little bit of
an oversimplification here

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:44.750
but let's try to understand

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.453
what happens to the environment

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.389
when you take
animals and species

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.091
that have unique
ecological roles.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:56.429
Types of plants growing
in the ecosystem

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:59.865
will be altered if seed
predation rates change.

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:02.501
Also, if trees depend
on a specific species

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.269
to disperse their seeds,

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:07.572
they will have reduced
dispersal capacity.

00:05:07.572 --> 00:05:09.274
Also, the ecosystem will have

00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:11.911
decreased regeneration ability.

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.547
If predators are missing,

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:18.017
prey species may experience
explosion in populations

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:20.586
which can even become
pest to our agriculture.

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:23.255
On the other hand, when
prey species are missing,

00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:26.458
predators may experience
decrease in their
population sizes

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:29.628
which can effect
all connected species.

00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:32.965
Lastly, when less individuals
are left to reproduce,

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:36.101
this can lead to more
genetically similar populations

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.070
which in extreme cases
can even contribute

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.107
to the populations
or the species extinction.

00:05:43.008 --> 00:05:45.644
Some people, among
them some researchers

00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:47.080
who I respect very much,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.580
have proposed that
we do commercial

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.283
captive breeding of wild species

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:51.751
in order to supply demand

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:54.220
without exploiting nature.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.455
This obviously has
many advantages.

00:05:56.455 --> 00:05:58.958 line:0%
Yes, in theory it
could supply demand

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.160 line:0%
for wild animals as pets.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.462 line:0%
We could learn and
acquire precious knowledge

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:05.631 line:0%
on how to maintain
the species in captivity

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.334 line:0%
which could be used in
future conservation efforts.

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:11.537 line:0%
You could create an
industry with lots of jobs.

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:13.673 line:0%
However, there
are disadvantages.

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:15.574
Keeping wild animals
in captivity

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.676
is per se a source of suffering.

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:19.979
Also, being in a relevant
business could also

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.615
bring about many
political interests

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:25.317
and this would probably
shape our ultimate goal

00:06:25.317 --> 00:06:27.487
of conserving wild species.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:30.690
Lastly, when we do captive
breeding of wild animals

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.625
with commercial purposes,

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.727
it becomes very difficult

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:38.264
to promote effective control
and law enforcement
of this activity,

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:40.900
making it very easy
and profitable

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.501
to make poached animals

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.270
look like they were
bred in captivity,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.507
what we call bird laundering.

00:06:50.142 --> 00:06:52.644
There is an even worse problem.

00:06:52.644 --> 00:06:55.648
Honest breeders invest
great deals of time,

00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:57.083
money and resources

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.251
to obtain
a limited number of animals.

00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:01.920 line:0%
For example, a captive
bred Blue-Fronted Amazon

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.891 line:0%
can cost around
1,000 US dollars in Brazil.

00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:08.226 line:0%
Whereas a poached
animal from nature

00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:10.763 line:0%
will cost 40 dollars or less.

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.297
There are way fewer people

00:07:12.297 --> 00:07:14.333
willing to pay so much more.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:16.635
What happens is the
bigger consumer market

00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:19.705
will not buy the most
expensive animal.

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.208
These animals with
very different origins

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.809
and very different prices

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:26.512
will supply very different
consumer markets.

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:27.646
In my opinion

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:30.582
commercial captive breeding
of wild species will not--

00:07:30.582 --> 00:07:34.520
has not the ability
to supply the big demand.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.856
Another problem, and then
we start to the solutions.

00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:39.792
When animals which
were illegally traded

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.727
or kept are seized,

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:43.028
they have to go through

00:07:43.028 --> 00:07:45.630
a very complicated
rehabilitation process.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.202
And absolutely can not
be released anywhere

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:52.238
or we will cause more bad
impacts than good ones.

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:54.106
We have to make sure
they are healthy.

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:56.642
We have to make sure
they exhibit wild behaviors.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.543
We have to make
sure that the place

00:07:58.543 --> 00:08:00.612
where we are releasing
them is safe.

00:08:00.612 --> 00:08:02.047 line:0%
We don't want them
to be recollected

00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:03.682 line:0%
and back on the black market.

00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:05.384 line:0%
But it has to be
able to maintain

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:09.488 line:0%
the new individuals as well
as the natural populations.

00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:11.590 line:0%
They have to be released
in the same biome

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.759 line:0%
they were collected in
for adaptive reasons.

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:16.428 line:0%
Depending on the existence of

00:08:16.428 --> 00:08:19.731 line:0%
different genetic populations
within each species,

00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:21.934 line:0%
they must be released
as close as possible

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:23.970 line:0%
to their true
population of origin

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.105 line:0%
or we can cause
a severe decrease

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:28.674 line:0%
in the offspring's
adaptive potential,

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:32.177 line:0%
following mating with
the local population.

00:08:32.177 --> 00:08:35.447
I was fortunate
enough to find mentors

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:38.049
that fully supported my ideas.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.820
After so many "no's"
and "you are crazy's"

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.821
we decided to--

00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:44.122
I just had to do more.

00:08:44.122 --> 00:08:47.360
We decided that together we
would develop my PhD research

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.729
in population genetics of
some wild birds that are

00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:54.767
severely exploited in Brazil
for the wild pet trade.

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:58.103
So thank you guys.

00:08:58.103 --> 00:09:00.105
I would just show you
a couple of my results

00:09:00.105 --> 00:09:02.741
among all the piles of
data that we generated.

00:09:02.741 --> 00:09:05.077 line:0%
Meet the Red-Cowled Cardinal.

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:09.514 line:0%
( birds chirping )

00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:11.783 line:0%
And the Green-Winged Saltator.

00:09:11.783 --> 00:09:14.720 line:0%
( birds chirping )

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.088 line:0%
They are very appreciated

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:18.290 line:0%
for their beauty and
their songs.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.460
I decided to study
the species to see

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.662
if we could find different
genetic populations

00:09:23.662 --> 00:09:27.399
within each one and
see the level of threat

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:31.703
or if we could pinpoint
the origin of animals

00:09:31.703 --> 00:09:32.871
within a known origin.

00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:38.276
Ironically enough, we found
a different population

00:09:38.276 --> 00:09:40.546
in the species we did
not expect to find.

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:42.181
But we did not find
them in the species

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:44.717
we expected to find them.

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:48.688
It changed a little bit
the way we saw this species.

00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:54.426
This has complicated
implications.

00:09:54.426 --> 00:09:56.528
Broadly it means that
releasing the Saltators

00:09:56.528 --> 00:09:58.931
back in the wild
should be less problematic

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.533
concerning the genetics
criterion I just mentioned

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:04.069
than releasing the
Red-Cowled Cardinals.

00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:06.404
Here are the three
populations of cardinals

00:10:06.404 --> 00:10:09.041
that we were able to describe.

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:11.209
We would you like to know
if we could infer

00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:13.011
the most likely
origin of some animals

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:14.279
seized in São Paulo.

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.581
These tests still
need to be refined

00:10:16.581 --> 00:10:18.717
but they indicate
that these animals

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.986
are probably most
likely from a population

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:25.357
in Northeast that is known
to be a collection hot spot.

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:29.361
Data like this alone will
not provide a final answer

00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:31.397
but along with other
sources of information

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:33.765
may provide a good
indication and a good help

00:10:33.765 --> 00:10:35.701
for the decision-making process

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:40.372
not only for prevention
efforts but for releasing

00:10:40.372 --> 00:10:43.209
in a technically
responsible way.

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:45.978
Towards the end of my PhD,

00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:49.081
I wanted to do everything
but writing the thesis

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.117
to much the despair
of my advisors.

00:10:52.117 --> 00:10:54.319
I was still not happy
because I felt my work

00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:57.989
was really localized
and still small.

00:10:57.989 --> 00:11:00.425
I went on and along
with Freeland Foundation

00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:03.395
from southeast Asia,
I started Freeland Brasil.

00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:05.597
Trying to organize
the work I was doing

00:11:05.597 --> 00:11:08.133
and broaden the
impact so we work now

00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:11.436
with three pillars
trying to accomplish

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:13.505
a comprehensive set of actions

00:11:13.505 --> 00:11:16.541
against wildlife
trafficking in Brazil.

00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:19.011
The first one, education
and awareness.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:20.545
Amazing.

00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:22.348
The brink of our civilization,

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:25.150
but a little bit too
long term for us.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.686
In this component,

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:30.122
among other projects,
we are co-producing

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:33.893
a feature documentary on wild
animal trafficking in Brazil.

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:38.330
( upbeat music )

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.766 line:0%
Voiceover: (translated) I
believe animals bring joy to us,

00:11:41.766 --> 00:11:44.704 line:0%
the joy of singing in its cage.

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:48.940
( sad music )

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.410
( monkey squeaks )

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.313 line:0%
Voiceover: ( translated )
You are responsible

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:55.580 line:0%
for all that you captivate,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.283 line:0%
not for that which you imprison.

00:11:58.283 --> 00:12:01.921 line:0%
That which you imprison,
you're more than responsible,

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:04.990 line:0%
you're the overseer.

00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:09.228 line:0%
Juliana: This should launch
beginning of next year.

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:12.464
Also, that was not
enough yet so off we went

00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:15.067
to launch research and
mitigation of impacts.

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:18.803
Where a student is analyzing
the mitochondrial DNA

00:12:18.803 --> 00:12:22.541
of the Saltators to see if my
results can be corroborated.

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:26.478
I hope to start my
post-PhD next semester

00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:29.448
developing paternity tests
which will be able to be used

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:32.851
in commercial bird breeders
to help law enforcement

00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:35.320
detect poached animals.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.524
We also collaborate
in responsible releases

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:40.725 line:0%
such as this done
by the organization

00:12:40.725 --> 00:12:44.496 line:0%
SOS Fauna in which 80
Blue-Fronted Amazons

00:12:44.496 --> 00:12:47.165 line:0%
were returned to nature

00:12:47.165 --> 00:12:51.270 line:0%
following most of all those
criteria I just showed you.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.639 line:0%
This was only a
couple of years ago.

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:57.176 line:0%
( birds squawking )

00:13:04.883 --> 00:13:08.220
That's me almost crying
behind the camera.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.661
If you are asking yourself
how well that went,

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:18.130
how about this?

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.899
And this?

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:23.135
But that was not enough!

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.003
See, not enough!

00:13:25.003 --> 00:13:28.407 line:0%
So, off we went to capacity
enhancement and articulation

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:30.543 line:0%
where we work
with agents involved

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.344 line:0%
in combating
wildlife trafficking

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:35.213
and provide training,
courses, and workshops.

00:13:35.213 --> 00:13:39.117
The next ones aligned is one
with the prosecutor's office

00:13:39.117 --> 00:13:41.319
from São Paulo
where they rely on

00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:43.288
international
prosecutor's task force

00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:45.557
against wildlife
trafficking in Brazil.

00:13:45.557 --> 00:13:47.559
We will bring South
American prosecutors

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:50.061
to develop international
agreements on how we can

00:13:50.061 --> 00:13:53.632
better cooperate against
wildlife trafficking regionally

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:56.134
and how we can join
the global efforts.

00:13:56.134 --> 00:13:58.537
We also have an aligned workshop

00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:00.205
with the Brazilian
federal police

00:14:00.205 --> 00:14:02.607
on wildlife forensics
and best practices.

00:14:02.607 --> 00:14:05.477
Lastly, we are
producing with SOS Fauna

00:14:05.477 --> 00:14:08.346
post-seizure procedure
guides on how to

00:14:08.346 --> 00:14:12.384
radically decrease the death
rate post after the animals are

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:14.019
seized by law enforcement

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:17.790
by taking very simple
and cheap measures like

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.060
this animal likes cold and
this animal hates heat, etc.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.129
But that's not enough!

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:26.565
My next goal is to get
involved with efforts

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:29.200
to change the Brazilian
environmental legislation

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.738
and try to encompass wildlife
trafficking as a full crime

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:35.473
because believe it
or not, it doesn't.

00:14:35.473 --> 00:14:38.309
If your country's legislation
is anything like ours,

00:14:38.309 --> 00:14:40.312
tell your law makers
you want to change it

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:42.982
and encompass wildlife
trafficking as a full crime

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:45.184
as it is a crime
against humanity.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.389
These animals are
being withdrawn

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.524
from the environment
on a regular basis

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:54.726
to be people's pets.

00:14:54.726 --> 00:14:57.295
Should we maintain
the so-called cultural habit

00:14:57.295 --> 00:14:59.465
just because we are used to it?

00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:04.703
If commercial captive
breeding of wild animals

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.971
makes law enforcement
and protecting

00:15:06.971 --> 00:15:09.174
our biodiversity more difficult,

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:12.477
should we do this
just so that some people

00:15:12.477 --> 00:15:16.481
can fulfill their desire
of owning a wild animal?

00:15:16.481 --> 00:15:19.317
If we fail, consequences
may be severe

00:15:19.317 --> 00:15:21.252
and even not fixable.

00:15:21.252 --> 00:15:24.323
Cultures are dynamic
and can and must evolve.

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:25.991
So I'd say no!

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:28.994
These animals in
all endless forms

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:31.063
most beautiful
and most wonderful

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:34.299
should be out in a healthy
and dynamic environment

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:36.301
fulfilling their
ecological roles

00:15:36.301 --> 00:15:38.070
and their evolutionary roles

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.771
as species that
evolve over time.

00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:41.206
Thank you.

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.442
( applause )

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:47.079
( outro music )
