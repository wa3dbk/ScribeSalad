00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:12.000
NARRATOR:
This summer, prepare for the poorly-directed

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.109
movie adaptation of the young adult phenomenon
that isn’t about gay vampires. The Hunger

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.380
Games.&nbsp;In a dystopian future, the rich dress
like second-rate Lady Gagas in cities leftover

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.890
from Phantom Menace&nbsp;while the poor struggle
for survival in unnecessary shaky cam.&nbsp;But

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.960
can still somehow afford futuristic projection
thingies.&nbsp;One girl must choose - between

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.420
a short, boring, one-dimensional, worthless
blonde guy&nbsp;and this much hotter dude.&nbsp;In

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.579
a world where children are ripped from their
families, and their parents seem oddly okay

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.609
with it, she will make the ultimate sacrifice.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.199
KATNISS:
I volunteer as tribute.

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.339
NARRATOR:
And enter a life-or-death game where competitors

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:09.260
learn the deadly arts of… lying in rafters,
button pressing, playing with balls, and frosting

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.260
decoration.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.630
PEETA:
I used to decorate the cakes down at the bakery.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.230
NARRATOR:
What the hell is this?&nbsp;

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.350
KATNISS:
Peeta!

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.470
NARRATOR:
Seriously? That is [bleep]-ing ridiculous.&nbsp;A

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.841
girl that will enthrall a nation through her
stupid face, cheap -looking CGI fire, and

00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:29.550
completely emotionless delivery.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.280
KATNISS:
How do you find shelter? Listen to them. I

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.240
told her that I would try to win. How will
they change you?

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.550
NARRATOR:
A film that forces two actors with no chemistry

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.850
to awkwardly fall in love.&nbsp;Which would have
been far more believable if they would have

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.800
cast him as Peeta. I mean, I’m not gay,
but I’d totally [bleep] Gale’s [bleep].&nbsp;A

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.311
future so advanced they can conjure fire and
monster dogs but not food for the poor.&nbsp;The

00:01:56.311 --> 00:02:00.760
ultimate game of kill or be killed, except
for these kids who don’t kill each other

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.810
for some reason. Who Katniss will outsmart
by hiding in trees, falling from trees, sleeping

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.790
in trees and basically being around a lot
of trees. &nbsp;Not starring these important parts

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.420
from the book: Katniss' hearing loss, the
avoxes, Peeta's amputation, political and

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.310
social satire, the subtle nuances explaining
the relationships between the districts and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.310
the capital,&nbsp;The inner turmoil of Katniss
as she struggles to love Peeta for the sake

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.530
of the cameras and the actual hunger.&nbsp;Seriously
they all look very well fed.&nbsp;The Hunger Games.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.400
&nbsp;It’s basically just a rip-off of Battle
Royale. Tell us what movie you'd like to see

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.040
as an Honest Trailer and leave a comment with
the word you'd like to hear me say next time

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.389
want in my awesome voice. &nbsp;Indubitably. Me
gusta. Derp. Frabbins. Tittie sprinkles. I'm

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.779
a little teapot, short and stout, here is
my handle, and here is my spout.
