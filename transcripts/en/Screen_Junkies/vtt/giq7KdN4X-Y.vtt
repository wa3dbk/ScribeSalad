00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.750
From the man responsible for every movie your
girlfriend tried to drag you to

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.849
comes the film responsible for every bad movie
about a dozen famous people falling in love

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.770
on a popular holiday...

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.490
Love Actually

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.220
This holiday season, prepare for the ultimate
romantic comedy

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.230
that's not very romantic

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.480
or funny

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.099
or relevant to the holiday season.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340
"They've been giving out parts in the nativity
play!"

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.850
"And I'm the lobster!"

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.350
"In the nativity play?"

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.699
But don't worry: sit through it and you
still might get laid.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.140
Follow along on this Pulp Fiction for girls,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.839
stuffed with eight different plot-lines that
are creepy and depressing when you actually

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.290
stop to think about them, like...

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.750
a man getting over the death of his wife by
helping his kid seduce a girl with the same

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.979
name as his dead mom,

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.040
"Her name's Joanna?"

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.089
"Same as mom."

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.379
a woman who ends up alone with her unstable
brother instead of her hot available coworker

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.220
"Don't do that, my darling."

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.680
this guy who's trying to bang his best friend's
wife...

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.740
wait, is that Rick?

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.220
"Do you think Carl knows?"

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.020
"Caaaaaarl!"

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.810
"Carl!"

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.020
a man who will throw away his loving wife
and children to buy a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.850
necklace for this walking vagina,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.549
"Full of dark corners for doing dark deeds."

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.950
a powerful older man who fires his subordinate
for being distractingly hot,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.140
a powerful older man whose wife cheats on
him...

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.880
so he seduces his young hot subordinate who
doesn't even speak English,

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:44.450
and these two uncomfortable stand-ins on the
highest budget porno of all time.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.320
Experience what boils down to a supercut of
every rom-com cliche in the book, like

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.770
the last minute airport dash,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.220
"Sam?"

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.960
"I thought you didn't know my name."

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.100
awkward meet cutes,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.429
"It's Junction 13. That's just murder, isn't
it - total gridlock this morning."

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.499
making out behind the curtain and getting
discovered,

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:04.539
singing in public,

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.090
"Good King Wenceslas looked out."

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.369
adorable children,

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.780
"I'm in love."

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.310
Over the top gestures,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.310
"All you need is love!"

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.310
and Hugh f***ing Grant.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.569
So this Christmas, catch one of the most subversive
chick flicks of all time

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.030
that's aimed at a female audience

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.290
but tells them the ideal woman brings you
food,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.180
"These are... for you."

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.840
"Banoffee pie."

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.660
isn't fat,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.820
"The chubby girl?"

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.760
"He said I was gettin' fat."

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.040
"Come on later, Plumpy."

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.040
"I think there's a pretty sizable ass
there, yes. Huge thighs."

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.099
and shows you her boobs.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.260

all these people you likes better in other
things.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.930
