00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.210
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.800
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Alvaro Enrigue
is a celebrated Mexican author.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.670
He has written 10 fiction books,
several of which are now available

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.850
in English translations including

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.630
"Perpendicular Lives"
and "Hypothermia."

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.840
Enrigue received the
prestigious Joaquín Mortiz Prize

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.510
for his first novel, "La
muerte de un instalador,"

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.610
as well as the coveted
Herralde Prize

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.510
for his recent book,
"Muerte subita."

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.370
He has also written for The
New York Times, The Believer

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.530
and The London Review of Books,
and he also writes for El Universal

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.770
which is a Mexican newspaper.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.580
His award-winning "Muerte
subita" is now available

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.620
in the English translation
and is titled "Sudden Death"

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.810 position:56%
and is published by Riverhead Books.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.810
And this is the book that
we're here to celebrate today.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.280
The book is a daring adventure
story featuring 16th Century--

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.410
a 16th Century tennis match
between Italian artist Caravaggio

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.330
and the Spanish poet
Francisco de Quevedo.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.750 position:56%
Enrigue lives in New York City
where he alternates between teaching

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.390
at Princeton and Columbia
universities.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.060
Alvaro, thank you again
for being here with us.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.180
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Thank you for
inviting me and for reading the bio

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.390
of someone so successful.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.110
It's so fantastic.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.480
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: So to start, can
you just tell us a little bit about

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.900
"Sudden Death," a little
synopsis perhaps?

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.370
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: There is a
trolling, most of the reviewers

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.040
and the critics always begin
saying that it's a book

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.090
that I cannot define, you know.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.020
I cannot-- the American review has
a very strict format, as you know,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.420 position:56%
and it always begin with a long part
in which they tell the book somehow.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.440
And it's not a book
that-- I don't know.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.880
I know what it is about, of
course, but it's not a book

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.660
that you can tell what it is about
but it's mainly, I would say,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.770
like a mural, like a big screen
representation of a moment

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.600
in the 17th Century or the transit
between the 16th and 17th Century

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.990
in which modernity was
invented or it's a novel

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.360
about the invention of modernity.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.780
And so, the main characters
of the book are--

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.700
or the more visible characters
of the book are, as you said,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.690 position:56%
this painter Michelangelo Merisi
who was the first painter in history

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.750
that used-- that considered
metro more important than work,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.470 position:56%
that makes out of him a modern
master and not a renaissance master,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.470
and Francisco de Quevedo who
was this fascinating poet

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.320
from the golden century of Spain
that had a life as rich and scary

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.840
as Caravaggio's, you know, because
what is told in the novel is true.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.030
Both of them were assassins, both
of them were fantastic artists.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.890
Quevedo was for a period
a pirate, you know.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.280
He was a diplomat.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.930
He worked with the
Viceroy of the Two Sicilies

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.310
that is featured in the novel too.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.570
And Caravaggio is just an
unbelievably modern, contemporary

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.580
and fascinating character.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.700
He was an openly gay artist in the
17th Century who made a statement

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.860
over being gay and being successful
at the same time in a city

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.780
in which one good thing that
even sex could be forbidden,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.510
you know, that was Rome.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.540
So, it's a portrait of
this period but the main--

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.030
those are not the characters.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.560
The true characters are
the objects in the novel.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.860
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.760
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: That's why it's
so difficult to grasp a definition

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.380 position:56%
of it, because what the novel tells
is really the story of a tennis ball

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.620
that was made with the hair of
Anne Boleyn, sounds theatric

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.560
but this is completely true.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.450
The tennis balls in the 17th
Century were made with human hair,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.430
usually hair of dead people
of course, and this is true.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.190
That's completely historical.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.990
And the other object is a
work of art made in Mexico

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.500
in the 17th Century, the
[inaudible] scapulary.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.440
The-- I don't know if the American
culture knows what a scapulary is

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.570
but it's a little image of a
saint or a virgin or a god,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.320
if you belong to a
different religion,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.340
I suppose, that you carry with you.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.570
And this image is not painted
as it would be in the case

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.050
of a European scapulary
but it's made

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.850
out with feathers,
with shiny feathers.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.560
That was the way in which
the Aztec artists painted.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.380
So we know it will tell this story

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.950 position:56%
of how those two objects make a very
long trip to a center of the world

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.190
of that moment that
was the City of Rome,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.060
and they are displayed
during the game.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.970
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: So
perhaps, just a little reading

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.530
of a little part of the book--

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.830
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Yes.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.670
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: -- before we
continue with some questions.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.970
&gt;&gt;

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.010
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: This
is very serious, I mean.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.330
[ Laughter ]

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:31.010
I think that it will torture
the language of your ancestors

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.680
in the next minutes reading.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.980
I can say in my defense

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.240
that in Spanish I have a
very weird accent, too.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.930
And that I mispronounce
words in Spanish, too,

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.100
so it won't be as bad as you think.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.400
It will be natural.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.110
And then there is this thing
that my kids are American

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.490
or Mexican-American
and they really--

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.930
they don't have accents, no.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.260
They have very cool accents.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.790
The little one speaks with a Harlem
accent which is just beautiful.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.890
So usually, I take them when I
do readings in New York and we go

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.230
by metro and I practice and
they have opinions they consider

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.850
as all kids that their
father is [inaudible].

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.640
So whenever I read one word
that is wrong, they correct me.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.830
But being New York City, the people
in the metro intervenes, you know,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.330
and they say, well, no, I don't
think that's the correct word.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.830
You say that because you're
from Harlem, baby, [inaudible].

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.620
So this will be a mess.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.920
Sorry about it.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.290
The name of the chapter
is "Beheading."

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.720
Jean Rombaud had the worst of
all possible tasks on the morning

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:42.400 position:56%
of May 19, 1536, severing with a
single blow the head of Anne Boleyn,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.430
Marquess of Pembroke
and Queen of England,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.440
a young woman so beautiful she
had turned the Strait of Dover

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.850
into a veritable Atlantic.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.920
The notorious Thomas Cromwell,
chief minister to Henry VIII,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.900
had brought Rombaud over from
France for this express purpose.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.390
In a curt missive, Cromwell
asked that he bring his sword,

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.370
a piece of miraculously
fine craftsmanship,

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.630
forged of Toledo steel,
because he would be performing a

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.830
delicate execution.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.840
Rombaud was neither
beloved nor indispensable.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.870
Beautiful and immoral, he
drifted coldly in the tight circle

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.490
of very specialized workers who
thrived in the Renaissance courts

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.420
under the blind eye of ambassadors,
ministers, and secretaries.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.710
His reserve, striking looks, and
lack of scruples made him a natural

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.510
for certain kinds of tasks known
to all and spoken by no one,

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.300
the dark operations that
have always been unavoidable

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.320
in the conduct of politics.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.430
People in DC know about that.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.340
He dressed with a surprising
good taste for someone

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.910
with the job of killer angel.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:04.370
He wore expensive rings, breeches
lavishly trimmed with brocade,

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.870
and royal-blue velvet shirts
unsuited to a bastard,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.080
which he was in every
sense of the word.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.870
Cheap gemstones were
braided with gypsy panache

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:22.470
into his gold-streaked
chestnut hair, the gems filched

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.320
from mistresses conquered
with the various weapons

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.390
over which God had
granted him mastery.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.470
There was no knowing whether he
was silent because he was clever

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.490
or because he was a fool.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.710
His deep blue eyes, which turned
down a little at the corners,

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.490
never expressed compassion, but
they never expressed any kind

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.930
of animosity either.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.750
Also, Rombaud was French.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:54.010
For him, killing a queen of
England was less sin than duty.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.110
Cromwell had called him to London

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.860
because he believed this last
quality made him particularly

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.590
hygienic choice for the job.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:09.530 position:56%
On the morning of May 19, 1536, Anne
Boleyn attended mass and confession.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.340
Before she was turned over
to the constable of the Tower

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.790
so her body could be cleaved apart,

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.240 position:56%
she asked that her ladies-in-waiting
alone be given the privilege

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.700
of cropping her heavy red
braids and shaving her head.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.650
Most of the surviving
portraits, including the sole copy

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:35.260
of the only one reportedly painted
from life depict her as the owner

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.990
of crimped and, yes, of
crimped and significant locks.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:45.360
What is it about nudity, in
theory the great equalizer,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.600
that excites us?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.330
In their naked states, only
monsters should turn us on,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:57.720 position:56%
and yet it's the very sameness of
our nakedness that we find arousing.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.510
The ladies who accompanied Boleyn

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.170
in her trials had pulled
back the collar of her gown

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.450
to reveal her neck before
escorting her to the scaffold.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.500 position:56%
They had also removed her necklaces.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.600
They didn't feel that
the removal of her veil

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.390
and tresses marred her
beauty in the least.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:24.440
She was just as lovely with a
shorn head as she was with hair.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.380
The bluish gleam of her neck
quivering in anticipation

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.900
for the blow triggered an
emotional response in Rombaud.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.710
According to one witness,
the mercenary was kind enough

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.940
to make an effort to surprise
the lady lying there bare

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.690
from her shoulder blades
to the crown of her head.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.920
With his sword raised up
high and ready to come

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.640
down upon the queen's
neck, he asked carelessly,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.210
has anyone seen my sword?

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.020
The woman twitched her
shoulders, perhaps relieved

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.790
that some chance occurrence
might spare her.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.600
She closed her eyes.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.750
Vertebrae, cartilage, the spongy
tissue of trachea and pharynx,

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.360
the sound of their parting
was like the elegant pop

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.040
of a cork liberated
from a bottle of wine.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.130
Jean Rombaud refused
the bag of silver coins

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.030
that Thomas Cromwell offered
him when the job was done.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.270
Addressing the whole gathering, but
looking into the eyes of the man

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.690
who had schemed until
he unseated the queen,

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.850
he said that he had agreed
to do what he had done

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:41.750
to spare a lady the vile fate of
dying under an executioner's blade.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.340
He made a sideway bow to
the ministers and clergymen

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.340
who had witnessed the beheading,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.070
and he returned straight
to Dover at full gallop.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.950
Earlier that morning, the lord

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:57.430
of high constable had packed the
categorical braids of the queen

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.550
of England in his saddlebags.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:07.300
Rombaud was an avid tennis player,
and this seemed sufficient payment,

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.720
the hair of those executed on the
scaffold had special properties

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.560
that caused it to trade

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.200
at stratospheric prices
among ball makers in Paris.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:24.360
A woman's hair was worth
more, red hair more still,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.440
and a reigning queen's would
command an unimaginable price.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.970
Anne Boleyn braids produced
a total of four tennis balls,

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.710
which were by far the most
luxurious sporting equipment

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.280
of the Renaissance.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.080
Thank you.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.690
[ Applause ]

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.480
When the book was presented
in Spanish for the first time,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.780
I have my editor in Spanish,
he's a legendary editor.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.080
He's Jorge Herralde.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.280
He's really a living legend
of edition in Spanish.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.320
And he said in the press conference
that the balls made with the hair

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.390
of Anne Boleyn were real,
you know, that they existed

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.000
and that they were in a museum.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.280
So I have to pretend for like three
months that those balls existed.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.930
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: And do they
look similar to the balls--

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.230
were they-- how do they look like?

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.710
Just like a jumble of hair?

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.750
I'm just curious.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.740
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: They look
like tennis, like baseballs.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.040
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: OK, OK.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.460
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: They
look like baseballs, yes.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.740
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Well, thank
you for that reading, Alvaro.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.950
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue:
There is-- I'm sorry.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.250
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: No, no, no.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.880
Go ahead, go ahead.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.180
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: No.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.060
A few weeks ago, I was invited
to London and I made a reading

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.980
in the racket club, in
the Queen's racket club

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.660
where they still play this
game, the archaic tennis.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.280
And this novel begins with Quevedo
bouncing the ball, you know,

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.790
the tennis ball so he can make a--

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.090
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: A serve.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.390
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue:
A serve, you know.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.690
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:58.990
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: And I arrived
there and I had the chance

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.530
to play this very old game.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.020
So they gave me the ball and
I got the racket and drop it

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.390
and it stays in the floor.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.900
It's like a baseball.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.200
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Oh, yeah.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.070
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: So they
are very small and very hard,

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.370
you know, like little baseballs.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.670
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.070
Well, thank you for that, Alvaro.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.200
And I'm just going to ask you some
questions about the book and then

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.260
about your work in general.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.460
So in this book, you
juxtaposed historical elements

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.950
with the postmodern.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.420
You also inserted tweets,
emails and other current mode

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.810
of communication in the novel.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:35.390
Can you talk a little bit about
this element in your work?

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.030
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Yeah.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.440
I suppose that it's maybe
just a generation, I think,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.340
but I have a resistance,
a natural resistance

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.170
to linear storytelling, you know.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:51.900
Linear storytelling feels
not boring to me but sounds

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.260
like petit bourgeois, you know.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.170
It sounds to me like a 19th
Century novel in which the sequence

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:02.600
of events is clear and
the-- and more importantly,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.390
the reader doesn't have
an intervention, you know.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.800
I believe-- and I believe
it honestly and truly

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.630
that true art is reading
and not writing, you know,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.200
that it's the reader who
produces the work of art.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.930
The writer just sets some
Post-Its there and the art happens

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.440
in the head of the reader,
not in the head of the writer.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.200
The writer is just a vehicle
so someone can make art

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.880
as they are reading or
as he or she is reading.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:36.330
So in that sense, I'm interested in
novels that are like, I don't know,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.790
Swiss cheeses, you know--

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.090
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.810
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: -- that are
full of holes so the reader can go

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.730
through it like what we are--

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.030
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.330
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: --
when we read, you know,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.630
that is like reading
worms, you know.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.930
We're inside the book.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.440
And I think that the more open
the spaces inside the novel,

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.170
the more comfortable the
reader will feel inside--

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.470
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.020
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: -- and will
be able to set a particular order

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.080
in the book and a particular
set of ideas

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.500
that are not necessarily
mine, you know.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.820
I don't approach to
writing as a dictator.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.520
I approach to it as a social work.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.860
That is what I think it is.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.640
Reading and writing is
always social, you know.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.370
There is this-- Do you remember
Ficano [assumed spelling]?

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.330
He used to say that we should
forget about the 19th Century

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.590
and he was absolutely right.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.960
This idea of the lone
writer, he thinks he's--

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.760
it's always a he, it's never a she.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.060
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Right.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: That he's in his
house with the beard and a cigarette

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:40.580 position:56%
and he's super serious and alone and
then the reader that is in the house

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.240
of the reader alone and
everything is bullshit.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.560
Reading is a social thing.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.860
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.160
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: It's
[inaudible] but there are a lot

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.130
of people a book is intervening but
many, many people before it arrives

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:57.280 position:56%
to the reader and the reader himself
is reading with a lot of people,

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.510
too, you know, the recommenders,
the reviewers, et cetera.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.810
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Right.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.110
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: So,
my books are like that.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.190
They are more open than closed.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.490
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: And do
you also think about sort

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.850
of how we are currently
reading in the generation

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.900
which is all these little bits
and pieces in the internet

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:17.270 position:56%
and being able to see, to read about
historical moments in our computers

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.520
but then also like watching a
YouTube video and all this sort

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.940
of broken pieces of information?

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.870
I mean, because that's sort of
what it reminds me definitely.

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.170
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: I don't know.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.470
I don't know.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.520
I've written all my books listening
to music in a computer, you know--

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.820
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.120
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: -- which
is not to listen to music,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.420
you know, but I listen to music.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.910
I listen to a piece, you know.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.600
But when I'm working,
I took music in iTunes

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.860
or whatever program you
have and is always broken,

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.490
you know, everything is broken.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.330 position:56%
The whole discourses of the 19th
Century or of the late 20th Century,

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.340
maybe the 70s was still--
don't exist anymore.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:57.270
That's by one hand
but by the other--

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.960
a novel is such a marvelously
demanding object in itself

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.580
that you cannot decide
what form it will have

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.060
to please certain kind
of reader, you know.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.870
To tell a story is so
incredibly difficult,

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:18.850
so damn incredibly difficult
that the form that the novel asks

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:23.930
for the form, I mean in this case,
I said it was a novel that is set

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.060
in a tennis game is not a
novel about the tennis game.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.880
I had when-- The first time in
my life I saw a tennis game was

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.610
when I went to a Queen's racket
club last year, you know.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.460
It's not that novel about tennis.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.390
But as the spine of the novel was a
tennis game, the novel had to have

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:47.700
that form so the chapters are very
short, very violent and very strong

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.400
because you should really test, as
you see, a tennis match, you know,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.300 position:56%
moving the head from one side to the
other because the ball is bouncing

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.290
and the novel has that structure.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.590
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.030
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: In the
beginning, you are, as a reader,

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.440
you are standing behind
Quevedo's back.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.830
As, yeah, as a reader, you're
just-- that's the point of view.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.410
So you see Caravaggio at
the other side, you know,

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.510
the monster of baroque, you know,

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.420
the man who will invent
baroque art in the next.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:20.550
And behind him, you can
perceive, you know, Rome,

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.010
the counterreformation,
France, you know, Spain.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.310
It's eternal duel.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:30.390
And when in the middle of the game,
they switch positions and you begin

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.010
to see the game from the
perspective of Caravaggio.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:37.150
You see Quevedo and you see Spain
became him but more than anything,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.290
you see the America behind, you
know, the great and main monster

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.740
of the 17th Century, you know,
that thing that had to be invented,

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:49.150
that empty space that-- which
the story had to be told

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.230
so it could exist in the
imaginary of the people.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.000
So the novel happens
very fast, you know.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.300
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.600
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: In
the book I'm writing now

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.620
that happens during the 19th
Century, the chapters are very long

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.210
because it should feel
like a train ride--

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.510
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.990
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: -- and not
like a tennis match, mm-hmm.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.630
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: What also
the tennis match symbolized,

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.320 position:56%
like this back and forth of the
ball between Caravaggio and Quevedo,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.350
is there more symbolism there?

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.480
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Between the,
well, Italy and Spain, you know.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.780
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: OK.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.100
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: It's still
a-- when you speak about soccer,

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.340
that's an important game always.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.640
Italy-Spain is--

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.940
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.470
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: -- a game the
world stops to watch, you know.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.390
But anyway, no, I was--
I wanted, for years,

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.930
I wanted to write a novel about--
or with Caravaggio, you know,

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.960
which Caravaggio was a--
I read in long, long ago--

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.000
long, long ago, I read in The
New York Review of Books a review

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.680
of a new biography of Caravaggio.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.250
He was in Berlin.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.550
He was in Berlin.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.610
And I read this, I had it
from the plane and I read

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:57.380
that he had been an assassin
and that-- while he was--

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.730
you surely had seen many
Caravaggio paintings

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.640
because he was a superstar.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.590 position:56%
But that when his paintings, there
is a beheading, there is a character

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.170
who is beheaded like
John the Baptist or all

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.150
of this biblical characters
that are beheaded, or Goliath,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:19.580
the head that is presented always
in the painting is a self-portrait.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.190
It's always the head of
Caravaggio, you know.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.480
So I found that incredibly
fascinating.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.830
And I began to think about
writing one day one novel

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.510
in which Caravaggio was
displayed, you know.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.050
He's such a theatric
character, you know.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:36.790
And at the same time, he had a
studio that was a place like this

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.950
that had a little hole
in the top of the studio

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.310 position:56%
and it was the only source of light.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.900
So he will paint with
only low lights.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.430
There were no professional models
in his life and he was a low life.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.160
So he would grab all these
people from the street

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.300
that were well-known in Rome.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:00.460 position:56%
When he painted, he used a
prostitute to paint the Virgin Mary.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.770
His painting was rejected from
St. Peter because everybody knew

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.140
that woman, you know,
so it was scandal.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.500
So he would grab all these people,
prostitutes, beggars, you know,

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.900
tattooists, people like the bottom
of the Roman society, dress them

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.060
and display them under the
ray of light and that way--

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:26.100
and then he would project
that in the canvas

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.990
and then copy it, you know.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.100
So, he was a process artist.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.670 position:56%
And what is more fascinating I think

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.640
or what they could find more
fascinating is that the work

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.340
of art is not what is in the
canvas but what he did, you know.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.020
It was the performance made

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.060
by the beggars what
produced the work of art.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:47.490
The canvas itself was something
that you sold to a priest

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:51.540
for a ridiculous amount of money
because he was familiar, you know.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.840
He became very famous.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.010
He was like a rock star, you know.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.250
So this character was fascinating.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.550
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.850
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: I wanted
to write a novel about him

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.580
and I read a thousand biographies,
spent years going from museum

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.870
to museum to watch his paintings.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:10.060
They are not many for there
are only 63, now 64 paintings

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.710
because every now and then
one is found, you know,

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.540
not knowing how to write about him.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.850
And one day rereading,
that's interesting,

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.780
rereading the biography,
the bio that Peter Robb,

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.550
I think is his name, an Australian,
another critic, wrote about him,

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.690
I discover that he
was a tennis player.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:33.730
That before he became a famous
painter, he used to play tennis

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.250
in the streets for money.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.740
People would bet on him
as if he was a horse

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.210
or a Jai Alai player
in the streets of Rome.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:46.640
And I found that-- when I saw that,
you know, the idea of the so little

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.260
of the tennis court and
the people betting on him

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.280
as if he was a little animal
and he was the great--

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.380
he was about to invent
modern art, you know.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.680
I--

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.980
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.280
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: The novel
was set there you know.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.580
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.880
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: There
weren't nothing else have

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.180
to read only, except writing.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.480
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.780
That's great.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.630
OK. The next question, so
through exaggeration, humor and,

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.150
quite frankly, brilliance, you--

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.110
I think you're laughing at the
way history has been written

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.660
and you're kind of
laughing at history

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.980
with a capital H. Is this correct?

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.280
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Yeah.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.580
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah?

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Yeah, I think so.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.180
I think that's a privilege
of a novelist, you know.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.300
A novelist can work--
I work as a writer.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.520
I work as, you know, with archives.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.620
But I do a lot of research
and I work in--

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.640
with historic materials but
they are not historical novels

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.100
because they are not loyal
to history at all, you know,

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.620 position:56%
and they are not remakes of history.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:48.280
They are mainly meditations on why
missed history with a capital H

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.530
which are ridiculous
discourse that comes

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.710 position:56%
from very specific places, you know.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.580
It comes from the clusters
of the universe.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:01.080 position:56%
It is, you know, and is told in only
a very specific way and that's it.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.260
So, my novels tend to
be a meditation on that.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:09.390
I think that the privilege of the
novelists is that you can tell it.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:13.210
And when you are telling you
can propose different theories

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:19.900
about things that may make more
scenes than how they are told

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.950
in the academic works of history.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.730
I am not being critical
of historians.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.510
I would not be a writer
without their work, you know.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.620
I'm a reader of history.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.920
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: And how was
it to work with Natasha Wimmer,

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.180
your translator, in the
translation of this work?

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.510
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Natasha is

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:43.180 position:56%
to translation what Diego Armando
Maradona to a soccer ball, you know.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.480
No, she really is.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.780
She is a crack, you know.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.080
She is a monster.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.380
She is--

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.680
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: She translated
Bolaño, all of the Bolaño--

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.980
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: She
translated some Bolaño.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.280
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Some Bolaño.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.580
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: She
translated the big ones,

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.940
"The Savage Detectives" and "2666."

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.130
And she has done a lot of work
but it was when my agent told me,

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.970
you know, it will be Natasha
Wimmer, I was incredibly excited

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.690
because I know her work well.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.900
I didn't know her personally
but I know her work well.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.780
And I have-- Even in
my class in Princeton,

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.840 position:56%
I have worked with students with the
original of "The Savage Detectives"

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.140
and the original that she
produces because she's so good

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.710
that it's like an original.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:25.070
And so I was an admirer of
her work and it was great

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.210
to have the chance to
collaborate with her.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.360
And I thought that it was a
privilege to be translated by her.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.360
But as we were moving
in the translation,

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.910
I discovered that the true
privilege was to see her work,

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:39.350
to see a true artist of the
translation produce a book,

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.730
you know, because she
does first like a mess--

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.800
she does a very fast first
translation of the book

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.360
that is very messy and shapeless.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.960
And then she works with
an unbelievable devotion

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.820
but unbelievable word by word until
she has the feeling that it sounds

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.490
like the original and I have
that feeling, too, you know.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:04.790
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.980
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: At the end of
the process, because we read the--

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.960
it's a novel that is difficult
to relate because of the archives

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.620
and everything that discussed in.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.470
We did the edition with the
American and the British editors

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.480
at the same time and
their copies, you know.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.800
And editors in copies when they
are editing really hit the outdoors

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.560
in translation, you know.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.560
It's like a war between
the translator

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.930
and the editors on the other side.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.670
And when they would
ask for something,

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:36.360
I will go to Natasha's
original as if it was mine.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.050
There was a moment in which
I wouldn't have noticed

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:42.610
if what I was reading were
my words or Natasha's words.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.910
That's a [inaudible] translator.

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:45.210
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Wow.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.510
Yeah, right.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:47.810
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: That's her.

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.110
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah, right.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.410
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: She is amazing.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.710
Anyway, I think that a
translation is always an original.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.010
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.330
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: I don't share
the idea that translation--

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:59.660 position:56%
this Frost idea which is fine, you
know, poetry is lost in translation.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.960
It was a joke, you know.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.260
He didn't mean it.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.560
I don't know if it's lost--

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.860
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: So
you don't think that--

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.160
you don't think anything
is lost in the translation?

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.460
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: No.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.760
I think that that translation
enriches the reading,

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.060
you know, of the things.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.360
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.420
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: First that
translation is a second view

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.330
on that book which
means that, in general,

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.510
it will be better meditative
and it's--

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:23.330
when the translator begins
to work, the book is finished

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.760
so they know they are--
where they are going.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.040
So, the chances to
improve the book are real.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.190
And by other hand, it's
through translation

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.880
that we renew literary discourses.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.180
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Right.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.040
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: If there
was not because of the effort

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.220
of passing one thing written
in one language to another,

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.820
the language will stay
always the same, you know.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:52.240
It's through translation that a
language renews and learns new ways

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.600
of saying things, you know.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.900
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.370
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: So, I'm
a believer in translation,

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:02.560
a thing that more popular position
lately in the US fortunately.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.790
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Mm-hmm.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:08.550
And this next question is more
about your work in general.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.870
So, I feel like your
work talks a lot

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.460
about structures of power as well.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.290
In your first novel, "La muerte
de un instalador," which I think

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.420
that book has mistranslated to
English but it would translate

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.170
to "The Death of an
Installation Artist."

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:22.470
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Yeah.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:23.770
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Right.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.070
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: It would
translate to that, yeah.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.370
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez:
And that books deals

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.670
with the power structures
within the art world.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.080 position:56%
And then "Perpendicular Lives" deals

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.020
with the power of the
Catholic Church.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.320
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Yeah, and--

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.620
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Can
you talk a little-- yes.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.130
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: It's a novel
about parricide, that word exist

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.990
in English, parricidio,
parricide, yeah.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:43.470
"Perpendicular Lives" is--

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:44.770
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.600
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: -- a
series of characters that--

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.950
a parricide that reincarnates
and reincarnates and reincarnates

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:55.470
and he's always trying to not kill
his father and ends up doing it.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.290
Yes, I hate the authority figures.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:58.590
It's very sinful.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.530
I can deal with it.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.260 position:56%
I'm the son of a hippie [inaudible].

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.880
My father is older
than the hippies were.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:13.420
But anyway, I grew up in a very
relaxed home environment but went

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.660
to Catholic school
from six years old

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.080
and then I never could
deal with authority.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.380
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.680
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: I
still can't, you know.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.780
I tried. [Inaudible]
towards me but I can't.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.430
So yes, I have a beef with that.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.920
It's like a personal thing.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.580
And I have a beef, too, with the
figures of the machos, you know,

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:37.780
the quite great white machos
of history are always displayed

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.880
in a cruel way in my
novels, you know.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.840
I think that one of the things
that we have done really wrong

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.770 position:56%
in the western civilization is to
center all the efforts in the male--

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:52.810
in the masculine figures and I
think that that's a generation

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:56.430
where we have this
fantastic situation in which,

00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:03.000
for the first time, maybe
since 600 or 400 Before Christ,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.440
we are able to dismount that and
see history and seek what we do

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.800
from a different point of
view that is much more richer,

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.500
not only the point of view of the
being macho but the other one.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.470
I think that the way to
deconstruct that is to write

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:24.740
about the great machos of the world
and to laugh about them as much

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.050
as you can, you know,
and as loud as you can.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.660
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:36.390
OK, this is more about
you, you as a person.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.840
Had you always wanted
to be a writer?

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.390
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Yeah, I never
wanted to be anything else.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.810
I had it very clear.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.970
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: But yesterday,
you told me something different.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.320
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Yesterday,
I said something different.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.840
But I wanted to, well, I wanted
to be a soccer player or--

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.650
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: A
musician, you said a musician.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.590
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: No,
but I never studied music.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.890
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Oh, OK.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.190
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: No, but no.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:01.370
Yeah. No, if I could be whatever I
wanted to be I would be a musician.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:02.880
I have this reverence,
reverence, reverence--

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.430
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Oh,
I see, the-- OK-- yeah.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.760
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: -- for
music, but I cannot play a drum.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.890
I could not play a
bottle of water, you know.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.330
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: But you've been
writing for a very, very long time.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:14.630
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Yeah.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:15.930
I always wanted to be a writer.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:19.320
I'm a melomaniac, you know, but
you don't make money with that,

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.700
listening to records and
going to [inaudible] and help

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.580
with the family's economy, so.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.880
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.160
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: No, but I
always wanted to be a writer.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:35.170
I grew up in a family
that considers the ability

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.550
of telling a story important.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:42.570
It's a family of storytellers.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:45.170
It's a big family, it's a
Mexican family, so it's really big

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.630
and the meals are really long, you
know, as it is in Mexico, you know.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:54.980
A Sunday meal would begin at 3 p.m.
with the first tequila and will end

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.090
at 10 p.m. and all the
time, the people will be

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.620
in the table talking
and it's a big family.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.670
So in order to survive
to that family,

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.070
you have to be a good storyteller.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:07.370
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:09.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: You had to be
able to make people laugh, you know,

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:16.140 position:56%
so your uncles and grandparents will
learn your name which is noticing.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.700
There's a lot of children.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.000
Not anymore.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.030
Those families are in
extinction in Mexico.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.330
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Right.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:23.630
Yeah.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:24.930
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Now, they are
these like American families,

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.710
you know, a bunch of
old people and one kid.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.010
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:29.310
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: But when I
was a kid, it was different.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:33.190
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Who have
been the artists and writers

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.540
that have influenced you the most?

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.940
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue:
I don't know about--

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.540
The question about
influence is always weird--

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.090
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez:
They're difficult?

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.390
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: -- because I--

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:49.750
of course, you can speak about
writers you want to be as

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:53.220
and writers that you read
and you say wow, this is it.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.210
But I think that every
good thing is an influence.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.510
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:00.200
I would say that I would
not be the writer that I am,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.310
whatever kind of writer I am, if it
was not because of the folk songs

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:09.330
of Jose Alfredo Jimenez that I
would quote that as a big source

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:13.140
of poetic knowledge for me even
when he was not a great poet,

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.220
but he was the prince
of record and machos.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.760
He was so ridiculous
in those things,

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.560
but he wrote fantastic songs.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.850
The same thing I could
say about Agustin Lara,

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:27.580
you know, who wrote [inaudible]--

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.880
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.180
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: -- et cetera.

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.510
But at the same, of course,
that writers influenced you

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:36.780
and I wish it were like great
Greek writers but the truth is

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.180
that they tend to be
American writers.

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:42.880
I grew up in this-- in the
post-revolutionary Mexico

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.470
in the Mexico of, you know,
this thing that we have now

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:47.900
that who knows what it is,

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.090
but the genuine Partido
Revolucionario Institucional

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:55.550
which was ultranationalist, ultra
close, and kind of socialist.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.150
So I grew up in this country

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:01.250
in which it was impossible
to get foreign books.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.850
You have to read only
books in Spanish

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.350
and those books were
only Latin American.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:10.330
In the 70s, the educational
programs changed and in the school,

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:12.690
you would only read
Latin American writers.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.740
You grow up without knowing
that Dostoyevsky existed.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.410
Maybe the Dostoyevsky
because you are Russian

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.080 position:56%
and Russians were communist so maybe
you could read a Cuban translation

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.380
of Dostoyevsky's.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.680
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.980
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue:
But the rest of the--

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.630
we grew up without reading
Jane Austen, for example.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.930
I didn't know that she
existed until I was,

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.400
I don't know, 17, 18 years old.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.700 position:56%
So, anyway, there was this moment in
which Mexico, that closeness began

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:42.510
to crack before the signing of
the NAFTA and foreign books begin

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:47.850 position:56%
to arrive and that would be
Spanish and Argentinian translations

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.950
of literary works of England

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:53.710
and the United States
and that drove me crazy.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.330
The discovery, for example,
of Don DeLillo for me was

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.290
like the source of
everything, you know.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:05.380 position:56%
Finally, I was finding a writer that
was not center in his own discourse,

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.100
as the boom writers were, the big
geeks of Latin American literature,

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:13.140
but a writer who was centered
in how the novel works,

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.650
novels that were not poetic
discourses over the reality

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.940
but incredibly well
crafted machineries.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.280
In that sense authors like Ian
McEwan was incredibly important

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.580
for me.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:31.840
That this book "Flaubert's Parrot"
by-- I'm forgetting the name.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.250
What's the name of him?

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:35.550
&gt;&gt; Julian Barnes.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: By Julian Barnes.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:38.150
You know, all of those books were--

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.340
" A History of the World
in 10 1/2 Chapters."

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.640
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.940
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: They
were very important.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.840
In the Spanish side, I
discovered very young,

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.020
this incredible Spanish
author that now he's--

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.660
will be a [inaudible]
soon, Enrique Vila-Matas.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.340 position:56%
And he was influence, too, you know.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.640
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.940
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: He was
such an eccentric writer,

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.780
a writer that only writes about
writing but he's very fond

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.430
and very respectful of everything.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.280
So, those were more
or less the readings

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:11.160
that influenced me, if that exists.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.460
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: OK.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.110
I think we have enough time to
open the room for questions.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.490
So, if anyone has a question,
I think there's two microphones

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.790
in either side of the room.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:29.160
&gt;&gt; You mentioned Caravaggio
and Quevedo

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.600
and Quevedo is a [inaudible].

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.870
You are at Princeton and probably
Firestone Library has the best

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.930
collection of Quevedo's
notebooks when he was

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.700
in school as once before.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.900
You accessed those things at
Firestone Library in Princeton?

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.200
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Yes, I did.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.500
Yes, I do, of course.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.770
I wrote this book in the--
the second half of it, the--

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.610
I worked on it for two
years and in the first year,

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:57.510
I worked in the public library,
New York's Public Library.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:02.140
I had the sort of privilege of
having the Cullman Fellowship

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.890
that is one year in which the New
York Public Library pays you an

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:08.860
incredibly good salary
just to be reading there.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.230 position:56%
The theory is that you would be
reading and writing but the truth is

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:15.390
that I spent the whole
year just reading.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.990
And they have an incredible
art collection there.

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:23.760
And then the second year, I
was teaching at the program

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.960
with fellowship too at the--
program in Latin American Studies

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.580
of Princeton University and I would
work in Firestone all the time.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.710
One of the reasons why I
always return to the US is

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.610
because of the libraries, you know.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.930
The library culture in the
US is just fantastic and--

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:47.550
but I don't have to say that
in this event and in this town.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:50.880
I wrote my dissertation
in the Library of Congress

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:56.460 position:56%
and I will always be nostalgic about
those years in which I was so poor

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.410
and everything was so difficult,

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.820
but I could spend eight hours a
day inside the Library of Congress.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.120
I'm going to cry.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.550
It's happiness for me.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.790
The New York Public
Library is-- there's not--

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.560
no mythical animal as
the Library of Congress.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.620
No, there's nothing
like that in the world.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.160
But the New York Public
Library is a good one, too,

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.050
and Firestone is amazing.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:23.440
Between both of them, I think
have more documents than anything.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.930
And then I worked in
other libraries, too.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:29.070
I went to, in search
of certain documents,

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:34.440
I went to Austin because-- the
University of Texas in Austin

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.970
because they-- you work in
the Spanish reading room here.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.270
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Yeah, but--

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.570
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: The
Spanish reading room

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.970
in Austin has the best
collection of documents

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.820
about Mexico in the whole world.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.450
There is not even in Mexico
a collection like that one.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:50.270
And I saw things there
that are amazing.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.020
The book tells one of
those subjects that--

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:58.950 position:56%
I had one of those subjects that
was the copy of Thomas More "Utopia"

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:03.360
that was read by the first
archbishop of Mexico,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.610
Juan de Zumarraga, the author
of the Virgin of Guadalupe,

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.670
the guy who invented the Virgin
of Guadalupe, and he was--

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.960
it was given to him through Vasco,

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.260
the founder of the great Latin
American utopias, the original one.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.240
So you can see the first
Latin American like pioneer

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:27.460 position:56%
of utopic thinking making notes on
the book of-- on "Utopia," you know.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:33.730
It's just a privilege, you know,
to be able to touch that book.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.760
Sorry, I take super
long in everything.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.060
&gt;&gt; Hi, Alvaro.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.880
I've enjoyed listening
to you talk very much.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.560
Could you talk about the
writing process and how you go

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.330
about drafting and editing and
whether you have a schedule

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.920
or just sort of what
is your approach to--

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:55.350
when you've had the idea
to when you're ready

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:58.120
to hand it over for publication.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.980
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue:
It's always a mystery.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.830
I think that I had never--

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:07.880
I published right now maybe
seven books of fictions.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.980
I'm not sure how many books,
something around seven, six,

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.070
eight, something like that.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:16.330
I never-- the day in
which I finish the novel,

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:20.160
I thought in the morning I
will finish today, you know.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.590
I never felt that I was
even close to finishing.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:24.890
It's just that there is a moment

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:29.540
in which you cannot move forward
anymore and then that's it.

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.100
But the-- So I don't know.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.990
But I work in the mornings.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:37.400
I am a morning person so I
wake up incredibly early.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.280
I wake up at 4:30 every day.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.070
That's because I have
children, too, and like I have--

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:45.630
I teach a zillion classes,
[inaudible] writing.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.230
I'm super as much so I
live in the most expensive

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.910
and demanding city in the universe.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:55.010 position:56%
So I need to teach classes whole
day and I'm always doing journalism.

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.670
I have many things to
do during the days.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:02.280
So I work for sure from 4:30 to 7.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.310
And two or three days of the
week I can keep work longer.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.810
But I can never write a
word afternoon, you know.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.720
After lunch, I'm done with writing
and I devote most of the time

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.220
to teaching, of course,
but to reading.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.920
I spent a lot of time reading too.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.800
Other than that, I don't
have any method or--

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.410
I write by hand in
notebooks and with pencils.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:29.980
So I have this love for
pencils and sharpeners.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.860
And so I-- all my novels,

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.050
the original originals,
are in notebooks.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.420
&gt;&gt; You said earlier that, at
the book signing that your--

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:48.550
the English language translation of
your current book is a bit longer

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.280
and I wasn't sure if
you were joking or not.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.580
Is that true?

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.880
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: No, it is true.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.660
&gt;&gt; Could you go talk about--
more about the translation?

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.960
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: I'm being nailed

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.960
for the things I said
previously to this.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.320
But next time, I will
be shut up [inaudible].

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:10.000
No, the-- I think that the book
is a living animal, you know,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.380
and I think that the book is
not a work of art or something

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:19.080
that was dictated by this thing,
Holy Spirit, or any of that crap

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.220
that comes from the 19th Century.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:27.860
I think that the book is a register
of someone's mind working during

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:33.230
that period of time and that time
was being the book, you know.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.590
In that sense, as I speak
English well with an awful accent

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:41.710
but I write very well in English
or very competently, I could have,

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.210
in the two years of difference
between the launching of the book

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.300
in Spanish and the
publishing of the translation,

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:51.520
reality changes a little bit
so I was able to add a couple

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.400
of chapters, maybe I
think three chapters

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.990
to the book in English, you know.

00:43:55.990 --> 00:44:00.010
And they are written in English
and there is one about the names,

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.440
for example, that doesn't
exist in the Spanish.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.000
There is one about the sport.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.580
There are very few.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:09.540
And it is true too that as
people begin to read the novel,

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.780
people begin to discover that many
of the historical facts were not

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.620
that historical and there
was some backlash in Spanish

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.940
when people discover that
not everything was true.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.290
So, the novel in English
is much more clear about--

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.420
you will always be lost,
that's the idea, you know,

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.660
that you'll never know
what is real and what comes

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.140
from mystery and whatnot.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:37.510
But anyway, the original in English
is more pointed to the reader

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:39.850
that don't necessarily have

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:43.570
to believe what is
told there, you know.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.290
So, the novel in English
has like the instructions

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:49.230
to read the novel that
says like that.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.300
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: One more, yeah.

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.600
OK.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going to ask, I
know you said your interpretation

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.270
of the history and how your--

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:02.590
yeah, I almost share your lack
of just respect for authority

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:05.760
for authority's sake and
how you're not afraid

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.380
to challenge the university
because they're tagged

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.150
with as being in authority.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:13.020
You're saying that your
interpretation may be just as valid

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:16.900
as their interpretation may have
been or maybe even more accurate.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.340
And then you got into the
comedy in making, you know,

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.370 position:56%
laughing at that concept of history,
capital H, and the, you know,

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:29.610
the macho guy and what do you--
can you speak on comedy's ability

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.110 position:56%
to kind of depedestalize ?authority.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:36.180
And once you laugh at them,
there's a respect lost.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.480
So, could you speak on that?

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.590
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Could you
say just the question again?

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:45.260
&gt;&gt; Like comedy's ability,
like using laughter or like--

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.560
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Humor.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.860
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Humor.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.160
Oh, comedy's ability, comedy's--

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sort of using ridicule
to depedestalize authority.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:57.210
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: I think that
it were only a more effective tool

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:01.370
to defend against the
powerful ones, you know.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:07.070
We as citizens live oppressed and
destroyed by the institutions,

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:10.330
by the paternal feels,
but all of these things

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.830
that are there just fucking with
your freedom and your ability

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:16.710
to say things and your
capacity to have fun

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:20.610
and to listening to music in peace.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:23.650
So I think that the only we
have is laugh about them.

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:25.100
It's the only thing we can do.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:29.120
Still, the other one is a
revolution but [inaudible].

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:34.340
I've done enough with--
I would never recommend.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.990
[ Laughter ]

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:43.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for bringing
your books to us and all that you do

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:46.270
and I know that you're often
here in DC for different events

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:47.570
and I always get to see you.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.350
But this is the first
time I'm actually here

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:51.450
to see you talk about
one of your books.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:54.310
I have a question about
"Muerte subita."

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:57.080
There's one point in which you
interject yourself and it's clear

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.560
that it's you thinking out loud
and it's projecting yourself

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:04.810
through the book but you say
maybe this novel is trying to--

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:09.560
maybe this novel is about
how to tell this novel.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.630
Did you realize that when
you were writing the book

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:13.930
or were you intending to that be?

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:15.530
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: No, it's always

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:19.540
that I have always thought
and he's not myself.

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.000
It's fiction.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.300
It's all fiction.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.140
When I was writing the novel,
I was thinking in a narrator

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.290
that it's a person with
different experience than me.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.980
It's a novel about
beheadings, of course.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.470
If you write a novel
about Caravaggio,

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.750
there will be beheadings
all over the place.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.990
So, I was, in the novel,
I was thinking in the fear

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:43.450
of a Mexican poet whose one
of his kids was standing

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.200
in the wrong place the
wrong day when the--

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:50.430
and was brought by some fight
between drug dealing gangs

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:54.150
or something and he had
a brutal death, the kid.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:58.210
So, I was thinking about the
father when I was writing the novel

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:00.930
and I was trying to stand
on his feet, you know,

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:05.240
to be able to write this novel
that I don't know if you noticed

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.890
but he's a person that is
tremendously disappointed

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:09.940
and depressed, the narrator.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.010
I am not and I still believe
that there's a way to cure this

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:15.420
and I still believe
that I'm not depressed.

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.500
And when I'm depressed, I drink
a coffee and I'm happy again.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:23.780
But believe me, the narrator
of the novel is that, you know,

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.160
that it's something that I believe.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.400
I think that what novels are about,
that was your first question,

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.050
is about how they were
told, you know.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.590
I think that since [inaudible],
all the books are the book

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:39.040
in these structures, you know, or
all the books I like are the books

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.220
that reteach you how to
read literature, you know,

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.570
and that's the wonder
of the novel, too.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.680
Every novel is the first and
the last novel that was written.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.770
Since that's the gift,
the enormous gift

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:52.720
that Cervantes gave us, you know.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.440
So, a form that is so
free and so malleable,

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.720
that every novel will be the
ultimate novel, you know.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.690
Every novel is always experimental

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:04.710
because it cannot be
equal to any other.

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:10.170
All of that is there, of course,
in the voice of the narrator.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:13.510
But I have problems with
that because that paragraph

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.890
that is quoted always,
always, always,

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:18.500
begins in I don't know
what this book is about.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:23.160
And imagine the very
resentful reviewers

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:26.010 position:56%
of Amazon can do with that sentence.

[Inaudible], three seconds.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.100
&gt;&gt; OK. I just want to say I'm
a new reader to your work.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.580 position:56%
I really enjoy the book especially
how it's set up with all the duality

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:53.010
in it, the old world versus new
world and Spanish versus Italian.

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:56.400 position:56%
I'm really looking forward to
reading more of your work and I want

00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:01.630
to know what is available for
me that has been translated

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.280
and what is kind of in the
translation process that's

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.580
still coming?

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.220
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue: Well, I spoke
about the translation process,

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.660
the only book that you
can get in English--

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.960
&gt;&gt; It's "Hypothermia."

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.260
It was the only one
I was able to find.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.560
&gt;&gt; Alvaro Enrigue:
It's "Hypothermia."

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.910
That is a very fun book about-- and
this would touch, in two seconds,

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:19.640
the problem of translation.

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:23.580
"Hipotermia" in Spanish
is a novel and in English,

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.410
it's a book of short stories.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:26.710
It's a mystery.

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:28.110
It's a total mystery.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:31.910
I don't know how that happened
because I read English perfectly

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:36.370
and I work with my translators and
I work in this one and somehow,

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:39.250
"Hipotermia" in English
is a short stories novel

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:40.690
but you can read it too as a novel.

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:43.400 position:56%
The original one is read as a novel.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.310
It's just that the characters
changed but the time evolution

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:51.350
and the way in which their lives
keep going is always linear

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:52.650
as in the novel.

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:54.860

I will give you the
email of my publisher.
