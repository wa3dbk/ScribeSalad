&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.160
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Good
afternoon everyone, come on.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.600
It's wonderful to see you, yes.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.160
My name is Martha Kennedy, for
those of you who don't know,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.090
and I'm very pleased to welcome you

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.780
to the 2017 Salon Fellow's
Lecture today.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.260
This program is sponsored by the
Swann Foundation for Caricature

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.170
and Cartoon, and the Prints
and Photographs Division.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.750
The Swann Foundation is one of
the few that provides support

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.370 position:56%
for scholarly graduate research, in
the field of caricature and cartoon.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.120
And it does this through
annually awarded fellowships.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.100
Since 1977 the foundation
has been an important part

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.770
of the library's graphic program.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.260
The foundation underwrites a
number of initiatives relating

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.570
to these art form,
here at the library.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.680
And they include preservation
and processing

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.210
of the library's comic art,
development of these collections,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.900
related public presentations and
many exhibitions that are mounted

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.540
in the graphic arts
gallery, and other spaces

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.640 position:56%
in the Library's Jefferson
Building, in fact, there are several

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.240
up right now, and I encourage
you to go and see them.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.930
I should say that this is being
filmed for future broadcast

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.300
on the library's website
and at the media.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.560
We encourage you to ask questions
and offer comments, after the talk.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.060
But, please realize that if
you participate in the Q and A,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.800
you are consenting to be --
you're consenting to the library,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.560
possibly using your
film image and remarks.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.670 position:56%
Today's speaker; Elizabeth Nijdam
is a PHD candidate in the department

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.200
of Germanic Languages
Interpreters, at the University

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.080
of Michigan, at Ann Harbor.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.690
The research focuses on
German Comics after 1989,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.270
and the desertion traces
eastern men artistic traditions

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.820
into the post-unification
comics of Anke Feuchtenberger

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.030
and [foreign language] and
these artists are members --

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.490
were members, or are members

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.270
of an opposition artist group
called PJH [foreign language],

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.280
which I believe it's
translated as Gloom Future,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.380
I think it's an interesting name.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.670
Elizabeth's research
has been published

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.970
in the International
Journal of Comic Art,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.820
and World Literature today, she has
worked extensively, also on Comics

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.140
on the Classroom, and in
fact published a chapter

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.770
on teaching German History
with graphic novels,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.000
and a book entitled class
-- please open your comics.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.850
She currently serves as Secretary
for the Executive Committee

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.970 position:56%
of the International Comic Arts
School, and she's a member at large,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.380
of the Executive Board of the
Comics Studies Society's Graduate

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.400
Students Contest.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.960
On October of this year, she will
start work on her book project,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.430
entitled Panel Pasts, East
German History and Memory

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.620
in the German Graphic
Novel, and she will do this

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.220
as a post-doctorate fellow in the
Berlin Program for advance German

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.640
and European Studies, at the
Freie Universität Berlin.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.920
It is been a pleasure for me to
introduce Elizabeth, to resources

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.190
and PNP and some other
divisions here at the library.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.510
Her lecture today is titled,
It's not just horror and black;

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.760
The Comics of Anke Feuchtenberger
and Their Many Expressionisms.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.620
Please join me in welcoming
Elizabeth.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.340
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Nijdam: Thank you for
that wonderful introduction and I'd

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.290
like the Swann Foundation, and the
Prints and Photographs Division

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.160
for inviting me here today,
it's been a wonderful week

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.530
up in the PNP reading room,
where I've taken many photographs

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.190
of the first eight issues
of Raw, and you'll be able

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.490
to see those photographs

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.370
in my presentation today every time
you see my thumb or my fingers,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.020
those are the photographs
that I took here

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.420
at the Library of Photographs.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.840
So, this part of my
dissertation and presentation,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.880
and talk today would
have been impossible

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.220
without this experience here.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.990
These panels are from
the early sequential art

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.110 position:56%
of Anke Feuchtenberger, and each
driven graphic artist who is trained

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.370
in the German Democratic
Republic, but began making comics

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.950
in the United Germany after
the fall of the Berlin Wall.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.360
Beyond the very fact that she
embraced the comic's medium,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.360 position:56%
which was an artistic form virtually
non-existent for adult audiences

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.520
in Socialist East Germany,
a striking feature

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.520
of its work is its German
Expressionist visual rhetoric.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.170
Feuchtenberger sequential
art emulates the aesthetic

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.500
of the wood cap print, the
claustrophobic and angular space

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.390
of German expressionist
cinema, and the deformed bodies

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.280 position:56%
and elongated appendages of the work

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.110
of German expressionist
artist, [foreign language].

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.280
Feuchtenberger's comics
were called the aesthetics

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.560
of the German modernism
of the early 20th century,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.980
but interestingly this
is a visual language

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.810
that predates her artistic
production

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.950
by more than seven decades.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.830
Comments on the role
and significance

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.940
of Feuchtenberger's expressionist
visual rhetoric, and not unusual

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.070
on the discourse surrounding
German comics after 1989.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.250
In the exhibition catalogue
for the Goethe-Institut comics,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.850 position:56%
manga and co, from 2010 for example,

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.450
and the [foreign language]
attributes the quote,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.770
"Return of German comics
to the emergence

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.770
of East German graphic
artist in the scene",

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.290
observing that Anke
Feuchtenberger and other members

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.280
of the graphics art collective PJH
[foreign language] were not the

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.200
whole boom to the economic demands
of successful comics production,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.490
due to the work of graphic artists,
which granted them the space

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.680
to experiment in the comics medium.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.320
He continues his assessment
of the renovations,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.730
by implicating the quote
on quote, "Solid education

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.530
in the East German graphics arts",
which he writes, "Instructed them

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.600
in techniques such as hand process,
wood cut, and leno-cut printing,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.370
calligraphy and book design,
quote, "Had long been abandoned

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.670
by West German art colleges,

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.290
and other educational
establishments", end quote.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.800
Perhaps is there, but situates the
technical and aesthetic innovations

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.220
of Feuchtenberger and other
East German artists working

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.450
in the comic's medium, in
their training at the JDR,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.370 position:56%
in the Nation's Artistic Traditions.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.490
Perhaps it is that his
observation reflect the importance

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.170
of Feuchtenberger and
other East German Artists,

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.720
in redefining German
comics after 1989.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.440
However, lacks new ones.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.280 position:56%
So, here is the list of three
artist collectives that were founded

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.500
in the '1990s and that's to the
individual names where it says EG,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.170
or those East Germans
that participate

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.620 position:56%
in the forming of these collectives.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.060
While the techniques these artists
mastered in the DDR informs some

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.890
of her aesthetic experiments.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.380
Feuchtenberger expressionist
influences were not entirely born

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.550
of her East German
artistic training, in fact,

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.930
the expressionist visual rhetoric
of Feuchtenberger's poster art,

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.620
and graph curation after 1989
looks nothing like the experiments

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.910
and neo expressionism that occurred
the last few decade on the DDR.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.570
So, here at the bottom we have
to give examples of painting,

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.530
that's sort of being mobilized
on the expressionism aesthetic,

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.360
and then we two posters
in the right hand side.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.070
This presentation, therefore
complicates plat houses

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.310
implications, that German comics
were reborn, as a consequence

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.710
of Fauchtenberger and
other artist training

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.780
in the East German graphic arts,
studying alternative comics

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.740 position:56%
and especially arch speak on them in
France by my rule is Raw magazine,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.840
as an important but unacknowledged
factor in the development

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.950
of Feuchtenberger's
expressionist aesthetics.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.760
Furthermore, it illustrates
how Feuchtenberger's adoption

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.750
and adaptation of an
expressionist visual rhetoric.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.400
Can ask 100 expressionist
artistic styles,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.330
including early German
expressionism,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.630
East German Neo-Expressionism, and
the Expressionist Visual Rhetoric

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.310
of American Alternative Comics,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.710
to simultaneously distant
her post 1989 work

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.150
from her East German training,

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.340
while also setting
incorporating elements of it.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.710
I've examined how this engagement

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.570
of multiple expressionism
complicates assertions

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.000
of West German cultural hegemony
after 1989, aligning this project

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.740
with Scholarship of Paul Cook,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.390
my analysis of Feuchtenberger's
Graphic innovation demonstrates the

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.440
importance of East German to stick
traditions, and in the Agency

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.120
of East German Artists, alongside
with international innovations

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.690
in comics art, and
redefining its fears of quote,

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.420
"Western artistic production
after 1989".

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.780
r in terminology from
cultural theorist "I argue

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.320
that the sequential
art of Feuchtenberger

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.540
and other East German
graphic artists there

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.900
by produce a hybrid space
of cultural production,

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.460
where East German artistic
practice has got subverted

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.560
to Western artistic traditions,
but operated in tandem with them.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.830
And representing East
Germany since unification.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.960
Paul Cook engages post-colonial
theory to understand the faith

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.030
of East German Culture in
Post-unification Germany.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.330
He pauses that the process

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.380
of Germany Unification has been
presented as a quasi-subjugation

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.730
of East by the West, where
West Human Culture has remained

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.700
hegemonic, and East German culture
has been suppressed, ignored,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.780
and systematically erased.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.250
Most notably articulated
in a book called,

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.850
[foreign language] called it a
volume, called [foreign language]

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:20.050 position:56%
which means colonization of the DDR.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.400
These authors describe
post-unification circumstances

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.160
of East German Culture, in
conventionally colonialist terms.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.910
Studying the dismantling of the
East German economic system,

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.480
development of a new
social hierarchy,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.550
featuring important leaders
from the federal republic,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:38.410 position:56%
and the systematic denigration of
local practices, collective identity

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.640
and shared morals as evidence.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.540
Cook continues, however, to comment
on how limiting the perception

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.450 position:56%
of unification of this -- perception
of the unification may be,

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.390
remarking that the
relationship between East

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.070
and West German regions,
is much more complex

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.730
than Post-colonial
theory may suggest.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.720 position:56%
Ultimately, he observes that the
colonization of East Germany is more

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.430
about the perception and
representation of the East,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.450
West German relationship than
the reality of the situation.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.790
However, this perception

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.430
of colonized East Germany
has important consequences

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.260 position:56%
on the way East and West Germans,
quote, "Relate to the unified state,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.740
and the legacy of the
past" end quote.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.930
Co-opting [inaudible]
cultural hybridity,

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.240
allows me to examine the impact of
East German artistic traditions,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.410
on Post-Unification German comics.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.140
Well, also highlighting
the importance

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.510 position:56%
of other expressionist traditions
and the development of a hybrid form

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.520
of post-unification and
cultural production.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.420
Feuchtenberger's theories Barmi
und Klett, is an excellent example

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.580 position:56%
of the emergence of the early German
Expressionist visually rhetoric

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.880
in our work.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.430
The four narratives of bam
and flat Barmi und Klett,

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.140
span her first four
publications Schrage Schwestern;

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.980
a 1993 collection of comics from
German speaking female artists

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:57.610
like [foreign language], Herzhaft
and Lebenslanglich, also published

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.470
in 1993 part of the
crunch series edited

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.380
by Attacks Brother, Martin Barbara.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.360
Mutterkuchen, Feuchtenberger's
first official publication

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.450
by Joham Enterprises [phonetic]
in 1995, and Die kleine Dame,

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.800
the artist's first collaboration
with [foreign language] published

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.290
in 1997, it features the real
narrative of a mother and child,

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.370
as they traverse a frightening
reality of strange nightmares

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.440
and mysterious men,
in an alien 80 world.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.970
The narratives are highly
imaginative and symbolic,

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.280
offering allegoric interpretations
of the relationship between mother

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.470
and child, and man and woman.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.820
Her aesthetic devolves over the
half decade of her production,

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.840
but each graphic narrative
maintains an equivalent link

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.710
to German expressionism.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.450
The bodies Feuchtenberger
represents, feature sharp angles

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.950
and elongated appendages, the
spaces in which the action unfolds,

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.750
are constricted and
claustrophobic, and the perspective

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.680
from which the images are
drawn is angled sharply

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.060
to the picture plane changing
dramatically between panels.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.980
German expressionism, a leading
style of German modernism,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.850
relates to a number
of related movements

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.180
that emerged before
the First World War,

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.930
but reached their peak during the
'1920s, defined by visual rhetoric

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.970
of sharp angles, deep
shadows, and dramatic contrast

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.410
to real landscapes, extensive
symbolism, and emotive

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.690
and often unrealistic
representation.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.500
It emphasizes personal
expression over objective reality,

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.880
characterized by simplified

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.750
or distorted forms
of exaggerated color.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.910
However, a defining characteristic
that set expressionism apart

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.500
from other modernist movements,
and indeed, almost any other period

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.600
of our history, was this
dedication to print making,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.890
and works on paper in general.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.520
The wood cut print was an
invaluable tool of the movement,

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.350
and as expressionists encouraged,
essentially every painter

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.980
of the period turned
to the graphic arts.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:58.100 position:56%
With an emphasis in geometric forms,
accompanied by alternating patterns,

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:03.610
solid color, and carve patterns
produced texture shading and depth.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.080
The aesthetic of the wood cut print

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.080
and its variance are immediately
recognizable, and associated

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.160
with German expressionism.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.070
In Feuchtenberger's 1993 [foreign
language] graphic narrative,

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:21.920
featured in [foreign language] the
protagonist that may see in a body,

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.640
is represented topless
with unusually long arms,

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.560 position:56%
and unrealistically sharp shoulders,
recurring to angularity, nudity,

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.880
and even tiny nipples, of Austrian
expressionist painter [inaudible].

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.010
The panel's perspective
changes dramatically

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.300
and the readers observes the
protagonist's search happen

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.140
from four different angles
across the first five panels

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.120
of the search for treasure.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.190 position:56%
The second panel of the series
features a perspective from directly

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.600
in front of the protagonist,
the viewpoint in position,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.590
perhaps in part of the
figure's mid-section.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.290
The third and fourth panels
feature aerial views, however,

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.650
Feuchtenberger complicates
this representation of space,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.410
by making elements
of the scene visible,

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.230
with a contradictive
perspective of view from above.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.140
For example, the second panel
presents the reader with both --

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.600
with the view of both, the
top of the protagonist head,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.480
and the bottom of her left foot.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.210
Furthermore, the architecture
behind the protagonist is towering

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.050
over her, and threatening to
break out of the picture plane.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.350
Well, the flat surfaces

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.620
of the building's uppermost levels
are also visible to the viewer.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.580
Again, in the third panel, space
seems to be folding in on itself,

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.030
where the viewer's perspective
is simultaneously looking

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.600
up from the ground, with
side obscured by plant life,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.470
while also looking down from
above, with the back of the head

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.370
of both the mother
and child visible,

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.830
as they bend down to
inspect the earth.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.780
But, the panel start geometric
impulse, the claustrophobic

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:50.030
and collapsing spaces, angular and
non-parallel architectural aligns,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.320
and dramatic and changing
perspectives; Feuchtenberger's art,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.070
echoes the aesthetic of
expressionist cinema.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.480 position:56%
Specifically, recalling the films --

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:03.470
those of the Cabinet of
Doctor Caligari, from 1920.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.040
Barmi und Klett, distorted
landscapes, collapsing

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.290
and claustrophobic architectural
spaces, irregular lightning,

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.510
deep shadows and imaginative
city escapes, narrative aesthetic

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.830
of the dark and distressing
stories of early German cinema.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.200
However, the overwhelming
expressionist impression

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.920
of Feuchtenberger's art, really,
it's not to the panels construction

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.930
of space, nor how the
figures angular

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.410
and elongated proportions recall
expressionist painting; rather,

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.290
it's Feuchtenberger's style
of artistic representation,

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.590
which mimics the visual vocabulary
of early 20th century engravings

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.310
that echoes German
expressionism on a formal level,

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.800
and specifically the
art of wood printing.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.730
Like the founders

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.120
of the expressionist artist group
[foreign language] Ernst Ludwig

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.230
Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff,
Erich Heckel, [foreign language].

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.380
The space represented in
Feuchtenberger's work is textured

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.760
with repetitive geometric forms
that flatter the picture plane,

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.330
and pattern, and line
work that develops death.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.180
Well, the bodies depicted
are sharp and angular,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.730
with elongated proportions.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:13.820
Feuchtenberger's panels flat and
dense planes of black and white,

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.970
stand in stark contrast
to the textures she builds

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.950
in the background and
foreground of her images.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.510
Her line work is clear, with bold
demarcations that rarely blur

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.660
or fade into the background, and
she develops her deviation in tone,

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.860 position:56%
saturation in shape, through complex
patterns of cross hatching dots,

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.360 position:56%
and parallel and non-parallel lines.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.320
Feuchtenberger's sense of space
there by simultaneously flatten --

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.860
is flattened through the planes of
black and white, in a sign depth,

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.430
through the intricate pattern work.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:46.080
This visual style is particularly
logical on Barmi und Klett series,

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.970 position:56%
but Feuchtenberger's novelization of
the wood print aesthetic is apparent

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:56.110
in all of her work,
between 1993 and 2003.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.410
Well, Feuchtenberger's black

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.200
and white parallel
recalls the print work

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.810
of [foreign language] her
emphasis on the female body,

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.910
and intimate relationship
between mother and child,

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.150
echoes the engravings of
another important impressionist

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:11.340 position:56%
and print maker; Kathe Kollwitz, and
the sequentiality of her art points

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.570
to the influence of fans,
[inaudible], wood cuts.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.350
Yet, despite the implication
of this artistic strategy;

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:21.770 position:56%
in reference to the Feuchtenberger's
wood cut print aesthetic,

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:26.510
she does not employ the technical
aspects of such print making,

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.140
instead, she mobilizes as
a characteristic texture

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.750
of impressionist engraving,

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.990
painstakingly reproducing
the geometry

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.820
and detail patterning
of the medium by hand.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.880
She thereby, creates works that
emulate the print making culture

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.360
of Germany, before World
War One, but still,

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.110
undeniably possessed traces
of the artist's hands,

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.110
the artist's signature
style, and the influences

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.880
in the Post World War One
period, until modern day.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.980
In fact, the wood cut
print aesthetic is just one

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.100
of many expressionist's influences
that he artists integrate,

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.130
producing unique visual aesthetic.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.250
In line with [foreign language]
contention, Feuchtenberger's trying

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.600
to do expressionism might
not seem surprising,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.520
considering her graphic
arts training,

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.330
at the Kunsthochschule Berlin
license, during the most radical

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:15.330
and experimental decade
of DDR artistic practice.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:21.370
East German poster art is
often naively -- back --

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.460
is often natively associated
of the artistic mandates

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.270
of socialist realism, however,
it was in fact, in artistic space

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.660
that had its own set of
modernist aesthetics,

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.180
that allowed room for
experimentation.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.450
Furthermore, after the
'1970s, when the legacy

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.680
of East Germany expressionism
was officially adopted

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.090
into East German aesthetic
traditions.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.860
Expressionism became an
important mode of representation,

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.070
in all areas of each
German artistic practice.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.680
However, while the East German
neo-expressionism of the '1970s

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.510
and '1980s could be written in to
the legacy of German expressionism,

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.040
its relationship with early
German modernism was flopped,

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.440
and evolved to look very different
than the aesthetic strategies

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.850
of expressionists that were popular

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.100
in the first three decades
of the 20th century.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.860
I would definitely like to
spend the next few minutes,

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.650
outlying the integration
of German modernism,

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.730
and specifically German
expressionism,

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.030
into East Germany's art history.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.310
In the immediate post war
period, very few styles

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.890
and differences existed between the
occupied zones of divided Germany,

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.560
where all artistic production
attempted to distance itself

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.270
from the Nazi past, through a
number of aesthetic practices.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:39.880
However, already in 1946, cultural
ambassadors began encouraging the

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.570
Soviet occupied sector, to
adopt Soviet socialist realism,

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.960
as the model for Post War
German artistic production.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.150
With the founding of the DDR
in 1949, the salinization

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.810
of art was institutionalized in
the battle against capitalism.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:57.890
Two years later, the Socialist
Unity Party of Germany, or the SED;

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.190
adopted policy against
formalism, and in 1953,

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:05.340 position:56%
socialist realism became the
official cultural policy of the DDR.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.330
By 1960, however, the SED began
to re-evaluate the position

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:13.260
on the proto-revolutionary
art of the pre-war period,

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.570
and began sponsoring working groups

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.960
that would reverse
DDR's cultural policy,

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.670
land bashing German modernism,
and instigate the liberalization

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:25.330
of the party's cultural politics,
over the following decades.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.010
And its opening address
for the symposium

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.600
at the Hamburg Universitate in
Berlin, in November of 1960,

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.140
a historian [foreign language]
provided his reconsideration

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.690
of the history of German
proletarian revolutionary art.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.870
He spoke about the tradition as it
harkens back to the 19th century,

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.580
and culminated in the work

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.160
of [foreign language] who'd
previously had been harshly

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.990
criticizing, and not regarded
the positive contributor

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.740
to socialist realism.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.380
In direct contradiction to the
origins of socialist realist art,

00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.420
publicized in the '1950s,
[inaudible] sided the origins

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.830
of German's socialist realism, with
the founding of the communist party

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:08.210
or KPD in 1919, and those
artists aligned with the party

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.640 position:56%
in creating proto-revolutionary art.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.970
Who have also identified the key
components of socialist realism,

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.760
which thematizes the
worker with the goal

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.990
of awakening the worker's
movement in Germany, well,

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:24.340
also maintaining organic and
inorganic tie between the people

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.130
and art, but importantly,

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.770
he prescribed no specific
medium or style.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.060
Moreover, he considered
Käthe Kollwitz,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.780
as notably German expressionist,
memorial wood cut,

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:41.070 position:56%
for Karl Liebknecht, as exemplary
of the origins of socialist realism.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.390
And acknowledges the
German expressionist members

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.930
of the Association of Revolutionary
Visual Artists of Germany;

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.940
George Grosz, John
Heartfield, Rudolf Schlichter,

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.210
[foreign language], Otto
Nagel, Oscar [inaudible],

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.270
as having the most
significant contribution

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.830
to East German socialist realism.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:03.160
April 1964, marks the turning
point in East German Aesthetics.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.960
At the fifth congress for --

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.340
[ Foreign Language ]

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.180
Organization of Fine Artists,

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.540
our historian [inaudible] found
sculptor Fritz Klein [phonetic]

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.900
in live cigar cellar painting,

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.420
[foreign language] shocked
administrators and members,

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.660
by attacking the East
German cultural policy

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.190
that rejected methods of modernism
as unusable for socialism.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:30.830
Warnings that artistic stagnation
and provincialism would lead --

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.890
would result from SED policies.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.990
Isaac [phonetic] spoke in favor
of artistic experimentation

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.120
with modern artistic styles,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.520
he believed artistic freedom
would be given back --

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.440
should be given back to
the artist, and artists,

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:48.060
not politicians should decide
the constituted communist art.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.000
Isaac was harshly criticized
for its comments, and was forced

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.010
to subsequently release a
self-criticism six months later,

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.590
to prove his loyalty to the party.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.180
Official aesthetic
artistic doctoring,

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.460
did however, begin to lose him.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:08.210
In his article, [foreign language],
in 1964, Siegfried Wagner,

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:12.020
editor and chief of the SED art
publication [foreign language]

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.040
brought that many artistic
paths could lead to realist art.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.750
With the statement
being more important

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.300
than the realistic representation.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.390
Ultimately, was this perspective
on socialist realist art,

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.110
that [foreign language]
sanctioned in its close remarks,

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.600
the fourth conference
of the Central Committee

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.790
of the SED, on December 17, 1971.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.540
Where he concluded that,
quote, "If one starts

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.290
out from the solemn position of
socialism, then there cannot be

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:44.010 position:56%
in my view, any taboos in the fields
of art and literature that applies

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:49.020
to both the shaping of the
content, and of style", end quote.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.270
His election marked an official
shift in cultural policy,

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.460
and even though, the
surficial opening act

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.510
of cultural policy
only lasted until 1976,

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.910
when both [foreign language]
was expatriated, also resulting

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.950
in a mass exodus of artistic
and intellectual figures,

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.800
emigrating out of East Germany,
and let the lasting impact

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.090
on all East German
artistic production to come.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.100
While the aesthetics in modernism
came under attack again, and again,

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.830 position:56%
from the '1970s onwards, the SED
officially changed their perspective

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.700
on the preview art of
the [foreign language].

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.460
Seeking to legitimize
socialist realism, by claiming

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.630
and actually stand out
of the expressionist art

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.540
of the Proletarian
Revolutionary Artists,

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.580
and the same artist's
anti-fascist art

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.740
of the immediate post war period.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.040
Cultural authorities began

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.480
to incorporate the socially
conscious art of the also artist,

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.730
and the German Avant Garde,
into the artistic tradition

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.430
of socialist realism.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.330
Consequently all pre-war humanist

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:50.390 position:56%
and anti-fascist art was
reinterpreted in the '1970s onwards,

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.670
as early socialist art;
that's creating a continuity

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.850
between the socialist realism of
the day, and the artistic practices

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.720
of early German modernism.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.040
Feuchtenberger's education in
the last decade of the DDR,

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.910
had already incorporated
this lineage

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.200
of early German expressionism.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.520
New expressionist aesthetics, were
therefore, no longer the radical

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:16.340
and alternative visual, rather they
were in the '1960s and the '1970s,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.920
in the sense they would
still use the language

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.770
that would become convention
in some forms

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.620
of East German artistic production.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:28.160
This was especially true in DDR's
poster art, and specifically

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.860
in the genre of theater posters,
which was both an important part

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.650
of Feuchtenberger's
training in the graphic arts,

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:39.560
and an essential avenue of
income for her, after 1989.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.550
Yet, like her comics;
Feuchtenberger's comics

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:45.310
after 1989 looked nothing
like the new expressionist art

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.610
of East Germany.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:51.620
And pairing Feuchtenberger's
pre and post 1989 work,

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.670
illuminates the shift
in her aesthetics.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.110
So, if you guys can see
here, we have two posters

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:01.570
that she created right after
of the Wall; '91 and '92,

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:05.240
and this is the final project
that she did to graduate

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.620
from her art school, where she did
a series of promotional materials

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.420
for a Soviet Sun Festival,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:16.220
as it's the only remaining
example they're holding from 1980.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:20.300 position:56%
And then, to compare to sort of
what she's been doing more recently,

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.580
in 2006 and 2003, she's
in her return to charcoal,

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.880
and sort of a more round

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:31.430
and realistic representational
mode for figures.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.270
So, you can see how -- a
dramatic shift happened

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.470
after 1989 in her work.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:46.310
Even though, Feuchtenberger
was trained during '1980s

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:49.010
in Kunsthochschule in poster
art, with the aesthetics

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.370
of her poster art before
1989 aligning

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.950
with the representational modes
of East Germany neo-expressionism,

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:59.190
her graphic art after 1989 does not
emulate this vision of language.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.320
Instead, Feuchtenberger embraces
the aesthetic of the wood cut print

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.470
on early German expressionism.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.970
Contradicting frat houses claim
that an explicit continuity exists

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.590
between Feuchtenberger's training
and East German graphic arts,

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.500
and her innovation
in graphic narration

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.430
after the fall of Berlin Wall.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:19.330
The exact words of Feuchtenberger's
style innovations were not entirely

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.070
born of her East German training

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.450
and the expressionist
aesthetics specific to the DDR

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.160
on the '1970s, and '1980s.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.780
Instead, Feuchtenberger
visual rhetoric is embedded

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.000
to an earlier form of
German expressionism,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.650
that predated the DDR altogether.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.780
Looking into the expressionism art
of the proto-collective and artists

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.800
such as Frans Masereel,
Kathe Kollwitz, Otto Dix,

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.730
George [foreign language],
the question remains however;

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.510
why a really German modernism?

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.770 position:56%
How did Feuchtenberger came to adopt
an early German expressionist visual

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.030
style on her artistic
production after 1989?

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.480
And what factors led this artists
and others to mimic the aesthetic

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.230
of the wood cut print, instead of
another form of representation?

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:04.710
And it's often been acknowledged,
that the turn to comics

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.720
by Feuchtenberger and other
members of PJH [foreign language],

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.500 position:56%
was inspired by their introduction
to the Avant Garde comics anthology,

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.550
RAW, which they began
reading after 1989.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.890
Something Feuchtenberger
hesitated to.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:25.150
Yet, comments on their visual
aesthetics nevertheless assert its

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:29.170
embeddedness in East
German graphic arts.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.530
Considering that Feuchtenberger art
bears striking resemblances to some

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.270
of the alternative comics
published in RAW magazine

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.990
in the '1980s and the '1990s.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.940 position:56%
It appears that American alternative
comics inspired Feuchtenberger

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.620 position:56%
to adopt more than the comic's form.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:50.240
So, here on the left we have Mark
Bayer, spelled wrong actually,

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.800
and on the right we have Mark
Caro, we'll be seeing more

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.290
of their work as we continue.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:02.160 position:56%
When the Wall fell in 1989;
Feuchtenberger moved to West Berlin,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.100
to continue her artistic endeavors

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.900
with other PJH [foreign
language] members --

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.400
[ Foreign language ]

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.120
Like many East Germans at the
time, they became quickly inundated

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.740
with the West German and
American cultural material

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.180
that they had not had
access to in East Germany,

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.320
one such document was the American
alternative comic's anthology, RAW;

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.080
produced by Art Spiegelman
and Françoise Mouly.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.670
East Germany had a
cozy comic's culture,

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:35.700
the children's comic books series
Mosaique [foreign language]

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:41.100
for example, here we have
two issues of Mosaique,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.310
both which began in 1955.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:47.020
The medium was referred
to as [foreign language]

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.140
and picture stories, and no comics
for adult audiences existed.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.120
The discovery of RAW by this group

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.090
of artists was therefore
transformative.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:59.550
In addition to introducing Avant
Garde European and American comics

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.610
to the art collective, RAW magazine
demonstrated the possibilities

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:06.250
of the expressionist visual
rhetoric in the comics form.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.290
The obvious aesthetic
and narrative parallels

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:12.170
between the sequential arts of
Feuchtenberger in the comics of --

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:17.060
here we go -- [foreign
language], see?

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:23.060 position:56%
And the -- the comics of Mark Bayer
and Mark Caro, both published in RAW

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.680
for example, leads us to question;
how did international trends

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.380
in comic's production informed
Feuchtenberger adoption

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.580
of early German modernism?

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.180
The volume section
of this presentation,

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.810
therefore positions Feuchtenberger
artistic innovations alongside

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.560
developments in the
alternative comics --

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.220
alternative comics internationally,
looking into the myriad

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.730
of expressionist visual
rhetoric's published in RAW,

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.030
as an important factor in
Feuchtenberger adoptions

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.330
of the aesthetics of
the wood cut print.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:57.170
The visual rhetoric of
expressionism has been familiar

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:01.370 position:56%
to the American comics, since Will
Eisner's adoption and popularization

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:05.080
of the graphic novel
in 1978, after all,

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.980
it was the expressionist
wood cut novels of Le Noir

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.980
that inspired Eisner
in his production

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.730
of the supposed first graphic
novel -- a contract got.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.770
And later, Art Spiegelman's mouth,

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.770
the Pulitzer Prize
winning graphic novel

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.210
that put comics on
the proverbial map.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.120
However, Spiegelman's
first experiments

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.960
in expressionism predate
even Eisner's canonical text,

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.320
when he first produced his
experimental four page comic.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.730
Prisoner on Hell Planet in 1972,

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:39.160
and Real Dream three
years later in 1975.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.260
While there's no way to talk
conclusively about the adoption,

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.330
specific representational
styles during different periods

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:49.060
of comic history, artistic choices
often conceded throughout history

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.230
trends, and it is safe to say
that there's some clear aesthetic

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:55.100 position:56%
and thematic differences that emerge
between the underground comics

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.770
and alternative comic scenes.

00:32:56.770 --> 00:33:01.110
The underground comics of the
late '1960s and '1970s sought

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:04.760
to push back on the restrictions
of the comics code of the '1950s,

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.530
which stipulated no sex, no
violence, and no social relevance,

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:12.540
to the emphasize leftist politics,
and the sexual and debates aspects

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.760
of the human nature, through
the themes of drug use, sex,

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.800
violence anti-Vietnam
protest and rock music.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:24.380
Epitomizing the work of Robert
Crumb, was at first only associated

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.670
with San Francisco comic scene,
but later became synonymous

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.150
with the underground
comic's movement as a whole.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.540
Crumb's crude, crass and
misogynist comic style,

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.150
defined both the archetypal
content of the period,

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.010
and the visual language
of its expression.

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.320
However, during the mid '1970s,

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.140
the underground comic
scene began to stagnate.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.770
When emerged underground comics
began to wane in popularity,

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.760
were generically known
as alternative comics.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.460
Generally speaking, they
were adult oriented comics,

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.540
sometimes science fiction,
auto biographical or horror,

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.440
but overall experimental
in forming content,

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.780
seeking political relevance,

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:06.340
and presenting increasingly a
sophisticated visual aesthetics.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.370
The lingering influence of
the period, came in the form

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:13.710
of a new Avant Garde comic;
typified in RAW magazine.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.860
First published in 1980 with the
print of around 45,000 copies;

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.980 position:56%
RAW introduced a new generation of
experimental comic's artists working

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.180
in a variety of visual languages.

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:28.490
Artistic style within
RAW very dramatically,

00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:30.670
with regular contributions
by a number of artists

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.180
over the first eight
issues of the first volume,

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:36.360
including the scratching,
expressive punk-rock style comic,

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:43.100
Jimbo by Gary Panter, who is quoted
king of the ratline, end quote.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.810
The delicate incautious of Ben,
captures the pointless position

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:50.950
of Drew Friedman, the grotesque
and deformed bodies of Mark Bayer,

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:54.220
the bold, clear lines of
Charles Burns, and the scratch

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:58.150
for illustrations of Scott
Gales, while also an homage

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:02.090
to her recruitment in MAD, with its
alt, capital, three letter title,

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.480
and similarly kinky by lines.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.060
RAW, was a lavishly produced
large format anthology

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:12.110
that was obviously intended
to be a work of art.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:16.530 position:56%
Its format, comparable to other New
York art scene tabloids of the time,

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.330
specifically Andy Warhol's
interview,

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:22.580
made it clear that Spiegelman
and Mouly's intention was

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.330
to show case the art
featured within the magazine.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:28.310
Spiegelman sought new talent,
directly from his class

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:33.180
at the School of Visual Arts, in
New York, including Mark Newgarden,

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.470
Drew Friedman and Cats,
many of whom,

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.660
engaged their formal arts
training in their production

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.830
of sequential arts,
more holistically

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.700
than earlier comic's artists.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.220
Thereby, lending the soft
preferentiality, artistic depth,

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.730
and formal complexity
of Avant Garde art

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.580
to the comic's production
show cased in RAW.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.480
The impact of RAW, and of
Art Spiegelman and Mouly,

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.700
in developing the alternative
comic scene, cannot be overstated,

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.160
as a collection of
cartoon and talent,

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.800
no other single comic's
production has ever equaled

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.150
RAW accomplishments.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:08.490
Flipping to the pages, it is
clear that the visual language

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.170
of alternative comics expanded
upon the visual rhetoric's

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:12.910
of the underground comic scene,

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.760
to incorporate new
and innovative styles.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.520
And so, this is one issue
of RAW, this is RAW five,

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:23.580 position:56%
and I took a picture of the first
page of every comic, or illustration

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.960
in the volume, so that you can
see how varied it really was.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.760
Underground comics
have shown artists

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.440 position:56%
that the comics form was not defined
by any particular age, group,

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.790
art style or subject
matter; however,

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:42.530
it was in alternative comics that
the visual language of the medium,

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:46.330 position:56%
really proliferated and diversified,
and importantly it was also

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.100
around this time that
an expressionist,

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:52.040
artistic language emerged, not only
engaged the composition angularity

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.420
and wood cut print aesthetic
of early German modernism,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:37:00.560
but it also featured a dramatic
shift in content as well.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.350
The center piece of RAW, was
Spiegelman's own story; Maus.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.990
Maus had previously
appeared in prototype form

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.290
in a three page comic,

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.480
in the underground comic's
magazine Funny Animals,

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.910 position:56%
published in 1972 by Apex Novelties.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:16.290
But, in RAW, it became
serialized graphic narrative,

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:19.270
published a chapter at a time.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.910
The comic recounted the story
of Spiegelman's father's Life

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:25.000
in Poland, an experience of the
holocaust, representing Jews

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.220
as mice, and Nazis as cats,
and the greatest antagonism

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.790
between Tom and Jerry ever pinned.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.790
Subverting the conventions
of the comic's medium,

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.660
to use Funny Animals, to represent
such serious subject matter,

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.300
was itself interventional.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.870
However, openly tackling
traumatic story

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:43.720
through the comic's
form was revolutionary.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.190
After winning the Pulitzer
Prize in 1992;

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.460
Spiegelman's Maus had
successfully proven

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.160
that comics could tell
important, accessible stories

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.950
that had absolutely nothing
to deal with super heroes.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.700
Maus, however, changed the content
and perception of the medium,

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.060
paving the way for
comics to be incorporated

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.020
into serious literate
discussion and academic study.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.110
They finally escaped the humor
shelves in commercial book stores.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.810
The representational mode of Maus,
also drew significant intention,

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.450
in contradiction to the
comical aesthetic positions,

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.940
suggested by the representation
of human figures as animals,

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.060
the visual language of the comic
itself is dark, dense and morbid.

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.680
The panels and images are
exclusively in black and white,

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.960
heavily shaded with cross hatching,
and solemn planes of color.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.030
Divergent for the earlier
visual rhetoric

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.100
of underground comics is clear,

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.410
as it's the quasi-expressionist
rendering of the figures.

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:40.790
All the space constructed
maintains an obvious adherence

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.420
to realistic representational
space, this shading;

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.590
simplicity of the line
work, and angularity

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.370
of the figure's bodies
is reminiscent

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.290
of expressionist engravings.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.630
Furthermore, when Art Spiegelman,
decided on the visual surface

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.850
of Maus, the artist
even sites the art

00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:00.160
of important German
expressionist George Grosz.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.590
This influence is made especially
explicit, when the panels

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.700
of the chapters of Maus featured on
RAW, are compared to the prototype

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:11.610
in Funny Animals, which featured
a more conventional strategy

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.800 position:56%
of portraying cartoon animals, while
also emulating the archetypal mode

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.760
of representation of underground
comics, in the stylization

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.090
of the figure's themselves.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:26.950 position:56%
Looking at the original printings of
the chapters in RAW; the connection

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:30.160
to the aesthetics of print making
is clear, both as a consequence

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.710
of the quality of the printing,
and in the cover chosen

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.270
for many issues themselves,

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:37.100
as well as in the enlarged
images Spiegelman selected

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.400
to show case for the work.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.960
So, what I found really interesting
about seeing these originals,

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.660
is when you see the anthology of
Maus, everything looks so clean,

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.980
but when you look at how
they originally printed,

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.500
because the quality of
the paper was not as high,

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.070
because it's a very
independent group of artists,

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.260
it just looks rougher
and scratchier,

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.900
so it was really interesting to
have access to these originals.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.950
However, returning to
Spiegelman's earliest incarnation

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.790
of the Maus narrative,
Prisoner on the Hell Planet,

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.070 position:56%
which not only inspired the visual
rhetoric of the subsequent chapters,

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:13.440
but also became part of the graphic
narrative itself, within RAW,

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.170
and later published with
the collection of chapters.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:19.490
Spiegelman's expressionist
influence is much easier to trace.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:23.620
In 1972, Spiegelman published
Prisoner on Hell Planet

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.620
in short order comics number one.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.580
As a powerful representation
of the suicide

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.030
of its concentration camp mother --

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.080
survival mother, Prisoner in
Hell Planet is remarkable,

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.130
for the way in which it deals
with the traumatic experience

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.270
as remembered by her son.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:45.180
However, it is not only the content
that lends power to the depiction,

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.480
it's also its mode

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.310
of representation,
decidedly expressionist.

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.100
Prisoner on Hell Planet was
drafted on scratch board,

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.740
a form of direct engraving, in
which the artist uses a sharp tool

00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.720
to scrape off dark ink, revealing
a white or colored layer beneath.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.590
Unlike conventional drawing,
scratch work requires the artist

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.660
to develop the image through
the addition of highlights,

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:11.060
and it's therefore -- thereby able
to reproduce the sharpness contrast

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.050
and texture of more
traditional forms of engraving,

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:18.310
without the painstaking process
of working with metal or wood.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:22.510 position:56%
However, the aesthetic produce often
mirrors the geometry and angularity

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:26.050
of other forms of engraving,
moreover, Art Spiegelman

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.790
in 2010 peers reviewed essay on the
expressionist wood cuts of Le Noir,

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.610
he situates his own work
in Maus, with a lineage

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.360
of expressionist wood
cut worthless novels.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.370
[inaudible] Ward is one
of his many inspirations.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:43.450
With the appearance of his
expressionist experiments

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:48.010
in arcade review, Real Dream in
1975, and later on RAW magazine;

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:51.820
Spiegelman fought to find the
parameters of the emergent genre,

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.230 position:56%
while also perhaps representing a
new direction of the visual language

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.550
of alternative comics thereafter.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:00.780
In fact, Spiegelman and
Eisner's initial novelization

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.140
of the style expressionism
and the aesthetics

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.040
of expressionist print making have
continued to influence comics.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.960
The dark angular and psychological
landscape of Batman, for example,

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.570
and specifically Tim Burton's film
for 1999 and 1992 inequitably draw

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:18.530
on expressionist visual
strategies as well as Film Noir,

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:21.760
which itself has its roots
in German expressionism.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.500
As is the work of other artist that
appeared in RAW during the '1980s,

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.970
and early '1990s, Gary Panter

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.160
and Bruno [phonetic]
Richards punk-rock scratching,

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.420
chaotic expression of lines.

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:39.730
Mark Caro and -- let's see, yes.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:44.670
Here we go -- Gary Panter
and Bruno Richards, Mark Caro

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:49.110
and Gerry Moriarty's mobilization
of the wood cut print aesthetic.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:56.480 position:56%
Jose Antonio Muñoz, and Mark Bayer's
grotesque bodies in black and white,

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.090
and Scott Gill's Pescadores, and
Mark Fisher's scratch board comics

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.990
and illustration; all
registered as neo-expressionist.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:07.470
While each individual artist
adoptionary of interpretation

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:09.670
of expressionism, and the
aesthetics of print making,

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.080
might have originated
from different influences,

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.200
which would've been difficult
to perceive from the point

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.140
of perception; the
pervasiveness of these aesthetics

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.460
in alternative comics was clear.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.510
Even Robert Crumb's work in
RAW in 1985 moves towards --

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.210
moving into the aesthetics
of print making,

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:28.170
and conventions of Film Noir.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:33.370
And by the eighth and final issue
of the first volume of RAW in 1996,

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:35.680
Spiegelman and Mouly,
even go so far,

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.290 position:56%
as to characterize the humor section
of the edition as expressionist.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:43.500
Take expressionist
jokes, abstract jests.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:49.350
Subtitled, some RAW artists seeking
inspiration; Gags of RAW eight,

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.510
is a collage of historical
and contemporary artwork,

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:55.370
featuring a variety of
artistic modes of representation

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.970
from around the world,
collapsing and in distinction

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:01.630
between our historical time
and space, and importantly,

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.940
it features two images
from wood cut novels

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:08.200
and expressionist print marker,
Frans Masereel, among other images

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.070
by Mark Caro, and white -- Charles
Burns and others, which in fact,

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.320
also look like wood cuts.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.760
The expressionist jokes,
Spiegelman's eight issue,

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.100
thereby bring the expressionist
influences of RAW in full circle.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.840
Ultimately, there existed
an expressionist impulse

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.800
in the visual language
of alternative comics.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.800
This auto-manifested as a trend
in artists mode of representation,

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.280
or editorial decision
by Spiegelman and Mouly,

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.560
and their selection to publish.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.750 position:56%
Either way, the result was the
same, and the neo-expressionist work

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:43.550
in RAW, encouraged other artists
to adopt the visual language.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:46.220
Reading RAW, Feuchtenberger
would've encountered this myriad

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.980
of expressionist visual languages

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.790
and the aesthetics of
alternative comics.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:52.580
Familiar with the neo-expressionist
visual rhetoric,

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.990 position:56%
prevalent in East German poster art;
their early German modernist style

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:59.110
of American alternative comics,
would've resonated with her,

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:02.100
while also reflecting the spirit
of the revolutionary events,

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.770
surrounding Germany
unification aesthetically.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.070
By adopting this mode

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.090
of representation Feuchtenberger
aligned her artistic endeavors

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:13.030
with the stylistic plane which
embodied the revolutionary moment

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:17.050
of 1989, by visually revisiting
the aesthetics of protests

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:18.520
of the early 20th century,

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.270
and the American alternative
comics simultaneously.

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:23.990
Her early expressionist aesthetic,

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:26.920
thereby anticipated the political
interventions of her work

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.670
in her poster art for the
East German Women's Movement,

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:32.180
and related comics in [foreign
language], just something I looked

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:37.590
at in my dissertation; her feminist
activism around 1989 to 1991

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.930
in the work that she did
with East German feminists.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:44.320
In conclusion, Feuchtenberger's
appropriation of the aesthetic

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.050
of the wood cut print,
sharp corners, collapsing

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:49.910
and contradicting architectural
spaces, and distorted

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:52.990
and grotesque bodies hailed
from an earlier iteration

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:55.780
of German expressionism than the
alternative visual rhetoric's

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.260
of neo-expressionism in the DDR.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.760
However, there are also not
directly derived in the iterations

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.300
of expressionism, found in
American alternative comics

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:09.610
in the '1980s, and '1990s.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:11.670
Instead, Feuchtenberger's
aesthetics come from a combination

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:14.240
of these influences;
Feuchtenberger's adoption

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.890
of the visual language of
early German expressionism,

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.230
was therefore neither an extension
of the aesthetics of this Germany,

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:22.830
as some German comic's
historians have argued,

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:28.150
nor as Feuchtenberger herself
attests, a reaction against them.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:29.820
Instead, the expressionist
visual rhetoric

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.660
of Feuchtenberger's early
sequential art is a combination

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.570
of both impulses.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.910
Appropriating the aesthetics
of the wood cut print,

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.530
simultaneously differentiating
her art from the alternative

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:43.300
and experimental art, to emerge out
of East Germany in the last decade

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:47.270
of the DDR, and the state mandated
aesthetics of socialist realism.

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:49.130
While allowing her
to continue to work

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:52.130
with familiar aesthetics paradigm

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:54.570
that embodied the revolutionary
politics of the moment,

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:57.120
and engaged in an important
artistic style

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.950
of alternative American comics.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:04.220
Ultimately the work from
Feuchtenberger, and other members

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.660
of PJH [foreign language] marked
the emergence of a new hybrid form

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.050
of cultural production,
at the intersection

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:12.780
between multiple expressionisms
and the politics of 1989.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.640
Feuchtenberger's graphic art drew
together divergent expressionist

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.170
traditions from various sources
of influences to create a new mode

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:22.100
of representation that complicated
both [foreign language] conviction

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.280
of Western German hegemony
after unification,

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.110
and frat houses assertion that
East Germany artistic traditions

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:31.690
reinvented German comics
after 1989, at the same time.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.490
Thank you.

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:40.400
[ Applause ]

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.900
Anybody has any questions?

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.200
Yes.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.500
&gt;&gt; I have one.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:53.480
Wasn't -- I'd like to know more if
you studied what you're reading --

00:47:53.480 --> 00:48:01.540
the German writing that
communist party was really engaged

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.300
with the production those days

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:07.180
of the expressionist
movement, and why not --

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.550
&gt;&gt; And so, my reading
of that turn of events?

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:12.130
&gt;&gt; That statement that --

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:15.600
&gt;&gt; Yes, it was a movement
desperation,

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.700
because it really alienated an
entire generation of artists,

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:22.710
when they turned away from the
expressionist and Avant Garde art

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:25.650
of the early 20th century, because
all of these artists identified

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.710
as communists, and all of a
sudden, art was no longer relevant,

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:30.530 position:56%
because the revolution had happened.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:33.270
So, it really alienated
all of these artists,

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:39.970
and didn't reinforce a brewing of
socialism realism on German soil.

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:42.920
So, it was a desperate
move, in order to try

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:47.160
to renegotiate their position
within German art history,

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.950
because it was coming
from the Soviet Union,

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:54.980
and they had to make sure
that German artists felt

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.290
that they had a connection
to this tradition.

00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:01.060
And they were constantly rewriting
the biographies of artists to try

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.750
to fit them in and out of
certain artistic legacies.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.240 position:56%
In a really, really interesting way,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.270
the way that they engaged
[foreign language] for example,

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:13.910
and his biography, and role,

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:18.810
and illustrating the presence
for both, for example.

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:21.300
So, there's all of these
switches that happen

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:26.250 position:56%
if you follow the whole thing, it's
really fascinating, the political --

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:30.570
the politics of the aesthetics
of realism and abstraction,

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:33.920
when you look of both
sides of the Berlin Wall.

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:40.470
Yes?

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:58.350
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:02.400
Well -- so, I think there
was some color on RAW,

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.010
but for the most part it
was used strategically.

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:09.140
So, the one volume
that I went through;

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:13.930 position:56%
it kind of had a funny section,
usually most of the entire volume is

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:17.980
in black and white,
like Gary Panter's use

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:21.540
of color here is very
striking, but most of the comics

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.340
in RAW were all black and white.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:30.970
And I think, with sparse
use of color, where's my --

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:34.850
So, when you look at this
one, these pages of color --

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:37.150
the material of the paper changes,

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.430
it's trying to mimic the
funny section of newspapers.

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.810
So, this was a characteristic
of every issue

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:44.870
of RAW in the first volume.

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.300
For the most part the artist
gravitated towards black and white,

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:52.090
and I think -- I can't
really speak to that choice,

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:56.470
but when you see Mark Bayer, who
has published [inaudible] Jordan,

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:59.630
and all of his work is in black
and white, but when you see it

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:04.170
in this volume, for example,
like you can see it's colored,

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:09.330
it's very bizarre to see Mark
Bayer in color, it's very unusual.

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:13.640
And then, also some of
these other artists --

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.860
all right, this Jack survives,
he's a novelist every issue

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.530
of the first eight of RAW, Moriarty

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:23.670
and usually entirely
black and white.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.710
So, they're making a statement
with this first issue,

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:29.410
trying to mimic the funny
section of newspapers.

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:34.250
But, all of these artists tend to
gravitate towards black and white.

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.450
Can maybe support example
to choose from,

00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:37.890
but I think it was fun to look at.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:41.780
&gt;&gt; Can you speak a little bit to --

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.190
on your research, you
felt that they --

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:49.490
well, actually was being
looked at by these artists?

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:55.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, in interviews they sight
that they were inspired by RAW.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.170
So, that's coming from
them directly;

00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:59.960
what part of RAW inspired
them becomes --

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.920
that's where I try to think
critically, because yes,

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.500
they were reading RAW, they
started reading some [inaudible]

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.990
at the same time as well.

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:13.310
So, I just take that they're
existed RAW in their purview,

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:16.830
and I know that Feuchtenberger
herself has identified Mark Bayer

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:19.620
as an important influence
for her, and then [inaudible]

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:23.470
but the other artist
that I'm looking at.

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:25.940
So, there's a few artists,
that really like this work,

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.860
and then I'm not aware
if they find that work.

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.700
How did they encountered it?

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:35.580 position:56%
And that's where I come to,
looking through these issues of RAW,

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.320
you see some comparisons
with Feuchtenberger's work,

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.430
but it's really striking
her colleague,

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:45.560 position:56%
[foreign language] the format of the
panels, the worthlessness and some

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.270
of these other aesthetic
characteristics that I'm seeing

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:51.690
in RAW, are very pronounced
in his own work,

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:54.330
and I feel like he actually down
planted his influence of RAW,

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:55.770
more than Feuchtenberger did.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:53:00.060
So, I start my entry point
as things that they commented

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:03.550
in their interviews, and
from there, I run with it.

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:05.510
Sometimes contradicting
your own assertions.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:24.730
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:29.390
It began as artist collective
that was politically motivated,

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:34.710
was founded in 1988, and during
the Monday demonstrations they were

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:39.460
handing out leaflets and flyers,
some of them for a mark to try

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:46.060 position:56%
to make some money at the same time,
and they worked in the same studio,

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.360
but they didn't work together.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.390
So, it was a different sort of
model for an artist collective,

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:51.330
they were just a bunch of
East German graphic artists,

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:55.550
some of which met in art
school, and then after 1989,

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:58.520
they did exhibitions
together, and there are --

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.950
for Feuchtenberger and
[inaudible] worked a lot

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:02.790 position:56%
on theater houses doing poster work.

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:04.240
So, they supported
each other, and not --

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.530
and then Feuchtenberger
independently did a lot of work

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:10.880
with feminist groups around 1989.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:14.000
But, those then, became very the
solution by the political process

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.820
after 1991, and the unification

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:19.780
as they were among those
East Germany intellectuals

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:22.600
that were looking for a third
way, some sort of in-between

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:27.060
where they didn't lose
-- they didn't --

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.130
East Germany was reformed,
instead of abolished.

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:33.720 position:56%
So, they became very -- the
solution after 1991, and you can see

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:38.020
that in their art, and by
1993 the group disbanded,

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:42.120
and I worked with these
two artists, because I find

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.330
that their artistic
production is very important,

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:46.660
because they became two of
the most prominent teachers

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:48.880
of graphic narration in Germany.

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:53.110
Anke Feuchtenberger has taught
essentially every German graphic

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:56.290
novelist publishing
in Germany today.

00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:59.740
So, that's the end of my
dissertation, sort of looking

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:03.580
at the legacy of her work,
through the work of her students.

00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.380
And [inaudible] has been teaching
in Berlin, for justice law,

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:10.140
those are in the one third East
German graphic artists attacked,

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:13.260
who was also a prominent teacher
of graphic narration in Germany.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:16.520
So, it's interesting; these
formally trained comic's artists,

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.160
then had the credentials
to become teachers, and so,

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.330
they can enter the art
institutions of the United Germany,

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:27.610
and start formalizing the training
of comics, which is really unique.

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.530
She is in Hamburg teaching.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:38.120
Yes, she's still teaches, she
lives in a small East German town,

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:43.500
a restored farmhouse, but
teaches at the HEW in Hamburg,

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.480
teaching graphic narration
and illustration.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.650
So, not explicitly comics, but
then, all of the final projects

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:50.590
of her students are always comics.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:54.280
And her students have
developed a really --

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.640
several years since a
prominent student run magazine,

00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:01.290
where a lot of the young German
graphic novelists got their

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:03.360
feet wet.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.510
The German scene isn't huge,
but I think it's inspiring.

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:12.040
