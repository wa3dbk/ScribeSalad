and use our collections
for a research.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.950
So, this is a custodial
division and what that means is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.670
that we actually have the
books under our purview

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.770
and we have three sections that
build and serve the collections

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.210

After the program, we invite you to
fill in a little evaluation forms

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.790

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.940

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.330 position:56%
So, now without further do, I'd like
to ask my colleague Nawal Kawar,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.540
our Arab [Inaudible] specialist to
come up and introduce our speaker.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.870
&gt;&gt; Nawal Kawar: Thank you Joan.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.450
It is really my great pleasure to

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.710
and thank him and appreciate his
time, taking time from his work

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.540
to come and be with us today.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.200
Mr. Burton is the present
president and chief executive

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.270

Business Council.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.120
He works with the American and
South Republic and private sectors

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.090
to promote the interest of
the US Saudi Arabia bilateral

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.590
commercial relationship.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.670
The main aim of the US Saudi
Arabian Business Council is

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.760
to improve the mutual
knowledge and understanding

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.610 position:56%
between the private sectors of both,
the United States and Saudi Arabia.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.280
The council's function is to
promote trade and investment

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.060

by utilizing

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.070

trade and investment opportunities

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.400
in the US and the Saudi Kingdom.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.050
The US Saudi Arabian Business
council was established in 1993,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.260
has been sponsoring advance in
activities such as trade missions,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.240
conferences, seminars, forums
and high level networking

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.070
between business partners.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.930
I hope they'll be invited
to one of them.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.320
For example, the three US
Saudi opportunities forums held

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:36.270 position:56%
in Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles
in 2010, 2011 and 2013 respectively;

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.210
were the largest gatherings of
Saudi and American businesses

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.430 position:56%
in the history of the council's work
which at this to the strong ties

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.760
between the two business
communities.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.530

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:41.430
[ Applauses ]

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.110
&gt;&gt; Edward Burton: Thank
you very much Nawal

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:49.710 position:56%
for those introductory remarks, I
think they're almost the same length

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:55.410
of my remarks, but I thank
you for that introduction.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.400
It's a pleasure professionally to
be here in the Library of Congress,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.370
I thank you Nawal, I thank
you Joan [inaudible] division

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:13.720
for sponsoring today's event and
to be able to share your lunch hour

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.210
with you, to focus
on my book, "Business

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.240
and Entrepreneurship
in Saudi Arabia".

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.790
I have some prepared remarks but
I'd probably will [inaudible] them

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:31.560
with a couple of comments
and observations from --

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.930
most from my time with the
embassy in Riyadh and my time

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.630
with the US Saudi Arabian
Business Council.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:47.840
Before I begin to speak about
the substance of my book,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:53.270
allow me to address what I'm sure
is probably the most asked question

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.880
of authors, particularly
after their first book

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.120
and this is my first
literary project.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.550
Why did you write your book?

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.770
So, the answer to that
question has to do

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.080
with where my professional career
has taken me over the last 16 years

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.420
as well as the body of
literature having to do

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.320
with the business community
and Saudi Arabia.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.510
So, first in terms of
my professional life.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:32.840
I landed in Riyadh in the
middle of the summer in 2003

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.810
for the beginnings of my diplomatic
posting as Commercial Attaché

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.520
at the American embassy
in Saudi Arabia.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.620
From the moment I landed,
the stellar professionals

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.640
at the US commercial service
under the US Department

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.800
of Commerce took me under their
wings and made it their business

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.770
for the following three
years to introduce me to just

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:01.100
about every business person of
significance in Saudi Arabia

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.720
and made it their business so
that those businesses knew me,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.880
those business leaders knew me
and the importance of the work

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.710
that the US commercial service
does in champing the interest

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.050
of American companies
in Saudi Arabia.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:26.370
Having joined the US Saudi Arabian
Business Council 10 years ago,

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:34.880
I continued the journey with the
Saudi businesses and my respect

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.990
and admiration for
this important part

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:43.500
of the global corporate community
has only grown in measure.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.240
So, to provide the first
answer to that question,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.620
"Why I wrote the book", in large
measure was to repay the value

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.670
to my own professional
career that sustained contact

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.010
with the business community
has brought me.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:02.760
Secondly, although there has
been much written on Saudi Arabia

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.790
over the last couple of decades,
there have been few books dedicated

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.990
to the subject of business,
businesses in Saudi Arabia.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.060 position:56%
As I mentioned in my book, a
cursorily [phonetic] review of books

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:23.640
about Saudi Arabia have primarily
centered on oil, geo politics,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.810
the Saudi economy or social issues
such as the role and importance

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.140
of the lives of women
in Saudi Arabia.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:39.890
There've been few books aimed and
accurately depicting the vibrant

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.940
and dynamic nature of the
Saudi business community

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.080
and what they do for the country.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.010
So, I wanted to write a book
that directed predominantly

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.880
to western audience that
portrait the Saudi business sector

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:03.070
as vigorously engaged in global
markets, industrially diverse

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.110
and a corporate community that
is unified in their support

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:14.420
for the national values and
goals of the Saudi people.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.560
The most mentioned Saudi company
in the world press these days

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.890
and actually in any
press or at any time

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:26.010 position:56%
for that matter is Saudi Aramco, the
largest oil company in the world.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.600
Saudi Aramco sizes
operations in oil production,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.810
far out paces the world's next
four oil companies combined.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.230
The company has been in
the press a lot lately due

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.000
to the anticipated
initial public offering

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.110 position:56%
that is expected next year, in 2018.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:57.810
The company is of course one, you
know, of the most prolific in terms

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:04.050
of not only upstream
production of oil but as well

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.760
as downstream production and
many people don't know but much

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.710
of the oil that flows through
the pumps and gasoline stations

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:18.340 position:56%
of growing amount is from Saudi
Aramco's, a joint venture operations

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.510
in Port Arthur, the
refinery down in Texas.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.390
So, when Saudi Aramco
takes an expected 5%

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.530
of that company public
it is anticipated

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.150
to be the largest IPO in history.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.760
Now, just to give you
some perspective,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.410
the largest IPO today is Ali
Baba's September 2014 IPO

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:45.350
that [inaudible] the company
proceeds of 25 billion dollars.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.370
The next largest in
history before that was

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.970
when the credit card
company Visa went public

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:58.380
in 2008 netting [phonetic]
in $17.9 billion.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.140
So, the process of valuating
Saudi Aramco's assets is ongoing,

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.910
however at this time some analysts
project the value of those assets

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:12.490
of Saudi Aramco to be between
one and two trillion dollars.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:18.490 position:56%
So, it is expected that the proceeds
from Saudi Aramco's IPO will reach

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.800
at least $100 billion
when the IPO occurs.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.860
But to my book.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.620
Business is much more
than Saudi Aramco

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.600 position:56%
and Saudi basic industries
corporation Sabic, which is also one

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.810
of the largest petrochemical
companies in the world.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.070
Although those companies
consistently pose some

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.770
of the largest capital
spending in Saudi Arabia,

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.950
there are other segments of the
Saudi Arabic corporate society

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:55.640
of equally important economic
value to the country and essential

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.670
to the current government's
plans to restructure

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.510
and diversify its economy.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:06.430
So, I wanted to write a book about
Saudi Arabia's family on businesses

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.780
and the betting young
entrepreneurship

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.190
that is occurring in Saudi Arabia.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:15.240
I wanted to highlight a few of
the well-known corporate figures

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.790
who are owners of the large
family on businesses as well

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.470
as to draw attention to some

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.890
of the rising Saudi
entrepreneurs within the Kingdom.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.630
I did not want to write a book
to contain dry facts and figures

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.270
of how these businesses
contribute to the health

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.910
and stability of the nation solely.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.750
Rather I wanted to bring to life
the personalities and opinions

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.190
of these business owners, again
to primarily a western audience

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:50.750
to quite frankly many find
Saudi Arabia quite enigmatic.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.760
And even businesses that are
doing business there find it

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.280
sometimes enigmatic.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.500
There is a continuum in the life of
Saudi Arabia's business community

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.400
from business owners that
started their family businesses

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.300
in the 1940s, 50s and early 1960s.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.450
To today Saudi's youth that have
innovative startups and companies

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.900
with disruptive technologies that
are having a global impact to some

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.950
of the older business leaders,
sometimes referred to as,

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:31.550
"The old guard ", they are many
of these older people and as well

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:37.260
as the young people, are really
re-crafting how business is being

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.560
done in Saudi Arabia.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.010
So, I wanted to portrait that,
many of these older business owners

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.230
and some of these Saudi
own [phonetic] businesses,

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.370
the larger Saudi own businesses
are multinational conglomerates

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.650
with businesses interests in many
countries including United States.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.390
So, many of their first-generation
family on business owners,

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.050
like Sheik of [inaudible] the
former Central Bank Governor

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.510
of the country.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:08.190
And actually, one of our business
councils, former Saudi Co-Chairman,

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:13.070
are venerated and respected
within Saudi Arabia.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.250
Yet among this continuum,
there are the raising,

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:22.080
second and third generation
family on business members

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.560
that are starting to assume
leadership authority in many

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:30.430
of these companies and
are making their own marks

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.180 position:56%
within the Saudi business community.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:42.260
So, I think, in part, the especial
character of my book is attributed

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.820
to the degree to which these family
own businesses really opened their

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:52.420
doors to me during the research
phase and writing of my book.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:59.060
Particularly, Sheik of [inaudible]
and his brothers, and their company

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.410
which was formed in 1958.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.430
They gave me an exclusive
look inside their companies,

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.180
I featured three companies
in my book.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.220
And all three permitted
me interviews

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.490 position:56%
with not only the older generations,
the founders of these companies

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.690
but also their sons and in
some cases their daughters

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.500 position:56%
that are taking over their business.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.970
As I have presented the opinions of
these younger generational family

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:33.740
on business leaders, I believe
that they do add significant value

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.410
to my book and make
it worth reading.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.190
So, since I've already started to
talk about the contents of my book

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:47.500
by telling you why I wrote it, let
me take some time and tell you more

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:53.350
about the substantive
messages in the book.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:58.040
I would like to use the remaining
time just to take you through some

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.720
of the select chapters and
highlight some of the subjects

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.520
and important themes I believe
that make the book worth reading.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:15.500
In the book's introduction, I
open with a very small vignette,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.470
featuring Sheik of Duragman
[phonetic], Al Reisi [phonetic].

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:27.690
Sheik of Duragman is one of the
most respected business leaders

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:31.820
in Saudi Arabia and I open
up my book with this vignette

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.900
and his track as a
7-year-old boy in 1940,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.300
travelling from his ancestral home

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.590
of Raghbah Saudi Arabia
to Riyadh by camel.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:49.500
Raghbah is about 75 miles
from the center of Riyadh.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:56.830 position:56%
Sheik of Duragman, Al Reisi is just
a stellar individual and is chairman

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.400
of the Jurisi [phonetic] group,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.290
which is one of the largest
companies in Saudi Arabia.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.480
It is a Sabic conglomerate

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.970
with business interests
all over the world.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:12.430
He's also the former chairman
of the Council of Saudi Chambers

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.640
of commerce and Industry,
which is the umbrella chamber

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.940
for the country.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:21.330
As well as the chairman of the
Riyadh Chamber for many years.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.380
So, a couple of years ago I
was at Sheik of Duragman's home

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.620
for dinner one evening
along with other American

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.880
and Saudi business people.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.370 position:56%
During the dinner, Sheik of Duragman
retold the story of his early days

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:42.080
as a youth in Riyadh in the 1940s.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.800
He told his dinner
guests of the time

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.380
when Riyadh was essentially
a small village

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.890
that went to sleep at sun down.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:53.750
I used Sheik of Duragman's story
of travelling to Riyadh as a boy

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.930
because it serves as a
common example of how many

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:02.100
of today's headlined private

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.370
and public sector leaders
began their journey

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:11.180
from their modest homes and made
their ways to cities like Riyadh,

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.270 position:56%
Jeddah and the old cities of the
eastern province such as [inaudible]

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:20.060
to seek their careers,
education and fortune.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.780
I also used that story he told
that evening to contrast the city

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:30.090
of Riyadh as it was before the
creation of this modern Saudi state

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.990
and how it has become
a global city today.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:37.930
Along with Sheik of Duragman's
story, I sight two years

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:43.380
of the most important
to the city of Riyadh.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.160
1902 and 1932.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.610
In 1902 the founder of the modern
Saudi State [Inaudible] reclaimed

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:56.660
the city of Riyadh and used its
strategically center location

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.820
in the country to launch a
three decades long struggle

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.150
to unify the tribes of
the Arabian Peninsula.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.230
King Abdul-Aziz [phonetic] began
his unification on horseback,

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.280
however in 1907 it is believed

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.020
that the first automobile
eventually landed in the Kingdom,

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.070
one of the first in
the Arabian Peninsula.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.710
The king was one of the first,

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.070
of course to receive
these new machines.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:24.390
The automobile was definitely
used by King Abdul-Aziz

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.830
and his national unification
efforts and later

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.210
in executing the many
diplomatic missions he undertook

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.600
around the country and you
see some of these photographs,

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.490
just go back just a couple.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:45.720
You see King Abdul-Aziz is arriving
in Jeddah in 1931 and there is a --

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.590
next photograph -- is King
Abdul-Aziz and Prince Faisal

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:57.900
on an inspection of the oil wells
in 1947 and the last photograph

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.890
of course illustrates how the
automobile allowed King Abdul-Aziz

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.810
to discharge his diplomatic
duties as head of state.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:11.460
And you see the king here, with
the leading Syrian politician

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.420
of the day Mardem Bey
in Taif in 1934.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:23.110
So, the automobile and particularly
American manufactured automobile

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:28.270 position:56%
parts were an inedible part of the
beginning of the modern Saudi State.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:34.090
The other important year in
the life of Riyadh was 1932,

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:35.390
I mention this in the book.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:39.060
The year the sovereign Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia was established.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.460
That year marked the
turning point for the city,

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.380
which began a slow growth in terms

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.050
of population and national
prominence.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:51.520
It is interesting to note that
in 1932, at the declaration

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.460
of sovereignty of the country,
the nation was among one

00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:00.580
of the most poor on
the face of the Earth.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:06.790
And it was largely a desert where
the kingdom's only major source

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:12.520
of revenue came from pilgrims
visiting Islam's holiest cities.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.710
So, just to close on
my thoughts with Sheik

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.990
of Duragman's dinner table
discussion that ultimately led

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.750
to my devoting my book's
introduction to him,

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.150
I would like to read a
couple of short paragraphs,

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.960
actually one paragraph
relating to the city

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.110
of Riyadh as it was back then.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.900
Riyadh, the Riyadh of 1902 was
no more than a mile across,

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.090
it consisted of the
Masmat [phonetic],

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:46.530
the citadel that was also the seat
of government, a large Masque,

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.710
a spacious market place
and several hundred houses,

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.480
all built of mud brick.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.000
The entire city was surround
the by a thick mud wall,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.370
ranging as high as 25 feet.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:03.910
The city's famous day gardens were
many located outside the walls.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:07.790
Sheik of Duragman recounts his
story of his youth in Riyadh

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:14.450
that when the end came for
[inaudible] prayer, the night time

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.680
and last of the daily prayers
recited by practicing Muslims,

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.200
the city would shut
itself from the night

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.900
by close the main gate
to those outside.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:31.320 position:56%
The Riyadh of the time of young
Duragman's arrival is not the Riyadh

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.620
of today.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.610
In 1940, there were not overhead
electricity transmission lines,

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.680
no power stations or
state power regulator.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.450
No light bulbs were to be found
in most Saudi homes, mosques

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.000
or commercial establishments.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.280
If one had looked in earnest
[phonetic] electricity could have

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.370
been found in some of the
palaces of the royal family.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.230
Electrical power generation
and the mass distribution

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:02.560
of electricity came to Saudi
Arabia in Riyadh in 1951

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.860
with the establishment

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.910
of the kingdom's first public
utility Riyadh electricity company.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:20.700
During Sheik of Duragman's time
in Riyadh growing up in the 1940s,

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.460
there were few of them,
3,000 city inhabitants

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.870
and the economy was
primarily composed of merchant

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.640
and agrarian commercial activity.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.070
And the business of
course of local government.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:35.190
Today the city has
5.7 million people.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:40.710
And this is Riyadh
actually in the 20 --

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:47.650
around the 1920s or 30s and this
is the view of the same location,

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.330
Qasr al-Hukm as it is today.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:56.650
So, today 5.7 million people and
a population growth rate of 4%.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.650
Its economy is one of the
most industrially diverse

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:05.780
in the Middle East and its city
gross products is estimated

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.110
to be more than $17 billion.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:12.190
And you saw some pictures
of old Riyadh and old Riyadh

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:15.850
and the big dig referencing
the big dig embossment

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:21.140
of years ago is happening in Riyadh
with the construction of the metro.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.810
So, hopefully if any of you have
been to Dubai and you've seen

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:27.220 position:56%
that beautiful metro that they have,

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:32.340
Saudi Arabia's building
their own version.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.730
So, I'll make mention --

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:40.190
short mention of chapter one which
covers the period 1938 to 1970,

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.380
a critical period in
Saudi Arabia's history

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.610
when the discovery of oil occurred.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:51.670
Now, here you see the
momentous Dammam number seven,

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:57.600
the first commercially viable
oil well in Saudi Arabia.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.260
During this time, the creation

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.340 position:56%
of the kingdom's administrative
governmental structures were formed,

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.800
then the humble beginnings of some

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.970 position:56%
of Saudi Arabia's most iconic family
own businesses got off the ground.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.630
In chapter one I introduce one of
the current things of the book,

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.360
and one that I believe
has been essential --

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.730
is essential to the success
of the kingdom's effort

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:20.440
to grow the country's economy
namely, is the question

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.950
of whether there is adequate
coordination between government

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.970 position:56%
and the private sector at all levels

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:32.130
in pursuing the country's
development goals.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:36.450
One of the most important
event occurring in the kingdom

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:42.710
within the last 15 years that has
had international significance

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.630
for the country has been
Saudi Arabia's accession

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.430
to the world trade
organization, WTO.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:55.180 position:56%
Saudi Arabia's membership in the WTO
was preceded by a very lively debate

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:59.300
in the country about the
impact of WTO membership

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.590
to the nation's private sector.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:06.050
During the 1960s and 70s there
were many import substitution laws

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.930
and in enact of Saudi Arabia
to protect its domestic market

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.790
from foreign competition.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:16.970
As the country's lead
WTO negotiators began

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:20.990
to bargain away some of
those protectionist laws,

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:25.250
Saudi businesses began
to be more vocal

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.550
in the press expressing their
extreme unease over some

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.740
of the new measures that
were aimed at opening

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.230
up the Saudi market to
foreign competition.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:39.730 position:56%
The government was obligated to take
these measures in order to join WTO.

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:41.950
There were dire warning from some

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.220
within Saudi Arabia's
business community

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.320
that industrial development
projects would fail,

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.990
many Saudi companies would face
financial ruin if the Kingdom were

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:56.840
to go through with
that membership in WTO.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:01.800 position:56%
In the years prior to WTO
accession, Saudi Arabian erected 42,

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.790
19 which were required
for WTO admission.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:11.010
So, in my book I conclude that
much of the high anxiety exhibited

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:14.860
by the Saudi businesses
was probably unwanted,

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.010
to be sure some Saudi business
were negatively impacted

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.860
by the WTO accession, however
there is evidence that suggests

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.270
that WTO membership actually
boosted the kingdom's effort

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.140
to diversify its economy.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.190
The opening of the economic markets

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.990
to foreign investors
has also undoubtedly led

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:39.990
to more technology transfer,
sharing of industrial processes

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:44.240
and the funding of proprietary
innovation applications inside

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.540
the kingdom.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.920
So, net net it is has
been a positive.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.560
Chapter two of my book offers a
broad view of the surprising amount

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.460
of innovation taking
place in the kingdom.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.150
It is important to know that Saudi
Arabia's journey towards cultural

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:02.890
advancement in technology
and innovation has its roots

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:07.360
in the illustrious past of
Islamic research and discovery.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.250
I make mention of this in the
very first paragraph of my book

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.080
and if you would allow me, I want

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:18.860
to read just a short
paragraph from that.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.400
Invention and worldwide
impact contributions

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.160
to science are nothing new

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.870
to the Islamic world during
the [inaudible] dynasty 750

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:31.380
to 258 Islamic culture, arts

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.690
and scientific advancements
reached its apex.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.170
The vertex of this pinnacle legacy

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:41.980
of achievement was the undeniable
fact that the world's economy

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.830
at that time benefited enormously
from the furtive and creative minds

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:50.790
of Islamic theorists, scholars
and scientists resident

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:54.330
in the Dynasty's capital, Bagdad.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.630
Largest donations and
contributions given

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:01.760
to fund the scientific pursuits of
Muslim intellectuals from Bagdad

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.390
and throughout the Islamic
Empire stretching from Asia

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:09.960 position:56%
to Southern Europe helped to advance
an already flourishing economic

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.760
and commercial trading emporium.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:23.000
So, I mentioned that because
although, you know, the impact

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.140
and global implications of the
research and development occurring

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.740
in Saudi Arabia is certainly
not as globally widespread

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:35.000
as the economy benefits
the Islamic world derived

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.420
from the epicedian [phonetic]
innovations 14 centuries ago.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.110
Nevertheless, in chapter two
I discuss the Saudi pursuit

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:45.190
of innovation and invention.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.520
I especially know when it comes
to actualizing the development

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.820
of technological advancement within
the kingdom, much of the discourse

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.150
in Saudi Arabia has centered
on innovation as opposed

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.790
to the concept of invention.

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:03.460
Chapter two devotes considerable
time to discussing the importance

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:09.920
between the difference between
innovation and invention.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.680
And at the most technology
experts and historians agree

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.680
that invention is not
the same as innovation.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.980
And to put it simply, invention
is always in the first instance

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.880
and what follows in terms of
improving to the original thing is

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.010
in some form or another innovation.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:32.960
So, the tip of the spear
organizations leading Saudi Arabia

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.980
forward, in both innovation
and invention

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.910
such as King Abdul University
for science and technology

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.760
or [inaudible] as it's called.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.580 position:56%
King Abdul-Aziz City for science and
technology or KACST, as it's known.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.190
The national [inaudible] office and
others are discussed in chapter two

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:56.440 position:56%
and their importance to bringing new
technologies and inventions forward.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.840
Chapter three actually is perhaps
my favorite chapter in the book

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:05.820
because it discusses in detail
the Saudi Family on businesses.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.660
The chapter discusses the
enduring legacy of these businesses

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.420
and gives the reader
a rare look at several

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.620
of the country's most
respected family establishments.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.270
The research of this chapter
entailed hours of interviews

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.880
with founders and first
generation, second generation,

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.040
third generation family members,
as well as covering published

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.080
and unpublished literature

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.340
on how these businesses
have historically operated

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:36.890
in the country, in the
peninsula and globally.

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:42.120
Saudi family on businesses are
very much defined of course

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.510
by the cultural norms
and historical standards

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.810
on how businesses operate
in the country.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:52.160
By nature of the cultural
[inaudible] of Saudi society,

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.040
the internal operations
and management

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.530
of these companies have
been closed to outsiders.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.700
However, since the late 1960s,

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.000
a Saudi family own
businesses have taken

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.760
on foreign joined venture partners
and formed the separate businesses

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:16.090
as well as holding companies to
manage their spare businesses

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.020
in the kingdom and worldwide.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:24.780
The composition of the boards
of these family own businesses,

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.740
therefore have changed and evolved.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:33.590
As boards which once were
dominated only by family members,

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.850
fathers first generation
family members to one

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:43.920
in which you have senior executives
from largely western companies,

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:49.520
some Asian companies sitting on
these boards and as well as second

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.490
and third generation family members

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:55.760
who have taken their
place at the board table.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.080
So, I discussed this in the
book and the evolving nature

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.170
of doing business with
Saudi own businesses,

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:07.090
particularly from the
perspective of American companies.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:13.120 position:56%
And I had the pleasure of convincing
the law firm Crimorean [phonetic]

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.220
to have a section in the book which
discusses some of the legal aspects

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.670 position:56%
that American companies should be
aware of when they get into business

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:25.010
with these Saudi own businesses.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.350
Chapter three discusses what
happens when one or more

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.260
of these original founders

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.100
of a decade's old family
own business dies

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.340
or wishes to leave the business.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.870
Often these original
founders were the guiding

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:44.480
and authoritarian forces
behind the company's growth

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.850
and success over many decades.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:50.960
So, I'm particularly pleased that
I was able to get the opinions

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.380
of the younger generation of
family own business leaders

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.690
on how they view the transition

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:01.330
from the company's original
leadership often led

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:05.410
by their fathers or uncles to
the second and third generation

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:11.230
of Saudi's eager to take their
place and managing the businesses.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:17.050
I have to tell you the most
fun I had in writing this book

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:21.580
and researching the book
is within chapter four.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.310
Since my book examines the subject
of entrepreneurship in Saudi Arabia

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:28.050
and how the country promotes

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:33.670
and supports its entrepreneurial
ecosystem, I spent some time

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:38.900
in researching the organizations
and institutions in Saudi Arabia

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:43.160
that are dedicated to supporting
the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.990
Moreover, I've looked at the
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:50.960
that Saudi Arabia spends
every year to support small

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.690
and medium size enterprises and
the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.280
So, in chapter four
look at the question

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.270
as to whether Saudi Arabia has
thrown money at the question

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:06.370
of Saudi SMEs and I
look at the efficacy

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:12.890
of the many government funded
agencies that have been created

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.660
to support small and
medium size businesses

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.270 position:56%
and entrepreneurship in the country.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:25.160
So, most startups in Saudi Arabia
are started by Saudi youth.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.470
And it's important
to note that with 70%

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:33.270
of the Saudi population
being below the age of 25,

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:36.980
the government is highly
incentivized

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.830
to support this ecosystem.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:45.340
Because many Saudis of the younger
generation are looking at business

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:51.350
as a way to further their lives'
pursuits as opposed to historically

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:56.010
which has been the
instability of government jobs.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.120
A big part of the relevancy

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:04.400
of that question is what is the
definition of the entrepreneur?

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:09.930
And that was one of the primary
purposes in looking at the subject,

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.180
because if you're just
throwing money at a problem

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.980
without knowing what
is an entrepreneur

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.380
or who you should be helping,
who call themselves entrepreneurs

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.340
for the overall betterment
of the economy,

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.250
then you are may be
missing the mark.

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:30.100
So, in chapter four I give the
reading a sweeping historical view

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.020
of the term of entrepreneur.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.910
From some of the earliest uses of
the term, an attempt of definition

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:41.270
such as those of celebrated
18th to 19th century economist

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:45.890
and authors Richard
Cotillion, and JP say.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:48.900
I think you'll all find it a very
entertaining joint [phonetic]

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:52.330
that includes the financial
bankruptcy of France

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.960
under Luis the 14th, the
son's King [phonetic].

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.980
America's Louisiana Purchase and
onto today's view of what it means

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:07.710
to take risk as an entrepreneur
and re-profits from the pursuit.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:10.000
I'll briefly mention chapter five,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.900
although is probably the most
important chapter when it comes

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.150
to today's Saudi business people.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:20.040
In this chapter I interview three
of Saudi Arabia's most insightful

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.480
and thoughtful entrepreneurs.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.530
I explore the theme
visited throughout my book,

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:30.930 position:56%
which is the central theme and that
is the issue of the fear of failure.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:36.050
The consequences to Saudi
entrepreneurs who start a business

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:42.460
and subsequently fail are not
normally what they are for startups

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:48.590
and entrepreneurs in
the western world.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:55.890
They -- when you start a
business, in Saudi Arabia and --

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.540
I would say primarily
in the Arab world,

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:03.480
the specter of failure can
haunt you for a lifetime.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.390
Is it not as it is view
in the western culture,

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:11.030
particularly in the Silicon Valley
failure, viewed as a badge of honor

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:14.070
which is to be warned,
and can catapult you

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.950
to further startups
and other activities.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:19.730
In Saudi Arabia, although
it is changing,

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:24.180
in my interviews I did
honored that in many instances.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:28.620
The cultural and societal
concept of failure,

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.660
particularly for entrepreneurs
is changing

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.700 position:56%
and slowly becoming more acceptable.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.140
But today it can be a real stigma
and when you have bank loans

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:44.930
or you go to lending institutions
for a startup and you fail,

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:49.660 position:56%
you most certainly will be
blacklisted in going into the future

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.650
in terms of seeking further
capital start your business.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:59.000
So, we're quite proud at the
business council for a number

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.210
of years we have worked
with young entrepreneurs

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.940
as you see are depicted here.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:09.990
We worked with the King Salman
Youth Center for a number of years.

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:15.330
Bringing groups of young Saudi
entrepreneurs to the United States,

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:18.010
to different cities so
that they get exposure

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:21.600
to the various corporate
communities here, in fact I think

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.710
that we even took them to
the New York Stock Exchange

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:29.440
when they're ringing the bell,
which was pretty neat for them.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:38.600
So, lastly to move to the close
of my remarks I, you know,

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.040
would like to talk
about chapter six.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.810
Which is basically putting together
all of the many things that I have

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:49.330
in the book in terms of
the Kingdom's current plans

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:53.250
to transform the Saudi economy
from one predominantly dependent

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:57.370
on oil revenues to a
more diversified one

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:01.070
which provides employment
to all studies seeking it

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:07.930
in a more rejuvenated, entertained
and more healthy Saudi society.

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:12.620
In April of last year Saudi King
Salman [inaudible] proposed a

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.670
comprehensive plan for
the Kingdom's economic

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.020
and social growth and change.

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:24.450
The plan is known as, "Vision
2030" and it is the most ambitious

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:28.990
and detailed economic development
project the Saudi government has

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:30.290
ever undertaken.

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:34.520
And if you read my book, almost
from the first chapter I talk

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.140
about throughout the book the
economic development plans

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.710
over the decades that have
transformed the economy

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:43.010
of Saudi Arabia.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:47.030
This is the latest and greatest
and it was begun last year

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.310
and financial analysts,

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:55.880
country study experts are all
intently looking at Saudi Arabia

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.730
to see how their progress
would go and it should be noted

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.500
that there are other countries
in the gulf Oman and a couple

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.320
of others have already done
their version of Vision 2030.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.030
But Saudi Arabia being the
largest economy in the gulf,

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:15.030
it's being intently scrutinized
as to where it would go.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.810
So, this plan if ultimately
successful will have long term

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.640
and profound implication
for a number

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.060
of the country's critical
important industry sectors.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.940
The vision also calls
for the reformation

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.120
of how the country
lives, stays healthy

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.760
and enjoys itself in recreation.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.970
Among the goals of 2030 and I'll
just mentioned a few of them here,

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:41.430 position:56%
by this plan if successful they will
increase the average life expectancy

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:45.770 position:56%
of Saudis from 74 years to 80 years.

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:48.930
If successful, they hope to
lower the rate of unemployment

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:56.320
from currently 11.6% to 7% and
significantly lower the rate

00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.940
of Saudi women unemployed,
which is actually double the

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.820
national average.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:10.480 position:56%
They also want to increase small and
medium size enterprise contribution

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.690
to the GDP from currently
20% to 35%.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:19.310
Again, with going back to women,
to increase women's participation

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:22.350
in the workforce from 22% to 30%.

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:27.560
To move -- they want to move the
current position of Saudi Arabia

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.960
from the 19th largest
economy to the 12th.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.010
And that is a heavy lift,

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:42.740
but considering they are the
only Arab country in the G20,

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:46.170
it may not be a heavy lift.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:52.210 position:56%
If they are successful, they want to
increase foreign direct investment

00:45:52.210 --> 00:46:01.090
from 3.8% to the international
level standard of 5.7% of GDP.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:05.270
And a couple of more, to increase
the sector's contribution from 40%

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:10.520
to 65% of GDP and to raise
the share of not oil exports

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:15.950
in the non-oil GDP from 16% to 50%.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:19.280
Those last two, and I talk
about this throughout the book,

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.550
I believe that in order for
the Kingdom to be successful

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:26.750
in Vision 2030, it is
actually crucial that they get

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.200
by from the country's
private sector.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.620
And these companies, many of
them family own businesses

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:38.570 position:56%
and global corporations that have
assets all around the world to bring

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:43.980
that capital spending from other
markets back into Saudi Arabia

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:48.150
to take off a lot of the capital
spending that are currently

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:52.370
on the government's books is
what the kingdom wants to do.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:54.390
So, those foreign investors
are already in the kingdom --

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:58.620 position:56%
particularly American investors are
solidly behind the country's efforts

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.010
to transform the country.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:05.840
In the last chapter of my book,
I recount a meeting that was held

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:10.050
on the sidelines of King Abdul-Aziz
-- King Salman, excuse me --

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:14.620
King Salman's visit to
Washington in September 2015.

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:19.800
I had the privilege of sort
of being a gadfly in the room

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:24.870
and I named some of these Fortune
500 chairmen and CEOs who were

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:30.600
around the table in the book and
you know, being having worked

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.400
in the business world for
a while and seen people,

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.900
I'm not easily impressed, but the
group that was there with three

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.450
of the Saudi ministers
was pretty heady.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:45.290
And I talk about that in the book,
you have to read the book to find

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:48.120
out what they said,
but I can tell you

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.220
that these American businesses
were solidly behind Vision 2030,

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:58.470
they had some concerns and
expressed some opinions as to some

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:04.030 position:56%
of the difficulties they encountered
in Saudi Arabia but by large,

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:09.490
they are all in of course in
having in some instances hundreds

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.680
of millions and billions of dollars
already invested in Saudi Arabia

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.430
with the Kingdom and its companies.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.570
They want to see them succeed.

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:23.440 position:56%
So, I think with that I will just
briefly mention my current employer,

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.420
the US Saudi Arabian
Business Council,

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.240
it's hard to believe I've been
there for 10 years already.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.740 position:56%
But of course, we're membership
organization, we're quite privileged

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.370
to -- if you look at our
board of directors, I mean,

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:41.240
you'll see some stellar individuals
that just the CEO Saudi Aramco,

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:45.560
many of the captains of
industry in Saudi Arabia as well

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:50.090
as an equal number of Fortune
500 company chairmen and CEOs

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:53.460
and senior executives that
are on our board and moreover,

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:57.070
if you look at our
membership, what I tried to do

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.620
when I joined the business
council 10 years ago was

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:05.630
to grow a [inaudible] of
medium and small enterprises,

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:10.960 position:56%
because it was predominantly, it
was dominated by the large companies

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.690
and we've been very successful
in bringing in more small

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:17.830
and medium sized companies with
these technologies and services

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.030
that are finding market
receptivity in Saudi Arabia.

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:24.130
So, we're pleased with that, you
see here on the slide the range

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:28.410
of our services, from customized
business advisory services

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.430
to print it indigital material
that talks about what's going

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:35.730
on economically in the country,
to market sector reports

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:39.590
and even Visa services,
you still need a Saudi Visa

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:42.450
to go to Saudi Arabia.

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:45.200
So, with that again let me
thank the library of congress

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.570
for the opportunity to highlight
my book and I'd be happy

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.170
to answer any questions, thank you.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:59.110
[ Applauses ]

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:00.910
Anything, yes?

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:20.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Edward Burton: So, story on that.

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:28.470
In 2013, some of you may
know the kingdom is trying

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:30.370
to build automobiles.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.180
And that's one of their aspirations

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.430
because of the downstream
petrochemical industry

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:39.470
in Saudi Arabia, a lot of the car
parts that are made have some type

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.970
of input material from
plastic to some metals,

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:46.790
but mostly downstream
petrochemical material.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.850
So, what we did with
the kingdom was,

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:55.120
we organized an automobile
conference just outside Detroit

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.840
and we, -- you know, we had about
a couple hundred people there,

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.920
but we had to do some
research to have some

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.470
of the presentations
that were given.

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:12.170
So, automobiles, that's a research
on automobiles, I - will no,

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:15.760
now that I have your card, I would
go back to our folks and find

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.690
out where those photographs came
from, couple of them came from,

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:22.920
actually from some of
the auto manufacturers.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.660
So, the big four, or the big
three, you know, were there,

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:32.190
they're senior executives
from Ford, GM and others

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:35.920
and we requested some
photographs from them,

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.350
so some of them actually
came from I think GM,

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:43.220
or the one with the [inaudible],
but I'll find out for you.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:46.400
OK. Yes, Joan, yes..

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.060
&gt;&gt; I was fascinated
with [inaudible].

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:57.490
Little bit on women [inaudible] by
women and also what is the status

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:01.940
of women in the younger sector
as far as entrepreneurship,

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:11.530
are they beginning to startup small
businesses and how does that relate

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:16.050
to some of the US small businesses

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:20.030
that [inaudible] minority
[inaudible].

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.760
&gt;&gt; Edward Burton: So,
women are dynamic

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.810
and prolific business
owners of Saudi Arabia.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:34.910
What you used to hear, which is
quite true in Saudi Arabia is

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:40.240
that -- you know, while the
gentlemen have these positions

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.210
in government and in
other positions,

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:46.080
they have these business
that they run.

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:52.250
And the women that take care of
those businesses are their wives,

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:56.670
their daughters and so,
years back, decades back,

00:52:56.670 --> 00:53:00.680
women started holding their
business skills a long time ago.

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:06.130
It's been within the last
I'd say 15 years that --

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:12.200
maybe 20 but probably 15 that
an amazing amount of startups

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:17.040
in Saudi Arabia are
women own businesses.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:21.110
It's really a truly
interesting story because in some

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:25.230
of the interviews that I've
had, you'll speak with women --

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:31.250
of course, as you know Saudi Arabia
is a gender segregated society

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:36.120
and so, women are not -- still
not adequately represented in many

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:43.690
of the upper echelons of
Saudi Administrative offices,

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:45.600
government offices.

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.380 position:56%
So, these women, you know, they have
had difficult waters to navigate

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:56.330
in order to set up businesses
and they are truly intrepid

00:53:56.330 --> 00:54:00.540
in their spirit because they
get it done, they, you know,

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.640
I've heard of stories
where not taking no

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:10.300
for an answer was a bit dramatic
but these women, they get it done,

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:14.460 position:56%
they get their businesses formulated
or created and they go forward,

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.960
the debate in the kingdom in terms
of the entrepreneurial ecosystem

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:22.780
and women have to do with
who you should be helping.

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:28.220
So, these women on businesses
range from very creative clothing

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:32.880
and accessories, you know, the
colorful vibes, the jewelry --

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:38.900
you know, cupcake industries - Ii
went to an [inaudible] a couple

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.830
of months ago in the
eastern province

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:46.070 position:56%
and it was just mind spinning,
because it was an [inaudible] solely

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:49.380
for women that was a
building of two floors,

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.380
many businesses were
started, you had a lady there

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.410
that started her own
Aude [phonetic] company,

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:58.020
which is the perfume prevalent

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:02.330
in the Middle East,
cologne if you're a guy.

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:05.950 position:56%
Very expensive, I mean these are
very expensive, this lady makes them

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:10.330
for royalty and they go from, you
know over a few hundred dollars

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:15.420
to a couple of thousand
dollars for a small bottle.

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.610
Cupcake manufacturers, I
had to run out of there

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:21.360 position:56%
because one was a chocolatier and I
kept eating these things and I said,

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.170
"I've got to get out of here" , but
these women, they're just amazing.

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:29.430
So, the question in Saudi Arabia
now is, "Do we help these women

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:32.200
or do we try to get
the women that are

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:37.760
in family own businesses are
ready spin out and have operations

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:44.260
that are much larger economic
consequence to the Kingdom.

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.270
So, that's going on, but
they are truly amazing.

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:49.450
I hope I answered your question.

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:51.250
Yes

00:55:51.250 --> 00:56:21.110
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:23.050
&gt;&gt; Edward Burton: So,
you need to buy my book.

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:30.000
Yeas, I spent a good deal of time
talking about technology patenting

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.090 position:56%
and interview Mr. Sodus [phonetic]
who runs the national patent office.

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:37.720 position:56%
Spent a number of hours with him and
some of his colleagues and I talked

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:42.590
about the evolution of patent,
the patent process in Saudi Arabia

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:45.970
and it is improving, I mean it
used to take an incredible amount

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:52.410
of time, year and a half, two years
to patent something and longer.

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:57.340
Now they have done to months
and they're passionate

00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:01.750
about bringing efficiency
to the process.

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:06.130
A lot of the patents are
coming in from young Saudis,

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:07.430
many of them coming through --

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:09.590
matriculating through
the universities.

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:13.350
Through the incubators
but they are --

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:16.660
the process is discussed
very extensively in my book.

00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.510
Yes.

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:39.130
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:40.760
&gt;&gt; Edward Burton: It's the same,

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:44.410
it's normally you'll find
universities that have incubators

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:51.170
where they take in applications
from Saudis, many of them students

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:53.400
but they don't have to be.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.540
They make these applications to
have access to physical facilities

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:03.230
where they make available to these
young entrepreneurs the hardware,

00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:11.080
the equipment, in many instances
a lot of the soft research

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.350
and resources that are
available within the institutions

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:17.360
to help them bring to market --

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.250
commercialize their
patents, their ideas.

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:26.250
And so, many of the companies,
including one, very famous lady,

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:29.460
that made Arabic coffee
maker that is Saudi Arabic

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:34.410
that they make an instant
coffee maker is selling --

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:37.900
what is her name?

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.130
[Inaudible] It's in the book.

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:43.700
She's -- But those are
examples of technologies

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:48.710 position:56%
and commercialized business products
that came out of incubators.

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:50.010
The same concept in the west.

00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:51.310
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:52.610
&gt;&gt; Edward Burton: Yes.

00:58:52.610 --> 00:59:07.250 position:56%
So, that's one of the misconceptions
of -- maybe deserved 30 --

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:10.660
you know 15, 20 years
ago but no so much now.

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:16.640
So, the perception is that women,
American women, western women going

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.620
to Saudi Arabian, can't
get in the country,

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:21.640
they can't get visas,
they can't do business.

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:26.890
There are certain visa requirements
for instance for married women,

00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:30.220
you know, you have to certain
information [inaudible] no, no, no,

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:31.720
they don't have to be
married, but, you know,

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:36.570
on the visa application they
have to basically document

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:40.080
that you're married, but when I
was Commercial Attaché for instance

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:45.790
for 2003 to 2006 I heard that and

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:49.080
yet for almost the entire
three years that I was there,

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:54.470
almost every month or every other
month we'd see these executives,

00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:59.730
female executives from American
companies coming in, landing,

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:02.930
doing their two to three days'
worth of business and going out

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:06.140
and having no difficulty whatsoever

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:11.300
and that's only improved
over the years.

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:15.440
Thank you so much.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.760
