00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT KERST: Welcome.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.510
My name is Catherine Hiebert
Kerst and I'm going to be talking

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.500
to you today about
Sidney Robertson Cowell

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.330
and the WPA California
Folk Music Project.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.060 position:56%
I'd like to thank the music division
for asking me to speak today

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.830
in their curator lecture series.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.000
The collection actually resides,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.980
both in the American Folk
Life Center where I worked

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.250 position:56%
for many years, I retired last fall,
and also in the music division here.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.110 position:56%
There is also a companion
collection that resides at Berkeley,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.630
UC Berkeley in their music library.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.810
The Folk Life Center has the audio
recordings for this collection

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.950
and many forms of field
notes and correspondence.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.410
And the music division has a lot
of information about the background

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.210
of Sidney Robertson, primarily
because she was married

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.570
to Henry Cowell for many years.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.330
And since Henry's collection
is there,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.800
many of Sidney's materials
are there.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.960
But they are in some
sense overlapping.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.950
I'm indebted to the staff

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.880
of the music division
who's helped me out a lot.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.540
Nancy Seiger [assumed spelling]
did a beautiful finding aid

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.730
for the Sidney Robertson Cowell
collection in the music division.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.310
And also to my colleagues in
the American Folk Life Center

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.710
who have always supported
my absolute fascination

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.010
with this collection.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.700
They've heard me talk
about it at nausea I know.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.230
And I want to thank the many
language and cultural specialists

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.740
in the library's European
division and the Hispanic division

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.010
who have provided language
and cultural background

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.710
for the many cultural groups that
are focused on in this collection.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.990
I'm writing a book and
so, I'm getting a chance

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.860
to see what these songs
actually mean in their languages.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.160
And I've gotten a lot of help.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.210
So, I'm very appreciative.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:28.500
From 1938 to 1940, while in her
young thirties, Sidney Robertson,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.470
collector of traditional music,
single-handedly organized

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.370
and directed a Work
Projects Administration,

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.830
or WPA project designed to
serve a musical tradition

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.970
in Northern California.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.870
The result of this new deal
collection project generated an

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.520 position:56%
ambitious, multiformat, ethnographic
field collection called the WPA

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.200
California Folk Music Project
that I will speak about today.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.470
Not only did the project
generate a wealth of musical

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.610
and cultural documentation from
a wide variety of cultural groups

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.780
at a certain point in California
history, it also provided

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.400
through the ebullient and
dynamic presence and writings

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.010
of Sydney Robertson, a vicarious
experience for all of us

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.310 position:56%
of what it meant to do
ethnographic field work at the time.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.900
In my experience, recorded
collections of traditional music

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.800
from the 1930s do not always
include much in the way

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.770
of documentary background and
may only list a song title,

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.220
the collection and
performer's names,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.360
the town where the recording
was made, plus the date.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.370
This collection has much
more contextual detail,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.720
with numerous photographs,
drawings and sketches,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.240 position:56%
official field reports sent into the
WPA, a variety of other field notes,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.240
and a wealth of Robertson's lively
reminiscences about her own work

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.790
and her often gossipy
correspondence.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.470
It is a vast collection, included
35 hours of audio recordings.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.790
I'll only be able to give you
a glimpse of what it contains,

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.230
plus a small amount of background.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.570
But I hope it will wet
your appetite to browse

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.000
through the entire
collection at your leisure.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.890
It is entirely online
here at the library.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.020 position:56%
Robertson was a dynamic and vigorous
presence, and eloquent spoke person

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.100
for traditional music
and its practitioners.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.640
She was also a colorful
personality with very strong views,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.960
perceptive of the graphic skills

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.620
in her own uniquely
patterned narrative style.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.150
In a publicity file she kept,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.690
Robertson described her new deal
folk music collecting efforts

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.770
dramatically in a bio that read

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.500
"Sydney Robertson Cowell is a
Californian whose adventures as a

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.180
"government song woman" in pursuit

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.840
of folk songs would
fill several books.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.850
Before she married the
composer, Henry Cowell in 1941,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.740
she had worn out three automobiles,

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.910
traveling over 300,000 miles
in her car in 17 states.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.880
Alone with her recording
machine, her sleeping bag

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.080
and a companion once
described in her hearing

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.790
as "the lady about the songs' dog."

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.850
That is typical Sydney
Robertson verbiage.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.100
Sydney William Hawkins was
born in 1903 in San Francisco.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.120
As a child she was precocious,
articulate and inquisitive.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.560 position:56%
Her upbringing reflected an
independent and rather unstructured,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.650
but open minded educational
philosophy,

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.380 position:56%
progressive in character, but
definitely high cultural in texture.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.440
She was given piano,
violin, dancing,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.390
and elocution lessons
from an early age.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.690
She had French tutors,
riding and polo lessons,

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.250
children's cooking
classes and much more.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.290
When asked about her interest
in folk music collecting later

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.390
in her life she wrote, the first
ingredient was an itching heel,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.140
which she attributed to having
accompanied her father as a child

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.920
on long business trips
throughout the west.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.130
He would leave her for long
periods of time where she was free

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.960
to go exploring, as she explained,
he naturally felt a certain danger

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.020
in the extreme gregariousness
that I had inherited from him.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.040
And so, the stock warning for girls
of that era, became a daily ritual.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.750
Try not to lose your purse Sidney,
and never talk to strangers.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.890
The trouble was I never
met a stranger.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.460
From the ages of 10 to 14,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.070
she accompanied her
piano teacher each summer

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.450
on Cook's Tours of Europe.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.340 position:56%
Robertson seems to have been present

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.640
at many memorable early 20th
century high cultural events.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.160
And to have run into or met
royalty, famous artists, authors

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.110 position:56%
and musicians in serendipitous ways.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.070
In her reminiscences, she
writes of attending the premier

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.420
of Stravinsky's [foreign
word] in Paris.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.330
She was in Rome at the outbreak
of World War I and in Paris

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.820
when German troops
moved into Belgium.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.150
And on, and on, and on.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.870
Robertson studied romance languages
at Stamford in the early 1920s,

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.880
married a philosophy
student, Kenneth Robertson,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.770
travelled with him to Europe
where in Paris she studied piano

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.950
with Alfred Créole
[assumed spelling].

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.980
Kenneth studied with
Young, though Young appears

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.550
to have been more enamored
of her mind

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.480
and perceptiveness
than with her husbands.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.210
When they returned to
California in 1926,

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.030
Robertson took a job teaching music
at the progressive Peninsula School

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.630
for Creative Education in Menlo
Park, and sat in on classes

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.030
about world music at the San
Francisco Conservatory of Music.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.960
She divorced her husband in 1934,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.310
and increasingly felt she was
leading too self-indulgent a life

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.260
in California.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.320
Franklin Roosevelt had
become president in 1933,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.570 position:56%
soon thereafter initiating a wrath
of social and arts programs intended

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.270
to help the US recover
from the Great Depression.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:42.610
It was in the spirit of the times
that Robertson moved east in 1935,

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.460
where she found a job directing
the social music program

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.450
at the Henry Street Settlement on
the lower east side in New York

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.580
and began to work with
recent Jewish refugees.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:01.210
Here is Sidney in 1929,
when she was 26 years old.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.410
I will refer to her as Sidney
Robertson throughout this talk,

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.610
because that was the name she used
during this period of her life.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.540
She called herself Sidney
Robertson Cowell later,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.120
after she married Henry Cowell.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.000
It was in 1936, while visiting
friends here in Washington

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.650
that Robertson visited the
archives of American Folk Song

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.290
as the American Folk Life Center
Archive was called at the time,

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.190
where it was then part of the
music division here at the library.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.550
Because of her many questions
about folk music collecting,

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.150
she was encouraged
to visit the Office

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.430
of Ethnomusicologist Charles
Seeger, the father of Pete Seeger

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.060
who was then in charge
of the folk music office

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.560
at the resettlement administration.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.540
They hit it off and as
she explained, "Of course,

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.590
I got hooked on the work
and the wonderful, hopeful

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.150
and dedicated new deal so
that I didn't resist too much

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.560
when Charlie urged me to stay on."

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.830
It wasn't long before
Robertson had learned how

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.820
to work an instantaneous recording
machine and began to travel

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.310
on her own, collecting a huge
body of traditional music

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.560
and song throughout the
south and into the Midwest

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.880 position:56%
for the resettlement administration.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.050
In her car, with her
recording machine and her dog.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.490
These recordings are
also here at the library.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.990
This she pursued until
Seeger's Office

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.650
of Resettlement was dissolved
early in 1937, followed briefly

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.180
by a few months of folk music
collecting support of the Midwest

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.940
through the Farm Security
Administration.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.220
When all of these sources of funds
dried up, Robertson began to lobby

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.950
for funding sources
that would allow her

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.780
to continue collecting on her own.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.430
She traveled to her native
California, where she stayed

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.610
at her father's pig farm
near Fresno to seek support

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.930
for a state based project which
she hoped would become a prototype

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.770
for the collection of folk
music across the country.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.070
After doggedly pursuing a variety

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.950
of funding possibilities
unsuccessfully,

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:13.190
like the Rockefeller
Foundation, she succeeded in 1938

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.330
in convincing the northern
California WPA Office

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.930
in San Francisco that
her project was one

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.190
that might be appropriate
for their consideration.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.120
By this time she had secured
sponsorship for the project both

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.070 position:56%
from the music department at the
University of California in Berkeley

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.430
and from the Library of
Congress' Music Division here.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.360
UC Berkley arranged for
space and equipment on campus

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.310
and the library suppled Robertson

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:48.700
with 237 blank 12-inch
acetate discs for recording.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.450
The trick within the WPA
was to device a project

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:57.340
that could keep 20 people occupied,

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.880
both to provide socially usefully
work for those on the relief roles,

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.220
and to justify the
hiring of a supervisor.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.830 position:56%
After working for Seeger, Robertson
was eager to be a supervisor herself

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.660
and not be beholden to
anyone else in her work.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.810
She was also determined
to collect both English

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.100
and foreign language recordings.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.460
Something that American folk music
collectors were just beginning

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.840
to do.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.050
Robertson was not an academic,
and of course she was a woman,

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.810
but with her forthright
and energetic personality,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.750
she found a niche for herself
in the fluid social chaos

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.450
of the Roosevelt Era, where in
other decades she might have had

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.490
more difficulty.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:48.390
It was an era reminiscent of
our own in a number of ways.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:53.180
Robertson devised and carried out
the California Folk Music Project

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.830
at fascist tendencies were
gaining momentum abroad

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.400
and populous sentiment
and the distrust

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.320
of immigrants was growing at home.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.490
In addition, by 1938, the
New Deal Arts programs,

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:11.520
the federally funded arts programs
were facing increasing suspicious

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.280
across the country as being
frivolous and a waste of money.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.090
She was well-aware of the
xenophobic tendencies of the age,

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.840
and prepared for pushback.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.910
In Robertson's instructions
to workers that she wrote

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:32.130
for the workers on her project,
she instructed them to "remember

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.990
that the Anglo-Saxon music
which we are inclined to think

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:41.740
of as the only American kind is
a relative recent importation

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.280
on this continent.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.320
Exactly as the Hungarian, Finnish
and Armenian folk music are.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.040
The Portuguese and Spanish have
been in California three times

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.630
as long as the "Americans."

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.730
She also asked that her staff not
refer to the musicians and singers

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:05.280
as foreign, but rather called
them minority performers

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:11.710
to avoid widespread negative
reactions to the foreign born.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.580
In a letter at the time to her
former boss, Charlie Seeger,

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.810
Robertson implored him when
talking to people in Washington

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:25.980 position:56%
to please not use the term "American
traditional music" in reference

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.700
to her work in California,
because as she wrote,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.490
I am trying to keep the
product description broad enough

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:40.520
to include Icelanders,
Hungarians, Basques, etcetera.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.090
Everywhere people are not crazy
about "foreigners" though,

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.130
so I am also leaving out
the word American everywhere

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.830
and hope not to get caught at it.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.650
She called her recordings
English language recordings

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:01.150 position:56%
and minority recordings as a result.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.800
Robertson had an uncanny
knack for unearthing WPA staff

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.520
from the California relief rolls
and she combed the files for people

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.990
who could help her with
her needs on the projects.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.620
She found a Mr. Deviere [assumed
spelling] who had a dairy route

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.390
in Contra Costa County
and who led her

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:25.160
to numerous valuable
contacts along the route.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.790
She also chose Portuguese
and Spanish speakers familiar

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.380
with their own musical traditions.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.900
An Armenian ethnomusicologist,

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.640
a young man whose parents
had been performers

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.260
on San Francisco's barbary coast.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.920
Plus photographers and draftsmen,
she thought would be useful

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.430
and would lead her to
singers she could record.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.230
In her WPA project proposal,
Robertson listed a wide range

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.920
of activities to keep
her staff busy.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.440
Everything from cataloging the
recordings she made to transcribing

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.580
and translating some of the songs,

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.450
researching old California
mission music,

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.110
San Francisco songsters
and much more.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.570
The year before the project
began, Robertson was involved

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.880
in a car accident and the
insurance payment she received

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:21.710
as a result allowed her to buy
a new "baby presto machine"

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.990
as she called her portable
recording device.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.410
She was delighted to own it
rather than borrowing one

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.450
as she had done for years.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:33.380
At the time the Presto
Recording Corporation was an up

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.230
and coming company in the
broadcast and recording industry,

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.310
so that she could use her 12-ince
acetate discs from the Library

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:46.020
of Congress to record up
to 5 minutes on each side.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.100
She liked the portability
and how small it was

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.690
and loved having her own.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.600
For the California project,
Robertson defined folk song

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.510
in the broadest possible
sense, as "songs circulated

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:13.400
in the oral tradition and
discoverable in 1938 to 40."

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.740
She was remarkably uninterested
in finding the very oldest songs,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:23.180
but rather wanted to document
what people were actually singing

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.500
in their homes, their
communities, their churches,

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.990
and at festivals and celebrations.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.790
Often in context.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.940
She wrote an article for "The San
Francisco Chronicle" a month before

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.370
the project officially opened.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.930
And I'm going to read this.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.630
It's a little long, but it gives
you a sense of where she's coming

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:48.410
from when she's looking
for music to record.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:54.440
"Because our history in California
is yet so young, we are more aware

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:59.740
of the road, the dams, the crops,
and the bridges than we are

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.430
of the intangible accretions,
which have built up our modes

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.400
of thought and of living.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.650
Every school child knows

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:13.480
that California's immigrant
civilization came from Spain first,

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.430
via Mexico and that the in rush
of settlers drawn by the discovery

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:24.650 position:56%
of gold contributed strains from the
five continents and the seven seas.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:30.410
And that California still draws
farmers and agriculture workers

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.760
of all kinds from the
middle west and the south.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.840
How can we believe that
these successive waves

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.350
of hard-working citizens
contributed nothing

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.430
to California beyond
the work of their hands?

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.560
What traditions came with them?

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.450
Which have survived here?

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.780
Changed or unchanged.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.840
What were they thinking and
feeling as they labored in mines

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.110
and forests, herding cattle
and sheep along our slopes.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.570
Plowing and harvesting
in the valleys,

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.860
and fishing along the coasts.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.540
Their songs will tell
us, if we can find them."

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.840
I think it's fascinating that she
uses the expression intangible

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.510
accretion because we
currently are always talking

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.540
about intangible culture and
the protection of it nowadays.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:25.360
The California Folk Music
Project opened officially

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.000
on October 28, 1938.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.590 position:56%
At 2108 Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:38.660
This is a photo of
the employees at work.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.390 position:56%
Here is Mr. Prater the photographer.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:47.700
On the back of this
snapshot, Robertson wrote,

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.080 position:56%
Mr. Prater our wonderful Welch
photographer did all our developing,

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.960
printing and enlarging
for performers.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.120 position:56%
And the microfilming of California
songs choice from various libraries.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.140
There are 168 photographs
of the musicians

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.250
and their instruments
in the collection.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:11.160
She also found draftsmen
from the relief rolls.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.000
And the collection
has numerous sketches,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.540
mostly of the foreign
musical instruments.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.500
Sketches on brown paper
and blueprint drawings

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.540
of the musical instruments.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:29.820
And here is Robertson
herself making copies.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.640
Robertson sought out the performers

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.010
and recorded all of
the music herself.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:39.170
She usually spent five days a week
at the Shattuck Avenue office,

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:43.430
sometimes going out to record
with a number of them, the staff,

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.440
but also made recordings after
five and on the weekends.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.130
There was no phone in the office.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:54.180
Over the years she reminisced
and she loved to reminisce

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:59.570
in quite flamboyant ways
to set the record straight.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.650
She was reminiscing about how
she did her collecting work.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:07.320
She wrote, "I never asked
the singers to sing for me

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.220
or for the government, except
as a preservation project.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.190
And I was never demanding of
them, if they didn't want to sing.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.320
And we skipped it for the present.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.230
And almost without exception,

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.350
they revived the subject
later themselves.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:28.290
I was careful, just as a matter of
good manners not to say, I want."

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:33.100
In her early training at the
Resettlement Administration,

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.520
Robertson had experienced folk
music collectors who imposed more

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.430
of their demands on performers
than she though civil,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.710
often ordering them to sing.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:48.770
In response, Robertson consciously
forged a more approachable manner

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.240
with those she recorded.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.760 position:56%
She explained, "I wanted to convince
people that I shared their tastes

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.260
and values and that I
liked and understood them.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.690
This is what has made a wide
variety of people willing

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.300
and even anxiously
determined that I should know

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.500
and record the best they had.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.590
It had carried often past the
language barrier to simple people

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.740
who knew only that I found their
music beautiful and important

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.640
and that I wanted it
perserved as it truly was

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.150
for future generations to hear."

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.670
She also has written
about locating singers.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.670
How does one found songs?

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.510
She asked, they are
everywhere at hand.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.140
A man changing a tire
on Shattuck Avenue

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.350
in Berkeley last month sang
an old ballad as he worked,

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.320
and was startled by an
urgent request to repeat it

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.570
so it could be written down.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.830
A receipt for a bill paid

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:50.220
to a railway express deliveryman
was signed with a Basque name

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:55.580
and this led to a whole
nest of songs.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:01.730
I'd like to, throughout the
collection she does this very small

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:06.780
WPA announcement I thought you
might enjoy hearing her voice.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.000
&gt;&gt; SIDNEY ROBERTSON COWELL: This
is one of a series of recordings

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.750
of California Folk Media made
by the Department of Music

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:20.930
at the University of California,
in cooperation with the Archives

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.370
of the American Folk Song
in the Library of Congress,

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.670
a diverse project administration,

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.970
official project number
665.8330, unit A 25.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.300
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT KERST: The
range of foreign language songs

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.860
that she recorded is
quite impressive,

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.010
documenting 75 performers
in 12 languages.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.860
From European and Middle
Eastern cultures primarily.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.690
These recordings make up
about 2/3 of the collection.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:50.490
There are love songs from
the Asturias in Spain.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.350
And from the Basque country.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:56.370
Hungarian Christmas carols,
improvised [inaudible]

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:02.560
from Icelandic settlers about
immigrating to North America.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.270
Spanish serenades from
old California,

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.780
and [inaudible] Russian
Malukan hymns

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.440
from a San Francisco congregation.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.730
Many of these groups had
never been recorded before.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.470
I have chosen a few to sample
so that you can hear some

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.420
of this remarkable music.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.170 position:56%
I will focus on the foreign language
materials in this presentation.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.610
Alice Lemons Avila was
a Portuguese Azorean

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.610
who had a Portuguese radio
program in Oakland at the time.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.530
And she was one of the people

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.700
that Robertson chose
from the relief rolls.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.580
She also did a lot of translating,
transcriptions and translations

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:50.930
of Portuguese songs and arranged
for groups of Portuguese Azoreans

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:55.130
to be recorded for Robertson
often in their homes.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:25:02.070
You see her in the front left with
three other Portuguese singers.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:09.030
She had a Portuguese guitar and
this is one of the scale drawings,

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.060
drawn by one of the
draftsmen, there are quite a few

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.850
of these wonderful drawings

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.160
of instruments throughout
the collection.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.830
And I'd like to play a song.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:28.840
She's accompanying herself on the
Portuguese guitar and let's see.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.140
It's [foreign word].

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:36.020 position:56%
This is a playful Portuguese song
form the Azores bemoaning the plight

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:41.810
of those who have no lovers,
whose faces look like raw parsley,

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.750
green lemons, or strained milk.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:51.020
Those who are never visited
after dark by suiters.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.970
It's actually quite
upbeat considering.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:31.040
[ Music ]

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.410
Then I'd like to play
you a recording

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:38.680
that was made a Mexican wedding in
Carmel to which she was invited.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.160
She met somebody on the street
in Carmel, who she had seen

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.160
and they started talking, and then
he invited her to this wedding.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.460
It was a wedding of Ben and Rose
Figueroa [assumed spelling].

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:58.360
And the orchestra that plays
is Julio Gomez' orchestra.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:04.430
It's performed in an ensemble form
at that time called [foreign word]

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.970
which predate Mariucci
ensembles of later years,

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.100
though this selection actually,

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.860
apparently is still a
favorite among Mariucci,

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.830
in the Mariucci repertoire.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.130
You can hear the wedding
excitement in the background,

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:27.510
this is what I meant about
mentioning the contextual aspect.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:28:01.130
[ Music ]

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:06.380
Actually, Robertson was
embarrassed at the wedding,

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:12.550
because the white boss of
Ben Figueroa was present

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.580
and got horribly drunk,
and acted horribly.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.620
She was totally embarrassed
and wrote about it at length

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:25.520 position:56%
in her field notes, how you know she
said I was one of the two outsiders

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.960
at this event and I was
mortified that you know

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.540
that his boss was making
such a ruckus.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.950
Her field notes have that kind of
detail which is really wonderful

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.550
to read many years later.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:43.810
Elinor Rodriguez was of
Puerto Rican heritage,

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:55.500
she was born on the mainland,
and she sings a beautiful bolero.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.700
Robertson called it
Bolero Sentimental,

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:04.570
which actually it's a composed
piece by Puerto Rican composer

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:09.080
and musician Rafael
Hernandez, written in 1929

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.770
about the disastrous
economic conditions of farmers

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.340
on the islands during the 920s.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.730
This bolero continues to be
one of the most symbolic songs

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.110
for Puerto Ricans I understand.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:25.610
And it's also fascinating
that as a folklorist

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:26.930
and as a folk music collector,

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.160
she made no disparaging
comments whatsoever

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.410
about songs that were composed.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:36.380
If it was song in a
community, she was interested.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.810
So, this is sort

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:47.510
of a heart-wrenching beautiful
bolero that Rodriguez sings.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:30:43.200
[ Singing ]

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.720
Another set of songs that have
nostalgic imagery and a deep sense

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.960
of longing for the homeland,
and there are many songs

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.720
in the collection that are
represented in that way.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:02.340
This next one is a Scottish
song a scots Gaelic song.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.360
There were a whole group

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:09.170
of beautiful scots Gaelic songs
collected in Berkeley in Oakland.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:13.100
Here Donald MacInnes from the
Hebrides sings a moving traditional

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:20.380
song about sailing by the
island from where he is from,

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:25.010
and not having a chance
to actually go back home.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.720 position:56%
The lyrics in English go as follows.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.530
"I see the land where I was a boy.

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.140
Land of heroes.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.850
I will lift myself up
and go suddenly to you.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.620
I see the land where I was a boy.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.120
I see her at a distance
from me, veiled and cold.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.530
And I am at sea on the back
of the waves in the Army.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:48.910
[ Singing ]

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:55.310
The Gaelic songs are really
lovely, and very haunting I think.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.280
Robertson also collected
many wonderful recordings

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.200
from the Armenian community
in Fresno.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:07.010 position:56%
Many of whom settled in California
after the Armenian genocide of 1915.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:11.930
She recorded music in Armenian
cafes and at their picnics.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:17.770
Bedros Haroutunian was a member
for Azoreans Armenian Orchestra

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:21.950
that performed at many community
events and that she recorded.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.320
Jack Azlonian [assumed
spelling] told Robertson

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:29.650
that the group could play in five
languages, mainly Armenia, Turkish,

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:34.280
Greek, Arabic, and American Jazz.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:38.070
Here is Bedros Haroutunian
with his qanun.

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:42.590
It's an instrument similar
to a zither with 30 strings.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:48.390 position:56%
The photographer on the project
took a phot of the tuning mechanism.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:53.610
It is plucked and played
held flat on the knees.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:34:03.100
So, here is "Song of Freedom"
and it opened with a qanun solo.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:08.620
So, the zither like instrument.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:35:15.740
[ Music ]

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:22.640
So, as they played they speed
up and this recording was made

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.660
on a Sunday afternoon at
Mr. Haroutunian's home

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.500
where the group often
played on weekends.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.300
Robertson really wanted to
use the microphone to bring

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.030
out the solos, but
the group said no.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:43.390
We all, we want to be one big
sound, we don't want any solos.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.970
We want that affect.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:53.100
So that was very interesting
that she writes about that.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:58.780
An ode? And ode is like a loot.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.440
Same family.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.120
Yeah, there are pictures,
I don't really have time

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.690
to show you but they're wonderful.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:11.990
Giuseppe Russo, he was a
Sicilian who also sang a number

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:15.200
of Neapolitan songs for Robertson.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:21.970
He was a barber and as Robertson
wrote in one of her WPA reports,

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:26.980
she wrote, Mr. Russo has been
extremely helpful he has invited me

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:32.270
back over and over again, and says
I can come any day but Saturday,

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.520
because that's a busy
day for a barber.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.430
He puts up the machine in
his house and dashes back

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.310
and forth when the bell rings.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:45.450
Leaving me to wait until
he tends to a customer.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:52.910
So, here is Mr. Russo
sings an amusing

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:59.190
and upbeat Neapolitan tarantella
about a man who wishes for more

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:04.870
than a kiss from his sweetheart,
and she's playing hard to get.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:09.140
It's almost like something
from Opera buffa,

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.960
as far as my knowledge is.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:53.270
[ Singing ]

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:57.490
The lyrics are quite racy,
I have learned [laughter].

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:11.670
Mr. Koljonen was a Finnish
American man, who Robertson met

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.930
in Shasta County up
in the mountains.

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:22.950
Boom Town was the name of the
town that rose up in 1937 and '38

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:26.590
when the Shasta dam was being
built and migrants from all

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:31.670
over the country rushed
there to get a piece of work.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.600
And he came from Minnesota.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.170 position:56%
He and his wife ran Koljonen's Café.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:40.660
And there are recordings
from inside the café.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:45.200
He sings some Finnish songs, but
I thought I would give you a taste

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.550
of a dialect song from Minnesota.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:51.090
So, let's see.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:56.520
It's called "The Disgusted Swede."

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.240
Now, dialect songs were
commonly found in oral tradition

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:05.340
in the Midwest, and especially,
there were quite a few

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.040
in Scandinavian communities
that I know of.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.990
They were comic songs about the
misadventures of immigrants,

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:17.060
usually sung in broken English and
usually about another ethnic group.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.570
So, here you have a Finn
singing about a Swede.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:26.320
And at the beginning I think
you hear, often at the beginning

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.580
of a recording you can
hear Robertson saying,

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.010 position:56%
and please tell them the name of the
song, or where did you learn this,

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:35.350
or step up to the mic, or whatever.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.920
And I always love that
bit of context as well.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.340
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.640

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.670
&gt;&gt; Shall I say the name?

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:50.470
&gt;&gt; SIDNEY ROBERSON
COWELL: Yeah, say the name.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.510

[ Singing ]

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:40.000
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT KERST: As I've
mentioned 1/3 of the recordings are

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.730
in English, among the English
language songs one finds

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:47.490
for example, tunes from the
California Gold Rush Era.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:53.010
Robertson sought out and
actually found, Sons of the 49ers

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.980
who were able to sing
old songs for her.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:01.250
But she also recorded barbary
coast, rag time, and popular songs

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:07.230 position:56%
from San Francisco, Cornish sailors,
chants and many other popular songs

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.900
from the turn of the century.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.350
One character she recorded
was John Stone.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.950
He was a fiddler, harmonica player.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:23.530 position:56%
And he had performed in the medicine
show routines earlier in the century

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.690
and in the previous century.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.250
I want to play.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:33.350
You see him, I mean she had a hard
time finding him because he was

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.930
up in his cabin somewhere
up in the mountain

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:40.150
and he would give cryptic
reports on where he was going

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:44.250
to be the next day and
she finally found him.

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:49.880 position:56%
But she recorded this section
called "Dr. Ridges Food" in addition

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.450
to all kinds of other things
that John Stone performed.

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:59.580
This is an advertisement for baby
food that John Stone performed

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:03.510
on the Medicine Show
circuit in years past.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.930
It punctuates sort of the
common narrative with song

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:13.850
that you find sometimes
typically in fable form and so,

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.880
I think you might enjoy this.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:23.510
I always have enjoyed this one.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:45.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:50.370
&gt;&gt; Well, there's an old song
that was used by Dr. Ridges

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:54.200
to advertise his food
for the babies.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:44:00.450
[ Singing ]

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:03.400

I've actually seen advertisements

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.260
in old newspapers for
Dr. Ridge's food.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:12.230
But it's a wonderful
document to have.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:16.560
Roberson was surprised that
in the Gold Mining Territory

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.550
that she roamed in the mountain
there were few purely traditional

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:25.210
songs and ballads, rather
her understanding was

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:30.010
that the theatrical and musical
stage, entertainment that sprang up

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:33.010
and was offered for the Gold
Rush settlers from the middle

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:39.610
of the 18th century on really took
over and people, when asked to sing

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:43.870
or play an old song, it
often ended up being a tune

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:50.640
from the Medicine Show circuit
or from old California songsters.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:58.650
Warde Ford and his brothers
were from Wisconsin.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:00.510
They came to Shasta County to work

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:03.510
on the Shasta Dam from
northern Wisconsin.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.970 position:56%
Robertson knew the Ford brothers and
their extended family in Crandon,

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.320
Wisconsin where she
had recorded them

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.240
for the Resettlement
Administration in 1937.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.950
Everyone in the multi-generational
Ford family had wonderful voices

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:23.300
and a wide repertoire of
songs about logging tragedies,

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:27.520
Civil War Ballads, love songs,
body and humorous songs.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:33.740
And I'd like to play you one
humors song called "Barney McShame"

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.450
that Warde Ford sings here.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.220
&gt;&gt; This song "Barney McShane"
learned from my brother Bo

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:49.360
who learned it from Walt Convert
from Boulder City, Nevada.

[ Singing ]

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:56.100
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT
KERST: During the time

00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:01.940
that Robertson was recording in
Thalami County and Shasta County

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.990
up in the mountains she camped
out in her sleeping bag,

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:09.570
or slept in her car with her
dog on the side of the road.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:14.390
And she writes about this sometimes
even in writing formal WPA reports

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.570
to the San Francisco office.

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:21.560
After 17 months of recording,
Robertson's plans for extending

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.640
and expanding the California Folk
Music Project had to be given

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.330
up when the expected WPA
funding was not renewed in time

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:31.470
for the project to go forward.

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:35.060
She had hoped that the continuation
of the project would allow

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:39.170
for recording and documenting
the performance of nonwestern

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:43.860
and primarily Asian music;
Chinese, Japanese, Korean,

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.540
which would have been
quite remarkable.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.680
In spite of the fact that
the project was not renewed,

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.120
no other WPA field collection
of folk music undertaken

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.410
by a single person in
a specific region was

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:58.780
as impressive as this one.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.130
The California WPA Folk Music
Collection provides a set

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:06.800
of recordings, a snapshot as
it were, representing a range

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:11.610
of traditional and popular music
collected during a specific era.

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:16.000
This taken as a whole also
tells much about the details

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.490
and the ethnographic field work at
its best during the new deal era.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:24.050
It also gives us a glimpse of
the character of an energetic

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:28.500
and capable woman folk music
collector who through the existence

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:32.820
of the WPA had the opportunity
to take charge and carry

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:36.300
out an ambitious folk
music collecting project.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:40.400
Roberson's successes in California
Folk Music Project fit well

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.580
with the new deal dynamism
and creativity

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.420
that generated similar
cooperative efforts to document

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:53.580 position:56%
and validate the lives of exemplary,
yet so often unsung Americans.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.440
I hope you have a change
to explore this collection.

[ Applause ]

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.620
If anyone has any questions,
I'd be delighted

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:16.890
to see if I can answer them.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:23.320
Yes, oh, wait they're bringing a
mic, so if you just hold on a sec.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:30.140
This, by the way, this image here
is from the online collection.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.620
Which soon will be
migrated to a new format.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.510
I'm not sure if this
image will stay.

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:38.120
But if you wanted to
find this collection,

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:45.190
you can just Google California Gold
Folk Life, that's wat I do instead

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.800
of remembering the whole.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.340
&gt;&gt; And it's available outside the
building in the public website.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.790
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT
KERST: Yes, yes.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:56.170
&gt;&gt; I'll just explain that
one thing that's a little odd

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:59.870
about this collection in its
online home right this minute is

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:02.920
that it hasn't been
integrated into the Library

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.330
of Congress main search feature.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.270
So, if you go on the front
page of the Library of congress

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.820
and you search for
an individual item

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.760
on this collection,
you won't find it.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.600
And so you have to go
to this collection page

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.100
and so you should search
for California Gold

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.400 position:56%
and you'll find the collection page,

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.290
and on that page you
can search and browse.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:26.210
So, but I also had a question or
a comment as well if that's okay.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:29.080
So, I think one of the great
things that you really bring

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:33.810
out about Sidney and her collecting
is that she was much better

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.210
than a lot of the male
collectors at the time

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:38.070
at allowing the community members

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:41.310
to be the authorities
on their traditions.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:43.930
But one place where I think
she may not have done that is

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:45.790
with John Stone's recording there.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:49.020
Because he very clearly said,
this is an old song called

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:53.110
"The Beautiful Baby" which
Dr. Ridges' food used

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:57.350
as an advertisement,
and yet the name of it

00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:00.490
in the collection seems
to be Dr. Ridges' food.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:03.890
And indeed it's an old [foreign
word] which you can find

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.850
in northern Ireland
and other places,

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:10.640
where it's called "The Darling
Baby" or something like that

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.140
and so have you found other
versions of that and found anything

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.440
out about the background of it.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.740
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT KERST:

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.750
I found other versions
of it, yeah, as you say.

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:23.940
But I should mention that
now, I mean I have worked

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.980 position:56%
with this collection over the
years, I'm discovering now that many

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:32.250
of the songs are, well the foreign
language songs are misspelled,

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:34.170
drastically.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:38.740
And basically what happened
was during a recording session,

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:45.540
the 12-ince acetate disk
was put on the baby Presto

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:51.900
and the record jacket was there
for Robertson to jot notes

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:55.030
down including the spelling.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:57.890
So, this is Dr. Ridges' food.

00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:05.110
Then the WPA, you know staff
typed that into their lists.

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:09.830
Sometimes even the English
language songs are totally wrong.

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:12.550
There's the problem of
reading her handwriting,

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:17.420
and then there's the problem, I
mean of her not knowing Gaelic,

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.920
or Icelandic, or whatever.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.540
So, as a result of this,

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:27.320
I think some of that will be
rectified in the catalog records.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.510
Oh, sorry.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.800
&gt;&gt; Fascinating.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.970
Fascinating lecture Cathy.

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:48.580 position:56%
I noticed the life dates of
Sidney, she lived into the nineties.

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:51.510
What was the rest of her life

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:57.270
like in a nutshell
after these recordings?

00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:59.030
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT KERST:
She didn't record as much

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:02.480 position:56%
as I would have loved her to record.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.800
She married a famous composer.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.930
She often was Mrs. Henry Cowell.

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:14.200
And she did some amazing recordings
in the Aran Islands in the 1950s.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:18.090
She did a smattering of
collecting otherwise,

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:22.750
but she was a very
complicated woman.

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:34.170
And Henry Cowell died in 1965,
but she spent a lot of time sort

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:37.660
of being the composer's widow.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:42.430
And his life was also
very complicated.

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:47.660
During this project he was in
San Quinton on a morals charge

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:51.300
and she would visit him, but
that's a totally different story.

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.880
And then she married him in 1941.

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:58.570
So, it's very complicated.

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:06.200
But some of her who she was
through her life had to do I think

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.810
with some of those events.

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:14.020
And yet, she wrote voluminously
and also spoke for hours and hours

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:18.280
into a tape recorder
reminiscing about Henry Cowell

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:23.710
and you know Langston Hughes, and
you know just all kinds of things,

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:26.060
and about his music and so on.

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:29.010
All of that is transcribed and
it's in the music division.

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:31.030
It's really quite remarkable.

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:34.860
So, it's not an easy answer.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:43.170
And for me, personally,
it's sort of hard to read

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:48.480
that she became Mrs. Henry
Cowell after being so gutsy

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:54.500
and so self-sufficient
in so many ways.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:59.410
So, it's a very complicated issue.

00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:05.670
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry if I'm the only person
in the room that doesn't know this,

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.650
but you're talking about tracking
people down in their cabins,

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:11.160
what did the Presto run on?

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.630
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT KERST:
It was plugged into the wall,

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:14.820
I mean an electrical source.

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.220
&gt;&gt; So, the cabins,
wherever she recorded it.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:18.520
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT
KERST: She needed a source

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:23.090
of electricity for that, yeah.

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:25.530
I think there was a
question up here.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.710
&gt;&gt; Were there any areas where
her collection did not overlap

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:40.510
with things that the
Lomax's had recorded?

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:44.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT KERST: I don't
know much about any Lomax recordings

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:47.140
in California, but
in the previous era,

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:50.010
I mean during the Resettlement
Administration

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:52.370
and the Farm Security
Administration,

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:57.650 position:56%
Robertson collected foreign language
materials just as Alan Lomax did

00:55:57.650 --> 00:56:00.640
and actually gave Alan ideas.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.080
You should be sure to see this,

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.750
go to this Finnish
community, or this, you know.

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:11.830
So, he was a lot younger than she,
but they were in communication.

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:16.490
And I would just say the more each

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:19.250
of them collected just
added to the bigger corpus.

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:24.490
Do you know what I mean?

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:26.260
&gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to the book

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:31.260
and this is a wonderful
presentation.

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:35.830
I'm wondering if you can say a
little bit more about their move

00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:39.080
when she married Cowell, east,
because it does seem to me

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.940
that she gave up her
life in a certain kind

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.340
of way to save him maybe.

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:49.370
And also, this was around the
time of the beginning of the war

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:53.980
and how does this play
within what was happening

00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:56.830
in the country at the
time of the war?

00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:00.900
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT KERST:
I guess, I don't have much

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:04.750
to say about all of that.

00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:07.240
Henry Cowell knew a lot
of the people she knew

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:11.650
from the progressive communities.

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:14.990
John Steinbach, I mean
she was a name dropper.

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:20.310
And he also knew a lot of, but I
mean she actually knew people too.

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:23.110
It wasn't just that
she was dropping names.

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:27.750
So, Henry Cowell had been her
piano teacher when she was young

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:35.160 position:56%
and then I also know, I mean her
family, her father was a businessman

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.910
for the White sewing
machine company.

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:41.470
And I believe they lost a lot
of money during the twenties,

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:44.690
even though they were
quite wealthy earlier.

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:46.860
And she needed money.

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:48.160
She needed support.

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.920
She didn't have an
academic affiliation.

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:55.780
And so in a way, marrying
Henry, I've wondered about,

00:57:55.780 --> 00:58:00.240
you know it gave her some kind
of a support and she would,

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:06.370
for instance she would go on
little field trips like in 1950

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:08.150
with Maude Carpoliese
[assumed spelling]

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:12.100
who was retracing the
steps of Cecil Sharpe

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:16.260
and Maude Carpoliese
from the 19-teens.

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:21.240
And Sydney wrote Henry saying,
oh it's so wonderful to be back

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:25.590
in the Appalachians, I'm
going to come back here.

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:28.040 position:56%
And then I don't think she ever did.

00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:34.240
I don't know, I mean
that's a whole other book.

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.880
Or several books.

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:42.340
Many layers of Sidney.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.450
&gt;&gt; I have a couple questions I
don't know what your time is here,

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:54.980
but this is a fellow playing
a bag pipe and I would

00:58:54.980 --> 00:59:01.440
like to know his nationality
and if you know,

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:07.050
when did she record and
music back from the.

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:08.350
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT KERST: He.

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:09.720
Mr. Biotical [assumed
spelling], he's Croatian,

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:12.060
I don't remember exactly
where he was from.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:17.830
But I mean she recorded a
wide variety of instruments

00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:21.860
that were unfamiliar to a
lot of people in California.

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:27.250
Then the three middle women are
the three Puerto Rican woman

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:29.440
who were friends and
who were all recorded

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:32.370
at Arura Caldron's
[assumed spelling] home.

00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:36.240
I've actually located
Arura Caldron's daughter

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.820
who is still in Oakland.

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:43.900
So, I love having those
connections because from that era,

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:49.190
we're moving away from people
who might be able to be located.

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:50.490
Yes.

00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:52.030
&gt;&gt; And one more question.

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:57.400
The Lomax recordings, did she?

00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.450
It sounds like, I wouldn't
say collaborated,

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:03.040
but she fed ideas to him?

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:09.280
Did she actually ever go to
Appalachia and record with Lomax,

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.840
and that's kind of what I wanted,
is there any cross stuff going

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.540
on between them as far

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:20.700
as collaborating, you
know recording, or?

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.860
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT
KERST: Not with Alan Lomax.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:29.510
Sidney went on a recording,
on a little field trip

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:36.050
with Frank C. Brown and John
Lomax, Alan Lomax's father in 1936.

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:39.070
And that was where she
was sort of testing

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:42.100
out how well she could
work the recording machine

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.570
for Resettlement Administration.

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:48.750
But otherwise I don't believe
that Robertson ever recorded

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:53.350
with Alan Lomax, though they
were very aware of each other.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:59.740
And I mean he would have a radio
program in New York and say,

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:04.720
oh do you have any 49'ers
songs that I could play on the?

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.300
You know so they were colleagues

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:14.250
and their relationship was
a little thorny sometimes,

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:21.250
but I think they both respected
each other in a certain way.

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:23.570
Yes?

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:26.750
&gt;&gt; Seems like mostly
European extraction,

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.180
did she do any Asian recording?

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.480
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE HIEBERT KERST: No.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.830
There are a few scale drawings,

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:37.310
blueprints of some Chinese
instruments because she had planned

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:40.430
that they would be done
in the second phase,

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.460
though I think it might have
been really hard for her

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:45.900
because of her lack of knowing
any other those languages,

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.120
though it would have
been fascinating.

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:55.850
Well thank you.

01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:57.650
Thank you so much.

01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:01.330
[ Applause ]

01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:05.190

of the Library of Congress.
