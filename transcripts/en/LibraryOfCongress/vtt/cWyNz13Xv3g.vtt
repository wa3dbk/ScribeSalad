know for 40 years you've been 

00:13:07.522 --> 00:13:11.709
watching 
     our special guest tonight. 

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.499
 I'm not the only person that 
was 

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.794
     twirling around when I was 
a kid to think you were going to

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.030
 turn 
     into a wonderful. We want 

00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:23.746
to thank you again for 
participating 

00:13:23.747 --> 00:13:27.751
     again. It's a big deal we 
have our special guest here and 

00:13:27.752 --> 00:13:29.721
a big 
     deal that our collection 

00:13:29.722 --> 00:13:32.300
ask on display. The library has 
one of 

00:13:32.301 --> 00:13:37.408
     the largest comic book 
collections in the world. We 

00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:39.430
have a 
     amazing pop up

00:13:42.818 --> 00:13:48.165
 exhibit. Wonder woman appeared 
by DC and a treat 

00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:55.258
     to see. If tease your first
 time at the library, feast your

00:13:55.317 --> 00:13:57.873
 eyes 
     to the ceiling and 

00:13:57.874 --> 00:14:01.559
Instagram like crazy.
          Also, I mean, if 

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.704
you're having fun now, there's 
more fun 

00:14:04.705 --> 00:14:10.098
     events coming -- a couple 
of weeks we're starting the 

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:13.236
first 
     outdoor film series, it 

00:14:13.237 --> 00:14:16.934
will run for six consecutive 
Thursdays, 

00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:22.188
     amazing movie that's you 
will remember growing up with, 

00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:26.735
like top 
     gun, Raiders of the lost 

00:14:26.736 --> 00:14:29.717
arc, please have your lawn 
chairs ready.

00:14:29.718 --> 00:14:33.885
          Let's talk about 
what's happening here today. We 

00:14:33.886 --> 00:14:35.886
want to 
     thank all the sponsors that

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:38.418
 make this possible. We can't do
 what 

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:43.379
     we do without Congress and 
our special donors that make 

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.393
these 
     programs happen. Let's talk

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.405
 about Lynda Carter shall we? 
          &gt;&gt; » (APPLAUSE): .

00:14:50.406 --> 00:14:56.064
          For the -- for 40 
something years I think when she

00:14:56.635 --> 00:14:59.200
 first 
     appeared on TV, I think all

00:14:59.749 --> 00:15:03.458
 of us identified as wonder 
woman, 

00:15:03.459 --> 00:15:07.690
     when you think of wonder 
woman you think of her. For the 

00:15:07.691 --> 00:15:10.268
past 75 
     years, she's looking great 

00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:14.714
for being 75 -- we have a a 
little 

00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:18.096
     clip to show you how she 
has changed through the years.

00:15:28.325 --> 00:15:32.017
I'm delighted to be here with 
you today at the United 

00:15:32.018 --> 00:15:37.991
     Nations celebrate wonder 
woman being named honorary am 

00:15:37.992 --> 00:15:42.423
bass door 
     for theem pourlett for 

00:15:42.424 --> 00:15:46.197
women and girls. I have some 
familiarity 

00:15:46.198 --> 00:15:51.236
     with wonder woman, and I 
couldn't think of a more perfect

00:15:51.246 --> 00:15:52.789
 role 
     for her. More than 40 years

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:58.201
 ago I had the honor of being 
cast -- 

00:15:58.202 --> 00:16:02.888
     more than 40 years ago -- 
more than 40 years ago. 

00:16:12.468 --> 00:16:16.997
I was cast as wonder woman by 
warner bros. 

00:16:20.797 --> 00:16:23.943
This was a 
     moneymen to us thing, at 

00:16:23.944 --> 00:16:25.638
the time there were very few 
women show

00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:30.831
     showing their own shows in 
television. They didn't think a 

00:16:30.832 --> 00:16:33.500
woman 
     could hold a television 

00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:36.877
show. We started getting letters
 and 

00:16:36.878 --> 00:16:45.720
     phone calls, I started hear
ing stories, this miracle of 

00:16:45.721 --> 00:16:52.398
idea that 
     came from a 48 year old 

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:54.664
woman named Elizabeth, started 
to have an 

00:16:54.665 --> 00:17:01.370
     influence in some girl's 
and woman's lives that's when 

00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:02.521
wonder 
     woman became flesh, this 

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:06.311
idea became a reality, the she 
became we

00:17:06.312 --> 00:17:15.983
     we, in some magical and 
mystical way, their lies within 

00:17:15.984 --> 00:17:17.412
each of 
     us wonder woman. She is 

00:17:17.413 --> 00:17:23.675
real.
          She lives and breaths 

00:17:23.676 --> 00:17:26.652
I know this because she lives in
 me 

00:17:26.653 --> 00:17:31.764
     and she lives in the 
stories that these women tell me

00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:38.129
 day in and 
     day out, I see it in the 

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.880
eyes that dance before me, I see
 it in 

00:17:41.881 --> 00:17:45.713
     the letters and in the 
story, I read it on social media

00:17:46.122 --> 00:17:50.296
, I see it 
     in the tears that fall from

00:17:50.297 --> 00:17:56.377
 the eyes of the women who say 
it's 

00:17:56.378 --> 00:18:01.862
     saveed them some, it 
inspireed them from some awful 

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:04.325
thing that they 
     endured because they saw, 

00:18:04.326 --> 00:18:07.204
they saw that they could do 
something 

00:18:07.205 --> 00:18:12.645
     great.
          You see, women really 

00:18:12.646 --> 00:18:20.410
know who they are.
          We can be smart and 

00:18:20.411 --> 00:18:23.030
beautiful and strong and wise 
and kind 

00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:31.223
     and brave, we believe in 
Fairplay, fair pay, and playing 

00:18:31.224 --> 00:18:32.784
by the 
     rules.

00:18:32.785 --> 00:18:38.640
          We build families and 
communeityies and yes, we stand 

00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:44.170
by our 
     men. As they stand beside 

00:18:44.171 --> 00:18:48.748
us.
          Wonder woman helps 

00:18:48.749 --> 00:18:53.065
bring out out the inner strength
 every 

00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:58.830
     woman has. We are all 
inclusive that's who women are. 

00:18:59.753 --> 00:19:00.639
We are 
     stronger together.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:08.336
          We are half the world.
 We have a voice. We are the 

00:19:08.337 --> 00:19:11.067
mothers 
     of all mankind. We are 

00:19:11.068 --> 00:19:15.154
mothers and sisters and daughter
s and 

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:19.729
     grandmothers and great 
grandmothers, we are tall and 

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.720
short and 
     thick and thin, we are 

00:19:23.721 --> 00:19:27.282
blonde and begin engineers and 
salt and 

00:19:27.283 --> 00:19:35.375
     peppers. All of you women 
of all colors, all you children 

00:19:35.376 --> 00:19:38.550
out 
     there. Never forget the 

00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:42.269
wonder woman inside you. I see 
these 

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:49.506
     beautiful faces, learn know
, be everything that you dream.

00:19:54.999 --> 00:20:00.946
Ladies and gentlemen, your 
wonder women, the one and only 

00:20:00.947 --> 00:20:07.259
     Lynda Carter. 

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.100
Oh, wow. Wow.

00:20:36.392 --> 00:20:40.080
Wow.
          Welcome to the library

00:20:41.005 --> 00:20:44.948
 of Congress.
          This crowd is 

00:20:44.949 --> 00:20:49.188
wonderful. There's also an 
overflow room too.

00:20:49.189 --> 00:20:55.191
          How did this make you 
feel Mrs. Carter after 40 years?

00:20:55.192 --> 00:20:58.327
 Can I 
     call you Carla? 

00:21:01.583 --> 00:21:06.726
Oh yes, definitely. Or do I call
 you doctor? No, 

00:21:06.727 --> 00:21:12.943
     madam library. Madam.
          That's a good one.

00:21:12.944 --> 00:21:19.769
          You know, it is -- 
it's really interesting that 

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.960
after all 
     these years, that wonder 

00:21:23.961 --> 00:21:27.286
woman is come full circle and 
she's 

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:34.109
     still so relevant. That 
speech that you saw was given at

00:21:34.512 --> 00:21:40.780
 the UN, 
     and it was for women and 

00:21:40.781 --> 00:21:46.045
girls across the world.
          And it was -- it was 

00:21:46.046 --> 00:21:52.454
about the idea of wonder woman.
          When I said wonder 

00:21:52.455 --> 00:21:57.534
woman is real, it's the idea of 
wonder 

00:21:57.535 --> 00:22:04.285
     woman that is real because 
she does live in us. It is the 

00:22:04.286 --> 00:22:10.654
idea of 
     that piece of us when

00:22:13.778 --> 00:22:18.355
 maybe no one believes in us or 
we've been 

00:22:18.356 --> 00:22:22.741
     bullyied or someone thinks 
we are not tall enough or pretty

00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:29.347
 enough 
     for -- for good enough or 

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.873
smart enough or enough, enough, 
or we 

00:22:31.874 --> 00:22:33.874
     have

00:22:34.971 --> 00:22:39.987
 obstacles to overcome where we 
live in a nation that wants 

00:22:39.988 --> 00:22:46.095
     to hide our faces or in an 
area that does not have good 

00:22:46.096 --> 00:22:49.618
education 
     or the skin we live in is 

00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:51.619
not

00:22:52.752 --> 00:22:58.210
 an easy color to live in in our

00:22:58.211 --> 00:22:59.177
     neighborhood or in our 
country.

00:22:59.178 --> 00:23:05.701
          I had a singer -- one 
of my singers who is an amazing 

00:23:05.702 --> 00:23:10.656
person 
     said to me recently, she 

00:23:10.657 --> 00:23:16.271
said, you know Lynda, I -- I 
can't 

00:23:16.272 --> 00:23:23.092
     change this and living 
inside this skin just became 

00:23:23.093 --> 00:23:25.093
harder for me
     me. 

00:23:28.311 --> 00:23:31.893
          What do you say to 
that?

00:23:31.894 --> 00:23:36.164
          What do you say to 
that? I say

00:23:41.405 --> 00:23:44.921
 I fight every day with you -- 
     I say I fight every day 

00:23:44.922 --> 00:23:49.388
with you to help educate you, 
help you 

00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:57.153
     realize you know, I'm an 
old girl now. But I will never, 

00:23:57.154 --> 00:24:01.497
and 
     until my dying day, I will 

00:24:01.498 --> 00:24:07.850
never stop fighting for the idea
 of 

00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:09.851
     wonder woman. The idea of

00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:16.274
 intellect and strength. 
Intellect and 

00:24:16.275 --> 00:24:26.170
     courage. Intellect what 
this library is showing us, 

00:24:26.171 --> 00:24:30.879
gives us, 
     what Dr. Carla Hayden is 

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.426
able to offer in a digitized 
world.

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:47.514
At your fingertips, a resource, 
so rich, so rich, that you 

00:24:47.515 --> 00:24:49.731
     could access it at any time

00:24:52.769 --> 00:24:54.786
, that's what I hope for you all
 of 

00:24:54.787 --> 00:25:01.301
     you. That's what if my life
 means anything, and who knows 

00:25:01.302 --> 00:25:04.602
it can 
     go at any time. If my life 

00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:10.019
means anything, it's that I give
 you 

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.691
     the gift of curiosity about
 yourself, about the world 

00:25:13.692 --> 00:25:18.722
around you, 
     about tapping into your own

00:25:22.702 --> 00:25:23.907
 intellect and courage. That's 
how I 

00:25:23.908 --> 00:25:27.824
     feel about this.
          Wow.

00:25:34.798 --> 00:25:36.798
So Lynda, I'm ready to put on a

00:25:40.026 --> 00:25:42.970
 costume and go out and do 
     something -- okay? I don't 

00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:45.702
know about you but that's what 
it 

00:25:45.703 --> 00:25:53.545
     means, and even though -- 
and she's celebrating her 75th 

00:25:53.546 --> 00:25:59.203
     birthday -- the come in 
this case -- wonder woman 

00:25:59.204 --> 00:26:06.740
started in 1941
     1941, and did you have any 

00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:07.991
trepidation with -- when they 
said 

00:26:07.992 --> 00:26:14.445
     would you like to embody 
wonder woman in the 70's? Nope. 

00:26:15.267 --> 00:26:18.809
You said 
     I'm ready. I'm ready. No, 

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:24.125
you have to understand the time 
-- now, 

00:26:24.126 --> 00:26:28.769
     I was in Hollywood during 
the time when there were no 

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.226
women in 
     television, they did not 

00:26:31.227 --> 00:26:33.475
think first of all, that a woman
 could 

00:26:33.476 --> 00:26:39.347
     hold a series, they did not
 think women would tune in to 

00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:42.661
watch an 
     hour long with a woman as a

00:26:42.683 --> 00:26:44.683
 lead. 

00:26:47.268 --> 00:26:51.109
They also said, women are going 
     to hate you so just get 

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.110
ready.

00:27:02.092 --> 00:27:07.609
Go girl. Yeah.
          They -- the only other

00:27:07.632 --> 00:27:11.018
 woman on the set was a script 
     supervisor, which is 

00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:17.986
basically the secretary of the 
set, there 

00:27:17.987 --> 00:27:22.855
     were the stunt person was a
 man --

00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:31.644
 first time I got on the set 
     and this guy had chest 

00:27:31.645 --> 00:27:33.645
headquarters coming out the top.

00:27:36.913 --> 00:27:38.913
Two 
     bullets here --

00:27:41.298 --> 00:27:44.441
 kind of walking like this -- I 
said,

00:27:47.723 --> 00:27:50.696
 I said, oh 
     the camera is going to be 

00:27:50.697 --> 00:27:56.609
so far away you'll never tell.
          I said,

00:27:59.797 --> 00:28:08.735
 I think this and this you're 
going to tell -- and I 

00:28:08.736 --> 00:28:15.187
     started, we started that 
show started the students women

00:28:15.517 --> 00:28:16.425
's 
     association. 

00:28:16.426 --> 00:28:17.455
          &gt;&gt; » (APPLAUSE): Great
.

00:28:21.531 --> 00:28:26.956
Women have to be doubleed by 
women. From that point on.

00:28:26.957 --> 00:28:28.957
          And

00:28:32.663 --> 00:28:39.891
 just a fantastic mow men tus 
wonder woman is directed by 

00:28:39.892 --> 00:28:45.788
     my good friend Patty 
Jenkins, she's a spit fire. Oh 

00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:48.267
my God, she's 
     amazing. If you haven't 

00:28:48.268 --> 00:28:53.986
seen it go see it.
          In fact, -- in fact, 

00:28:53.987 --> 00:28:56.265
-- I didn't answer your question
 -- 

00:28:56.266 --> 00:29:00.114
     when I got the part -- you 
were ready -- I was ready, I 

00:29:00.115 --> 00:29:02.645
knew what 
     I wanted to do with the 

00:29:02.646 --> 00:29:05.065
character, I knew that if you 
didn't want 

00:29:05.066 --> 00:29:11.020
     to be her friend, if you 
wanted to be her or be her best 

00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:13.751
friend, 
     any guy that looked at me 

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:17.618
and with some girl I would bop 
him 

00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:20.153
     upside the head and say get
 a grip.

00:29:20.154 --> 00:29:25.845
          Well I have to tell 
you that director Patty -- see 

00:29:25.846 --> 00:29:27.846
-- we've 
     got a lot of energy up here

00:29:28.832 --> 00:29:34.388
.
          Because Patty Jenkins 

00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:36.204
tweeted this week a note from a 
person 

00:29:36.205 --> 00:29:40.152
     that works in a 
kindergarten and talked about 

00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:49.467
the impact that a 
     the wonder woman had -- a 

00:29:49.468 --> 00:29:54.156
boy that was obsessed with iron 
man had 

00:29:54.157 --> 00:30:01.844
     asked his parents for a new
 wonder woman lunch box. Good.

00:30:01.845 --> 00:30:06.375
          And the little girl 
said when I grow up I want to 

00:30:06.376 --> 00:30:08.656
speak 
     hundreds of languages like 

00:30:08.657 --> 00:30:13.947
Diana. And another little girl 
had her 

00:30:13.948 --> 00:30:18.606
     revamp the beauty birthday 
party in three days because she 

00:30:18.607 --> 00:30:21.482
simply 
     had to have a wonder woman 

00:30:21.483 --> 00:30:24.115
party and that's the impact and 
the 

00:30:24.116 --> 00:30:29.532
     note ended consider this 
your friendly reminder that if 

00:30:29.533 --> 00:30:30.702
this 
     movie completely changed 

00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:34.378
the way these girls and boys 
thought 

00:30:34.379 --> 00:30:37.661
     about themselves in a world
 in a week imagine what the next

00:30:40.207 --> 00:30:43.455
we give them more movies like 
wonder 

00:30:43.456 --> 00:30:47.212
     woman. What do you think? 
          Yeah. 

00:30:50.466 --> 00:30:58.879
I -- I told Patty that I was not
 going to see any -- 

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.377
     we've spoken -- since the 
day it was announceed that she 

00:31:01.378 --> 00:31:03.812
was going 
     to direct this film, we 

00:31:03.813 --> 00:31:06.390
spoke the next day, and we had 
become 

00:31:06.391 --> 00:31:14.328
     great, great, great friends
, and I was very free with with 

00:31:14.329 --> 00:31:17.313
my own 
     ideas, not about her film 

00:31:17.314 --> 00:31:20.208
but about the essence of the 
character.

00:31:20.209 --> 00:31:26.902
          I never spoke to gal 
about her character because it's

00:31:26.905 --> 00:31:30.040
 not 
     something you do with one 

00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:33.841
actress to another, but as gal 
and I 

00:31:33.842 --> 00:31:37.082
     were so insync about this 
character, I told her that I did

00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:41.311
 not 
     want to -- I did not watch 

00:31:41.312 --> 00:31:44.529
any trailers, I did not read any
 of 

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:48.267
     her interviews about her 
process, I only spoke to her 

00:31:48.268 --> 00:31:53.355
directly. I 
     wanted to go to the 

00:31:53.356 --> 00:31:56.141
premiere which she invited me to
 personally, 

00:31:56.142 --> 00:31:59.974
     I wanted to go to the 
premiere uncluttered.

00:31:59.975 --> 00:32:06.120
          And so, I went with my
 family, my grown children and 

00:32:06.121 --> 00:32:08.362
my 
     husband, to the premiere, 

00:32:08.363 --> 00:32:17.521
and I -- my heart was pounding.
          And and I was taken

00:32:20.597 --> 00:32:24.302
 aback because the essence of 
that -- of 

00:32:24.303 --> 00:32:28.590
     who that character is for 
so many of us and for so long, 

00:32:28.591 --> 00:32:31.190
there's 
     a goodness, there's a heart

00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:37.532
, it's about -- it's about 
something. 

00:32:37.533 --> 00:32:42.237
     It's about who we are as 
people, as

00:32:45.381 --> 00:32:48.050
 against the violence, it's 
     about defending what's 

00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:53.608
right, it's about being 
Massachusetts 

00:32:53.609 --> 00:32:57.306
     bears, it's about those 
things that we hold so dear.

00:32:57.307 --> 00:33:07.305
          And so, this is great.
          And did you -- and

00:33:07.322 --> 00:33:09.685
 did you think about the fact 
that you 

00:33:09.686 --> 00:33:13.825
     would inspire generations 
of girls and boys as you were 

00:33:13.826 --> 00:33:16.797
really 
     fighting on the set and 

00:33:16.798 --> 00:33:19.491
making sure things were going 
the way 

00:33:19.492 --> 00:33:23.487
     that you really thought 
they should or did you know or 

00:33:23.488 --> 00:33:26.632
have a 
     sense? I really does 

00:33:26.633 --> 00:33:29.295
believe -- I had to fight for a 
lot of 

00:33:29.296 --> 00:33:39.267
     things -- they -- they 
tried to stare me -- they 

00:33:39.268 --> 00:33:43.094
thought I was 
     too sweet in the beginning 

00:33:43.095 --> 00:33:46.082
so they tried to get me to be 
more 

00:33:46.083 --> 00:33:51.784
     assertive with my stuff and
, a couple of those episodes 

00:33:51.785 --> 00:33:55.877
that a
     arose were real stingiers. 

00:33:57.209 --> 00:34:03.019
I can't watch them. But when I 
-- when 

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:08.834
     I kind of stuck to my guns 
and really wanted to, you know, 

00:34:08.835 --> 00:34:10.949
it's 
     like -- this is who she is 

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:14.454
-- she -- you know, you're born 
tall, 

00:34:14.455 --> 00:34:18.638
     you can't make yourself 
short. It's just who you are. 

00:34:21.242 --> 00:34:21.962
You're born 
     with what you're born with,

00:34:21.963 --> 00:34:25.538
 and these are the cards that 
you're 

00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:27.895
     dealt and those are her 
cards, this is who we are and we

00:34:28.450 --> 00:34:31.440
 talked 
     about backstage, whatever 

00:34:31.441 --> 00:34:34.562
that is, and whatever age we are
, it's 

00:34:34.563 --> 00:34:39.576
     what we are. I like being a
 woman. 

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:41.577
          &gt;&gt; » (APPLAUSE): .

00:34:44.372 --> 00:34:48.225
I like looking good.
          You know?

00:34:48.226 --> 00:34:56.207
          And do I like being 
older? Well, -- it's growing on 

00:34:56.208 --> 00:34:58.330
you -- I 
     guess so. I can't change it

00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:03.736
. So I might as well embrace it.
          You know, it is what 

00:35:03.737 --> 00:35:08.852
it is. And it's not exploitation
, you 

00:35:08.853 --> 00:35:13.423
     know, it's -- you know, 
we're going to do what we do. 

00:35:16.847 --> 00:35:21.231
Wear the 
     long earrings or not. If 

00:35:21.232 --> 00:35:25.937
you like to wear conservative 
things 

00:35:25.938 --> 00:35:29.630
     great, we're not competing 
-- we're certainly not competing

00:35:31.197 --> 00:35:35.048
guys. We are so thankful. I'm so

00:35:35.049 --> 00:35:37.317
     thankful.
          For the men in my life

00:35:37.716 --> 00:35:41.932
 that have helped me on this 
journey 

00:35:41.933 --> 00:35:45.959
     -- I embrace every single 
one of you. I embrace every 

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.692
single one 
     of you who sits by my side,

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:53.100
 who has helped me when I'm down
 and I 

00:35:53.101 --> 00:36:00.949
     need a you know a -- when I
 went back to singing, someone 

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:02.748
stole 
     all my music and my stuff, 

00:36:02.749 --> 00:36:05.570
I was going back on stage and my
 son 

00:36:05.571 --> 00:36:13.328
     -- my son -- six foot 5 and
 mom, look at me --

00:36:18.662 --> 00:36:24.935
 if you go out 
     there and mess it up, we're

00:36:25.237 --> 00:36:30.036
 still going to love you -- you 
know. 

00:36:30.037 --> 00:36:36.635
     Things like that. You know,
 these guys that support us, I'm

00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:39.758
 tired 
     of them being marJanuaryial

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:45.568
izeed. We own feminism. It's our
s. You 

00:36:45.569 --> 00:36:52.535
     guys are not feminist. You 
support us, and we support you, 

00:36:52.536 --> 00:36:54.822
and 
     come along for the ride.

00:36:59.068 --> 00:37:05.072
Now we mentioned the new wonder 
woman and it's the number 

00:37:05.073 --> 00:37:09.723
     one movie everywhere.
          How does that make you

00:37:10.743 --> 00:37:14.267
 feel? Wow, this is -- it lives 
again.

00:37:14.268 --> 00:37:23.114
          I told Patty, that 
before I saw the movie I said 

00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:27.358
this movie 
     is going to kill, this 

00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:29.387
movie is going to be great. She 
was 

00:37:29.388 --> 00:37:34.334
     nervous, you know. She just
 made the best movie she could 

00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:36.605
make, 
     and that's all we can do, 

00:37:36.606 --> 00:37:40.870
is we go out there and we do the
 best 

00:37:40.871 --> 00:37:43.595
     damn job we can do, and 
then the rest of it is the just 

00:37:43.596 --> 00:37:44.693
the rest 
     of it.

00:37:44.694 --> 00:37:49.696
          There are many element
 that's we cannot control. So, 

00:37:49.697 --> 00:37:52.129
she 
     just put every effort into 

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:57.095
if and she -- we talked an awful
 lot, 

00:37:57.096 --> 00:38:01.996
     and she's brilliant, she's 
a brilliant director. You know,

00:38:05.318 --> 00:38:07.753
 women 
     can't make action movies 

00:38:07.754 --> 00:38:13.499
and women don't go to action 
movies -- 

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.563
     so, you know, boom, boom, 
boom, and I said, this is going 

00:38:18.564 --> 00:38:22.263
to be 
     great. I said this movie is

00:38:22.265 --> 00:38:26.656
 going to gross over a a billion

00:38:26.657 --> 00:38:31.546
     dollars, there was silence 
on the other end of the text, 

00:38:31.547 --> 00:38:33.290
just 
     silence and after the first

00:38:33.291 --> 00:38:37.220
 week it came in, I said what 
did I 

00:38:37.221 --> 00:38:43.186
     tell you? And she went, 
yeah, maybe.

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:52.992
          So, it's already done 
like half a billion or 600 

00:38:52.993 --> 00:38:54.562
merchandise
     merchandise, by the time 

00:38:54.563 --> 00:38:57.237
it's over -- which is good -- 
you want 

00:38:57.238 --> 00:39:01.075
     people to go six and seven 
times, you want it because it 

00:39:01.076 --> 00:39:03.555
just 
     gives her more opportunity 

00:39:03.556 --> 00:39:06.490
to do more things because I'm 
sure she 

00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:12.104
     didn't get paid nearly what
 other direct fors have been 

00:39:12.105 --> 00:39:13.615
paid for 
     similar kinds of things but

00:39:13.616 --> 00:39:16.473
 that's Okay.
          I think she will now. 

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.459
Yeah. 
          &gt;&gt; » (APPLAUSE): .

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:29.801
Wow.
          And if by chance I 

00:39:29.802 --> 00:39:33.396
they asked you to appear in a 
sequel, 

00:39:33.397 --> 00:39:39.914
     would you consider? She 
asked me to do a came oin this, 

00:39:39.915 --> 00:39:42.345
she was 
     in England and I was doing 

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:44.872
my concerts I went back to 
singing -- 

00:39:44.873 --> 00:39:49.746
     it's how I started as a 
singer, and I was at jazz 

00:39:49.747 --> 00:39:52.408
Lincoln center, 
     and at the Kennedy center 

00:39:52.409 --> 00:39:53.982
--
          &gt;&gt; » (APPLAUSE): -- I 

00:39:53.983 --> 00:40:01.218
know -- and finishing up a new 
album, 

00:40:01.219 --> 00:40:06.068
     so at that time I just -- 
we couldn't -- we couldn't get 

00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:09.199
it -- 
     our timing together, so 

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.031
this next time if she writes me 
a decent 

00:40:13.032 --> 00:40:16.878
     part I might do it.
          I think she will.

00:40:16.879 --> 00:40:21.324
          Because I have been 
busy with your singing career, 

00:40:21.325 --> 00:40:22.143
you 
     mentioned that and I don't 

00:40:22.144 --> 00:40:25.344
know if a lot of people realize 
that 

00:40:25.345 --> 00:40:28.994
     you had a singing career 
before and now you have a new 

00:40:28.995 --> 00:40:31.543
album 
     coming out. I do. I have a 

00:40:31.544 --> 00:40:40.114
new album, it's really kind of 
     eclectic, I have quite a 

00:40:40.115 --> 00:40:43.936
few original songs which I've --
 I've 

00:40:43.937 --> 00:40:49.893
     been writing a long time 
but this past year nominated for

00:40:51.051 --> 00:40:53.080
 best 
     original music for a video 

00:40:53.081 --> 00:40:55.020
game --
          &gt;&gt; » (APPLAUSE): .

00:40:55.021 --> 00:41:02.834
          And guess what else? 
The library of Congress is in 

00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.414
the video 
     game.

00:41:09.562 --> 00:41:14.366
I bet that's -- did you know 
that? See, this is -- I mean, 

00:41:14.367 --> 00:41:19.616
     this is very cool stuff, 
comic stuffs and video games, I 

00:41:19.617 --> 00:41:23.019
mean, 
     who knew? I want to say one

00:41:23.158 --> 00:41:26.468
 thing -- we're talking about 
wonder 

00:41:26.469 --> 00:41:30.035
     woman which is all fine and
 good but I had the great 

00:41:30.036 --> 00:41:32.036
opportunity 
     to meet the

00:41:34.128 --> 00:41:37.989
 13th librarian of Congress, Dr.
 Billington, we were 

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:44.196
     at a state dinner and I sat
 next to him and when I realize

00:41:44.199 --> 00:41:48.490
ed who 
     he was, he -- his life's 

00:41:48.491 --> 00:41:52.894
work was digitizeing, the 
beginning of 

00:41:52.895 --> 00:41:56.421
     the emention work of 
digitizeing this work of the 

00:41:56.422 --> 00:41:59.860
library, and how 
     he explained it was it's 

00:41:59.861 --> 00:42:03.254
not just putting things online, 
it's 

00:42:03.255 --> 00:42:07.751
     taking the original work, 
not copies, which is what you 

00:42:07.752 --> 00:42:09.517
see 
     everywhere else, it's the 

00:42:09.518 --> 00:42:12.496
copies that you -- of the copies
 of the 

00:42:12.497 --> 00:42:18.465
     copies are quite degraded 
by the time you get to try to 

00:42:18.466 --> 00:42:21.216
decipher 
     anything, so this was high 

00:42:21.217 --> 00:42:23.217
quality

00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:31.154
 digitizeing of the original 
     work. And I -- I was just 

00:42:31.155 --> 00:42:36.177
for a person with A DD which I 
have, 

00:42:36.178 --> 00:42:38.178
     could you tell? 

00:42:39.729 --> 00:42:41.729
Nope. 

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:47.647
It is just a source -- I went 
into the 

00:42:47.648 --> 00:42:52.192
     Abigail letters and there's
 blue things and you go I want 

00:42:52.193 --> 00:42:53.768
to see 
     what that is and you go 

00:42:53.769 --> 00:42:56.868
over here and over here and 
pretty soon 

00:42:56.869 --> 00:43:01.596
     I'm over to Abraham Lincoln
 and I'm over here and over here

00:43:02.551 --> 00:43:05.840
 at 
     the civil war, it was like 

00:43:05.841 --> 00:43:07.841
just such a

00:43:10.027 --> 00:43:12.659
 treasure trove of 
     interesting learning almost

00:43:13.221 --> 00:43:15.093
 anything that you could 
possibly want 

00:43:15.094 --> 00:43:23.054
     to know. And seeing these 
documents so clearly, and paint

00:43:23.057 --> 00:43:26.018
ings and 
     architecture and anything 

00:43:26.019 --> 00:43:30.179
that you -- anything, and video 
games 

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:36.684
     and comic books and you can
 look up Lynda Carter.

00:43:36.685 --> 00:43:39.577
          And things are going 
to come up.

00:43:39.578 --> 00:43:44.571
          And that's why we call
 it the library of awesome and 

00:43:44.572 --> 00:43:47.200
we're 
     building on that legacy. 

00:43:47.357 --> 00:43:51.692
Dr. Billington and other library
ies of 

00:43:51.693 --> 00:43:56.203
     Congress since 1802 and 
it's just carrying the baton. 

00:43:57.969 --> 00:43:59.188
We're glad 
     you're here.

00:43:59.189 --> 00:44:08.625
          Only 14, only 14 
librarians, only 14 -- and one 

00:44:08.626 --> 00:44:11.131
woman.

00:44:19.502 --> 00:44:21.502
You can imagine.

00:44:40.283 --> 00:44:47.690
So you can imagine how excited I
 was -- I have to say -- 

00:44:47.691 --> 00:44:52.925
     wonder woman is coming? Oh 
sure. I have so say what is 

00:44:52.926 --> 00:44:54.926
     interesting about this, and

00:44:57.374 --> 00:45:01.156
 is that -- is this is just -- 
we're 

00:45:01.157 --> 00:45:05.466
     half the world, as I said 
we're half the world, we are the

00:45:06.567 --> 00:45:08.142
 mother
     mothers of all man kind.  

00:45:08.143 --> 00:45:12.828
Hello?
          This is about

00:45:16.374 --> 00:45:19.811
 -- it's -- if you're thinking 
of a family, and 

00:45:19.812 --> 00:45:24.517
     you're thinking you know, 
we all agree that raise ago 

00:45:24.518 --> 00:45:27.343
family, you 
     really want to have two 

00:45:27.344 --> 00:45:30.040
parents, you want to have a 
mother and a 

00:45:30.041 --> 00:45:34.184
     father, you want to have a 
father and a father or a mother 

00:45:34.185 --> 00:45:35.435
and 
     mother, whatever it is, but

00:45:35.436 --> 00:45:40.138
 you want to have co-parentsing 
and you 

00:45:40.139 --> 00:45:44.988
     want to have the I didn't 
think and the yang -- why is it 

00:45:44.989 --> 00:45:49.102
that we 
     think that's not purposeful

00:45:49.104 --> 00:45:54.406
 and importance in our 
government? 

00:46:05.004 --> 00:46:09.204
It's a supportive and another 
point of view -- you know? 

00:46:13.149 --> 00:46:17.418
     Went are much less about 
hierarchy and more about commune

00:46:17.421 --> 00:46:18.562
ity in 
     general.

00:46:18.563 --> 00:46:25.078
          That's maybe Anne over
 statement, we don't ask how big

00:46:25.393 --> 00:46:26.646
 is it
     it.

00:46:34.487 --> 00:46:36.487
I couldn't help myself.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.160
Lynda -- I couldn't help it.

00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:47.889
Well,

00:46:50.114 --> 00:46:53.248
 I think it's time for question 
and answer.

00:46:53.249 --> 00:47:00.078
          Because I have had the
 -- I know I get myself in 

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:06.257
trouble all 
     the time. It's okay, you're

00:47:06.289 --> 00:47:08.660
 wonder woman. I know I have had
 the 

00:47:08.661 --> 00:47:11.613
     opportunity to speak with 
you and ask you some questions 

00:47:11.614 --> 00:47:14.597
and it's 
     just one before I open it 

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:17.423
up and let everyone else -- have
 you 

00:47:17.424 --> 00:47:23.707
     had -- I know you've had 
down times your life -- oh yeah,

00:47:23.709 --> 00:47:24.688
 was 
     there something that you 

00:47:24.689 --> 00:47:27.220
said to yourself or how did you 
channel 

00:47:27.221 --> 00:47:32.936
     something to say? To just 
keep going -- 

00:47:32.937 --> 00:47:41.354
          People look at my life
, I was talking to my niece who 

00:47:41.355 --> 00:47:44.000
was is 
     in the audience, people 

00:47:44.001 --> 00:47:48.020
look at my life and say, she's 
had it all

00:47:48.021 --> 00:47:50.021
     all,

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:57.099
 oh, she's -- it's not the truth
. It's not where any of us 

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.653
     are. It's not what has 
happened to any of us.

00:48:06.189 --> 00:48:13.469
Yeah, I dealt with some really 
rough times in my early 

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:18.269
     childhood, in my middle 
childhood, and my teenage years,

00:48:18.568 --> 00:48:22.875
 and my 
     early adult life, and

00:48:28.138 --> 00:48:33.641
 work every time I have I 
graduated high 

00:48:33.642 --> 00:48:40.171
     school, never went to 
College, and had to make a 

00:48:40.172 --> 00:48:44.335
decision -- I 
     actually got a scholarship,

00:48:44.336 --> 00:48:46.336
 an

00:48:48.481 --> 00:48:52.411
 scholarship ats a state 
University

00:48:52.412 --> 00:48:56.957
     University, but also an 
offer to sing on the road for 

00:48:56.958 --> 00:48:58.958
$600 a week
     week,

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:10.519
 working at a pizza parlor to 
earn my way or I went the 

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:17.589
     singing and -- singing on 
the road and the girl singer in 

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:20.863
the 
     band. And making these 

00:49:20.864 --> 00:49:23.143
decisions all along the way 
where you can 

00:49:23.144 --> 00:49:29.814
     go a lot of different ways.
 And I was pretty clear on what 

00:49:29.815 --> 00:49:31.940
I want
     wanted to do. And it wasn't

00:49:31.943 --> 00:49:37.347
 easy.
          But there were a lot 

00:49:37.348 --> 00:49:39.768
harder times than that where you
 think 

00:49:39.769 --> 00:49:42.532
     everything is down, down, 
down on you.

00:49:42.533 --> 00:49:52.476
          And the world is crash
ing in on your soul. And I think

00:49:53.721 --> 00:49:55.721
 the 
     most important

00:49:57.831 --> 00:50:03.391
 thing I learn suicide that I 
didn't have to do it 

00:50:03.392 --> 00:50:09.909
     alone.
          I thought I did. And I

00:50:10.912 --> 00:50:13.220
 thought I was -- family broke 
up 

00:50:13.221 --> 00:50:20.316
     early in my life -- and I 
just kind of -- I was out there 

00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:23.144
and I 
     never -- I didn't go asking

00:50:23.294 --> 00:50:25.294
 for help or for

00:50:28.577 --> 00:50:30.577
 help and

00:50:33.107 --> 00:50:35.080
 -- and you 
     need to do that -- you need

00:50:35.081 --> 00:50:38.102
 to ask your teachers for 
instruction, 

00:50:38.103 --> 00:50:42.219
     if you're not following -- 
your homework -- sometimes your 

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.892
     children are not doing 
their homework because they 

00:50:44.893 --> 00:50:46.766
don't know how 
     to do it.

00:50:46.767 --> 00:50:52.897
          They don't know how to
 organize themselves, sometime 

00:50:52.898 --> 00:50:55.560
that's 
     the reason. Both my 

00:50:55.561 --> 00:51:01.277
children had learning disability
ies, genius IQ

00:51:01.278 --> 00:51:05.681
     IQ's but fell off the map, 
one in math and one in reading. 

00:51:05.828 --> 00:51:07.658
I was 
     able to figure that out 

00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:14.051
when they were very small, and 
got them 

00:51:14.052 --> 00:51:20.343
     some extra help.
          They were, you know, 

00:51:20.344 --> 00:51:24.288
they were so frustrated. And 
they felt 

00:51:24.289 --> 00:51:26.559
     stupid.
          And I'm sure they got 

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:30.857
that from me, the A DD bit or 
the 

00:51:30.858 --> 00:51:33.296
     whatever it was.
          And they're both

00:51:36.521 --> 00:51:38.803
 graduateing law school now and 
are very 

00:51:38.804 --> 00:51:42.780
     successful, but we had to 
retrain their brains doing 

00:51:42.781 --> 00:51:46.472
certain 
     things but getting through 

00:51:46.473 --> 00:51:52.599
it is part of it, you guys. 
That's 

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:58.710
     part of it. It's step one 
foot in front of the other. 

00:51:58.714 --> 00:52:01.497
Stepping 
     through it. It helps to 

00:52:01.498 --> 00:52:03.422
train your brain on how to do 
the next 

00:52:03.423 --> 00:52:08.364
     step, and how you do the 
next step and I figured if this 

00:52:08.365 --> 00:52:10.798
doesn't 
     work this will and if this 

00:52:10.799 --> 00:52:14.487
doesn't then this will, if this 
     doesn't then this will, if 

00:52:14.488 --> 00:52:17.925
this doesn't then this will, and
 ask 

00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:21.317
     for help if you need it, 
and I learn that lesson and I've

00:52:21.461 --> 00:52:24.193
 been in 
     recovery by the way for 20 

00:52:24.194 --> 00:52:27.732
years.

00:52:34.155 --> 00:52:37.538
I'm telling you we're going to 
fireed up and ready to go 

00:52:37.539 --> 00:52:40.373
     after this.
          This is something -- 

00:52:40.374 --> 00:52:44.208
this is a very shameful thing, 
you know

00:52:44.209 --> 00:52:48.508
     know, it's a shameful thing
 to come to terms with. I can do

00:52:52.376 --> 00:52:55.191
me. How could something like 
that get 

00:52:55.192 --> 00:53:00.132
     me. I didn't even drink in 
my mid-twentyies -- it's genetic

00:53:04.443 --> 00:53:07.674
you know -- as soon as I started
 get 

00:53:07.675 --> 00:53:13.789
     drinking to get rid of 
feelings -- so -- and you feel 

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:19.202
so, so, so 
     ashameed. I don't talk 

00:53:19.203 --> 00:53:22.191
about that much but I'm not 
afraid to talk 

00:53:22.192 --> 00:53:25.212
     about it either.
          It's part of being a 

00:53:25.213 --> 00:53:29.621
grown up.
          It's also part --

00:53:34.427 --> 00:53:38.158
It's also part of being wonder 
woman. Yeah.

00:53:38.159 --> 00:53:44.375
          Because what you have 
just said and that's why I said

00:53:46.092 --> 00:53:51.072

spirit and 

00:53:51.073 --> 00:53:54.044
     that wonder woman and you 
have inspireed so many people 

00:53:54.045 --> 00:53:56.368
for so 
     long and we're just so 

00:53:56.369 --> 00:53:58.892
pleased that you can be with us 
here today

00:53:58.893 --> 00:54:02.176

00:54:02.177 --> 00:54:07.974

     what? Kick put next week?

00:54:12.066 --> 00:54:14.257
You're wonderful.
          So thank you so much. 

00:54:14.658 --> 00:54:20.802
I like that you wear flats, I 
mean, I 

00:54:20.803 --> 00:54:26.036
     like heals but -- yeah, 
I've got my kitten heals in the 

00:54:26.037 --> 00:54:28.459
back, I'm 
     putting it on. I had to 

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.773
step it up with you being here 
you must 

00:54:31.774 --> 00:54:36.458
     no, I had to do it. You 
know I've been taking over the 

00:54:36.459 --> 00:54:38.575
whole -- 
     they told me this is going 

00:54:38.576 --> 00:54:41.970
to be 15 minutes -- see? I knew 
they 

00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:45.663
     were lying.
          So we have some people

00:54:45.814 --> 00:54:49.089
 that are really anxious to ask 
some 

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:55.615
     questions and we have two 
people one of both aisles with 

00:54:55.616 --> 00:54:58.613
the 
     microphone so -- that's a 

00:54:58.614 --> 00:55:02.754
-- I have to gain my exposure --
 I'm 

00:55:02.755 --> 00:55:06.143

00:55:22.922 --> 00:55:28.903
     from him, it brings you 
strength, I went to Star Bucks, 

00:55:28.904 --> 00:55:31.063

     be whoever you want to be, 

00:55:31.064 --> 00:55:35.003

00:55:39.863 --> 00:55:42.840
          &gt;&gt; » (APPLAUSE): , and
 we went into Star Bucks and I 

00:55:42.841 --> 00:55:46.380
had to 
     use the restroom and I said

00:55:47.259 --> 00:55:50.553
 I ordered his drink and my 
drink and 

00:55:50.554 --> 00:55:54.080
     I said wonder woman and 
Batman's drink is coming and 

00:55:54.081 --> 00:55:56.496
he's like 
     are you serious mom, and 

00:55:56.497 --> 00:56:01.193
I'm like yeah. He had both of 
our drinks 

00:56:01.194 --> 00:56:05.601
     and it was wonder woman and
 Batman and it's one of my 

00:56:05.602 --> 00:56:07.720
memories we 
     have I wanted to tell you 

00:56:07.721 --> 00:56:09.460
thank you so much from the 
bottom of my 

00:56:09.461 --> 00:56:15.551
     heart. I love you so, so 
much. I traveled far to be here 

00:56:15.552 --> 00:56:17.523
just to 
     be this close to you and 

00:56:17.524 --> 00:56:20.903
you inspire me and you inspire 
my niece, 

00:56:20.904 --> 00:56:26.084
     my family back home -- come
 here.

00:56:47.966 --> 00:56:50.288
Look at you. 

00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:10.071
Two part question -- first part 
is light hearted. I know 

00:57:10.072 --> 00:57:17.848
     you're an avid roller, I 
wonder if you have an invisible 

00:57:17.849 --> 00:57:19.146
boat 
     because I've looked for you

00:57:19.147 --> 00:57:22.540
 and I can't find you? I have 
not web 

00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:28.793
     been rolling this year yet 
but I belong to Potomac

00:57:32.114 --> 00:57:35.320
 boat club and 
     tomorrow some, so I gave my

00:57:36.173 --> 00:57:41.516
 faster rolling boat to the -- 
to the 

00:57:41.517 --> 00:57:48.021
     girl that's are in the o
lymph pig rolling group of -- 

00:57:48.022 --> 00:57:50.535
they're row
     rowing for practicing for 

00:57:50.536 --> 00:57:54.682
the Olympics, it's a single, and
 it was 

00:57:54.683 --> 00:57:58.836
     too fast for me.
          And I have my

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.831
 at Thompson's -- as a matter of
 fact, I'm 

00:58:04.832 --> 00:58:08.643
     going to get back on the 
river. Yeah. Yes.

00:58:13.218 --> 00:58:17.443
It's called telling -- it's that
 really cool looking thing 

00:58:17.444 --> 00:58:23.593
     you see in the Olympics, 
very long and shriek -- it's tip

00:58:23.596 --> 00:58:26.393
py, if 
     you do it wrong you're 

00:58:26.394 --> 00:58:29.522
right in the water.
          The second part is you

00:58:30.082 --> 00:58:35.643
 look amazing -- I am wondering 
what 

00:58:35.644 --> 00:58:40.498
     you do to look so great. 
Thank you, I love you.

00:58:43.596 --> 00:58:47.732
I think we have another one. I 
work on it all the time.

00:58:47.733 --> 00:58:53.454
          You have no idea the 
pressure.

00:58:56.848 --> 00:59:04.914
From my daughter -- mom, why 
aren't you working out. Holy 

00:59:04.915 --> 00:59:07.911
     crap.
          Hi. Hi. My daughter is

00:59:08.778 --> 00:59:10.642
 a lawyer who is studying for 
the bar. 

00:59:10.643 --> 00:59:14.497
     I said are you in the bar 
or studying for the bar?

00:59:14.498 --> 00:59:21.581
          She's probably both.
          So, hi my name is aida

00:59:21.582 --> 00:59:23.824
, I work across the street this 
year, 

00:59:23.825 --> 00:59:27.320
     in my normal job I work for
 the department of difference 

00:59:27.321 --> 00:59:29.321
where I 
     get to travel all over help

00:59:29.392 --> 00:59:31.516
ing people and the like so we 
can live 

00:59:31.517 --> 00:59:36.571
     a better lifestyle. But 
part of it was traveling to Iraq

00:59:36.575 --> 00:59:39.911
 and 
     Afghanistan and in Jordan 

00:59:39.912 --> 00:59:43.038
and I get to interact with women
 who 

00:59:43.039 --> 00:59:47.754
     don't have the same 
opportunities that we do here. 

00:59:47.755 --> 00:59:54.872
And I wear 
     wonder woman everywhere I 

00:59:54.873 --> 01:00:00.285
go.
                    You're in 

01:00:00.286 --> 01:00:07.658
the military? No. They have a 
height/weight 

01:00:07.659 --> 01:00:13.068
     requirement, no. But in 
every country I went the women 

01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:15.907
would come 
     to me on the side and say I

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:19.596
 love wonder woman I want to be 
wonder 

01:00:19.597 --> 01:00:23.923
     woman. Just thank you 
because I always wanted to be 

01:00:23.924 --> 01:00:25.924
wonder woman 
     too and to them I was help

01:00:26.263 --> 01:00:30.577
ing them to be wonder woman. Oh.
          Oh.

01:00:30.578 --> 01:00:33.563
          Thank you.
                    &gt;&gt; » 

01:00:33.564 --> 01:00:35.564
(APPLAUSE): .

01:00:36.794 --> 01:00:41.955
You know, there's -- I really do
 enjoy hearing the stories 

01:00:41.956 --> 01:00:48.872
     and I always have. Many 
actresses or actors they want to

01:00:49.765 --> 01:00:51.296
 divorce 
     themselves from a role 

01:00:51.297 --> 01:00:54.287
because we are actors, we really
 aren't 

01:00:54.288 --> 01:01:01.811
     the people that we play.
          But -- I knew very 

01:01:01.812 --> 01:01:05.655
early on this character is much 
more than 

01:01:05.656 --> 01:01:13.344
     me certainly, and to try to
 divorce myself from the 

01:01:13.345 --> 01:01:15.345
experience 
     that's other people have as

01:01:15.782 --> 01:01:19.614
 a character is silly. Truthful
ly, and 

01:01:19.615 --> 01:01:24.188
     my family experiences it as
 well. The stories that I hear 

01:01:24.189 --> 01:01:27.001
from 
     people are always so -- 

01:01:27.002 --> 01:01:29.832
it's so much fun for me to hear 
and to 

01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:34.848
     look at the glimmer in the 
eyes of parents that tell me 

01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:36.662
about the 
     children or people that 

01:01:36.663 --> 01:01:38.692
tell me about their own 
experiences, 

01:01:38.693 --> 01:01:44.820
     about feelings that they 
have about themselves, or the 

01:01:44.821 --> 01:01:47.095
little 
     plaque that's someone has 

01:01:47.096 --> 01:01:52.634
given them for their work -- the
 symbol

01:01:52.635 --> 01:01:58.471
     symbolism about overcomeing
 things, you know, tragedyies or

01:02:01.286 --> 01:02:04.891
admiration that someone has for 
a certain 

01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:11.252
     woman, this is all part of 
the -- of the sisterhood, it's 

01:02:11.253 --> 01:02:15.134
all 
     part of the idea of wonder 

01:02:15.135 --> 01:02:19.523
woman, and I -- it's you, it's 
you and 

01:02:19.524 --> 01:02:25.294
     me, it's you and me and 
Patty and gal, it's all of us. 

01:02:25.297 --> 01:02:28.755
And that 
     is where some people miss 

01:02:28.756 --> 01:02:33.695
the boat. On -- on this 
character. Yes, 

01:02:33.696 --> 01:02:40.517
     it's a comic book, I mean, 
we're not stupid -- you know, 

01:02:40.518 --> 01:02:45.219
but 
     there is something deeper, 

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:49.621
there is -- there is something 
more 

01:02:49.622 --> 01:02:56.187
     about -- about this -- it's
 not an ideal of a woman, it's 

01:02:56.188 --> 01:02:59.583
about 
     her intellect, it's about 

01:02:59.584 --> 01:03:03.267
her character, and that's what 
lives in 

01:03:03.268 --> 01:03:07.424
     us.
          And you too.

01:03:07.425 --> 01:03:09.234
                    &gt;&gt; » 
(APPLAUSE): .

01:03:09.235 --> 01:03:13.786
          We have time for one 
more question. I want to thank 

01:03:13.787 --> 01:03:15.761
you so 
     much for your career and 

01:03:15.762 --> 01:03:19.937
inspirations, growing up with 
you was 

01:03:19.938 --> 01:03:24.473
     awesome and I know you're 
ethnic heritage is Latina? 

01:03:25.181 --> 01:03:28.394
Uh-huh.
          And I have my son 

01:03:28.395 --> 01:03:31.067
wonder woman doll, I took it 
back when he 

01:03:31.068 --> 01:03:36.440
     got older, how did growing 
up Latina influence your life? I

01:03:36.441 --> 01:03:39.122
 was 
     -- the question is about 

01:03:39.123 --> 01:03:41.956
growing up in a Latina

01:03:45.095 --> 01:03:48.940
 family, my 
     grandmother was -- came 

01:03:48.941 --> 01:03:52.622
over as an infant from Mexico 
and it was 

01:03:52.623 --> 01:04:01.469
     a very rich heritage -- 
it's -- those of you -- any kind

01:04:02.466 --> 01:04:04.452
 of Eds 
     in this case family that is

01:04:04.453 --> 01:04:09.973
 a lot of food and music and 
     interactions and all of 

01:04:09.974 --> 01:04:12.394
that, that's what it meant to me
 and it 

01:04:12.395 --> 01:04:17.823
     was a lot of fighting, a 
lot -- you know, a lot of

01:04:23.002 --> 01:04:26.750
 that malLee 
     making and torteea making 

01:04:26.751 --> 01:04:31.295
and it was really wonderful and 
I -- my 

01:04:31.296 --> 01:04:33.722
     memories are very rich in 
that regard.

01:04:33.723 --> 01:04:37.876
          I wish that my own 
children had had some of that, 

01:04:37.877 --> 01:04:40.001
which they 
     didn't because we liveed on

01:04:41.416 --> 01:04:43.384
 the East coast but I'm still in
 touch 

01:04:43.385 --> 01:04:48.702
     with many of my cousins 
over the years and you know, I 

01:04:48.703 --> 01:04:50.703
have

01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:57.795
 an 
     understanding of the 

01:04:57.796 --> 01:04:59.796
immigrant

01:05:01.594 --> 01:05:08.722
 experience and I have an 
     understanding of being with

01:05:08.723 --> 01:05:10.723
 my

01:05:12.407 --> 01:05:14.407
 cousins

01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:24.083
 my -- my mother came from 
     a family of ten and in 

01:05:24.084 --> 01:05:30.617
those days in my town where my 
grandmother 

01:05:30.618 --> 01:05:35.618
     was from, her first husband
 died and the second husband had

01:05:37.895 --> 01:05:40.718
 that came after had darker skin
 so 

01:05:40.719 --> 01:05:45.562
     the cousins and that had 
darker skin and we would be 

01:05:45.563 --> 01:05:49.665
together, 
     and I experienceed this -- 

01:05:49.666 --> 01:05:53.411
this racism and hatred of others
 -- the 

01:05:53.412 --> 01:06:01.345
     other -- and it was so 
confusing to me. It was so 

01:06:01.346 --> 01:06:03.768
unfair, it was 
     --

01:06:06.931 --> 01:06:10.312
 my grandmother would ask me to 
take something, return 

01:06:10.313 --> 01:06:14.986
     something, at the store and
 I said why doesn't he do it and

01:06:15.288 --> 01:06:18.307
 she 
     would say because they 

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:21.663
won't take it from him.
          I would take it back 

01:06:21.664 --> 01:06:25.955
and they would take it from me.
          And they wouldn't take

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.664
 the return from the darker skin

01:06:28.665 --> 01:06:31.822
     cousin.
          And you know,

01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:37.755
 it hurts new a a place that

01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:45.419
 hurts you in some 
     raw place that unless 

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:47.547
you've experienceed it you don't
 understand. 

01:06:47.548 --> 01:06:52.706
     Personally did I experience
? My children are Jewish, so

01:06:56.538 --> 01:06:59.073
 how far 
     -- how many steps removeed 

01:06:59.074 --> 01:07:01.905
are we from pilgrims

01:07:04.936 --> 01:07:08.090
 of Europe and you 
     know. People I can't think

01:07:08.092 --> 01:07:11.016
ing people off of streets like 
is 

01:07:11.017 --> 01:07:17.278
     happening with ICE right 
now. It's scary stuff. So anyway

01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:20.567
, that 
     is my Latina experience and

01:07:20.721 --> 01:07:24.408
 most of it is absolutely grow
ing it 

01:07:24.409 --> 01:07:30.534
     and I loveed it. That's 
what I take from it -- a great 

01:07:30.535 --> 01:07:31.931
amount of 
     understand 

01:07:31.932 --> 01:07:38.945
     understanding and love for 
hard-working immigrant families.
