And a very, very special shout 
out to "Code Girl" Dorothy 

00:20:31.499 --> 00:20:34.157
Braden Bruce, Dot, who could not

00:20:34.158 --> 00:20:35.781
from Virginia.  We miss you, 
Dot.

00:20:35.782 --> 00:20:38.780
(Applause)

00:20:43.706 --> 00:20:45.732
If you have been a friend of the
Library of Congress' history 

00:20:45.733 --> 00:20:51.055
project for more than a year, 
then you may recall we were in 

00:20:51.056 --> 00:20:53.299
the very same room last March 
celebrating women's history 

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.537
month and at that time we were 
hosting a book talk 

00:20:58.618 --> 00:21:01.276
with the New York Times best 
selling author, Liza Mundy, who 

00:21:01.277 --> 00:21:04.926
wrote "Code Girls: The Untold 
Story of the American Women Code

00:21:04.927 --> 00:21:07.374
Breakers of World War II"."
     We are excited to have Liza

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:09.612
back with us today as she will 
provide 

00:21:12.651 --> 00:21:14.651
historical context to these 
women's a service.

00:21:16.173 --> 00:21:18.173
But I want to make it clear that

00:21:20.855 --> 00:21:22.476
today, women, history month is a
way of showing a long overdue 

00:21:22.477 --> 00:21:27.573
public appreciation on behalf of
of a grateful nation to the 

00:21:27.574 --> 00:21:28.997
World War II "Code Girls" 
including those who are no 

00:21:28.998 --> 00:21:30.998
longer with us.

00:21:33.305 --> 00:21:35.305
As a woman, I understand there 
are 

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.218
some things we prefer not to 
discuss, but today, I will make 

00:21:38.219 --> 00:21:42.940
an exception because they "Code 
Girls" who are with us today, 

00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:44.941
while they may not care to 

00:21:46.008 --> 00:21:48.008
admit it, all are in their 
mid-nineties and older.

00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:53.117
I imagine still traveling after 
all, these years.  I realize it 

00:21:53.118 --> 00:21:55.680
is no small feat for them to 
join us today in person, which 

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:57.681
makes their presence all the 
more special.

00:22:01.213 --> 00:22:03.078
I had the privilege of spending 
some time with them, getting to 

00:22:03.079 --> 00:22:05.079
know them 

00:22:06.766 --> 00:22:10.214
earlier this morning and all I 
can say is, "Wow!" And I hope to

00:22:10.215 --> 00:22:12.215
be as spry and sharp as they are
when I hit my mid-nineties.

00:22:15.372 --> 00:22:17.372
If I had known being a math or 

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.463
linguistics major was the secret
to longevity, I would have 

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:23.533
changed my college plans.  If 
there are any students 

00:22:23.534 --> 00:22:25.534
listening, please take note.

00:22:28.611 --> 00:22:30.258
The veterans history Project 
collects, preserves, and makes 

00:22:30.259 --> 00:22:35.338
accessible the stories of the 
United States military veterans 

00:22:35.339 --> 00:22:37.155
who served from World War I to 
the current conflict so that 

00:22:37.156 --> 00:22:42.290
future generations may directly 
hear from them and better 

00:22:42.291 --> 00:22:44.291
understand their selfless 
service.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.209
To date we have over 110,000 
collections in our archives and 

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.210
that number grows daily.

00:22:52.895 --> 00:22:54.895
Our collections include video, 
audio 

00:22:55.952 --> 00:22:57.981
reported oral history 
interviews, photographs, 

00:22:57.982 --> 00:22:59.982
letters, military 

00:23:01.247 --> 00:23:02.272
documents, journals and diaries,
and even two-dimensional 

00:23:02.273 --> 00:23:07.140
artwork.  We, not only highlight
existing collections, but we 

00:23:07.141 --> 00:23:12.078
continue to solicit volunteers 
from across the nation to gather

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:13.493
these stories from the veterans 
and their lives and their 

00:23:13.494 --> 00:23:15.494
communities.

00:23:17.593 --> 00:23:19.413
So we hear their first remanence
is, personal philosophy, and 

00:23:19.414 --> 00:23:24.056
their creativity so we can 
preserve it.  And in doing so, 

00:23:24.057 --> 00:23:27.314
we all better understand our 
history.  You may be wondering 

00:23:27.315 --> 00:23:32.511
how a project that focuses on 
oral history and other materials

00:23:32.512 --> 00:23:36.787
took on the role of hosting a 
reunion for "Code Girls."  Well,

00:23:36.788 --> 00:23:38.415
very much like what we do, it 
all started with a research 

00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:40.416
question.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.095
As part of the nation of's 
library, research is at the crux

00:23:43.096 --> 00:23:45.096
of everything that we do.

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:49.421
We don't just collect materials 
and tuck them away on a shelf 

00:23:49.422 --> 00:23:51.869
never to be seen again, we are 
in constant 

00:23:56.194 --> 00:23:58.194
communication with researchers, 
authors, 

00:24:04.741 --> 00:24:06.360
scholars, filmmakers, family may
peers, and the general public, 

00:24:06.361 --> 00:24:08.802
all of them who are looking for 
authentic first-hand accounts 

00:24:08.803 --> 00:24:09.639
that cannot always be found in 
textbooks or official service 

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.640
records.  So in Liza was 
connecting research for 

00:24:14.315 --> 00:24:15.934
her book, she contacted the 
Veterans History Project as one 

00:24:15.935 --> 00:24:18.587
of her many vital resources.  
Was the book was published, the 

00:24:19.809 --> 00:24:21.027
outpouring of interest in the 
"Code Girls" was nothing short 

00:24:21.028 --> 00:24:23.028
of amazing.

00:24:25.094 --> 00:24:27.094
As the people read their books, 
they 

00:24:28.173 --> 00:24:31.011
recognize bits and pieces of 
their mother, their aunts, their

00:24:31.012 --> 00:24:33.012
grandmother's history.

00:24:34.271 --> 00:24:36.713
A certain mystique surrounding 
her role in the war effort and 

00:24:36.714 --> 00:24:39.788
unexplained military documents 
among personal belongings and 

00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:44.052
hit them photographs she just 
wouldn't talk about.  Soon an 

00:24:44.053 --> 00:24:46.493
online community began to take 
shape and many wondered why it 

00:24:46.494 --> 00:24:49.545
seemed the "Code Girls" had been
all, but written out of history.

00:24:52.811 --> 00:24:54.025
The time is now, they said, to 
publicly honor these women for 

00:24:54.026 --> 00:24:57.683
their brilliance and bravery.  
The only thing left to do was to

00:24:57.684 --> 00:24:59.684
find 

00:25:01.164 --> 00:25:03.164
someone willing and able to host
what is 

00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:05.848
now known as the first national 
reunion for these historic 

00:25:05.849 --> 00:25:09.112
changemakers.  Fast forward a 
few months and here we are.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.205
As she comes forward, I would 
like to thank Liza for allowing 

00:25:14.206 --> 00:25:16.206
her research to 

00:25:17.876 --> 00:25:19.303
be the spark that lit this fire 
that encouraged the Veterans 

00:25:19.304 --> 00:25:21.304
History Project to coordinate 
this event.

00:25:23.162 --> 00:25:25.162
It has been a labor of love.

00:25:27.074 --> 00:25:30.407
Ladies and gentlemen, I present 
to you Liza Mundy.

00:25:27.074 --> 00:25:29.074
(Applause)

00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:42.941
     LIZA MUNDY:  Thank you, so 
much, Karen.

00:25:45.626 --> 00:25:47.261
Good morning, everybody, good 
afternoon, and happy Women’s 

00:25:47.262 --> 00:25:51.167
History Month.  Recently I was 
at dinner with a group of men 

00:25:51.168 --> 00:25:52.975
and women and it happened to be 
international women's day that 

00:25:52.976 --> 00:25:54.976
day and 

00:25:56.271 --> 00:25:58.271
we were chatting about it and 
the women 

00:25:59.534 --> 00:26:02.467
present thanked the men for 
giving us a day.

00:25:59.534 --> 00:26:01.534
(Laughter)

00:26:03.197 --> 00:26:05.197
And the men graciously told us 
that we were welcome.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.496
So with regard to months, I 
think it is good to have months 

00:26:09.497 --> 00:26:13.963
devoted to special groups, but 
it would of course have been 

00:26:13.964 --> 00:26:17.633
nice or every month or 
everybody's history month.  

00:26:17.634 --> 00:26:19.634
Unfortunately, great research 
institutions like the library of

00:26:20.709 --> 00:26:23.141
congress exist to make sure that
that happens.  And I want to 

00:26:23.142 --> 00:26:25.993
thank Karen and Liza Taylor and 
the staff of the Veterans 

00:26:28.499 --> 00:26:31.348
History Project for maintaining 
such a wonderful archive of 

00:26:31.349 --> 00:26:35.623
recollections of our nation's 
service members and through the 

00:26:35.624 --> 00:26:37.624
contributions that the families 
are 

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.110
making today to augment the 
holdings of the Veterans History

00:26:40.111 --> 00:26:45.394
Project, you are making sure 
that they women's experience is 

00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:47.219
ever better recorded and I can 
ensure you that your donation is

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.220
in very good hands.

00:26:50.511 --> 00:26:52.342
When I was researching "Code 
Girls" I was so grateful for the

00:26:52.343 --> 00:26:56.606
collection of military oral 
histories and other documents 

00:26:56.607 --> 00:26:58.607
and the knowledge and ability 

00:27:02.908 --> 00:27:03.724
and helpfulness of the staff at 
the Veterans History Project was

00:27:03.725 --> 00:27:07.015
incredible.  It is not an 
exaggeration to say that it is 

00:27:07.016 --> 00:27:08.228
thrilling to avail oneself of 
research in such a magnificent 

00:27:08.229 --> 00:27:12.884
setting.  It is also daunting 
and thrilling to speak in a 

00:27:12.885 --> 00:27:14.932
setting like this.
     But if you want to talk 

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:17.759
about daunting, our recently had
an experience that was even more

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.760
challenging.

00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:24.011
I had to talk to a group of 
fifth graders.

00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:23.211
(Laughter)

00:27:24.695 --> 00:27:26.757
There was a young reader's 
addition of "Code Girls" which 

00:27:26.758 --> 00:27:28.758
means that the 

00:27:30.019 --> 00:27:31.842
inspiring story of the code 
women is being imparted to girls

00:27:31.843 --> 00:27:34.302
and two boys to tell the story 
of women's contributions 

00:27:37.553 --> 00:27:38.789
to what was early computer 
coding and research as well as 

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.790
code breaking.

00:27:42.258 --> 00:27:45.538
I was very nervous because 
12-year-olds are a tough crowd. 

00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:47.366
They don't necessarily have to 
listen or be polite and I didn't

00:27:47.367 --> 00:27:51.859
have any gimmicks to keep them 
occupied.  There had been a 

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.918
power outage that morning and 
the power wasn't working so 

00:27:56.972 --> 00:27:58.972
I didn't have my PowerPoint and 
I had to improvise.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.094
So in a bit of a panic I ask how
many of them had ever 

00:28:03.095 --> 00:28:05.337
constructed some sort of secret 
language to communicate with a 

00:28:08.194 --> 00:28:09.612
friend or another person, 
something actually we were just 

00:28:09.613 --> 00:28:13.491
talking about at lunch today 
before this event.  Every hand 

00:28:13.492 --> 00:28:15.492
in the room shot up.

00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:18.430
And when I ask them what sort of
language that they had used, 

00:28:18.431 --> 00:28:22.732
what sort of codes and ciphers 
they had created, there was an 

00:28:22.733 --> 00:28:25.371
astonishing variety.  Some of 
them had developed their own 

00:28:25.579 --> 00:28:28.435
sign language.  Some of them 
were using fancy versions 

00:28:31.687 --> 00:28:34.123
of pig Latin and some actually 
new specific historical code and

00:28:34.124 --> 00:28:36.167
cipher system like the pigpen 
site, which 

00:28:40.282 --> 00:28:42.282
involves a table that I don't 
personally understand.

00:28:43.339 --> 00:28:45.776
One girl said she would put a 
Greek language template over her

00:28:45.777 --> 00:28:50.654
computer keyboard and send a 
message to a friend and the 

00:28:50.655 --> 00:28:51.661
friend would use Google 
Translate to decipher the 

00:28:51.662 --> 00:28:53.662
message.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.378
And when I ask them if they ever
used their phones to communicate

00:28:57.379 --> 00:29:00.444
with each other, they said, "We 
are not allowed to have cell 

00:29:00.445 --> 00:29:05.112
phones.  We are fifth graders!" 
And when I ask them what they 

00:29:05.113 --> 00:29:08.796
were communicating, they were 
trying to conspire with friends 

00:29:08.797 --> 00:29:14.073
to get their parents to do 
things like set up a dates.  I 

00:29:14.074 --> 00:29:15.697
mentioned this because it got me
thinking what I thought so many 

00:29:15.698 --> 00:29:17.698
times 

00:29:24.458 --> 00:29:25.684
during the course of writing 
this book about the fundamental 

00:29:25.685 --> 00:29:27.537
human urge to communicate.  And 
it since the origins of 

00:29:27.538 --> 00:29:30.190
language, since the origins of 
our ability to write and speak, 

00:29:30.191 --> 00:29:31.417
it has been our impulse to 
communicate urgently with 

00:29:31.418 --> 00:29:34.458
someone who is important to us, 
often with the hopes that the 

00:29:34.459 --> 00:29:37.120
enemy will be able to 
understand.  This happens in 

00:29:37.121 --> 00:29:41.413
wars and military settings and a
pharmacy and the context of 

00:29:41.414 --> 00:29:43.644
government where there is a real
enemy often, but for children, 

00:29:43.645 --> 00:29:47.698
the enemy of course is us, 
right?  The adults and parents.

00:29:51.541 --> 00:29:53.541
But the topic

00:29:56.257 --> 00:29:57.689
of communication is so 
fundamental to why we are here 

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.939
it is indeed a fundamental human
urge.  It is a necessity and, in

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.778
essence, in wartime as well as 
the diplomacy.  It is something 

00:30:02.779 --> 00:30:04.779
we have to do as well as people 
and countries and government 

00:30:06.045 --> 00:30:08.075
leaders, but what struck me also
interviewing the women for my 

00:30:08.076 --> 00:30:10.076
book is 

00:30:11.958 --> 00:30:14.431
that they were unable for so 
many years to communicate to 

00:30:14.432 --> 00:30:16.860
anyone the importance of what 
they had contributed during 

00:30:19.544 --> 00:30:21.544
World War II at this crucial 
moment for the world.

00:30:21.983 --> 00:30:23.983
To give you a sense of what that

00:30:25.451 --> 00:30:27.451
was like for them emotionally, 
the 

00:30:29.468 --> 00:30:31.468
central character in my book,

00:30:33.185 --> 00:30:34.606
Dot, Dorothy Braden Bruce, she 
worked all during World War II 

00:30:34.607 --> 00:30:36.607
during what was 

00:30:38.278 --> 00:30:40.363
called 2, 4, 6, 8, what was 
being used by the Japanese 

00:30:40.364 --> 00:30:43.411
supply ship to supply the 
Japanese Army.  It was one of 

00:30:43.412 --> 00:30:45.901
the three most important code 
breaking operations during World

00:30:45.902 --> 00:30:49.367
War II.  After the war she had 
two younger brothers who were 

00:30:49.368 --> 00:30:51.368
both in military service and 
they both fortunately 

00:30:54.349 --> 00:30:56.373
survive the war and when they 
came back, they both had jobs 

00:30:56.374 --> 00:30:59.249
involved with top-secret 
security clearance is.  And I 

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.276
learned after the book came out 
from one of her nephews that at 

00:31:01.277 --> 00:31:03.277
family reunions the brothers 
would come 

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:07.826
together and talk about their 
top-secret security clearances 

00:31:07.827 --> 00:31:09.864
and Dot could never tell them 
she had a top-secret security 

00:31:11.899 --> 00:31:14.134
clearance as well during the war
and that is the kind of thing 

00:31:14.135 --> 00:31:16.802
that the women had to put up 
with and live with and I 

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.090
think many of them accepted it 
as what 

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.806
happens when you do intelligence
work during wartime, or at any 

00:31:25.807 --> 00:31:27.807
other time, 

00:31:29.272 --> 00:31:31.713
but the thing is that even after
these story was declassified, 

00:31:31.714 --> 00:31:34.370
most of them never realized 
this.  Some of the women were 

00:31:34.371 --> 00:31:37.825
told that it was okay to finally
talk about most of the women 

00:31:37.826 --> 00:31:39.826
worked.

00:31:41.088 --> 00:31:43.534
Many of them, you know, never 
told anybody what they had did, 

00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:47.010
never got credit for their work.
And so when I was interviewing 

00:31:47.011 --> 00:31:49.011
women, often I had to convince 
them.

00:31:52.093 --> 00:31:53.516
Like we had to convince a Dot it
was finally okay to tell her 

00:31:53.517 --> 00:31:55.517
story and it took us about a 
half in.

00:31:57.795 --> 00:32:00.839
And she finally said, "What are 
they going to do?  Put me in 

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.893
prison?"  And I said, "At your 
age, it will probably be a nice 

00:32:04.894 --> 00:32:07.599
present."  And so she had a good
sense of humor and she liked 

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.929
that.  But I know that women 
were powerfully motivated to 

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.167
tell their stories and finally 
get credit for what they did and

00:32:17.424 --> 00:32:18.833
I will never forget when Janice,
a graduate who served in the 

00:32:18.834 --> 00:32:22.488
U.S. Navy, I was interviewing 
her in the emergency room 

00:32:22.489 --> 00:32:24.941
because she broke her wrist the 
night before and she said, "I 

00:32:27.992 --> 00:32:29.823
hope I live long enough to see 
your book published."  And I'm 

00:32:29.824 --> 00:32:32.056
very happy to say that she did 
and it was very meaningful for 

00:32:32.057 --> 00:32:36.733
the women I think to have their 
achievements known and 

00:32:36.734 --> 00:32:37.963
recognized entities it is very 
meaningful for me to be trusted 

00:32:37.964 --> 00:32:39.964
with 

00:32:41.027 --> 00:32:43.027
their story, to know that they 
were 

00:32:44.042 --> 00:32:46.042
communicating

00:32:58.531 --> 00:32:59.550
there secret to me and that it 
was my responsibility to try to 

00:32:59.551 --> 00:33:01.389
communicate their story 
accurately and well.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:02.816
I want to particularly thank Jim
Broome who sat with me to 

00:33:02.817 --> 00:33:04.817
persuade his mother to talk.  
That was the first interview I 

00:33:06.121 --> 00:33:07.736
conducted for my book and it did
signal to me that it would be 

00:33:07.737 --> 00:33:10.187
possible, might be possible to 
find the women and persuade them

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:12.188
to talk and I would like to 
thank Debbie Anderson who 

00:33:12.432 --> 00:33:13.677
unfortunately is not here today,
but she had amassed a really 

00:33:13.678 --> 00:33:16.723
impressive archive of women who 
worked in Dayton, Ohio,, helping

00:33:16.724 --> 00:33:18.724
to build the machines that we 

00:33:20.372 --> 00:33:23.058
would use to work with the 
German ciphers.  She worked with

00:33:23.059 --> 00:33:25.319
those women in Dayton for a 
number of years and I benefited 

00:33:26.745 --> 00:33:29.390
enormously from a number of her 
archives.  There are so many 

00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:31.639
family members here.  I have 
e-mail with you and talked with 

00:33:33.252 --> 00:33:35.920
you on the phone and you have 
made your family records 

00:33:35.921 --> 00:33:37.921
available to me and made 

00:33:39.182 --> 00:33:41.639
oral histories available, 
memorabilia, scrapbooks -- the 

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.295
women, they saved their 
restaurant menus and saved their

00:33:46.119 --> 00:33:48.142
concert tickets in Washington, 
every scrap of information that 

00:33:48.143 --> 00:33:50.591
the women saved was useful to me
in trying to 

00:33:54.055 --> 00:33:55.705
convey what wartime Washington 
was like where women were living

00:33:55.706 --> 00:33:59.170
in the nation's S capitol and 
often living un-chaperoned for 

00:33:59.171 --> 00:34:00.598
the first time in their life.  
They'll remember remembered when

00:34:00.599 --> 00:34:02.599
the 

00:34:04.262 --> 00:34:04.467
liquor stores was closed in DC 
versus Virginia.

00:34:04.468 --> 00:34:06.701
(Laughter)
     But I want to thank the 

00:34:06.702 --> 00:34:10.354
family members who rightly 
recognized that your mother's 

00:34:10.355 --> 00:34:13.204
grandmothers are national 
treasures and who had kept this 

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.894
memorabilia and made it 
available to me for this attempt

00:34:18.895 --> 00:34:22.399
to communicate what the women it
contributed.  All of this is a 

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.400
form of communication.

00:34:25.676 --> 00:34:27.705
It enables authors to 
communicate the tail a way to 

00:34:27.706 --> 00:34:29.536
tell it in a way that is vivid 
enough that people want to read 

00:34:29.537 --> 00:34:31.981
it.
     I worry sometimes that 

00:34:31.982 --> 00:34:34.414
readers might disbelieve this 
story given its magnitude.

00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:39.911
This is a story of more than 
10,000 

00:34:40.963 --> 00:34:42.382
women who answered the nation's 
call to serve as their brothers 

00:34:42.383 --> 00:34:46.910
and boyfriends were getting on 
aircraft carriers and convoys 

00:34:46.911 --> 00:34:48.568
out in the Pacific and Atlantic 
ocean.  These women are small 

00:34:48.569 --> 00:34:51.221
towns.  They were recruited as 
college seniors.

00:34:54.473 --> 00:34:56.703
They were called in and ask 
questions like, "Do you like 

00:34:56.704 --> 00:34:58.704
crossword puzzles?

00:35:00.574 --> 00:35:02.574
And are you engaged to be 
married?

00:35:04.426 --> 00:35:06.869
"  And many of them were 
schoolteachers who signed up for

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.870
the war Department not knowing 
even what the secret work was 

00:35:09.509 --> 00:35:10.937
that they were going to be 
doing.  They came to Washington 

00:35:10.938 --> 00:35:12.938
and generally their welcome to 
Washington was being 

00:35:15.602 --> 00:35:16.640
told that they would be shot if 
they talked about the work that 

00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:20.315
they were doing during the war. 
That was there greeting upon 

00:35:20.316 --> 00:35:22.316
arriving 

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:25.391
in the nation's capitol and I 
worried sometimes -- this was an

00:35:25.392 --> 00:35:28.859
untold story and I thought our 
people really going to believe 

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.860
this?

00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:34.552
And if I can find women who will
tell me their story and what 

00:35:34.553 --> 00:35:36.578
they remember, I worried how 
will I document this and how 

00:35:37.612 --> 00:35:39.612
will I substantiate it?

00:35:40.924 --> 00:35:42.547
So one again, I'm so grateful to
the Library of Congress for 

00:35:42.548 --> 00:35:47.852
providing the records to help 
document a story and all of the 

00:35:47.853 --> 00:35:49.853
families who had saved all of 
these letters.

00:35:51.097 --> 00:35:53.097
And as Karen mentioned, snippets
of 

00:35:54.355 --> 00:35:56.835
things that sometimes they did 
not know what had happened, what

00:35:56.836 --> 00:35:59.669
had gone on, most of these women
would not tell their families 

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.303
what they have been doing in 
Washington, but the families 

00:36:01.304 --> 00:36:04.753
knew the records were important 
and they saved them and made 

00:36:04.754 --> 00:36:06.754
them available and I 

00:36:08.215 --> 00:36:09.851
guarantee and you read every 
word and it all was used to try 

00:36:09.852 --> 00:36:12.726
to communicate the story.  As I 
imagine most of you know World 

00:36:14.185 --> 00:36:16.185
War II was a tipping point for 
women joining the military.

00:36:19.103 --> 00:36:21.103
It was a big deal when the WAVES
was created in the U.S.

00:36:23.982 --> 00:36:26.013
Navy, women accepted for the 
military service.  There will 

00:36:26.014 --> 00:36:29.480
women Marines and women were 
accepted in the WACs.  This was 

00:36:29.481 --> 00:36:31.936
a tipping point and it was a big
deal because this was total war,

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.140
global warp.

00:36:36.005 --> 00:36:38.005
The men had shipped out and the 
nation 

00:36:39.498 --> 00:36:41.498
was willing to be what we would 
today 

00:36:43.777 --> 00:36:45.402
call inclusive, to tap the 
women, to send out emissaries to

00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:50.902
recruit women from colleges and 
from teachers colleges.  Women 

00:36:50.903 --> 00:36:54.759
blue transport planes and they 
worked in air traffic towers.  

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.427
They received Morse code 
communications.  They encoded 

00:36:57.428 --> 00:37:01.885
our own US military messages and
they followed the men onto the 

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:03.741
beaches of Normandy after the 
D-Day landings and would run 

00:37:03.742 --> 00:37:05.742
communication for 

00:37:06.786 --> 00:37:09.630
the Allied forces as we were 
chasing the Germans through 

00:37:09.631 --> 00:37:11.858
France and Belgium and, of 
course, they broke codes and the

00:37:13.487 --> 00:37:15.970
military victory as a result of 
code breaking it during World 

00:37:15.971 --> 00:37:20.429
War II are too numerous to 
mention here and they include 

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.682
the bait -- a great victory in 
the Battle of Midway, which is 

00:37:21.683 --> 00:37:25.333
one of the most famous battles 
of all time.  It was the turning

00:37:25.334 --> 00:37:27.334
point in the 

00:37:28.422 --> 00:37:29.428
Pacific war where we had been so
terribly surprised at Pearl 

00:37:29.429 --> 00:37:31.429
Harbor six months earlier.

00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:36.579
Dates were used by the U-boats 
in the Atlantic and the breaking

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.018
up the water transport code 
being used by the ships 

00:37:41.494 --> 00:37:42.314
supplying the Japanese Army as 
well as reading diplomatic 

00:37:42.315 --> 00:37:44.315
communications that 

00:37:45.777 --> 00:37:47.777
Japanese diplomats or sending 
from Europe back to Tokyo.

00:37:51.279 --> 00:37:53.305
We read every one of those 
things woman named Genevieve who

00:37:53.306 --> 00:37:57.996
had the insight in 1940 that 
allowed us to break that machine

00:37:57.997 --> 00:37:59.622
cipher, and the kind of 
intelligence that we got from 

00:37:59.623 --> 00:38:01.623
these key medications.

00:38:03.078 --> 00:38:05.358
To give you one example the 
Japanese diplomats were invited 

00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:09.856
to tour the coast of France and 
Hitler's Atlantic wall, which 

00:38:09.857 --> 00:38:13.135
was his fortification to repel 
an Allied invasion.  They 

00:38:13.136 --> 00:38:15.169
dutifully reported back to Tokyo
on where the coast of France was

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.631
well fortified and where it 
wasn't so we knew when we 

00:38:18.632 --> 00:38:21.085
planned the D-Day landings that 
Normandy would be a better place

00:38:21.086 --> 00:38:23.086
to land 

00:38:24.787 --> 00:38:27.046
then a spot like Calay.  That is
a kind of service the women 

00:38:28.882 --> 00:38:31.554
provided and after the war there
was no going back in terms of 

00:38:31.555 --> 00:38:33.555
women military services.

00:38:34.818 --> 00:38:36.324
And so again, on behalf of all 
researchers, I want to thank you

00:38:36.325 --> 00:38:39.398
for your donations today.  
Because you are ensuring that 

00:38:41.008 --> 00:38:43.276
researchers and authors will 
continue to be able to 

00:38:43.277 --> 00:38:45.277
communicate the story to the 
American public, to fill out our

00:38:47.598 --> 00:38:50.036
understanding of our nation's 
history and the effect of which 

00:38:50.037 --> 00:38:52.314
women have served in the 
military for more than half a 

00:38:52.315 --> 00:38:54.315
century now.

00:38:55.373 --> 00:38:57.193
And you know it is important to 
fill out our understanding of 

00:38:57.194 --> 00:39:01.075
American History and the many 
groups of people who have served

00:39:01.076 --> 00:39:02.903
the cause of freedom and 
contributed to the progress of 

00:39:02.904 --> 00:39:04.904
our country.

00:39:06.365 --> 00:39:09.001
I just keep coming back to this 
theme of communication.  It is 

00:39:09.002 --> 00:39:11.850
so essential for the individual,
right?  We all have the need to 

00:39:11.851 --> 00:39:15.719
communicate our own personal 
thoughts and stories, but for 

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.551
our understanding of ourselves. 
And I also want to say how 

00:39:18.552 --> 00:39:22.217
inspired I was personally by the
stories that these women 

00:39:22.218 --> 00:39:24.653
communicated to me.  There were 
many days when I felt 

00:39:29.345 --> 00:39:30.767
overwhelmed by the task of 
understanding and writing the 

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:32.768
story of their service and 
whenever I felt overwhelmed, I 

00:39:33.213 --> 00:39:35.464
thought about the job they had 
to do during wartime, so 

00:39:35.465 --> 00:39:40.394
emotionally stressful, and so 
intellectually challenging.  And

00:39:40.395 --> 00:39:42.817
the fact that lives were at 
stake and the fact they had to 

00:39:42.818 --> 00:39:44.818
work as quickly as possible.

00:39:46.328 --> 00:39:48.386
And I felt so inspired by this 
and I know now that readers feel

00:39:48.387 --> 00:39:50.615
the same way.  And as a nation 
it is helpful and 

00:39:54.081 --> 00:39:56.314
heartening to read true stories 
of inspiring achievement and the

00:39:56.315 --> 00:40:00.449
women in this audience, as well 
as those who could not be here 

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.450
are a stirring example 

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:05.945
of that to remind us of who we 
are, and to recall us to our 

00:40:05.946 --> 00:40:07.946
best selves.

00:40:10.458 --> 00:40:12.305
The thing that surprised me most
was how many families of "Code 

00:40:12.306 --> 00:40:16.766
Girls" I heard from after the 
book was published.  Many of you

00:40:16.767 --> 00:40:18.767
are in the audience today 

00:40:20.447 --> 00:40:23.913
and many are serving in the 
diplomatic intelligence 

00:40:20.447 --> 00:40:22.714
community.  It is no 
exaggeration to say that the 

00:40:26.161 --> 00:40:28.210
"Code Girls," through your 
military service, not only 

00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:30.211
helped in the war, but you also 
established a tradition of 

00:40:32.319 --> 00:40:34.319
military and public service in 
your own families.

00:40:36.392 --> 00:40:39.049
And so I just wanted to read 
from the afterward of the 

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:41.492
paperback some of the 
testimonials that I got from 

00:40:41.493 --> 00:40:45.217
readers talking about their 
mothers and grandmothers and 

00:40:45.218 --> 00:40:47.218
what they learned that 

00:40:50.567 --> 00:40:52.582
they had never been told by 
women who were just not going to

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:55.061
talk about it.
     , "My mother would never 

00:40:55.062 --> 00:40:57.062
tell me 

00:40:59.565 --> 00:41:01.390
what she did during the war" 
wrote Karen stop Johnson, 

00:41:01.391 --> 00:41:03.829
daughter of anime May Barrett.  
Her mother enlisted in the way 

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:08.340
be a member of the WAVES, was a 
math whiz and obtained a very 

00:41:08.341 --> 00:41:10.828
high clearances in her work.  
And "Code Girls," she wrote, 

00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:15.735
offered her a window into what 
her mother's life entailed.  

00:41:15.736 --> 00:41:17.736
Here is another one.  I feel as 
though my life has been 

00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:22.773
turned upside down, wrote Gail 
Simmons, Provost of the 

00:41:22.774 --> 00:41:26.844
University.  Simmons knew her 
mother, Barber June was in some 

00:41:26.845 --> 00:41:28.903
fashion a "Code Girl" and she 
served in the WAVES and went to 

00:41:28.904 --> 00:41:33.186
Boot Camp at Hunter College and 
would, if pressed, say that she 

00:41:33.187 --> 00:41:37.257
did work with codes, but like 
the women you described, she 

00:41:37.258 --> 00:41:40.512
would not crack and give anyone 
in the family any details.  It 

00:41:40.513 --> 00:41:42.755
was clear that something about 
the experience had affected her 

00:41:42.756 --> 00:41:47.483
deeply, but she opened up to no 
one.  Reading the book, GAEL 

00:41:47.484 --> 00:41:51.961
wrote, at all suddenly makes the
snippets I knew about my mother 

00:41:51.962 --> 00:41:54.415
add up and it has taken my 
breath away.  It has brought a 

00:41:54.416 --> 00:41:57.267
feeling of closeness with my 
mother that I never had while 

00:41:58.083 --> 00:42:00.083
she was living.

00:42:01.163 --> 00:42:02.604
Jenny Landis wrote to me about 
her mother Mary who had 

00:42:02.605 --> 00:42:06.702
graduated from Montana State 
College with a degree in math 

00:42:06.703 --> 00:42:09.145
and science before joining the 
WAVES.  Mom never mentioned her 

00:42:09.146 --> 00:42:11.400
service until at least 50 years 
have passed, Jenny wrote.

00:42:14.447 --> 00:42:16.447
She died in 1992 and we had not 
asked or any detailed questions.

00:42:18.129 --> 00:42:20.371
It is difficult to realize that 
our mother, a brilliant and 

00:42:20.372 --> 00:42:22.372
incredible woman 

00:42:25.225 --> 00:42:27.225
was resigned to a life of house 
wiferery post-World War II.

00:42:30.656 --> 00:42:33.554
Other were almost funny.  Norman
wrote about her mother, Jean 

00:42:35.384 --> 00:42:37.835
Theresa and he recalled that 
once he was sitting in his 

00:42:37.836 --> 00:42:39.836
parents' den with his 

00:42:41.145 --> 00:42:41.748
parents and sibling watching a 
60-minute segment about World 

00:42:41.749 --> 00:42:46.235
War II.  It mentioned the battle
of the coral sea and the code 

00:42:46.236 --> 00:42:49.686
breaking that preceded that 
engagement.  I guess I canal now

00:42:49.687 --> 00:42:51.687
tell you what I did during the 
war.

00:42:51.731 --> 00:42:53.731
(Laughter)

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.330
His mother abruptly said

00:42:58.712 --> 00:43:00.735
.  Turgenson's S father began 
explaining that their mom had 

00:43:00.736 --> 00:43:02.736
been a secretary.

00:43:04.567 --> 00:43:06.567
When she interrupted him

00:43:10.014 --> 00:43:12.710
, "No Harold; I broke codes for 
the Navy and my girls worked on 

00:43:12.711 --> 00:43:14.711
and broke that code.

00:43:16.365 --> 00:43:16.601
"  She stood up and high-fived 
everybody in the room.

00:43:16.602 --> 00:43:18.602
(Laughter)
     (Applause)

00:43:29.221 --> 00:43:31.221
Dad was speechless I remember.

00:43:33.194 --> 00:43:34.832
So another one was my favorite 
when.  They are all of my 

00:43:34.833 --> 00:43:36.870
favorites.  So this was at a 
book talk.

00:43:40.112 --> 00:43:41.756
A man came up to me afterwards 
and he recalled that both his 

00:43:41.757 --> 00:43:45.607
parents soared with the Navy 
during the war.  His mother was 

00:43:45.608 --> 00:43:48.655
in Washington and his father was
in the Pacific.  He knew they 

00:43:48.656 --> 00:43:52.732
were both in code breaking, but 
they would not say more than 

00:43:52.733 --> 00:43:55.582
that, not even to each other.  
One day he took them to the 

00:43:57.852 --> 00:43:59.710
cryptologic Museum at Fort Meade
where there is a version of the 

00:43:59.711 --> 00:44:04.206
purple machine that was used by 
the Japanese diplomats.  They 

00:44:04.207 --> 00:44:06.435
were using a machine called, 
"Purple."  His mother was 

00:44:06.436 --> 00:44:11.098
startled to see it.  She had not
realized even now that it is 

00:44:11.099 --> 00:44:13.099
okay to acknowledge it existed 
and that we broke it.

00:44:15.177 --> 00:44:16.804
"  I worked on that machine" she
told them proudly to which her 

00:44:16.805 --> 00:44:20.484
husband replied, "You worked on 
purple?  I worked on purple!

00:44:24.723 --> 00:44:26.723
" They belong to the same

00:44:30.111 --> 00:44:31.532
code breaking chain and did not 
even know it!

00:44:31.533 --> 00:44:32.756
And so finally this experience 
also made me think we should all

00:44:32.757 --> 00:44:35.402
as the people in our families, 
especially the servicemembers 

00:44:35.403 --> 00:44:37.028
about their lives and their past
to understand what has come 

00:44:37.029 --> 00:44:41.932
before.  I am very grateful that
we are living in a time where 

00:44:41.933 --> 00:44:43.933
the stories of women, 

00:44:45.218 --> 00:44:46.867
people of color, and other once 
marginalized groups are more and

00:44:46.868 --> 00:44:49.933
more becoming a known and 
recognized part of our history.

00:44:53.197 --> 00:44:54.416
I think of the "Code Girls" as 
the hidden figures of the 

00:44:54.417 --> 00:44:56.661
greatest generation.  And on 
behalf of all of us who are 

00:44:59.918 --> 00:45:01.352
still benefiting from their 
tenacity and dedication, I would

00:45:01.353 --> 00:45:03.815
like to thank them all and thank
you for being here today.

00:45:03.816 --> 00:45:05.816
(Applause)

00:45:18.133 --> 00:45:22.186
     KAREN LLOYD:  Thank you, 
Liza for providing us that 

00:45:22.187 --> 00:45:25.895
thorough historical overview of 
the "Code Girls" service.  I 

00:45:25.896 --> 00:45:28.589
absolutely loved it!  Thank you.
Many didn't realize it back 

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:32.450
then, but we now know these 
women were changemakers and 

00:45:32.451 --> 00:45:34.693
every sense of the word.  The 
United States, not to mention 

00:45:34.694 --> 00:45:36.732
the world, would be a very 
different place 

00:45:39.802 --> 00:45:43.085
today if not for these secret 
code breakers of World War II.  

00:45:43.086 --> 00:45:45.086
Now I would like to invite Mrs.

00:45:46.895 --> 00:45:48.895
Nancy

00:45:49.988 --> 00:45:52.023
Tipton to share a few words 
about her service in the signal 

00:45:52.024 --> 00:45:56.904
Corps.  At 96 she has traveled 
with her family all the way from

00:45:56.905 --> 00:45:59.543
Centennial Colorado.  Mrs. 
Tipton shared with us that after

00:45:59.544 --> 00:46:03.892
her service she went on to lead 
quite an adventure life, even by

00:46:03.893 --> 00:46:05.893
today's standards.

00:46:07.584 --> 00:46:09.204
She worked in advertising, wrote
a shopping column for a local 

00:46:09.205 --> 00:46:11.437
newspaper, and proudly earned 
more money than her husband.

00:46:11.653 --> 00:46:13.653
(Laughter)

00:46:14.697 --> 00:46:16.697
Please welcome Mrs.

00:46:19.394 --> 00:46:21.394
Nancy Thomas Tipton.
     (Applause)

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.148
NANCY TIPTON:  Hello, "Code 
Girls"!  And hello to you all.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.820
I'm also pleased to have my 
three 

00:47:12.697 --> 00:47:14.697
children and my daughter-in-law,
my son 

00:47:15.939 --> 00:47:18.218
Scott and his wife Martha from 
Fort Collins and my daughter Ann

00:47:18.219 --> 00:47:22.893
from Olympia, Washington, and my
daughter Susan from Lakewood 

00:47:22.894 --> 00:47:24.894
Colorado, with me.

00:47:26.806 --> 00:47:28.806
And I also want to spay -- pay 
special 

00:47:29.808 --> 00:47:31.808
attention to

00:47:34.366 --> 00:47:36.631
Cammie -- where are you, Cammie?
Her mother was a dear friend of 

00:47:36.632 --> 00:47:38.632
mind and was a code breaker.

00:47:41.353 --> 00:47:46.461
She was in the Navy so we are 
honoring her today too.  I don't

00:47:46.462 --> 00:47:48.462
speak often in public like this.
But  anyway...

00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:54.215
I especially want to thank Liza 
Mundy for being here because it 

00:47:54.216 --> 00:47:55.225
is such a special treat to have 
her here.

00:47:55.226 --> 00:47:57.226
(Applause)

00:48:04.457 --> 00:48:05.894
And you all know that our work 
was top-secret and I have a 

00:48:05.895 --> 00:48:07.895
couple of stories to tell you 
about how top-secret 

00:48:13.786 --> 00:48:16.301
they were, and about five years 
ago, my roommate from 

00:48:16.302 --> 00:48:18.302
Washington, who still 

00:48:21.012 --> 00:48:23.012
lives here and who I will see on
Sunday, 

00:48:24.086 --> 00:48:27.161
came to see me, visit me in 
Colorado with her husband.  And 

00:48:27.162 --> 00:48:29.162
I got out my scrapbook, of 
course, 

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.895
and it was full of, as a said, 
it was full of restaurant menus 

00:48:33.896 --> 00:48:35.896
and football 

00:48:37.108 --> 00:48:37.964
games and bar and cigarette 
covers.

00:48:37.965 --> 00:48:39.965
(Laughter)

00:48:42.896 --> 00:48:44.896
But in the middle of it, she saw
this certificate.

00:48:50.893 --> 00:48:52.893
And I had gotten a raise from 
2300 to 3400.

00:48:54.555 --> 00:48:57.205
And the certificate said, "Crypt
analyst" on it.  And she said, 

00:48:57.206 --> 00:49:00.263
"What is that?"  And I said, 
"That is what we did during 

00:49:00.264 --> 00:49:04.536
World War II."  And she said, 
"Oh, no.  I worked in the 

00:49:04.537 --> 00:49:06.537
library.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.600
"  And I did not know we had a 
library.

00:49:10.665 --> 00:49:12.699
Yet she and I took the bus and 
slept in the same room together 

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.339
and yet we never talk about it. 
And the other when I had to say 

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.340
is my 

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.820
brother, a year ago he got the 

00:49:24.384 --> 00:49:26.629
Congressional medal of a and he 
went to eight big cryptology 

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.630
Museum here.

00:49:29.722 --> 00:49:31.722
And he was really excited about 
all of the machines.

00:49:33.191 --> 00:49:35.444
And so he told me, he said, "We 
have all of these different 

00:49:35.445 --> 00:49:39.102
names and numbers and everything
and machines."  And I said, "I 

00:49:39.103 --> 00:49:44.439
never saw a machine.  I did not 
know we had machines.  You must 

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.503
really knew exactly what you are
doing.  And nobody else knew.

00:49:50.198 --> 00:49:52.198
"  So anyway I do want to thank 
Liza 

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.914
Taylor too for hosting this 
wonderful event.  Thank you.

00:49:56.915 --> 00:49:58.915
(Applause)

00:50:19.957 --> 00:50:22.617
     KAREN LLOYD:  Thank you, 
Mrs. Tipton.  You are an 

00:50:22.618 --> 00:50:26.750
inspiration to us all.  Next I 
would like to invite Mrs. 

00:50:26.751 --> 00:50:29.393
Suzanne Embree to share a little
bit about her day as a member of

00:50:29.394 --> 00:50:31.394
the US Navy WAVES.  Mrs.

00:50:33.685 --> 00:50:35.946
Embree is 97 and lives in 
Litchfield, Maryland.  She spent

00:50:35.947 --> 00:50:38.177
two years during the war 
breaking Japanese secret codes, 

00:50:38.178 --> 00:50:41.636
all the while worrying about her
brother who was serving in the 

00:50:41.637 --> 00:50:43.514
Pacific.  Please welcome Mrs. 
Suzanne Embree.

00:50:43.515 --> 00:50:46.513
(Applause)

00:50:54.715 --> 00:50:57.713
     SUZANNE EMBREE:  

00:51:06.736 --> 00:51:11.867
I am very pleased that we all 
are able to come here today.  I 

00:51:11.868 --> 00:51:13.868
think one of the wonderful 
things 

00:51:17.358 --> 00:51:19.358
about the Second World War was 
that it 

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:22.810
helped not only us speak with 
each 

00:51:24.479 --> 00:51:26.913
other, communicate with each 
other, but it also brought 

00:51:26.914 --> 00:51:29.763
people from around the world 
together and that is one of the 

00:51:30.773 --> 00:51:32.773
things I would like to mention 

00:51:33.785 --> 00:51:35.785
particularly because

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:41.296
when the Japanese war, it was 
the only part of the war still 

00:51:41.297 --> 00:51:43.361
being worked on after the D-Day.

00:51:47.018 --> 00:51:49.018
The people at Bletchley Park who
were 

00:51:50.075 --> 00:51:52.075
in the Japanese hut or sent over
here to work with us.

00:51:55.563 --> 00:51:57.563
And the person that I worked 
with -- I 

00:52:00.263 --> 00:52:02.483
don't remember if I told this to
Liza, they were known as Lindley

00:52:02.484 --> 00:52:04.484
Jesus Christ.

00:52:05.964 --> 00:52:07.964
He looked very much like the 
picture 

00:52:09.418 --> 00:52:11.418
of Jesus that one remembers, 
seen Jesus knocking at the door.

00:52:14.759 --> 00:52:16.759
He had the same lien here did 
look, 

00:52:18.474 --> 00:52:20.474
very serious, and he was very 
serious.

00:52:21.733 --> 00:52:24.395
I was amazed later when I went 
to Bletchley Park itself and saw

00:52:24.396 --> 00:52:26.396
and 

00:52:28.656 --> 00:52:30.656
learned that one of the reasons 
he was 

00:52:32.544 --> 00:52:34.168
sent to us was that he was 
having a good time at Bletchley 

00:52:34.169 --> 00:52:36.169
Park.

00:52:37.678 --> 00:52:38.084
He and his wife were teaching 
everybody a Scottish dance.

00:52:38.085 --> 00:52:40.085
(Laughter)

00:52:41.356 --> 00:52:43.356
He didn't teach us that.

00:52:45.057 --> 00:52:47.057
We were very sober.

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:50.532
I worked primarily with Fred son
Powers.

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.112
Those of you who went to 
University of Virginia are 

00:52:55.113 --> 00:52:57.947
probably familiar with Fredson 
who in turn had a wife who was 

00:52:58.799 --> 00:53:00.799
also an interesting character.

00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:05.724
I never met her, but she wrote a
book called, "The prodigal 

00:53:05.725 --> 00:53:07.725
women.

00:53:10.197 --> 00:53:12.197
"  And we read that book and we 
were 

00:53:14.661 --> 00:53:16.512
astounded that he would do this.
Well, this was part of the whole

00:53:16.513 --> 00:53:18.513
thing 

00:53:19.519 --> 00:53:26.130
about being at the Annex.  It 
was the people who were there.  

00:53:26.131 --> 00:53:28.131
The people working together.

00:53:29.204 --> 00:53:32.072
And I want to say what impressed
me the most from the very first 

00:53:32.073 --> 00:53:34.073
day I went 

00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:39.010
to work where the people who 
were the warrant officers and 

00:53:39.011 --> 00:53:44.099
petty officers who helped me.  
And it was through them that I 

00:53:48.938 --> 00:53:50.938
understood what being

00:53:53.722 --> 00:53:54.942
-- what being part of the core 
really meant.  They were 

00:53:54.943 --> 00:53:57.377
wonderful.  I am glad to have a 
chance to thank 

00:54:00.394 --> 00:54:02.394
the yeoman

00:54:06.377 --> 00:54:08.414
efforts of all my colleagues.  
It was a wonderful opportunity 

00:54:08.415 --> 00:54:11.695
to meet these wonderful people 
and to feel that we were a part 

00:54:11.696 --> 00:54:13.564
of a greater human family around
the world.  Thank you very much.

00:54:13.565 --> 00:54:15.565
     (Applause)

00:54:44.917 --> 00:54:46.457
KAREN LLOYD:  Thank you, Mrs. 
Embry for sharing with us what 

00:54:46.458 --> 00:54:50.927
life was like for you in the 
military and giving us a 

00:54:50.928 --> 00:54:52.556
first-hand peek into wartime 
Washington because so many of 

00:54:52.557 --> 00:54:56.635
the "Code Girls" are no longer 
with us.  We thought it would be

00:54:56.636 --> 00:55:01.107
fitting to have someone to speak
with from the perspective of a 

00:55:01.108 --> 00:55:03.801
"Code Girl's" loved one.  I am 
thrilled to have you fill in 

00:55:03.802 --> 00:55:05.802
that 

00:55:08.845 --> 00:55:10.845
role for us, none other than 
William

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:17.652
Nye, all know -- also known as 
Bill Nye, the science Guy.

00:55:17.653 --> 00:55:19.653
(Applause)

00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:23.356
Bill Nye is an American science 
educator, engineer, comedian, TV

00:55:24.979 --> 00:55:27.853
presenter, author, and inventor 
with a mission to help people 

00:55:27.854 --> 00:55:31.747
foster a scientifically literate
society and to help people 

00:55:31.748 --> 00:55:33.391
everywhere understand and 
appreciate the science that 

00:55:33.392 --> 00:55:37.056
makes our world work.  Making 
science entertaining and 

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:41.565
accessible is something that 
Bill has had a passion and has 

00:55:41.566 --> 00:55:43.566
had a passion about his entire 
life.

00:55:46.215 --> 00:55:51.650
His mother, Jacqueline Jenkins 
Nye was a "Code Girl" and a 

00:55:51.651 --> 00:55:53.893
member of the US Navy WAVES.  
She understandably left a huge 

00:55:55.316 --> 00:55:57.961
impression on Bill and his 
siblings.  JoinMe and welcome to

00:55:57.962 --> 00:56:00.200
the podium, Bill Nye, the 
science Guy.

00:56:00.201 --> 00:56:05.487
(Applause)

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.900
BILL NYE:  Thank you.  Thank you
indeed.

00:56:10.577 --> 00:56:12.577
Ladies and gentlemen, service 
members and especially "Code 

00:56:15.055 --> 00:56:17.055
Girls"

00:56:25.795 --> 00:56:27.620
-- I am sorry, you guys -- I 
know I am among friends, I 

00:56:27.621 --> 00:56:29.450
think.  Are there any enemies 
here?

00:56:29.451 --> 00:56:33.936
(Laughter)
     I will be honest.  I am not

00:56:33.937 --> 00:56:36.800
objective about it.  Women’s 
History Month is a wonderful 

00:56:37.613 --> 00:56:40.477
celebration.  My 
great-grandmother marched in the

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:45.383
suffragette parade on the third 
of March 1913 right here in 

00:56:45.384 --> 00:56:47.384
Washington, DC.

00:56:50.264 --> 00:56:50.874
65 years later, my mother 
marched in the Equal Rights 

00:56:50.875 --> 00:56:52.875
Amendment parade.

00:56:53.947 --> 00:56:56.176
My many friends of my beloved 
sister in in the women's parade 

00:56:56.177 --> 00:57:01.465
do years ago and I cannot help, 
but feel honored to address you 

00:57:01.466 --> 00:57:03.466
today.

00:57:04.696 --> 00:57:06.696
Jackie Jenkins

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:09.798
, boy, I am you guys.  I am not 
that sorry.

00:57:09.799 --> 00:57:11.799
(Laughter)

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:16.753
She was I heck of a lady.  
Jackie Jenkins, later known as 

00:57:16.754 --> 00:57:20.223
my mother, was a naval officer. 
Her many contributions to 

00:57:20.224 --> 00:57:23.268
winning the war are very 
well-known, of course.  

00:57:23.269 --> 00:57:25.269
Actually, I getting.  Nobody 
knows what she did!

00:57:25.351 --> 00:57:27.351
(Laughter)

00:57:30.225 --> 00:57:32.225
Nobody has any idea, perhaps 
least 

00:57:34.113 --> 00:57:36.113
of all people like me, or 
members of my family.

00:57:38.027 --> 00:57:40.070
Peoples of my mother's age, by 
talking during cocktail parties 

00:57:40.071 --> 00:57:43.785
and talking between their dances
during big band shows and 

00:57:43.786 --> 00:57:45.786
through my whole life from 

00:57:47.867 --> 00:57:50.292
when I was a little kid crawling
over people's she at one of 

00:57:50.293 --> 00:57:54.377
those cocktail parties, or as an
adult observing other older 

00:57:54.378 --> 00:57:56.378
adults who were sitting for a 

00:57:58.106 --> 00:58:00.172
change around a dinner table, 
whenever someone asked and said 

00:58:00.173 --> 00:58:02.173
hey what did you do during the 
war, Jackie?

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:07.532
She would laugh and say, "I 
can't talk about it.  I can't 

00:58:07.533 --> 00:58:10.176
talk about it."  A few of you 
hear mate remember the 

00:58:13.858 --> 00:58:15.858
reunion party the Navy through 
at Fort 

00:58:18.974 --> 00:58:21.432
Myers in 1992, 50 years, 50 
freaking years after she and her

00:58:21.433 --> 00:58:24.670
fellow officers were recruited. 
And that morning and afternoon 

00:58:24.671 --> 00:58:28.547
once again these women were 
asked, people like my nephew 

00:58:28.548 --> 00:58:30.548
asked, "Hey, what did you do 
during the war?

00:58:33.795 --> 00:58:35.795
What did you do from

00:58:38.324 --> 00:58:40.371
0800 to 1600 to and round again 
during the war years, during 

00:58:40.372 --> 00:58:42.372
that first thing 

00:58:43.446 --> 00:58:47.342
known as a dog watch?"   "I 
can't talk about it."  They 

00:58:47.343 --> 00:58:48.968
absolutely would not talk about.
There are certain regular 

00:58:48.969 --> 00:58:50.969
English words that they would 
not use because 

00:58:55.066 --> 00:58:57.705
somehow the word, "Overlap" -- 
did I say the wrong word -- it 

00:58:57.706 --> 00:58:59.706
is somehow used and code 
breaking.

00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:04.349
It is generally agreed that

00:59:06.572 --> 00:59:08.207
decrypting the Nazi big-name a 
code shorten the war by a year 

00:59:08.208 --> 00:59:10.426
and a half.  And may have 
shortened the warp in the 

00:59:12.474 --> 00:59:13.897
Pacific theater by twice that 
long and they accomplish their 

00:59:13.898 --> 00:59:16.148
mission in large part because 
they took their duty and 

00:59:19.386 --> 00:59:21.858
their oath so seriously and we 
owe the "Code Girls" so much.

00:59:25.321 --> 00:59:27.321
Thank you all very much indeed.

00:59:36.567 --> 00:59:37.377
It is not long -- my mother and 
colleagues, while they were 

00:59:37.378 --> 00:59:39.378
breaking 

00:59:41.887 --> 00:59:43.887
codes, my father had the 
misfortune to 

00:59:45.343 --> 00:59:48.185
become a prisoner of war, 
captured from the tiny atoll 

00:59:48.186 --> 00:59:50.640
called Wake Island in the 
Pacific Ocean.  If you get a 

00:59:50.641 --> 00:59:52.681
chance to be a prisoner of war, 
I wouldn't do it.

00:59:52.894 --> 00:59:54.894
(Laughter)
     I would let it go.

00:59:58.182 --> 01:00:00.459
He managed to survive though all
the hardships and captivity and 

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.460
he returned 

01:00:03.507 --> 01:00:06.350
and married my mom in December 
of 1945.  They raised three of 

01:00:06.351 --> 01:00:10.010
us and them I'm mom went back to
work full at the beginning of 

01:00:10.011 --> 01:00:12.011
the modern women's rights 
movement.

01:00:13.665 --> 01:00:15.923
This was before the disco era.  
I remember very clearly a phone 

01:00:17.955 --> 01:00:20.580
conversation she had with some 
account executive from the 

01:00:20.581 --> 01:00:22.581
American Express Company.  She 
slammed the phone down.

01:00:28.687 --> 01:00:31.658
And she used the D-word Damn was
a risky usage for a woman those 

01:00:31.659 --> 01:00:36.151
days.  She was furious because 
she was told that she would not 

01:00:36.152 --> 01:00:38.187
be allowed to have her own 
credit card because she was Mrs.

01:00:45.097 --> 01:00:47.535
Nye after all and not worthy of 
credit on her own and this even 

01:00:47.536 --> 01:00:49.536
after she earned her Master 
degree.

01:00:51.801 --> 01:00:53.841
Mom went on to get her doctorate
at George, Washington University

01:00:53.842 --> 01:00:55.842
and she 

01:00:57.352 --> 01:00:59.352
kept winning ballroom dance 
competitions.

01:01:02.832 --> 01:01:04.832
The irony is ballroom dancing is
fun.

01:01:07.316 --> 01:01:08.734
So here I am getting choked up 
and I apologize, but she was a 

01:01:08.735 --> 01:01:13.066
very accomplished ballroom 
dancer and she danced until 

01:01:13.067 --> 01:01:15.067
almost the day she died several 
years ago.

01:01:17.542 --> 01:01:19.012
And she and my father, their 
ashes are both at Arlington 

01:01:19.013 --> 01:01:21.259
National Cemetery.  I hope we 
all celebrate the service of 

01:01:22.903 --> 01:01:25.342
these women as part of our 
nation's effort to form a more 

01:01:25.343 --> 01:01:27.343
perfect union.

01:01:29.007 --> 01:01:31.860
As a consequence of the war 
effort, women of this greatest 

01:01:31.861 --> 01:01:33.861
generation were 

01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:36.552
empowered like no generation 
before them with their 

01:01:36.553 --> 01:01:38.553
dedication and especially 

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:42.664
their intellect, the allies were
able to resolve a global crisis.

01:01:44.143 --> 01:01:46.143
We really cannot thank them 
enough.

01:01:47.195 --> 01:01:49.835
And today I cannot help, but 
feel that the "Code Girls" were 

01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:51.836
part of the larger story of the 
United States.

01:01:56.142 --> 01:01:58.574
They faced a worldwide crisis 
and they resolved it and as a 

01:01:58.575 --> 01:02:00.575
son of Lieutenant 

01:02:01.665 --> 01:02:05.759
Jenkins and later Doctor Jenkins
Nye, she hyphenated her name.  I

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.997
believe strongly in using our 
intellect and treasure to 

01:02:07.998 --> 01:02:12.090
resolve our global challenges 
facing us today.  The framers of

01:02:12.091 --> 01:02:14.091
the Constitution of the 

01:02:15.747 --> 01:02:16.157
United States, which had become 
a model for constitutional 

01:02:16.158 --> 01:02:18.158
governments 

01:02:21.262 --> 01:02:23.262
everywhere includes, included, 
and still 

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.980
includes, article one, Section 
8, clause eight, which refers to

01:02:26.981 --> 01:02:29.213
promoting the progress of 
science and useful arts.

01:02:33.103 --> 01:02:35.555
It is in the Constitution, 
people, is intent is to motivate

01:02:35.556 --> 01:02:40.452
innovators and drive the economy
by means of just laws.  They 

01:02:40.453 --> 01:02:43.085
knew that without the progress 
of science and the useful arts 

01:02:43.086 --> 01:02:48.792
of engineering, our economy 
would falter and this was in the

01:02:48.793 --> 01:02:50.793
18th century.  Without 
scientifically literate 

01:02:52.655 --> 01:02:54.655
citizens, the United States, any
country 

01:02:55.697 --> 01:02:57.532
impact cannot compete on the 
world stage economically, let 

01:02:57.533 --> 01:02:59.533
alone compete during a time of 
war.

01:03:00.998 --> 01:03:03.650
We must all take if few moments 
today to thank the women, the 

01:03:03.651 --> 01:03:08.895
"Code Girls" for their service 
and think about their legacy

01:03:12.891 --> 01:03:14.891
.  This is a feature -- excuse 
me -- I 

01:03:15.953 --> 01:03:17.953
wonder how many of those 
documents 

01:03:18.994 --> 01:03:21.646
documents -- again, we must 
almost take a few minutes, the 

01:03:21.647 --> 01:03:23.685
thank the women, the "Code 
Girls" for their service and 

01:03:23.686 --> 01:03:26.970
think about their legacy.  If 
they can resolve a global work, 

01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:31.848
a global warming in just five 
years, we certainly can provide 

01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:34.072
clean water, renewable 
electricity, and access to 

01:03:36.316 --> 01:03:38.979
global electronic information to
people everywhere to address the

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:43.328
violence, extreme poverty, and 
climate change, we can and we 

01:03:43.329 --> 01:03:45.590
must change the standard of 
living of women and girls around

01:03:45.591 --> 01:03:47.591
the world.

01:03:50.837 --> 01:03:52.837
In the spirit of our code 
breakers

01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:56.987
, we can do it.  I know we can. 
Because we can see what these 

01:03:56.988 --> 01:03:59.229
women did, their legacy inspires
us all.  Thank you very much.

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:01.230

sometimes to give up those 

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.937

01:16:00.938 --> 01:16:01.136

If you are here or watching

veterans in your life, living or
deceased, no matter what the 

01:16:25.065 --> 01:16:27.089
gender, branch of service, or 
military assignment, consider 

01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:29.090
donating your collection to the 
Veterans History Project.

01:16:31.174 --> 01:16:33.006
For those of you who are here, 
you can stop by the check-in 

01:16:33.007 --> 01:16:37.304
desk and get a field kit and it 
tells you everything you need to

01:16:37.305 --> 01:16:39.351
know to include all of those 
government papers that you have 

01:16:39.352 --> 01:16:44.664
to fill out.  But for those of 
you that are watching online, 

01:16:44.665 --> 01:16:46.665
you can download it from our 

01:16:47.675 --> 01:16:53.630
website, loc.gov/vets.  That way
you can ensure that your loved 

01:16:53.631 --> 01:16:56.264
one's story will be preserved 
safely at the nation's library 

01:16:56.265 --> 01:16:58.916
never to be lost or forgotten.  
You have to have a commercial, 

01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:01.145
right folks?

01:17:04.193 --> 01:17:05.862
As we bring this reunion to a 
close, I again would like to 

01:17:05.863 --> 01:17:10.332
thank each of you for joining us
today as we honored some amazing

01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:15.039
changemakers who led the way for
women.  The "Code Girls" of 

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.077
World War II, let's give them a 
great round of applause.

01:17:43.813 --> 01:17:46.462
Two our guest speakers, Liza 
Mundy, Nancy Thomas Tipton, 

01:17:46.463 --> 01:17:50.536
Suzanne Embree, Bill Nye, thank 
you for giving us an even deeper

01:17:50.537 --> 01:17:53.999
sense of awareness surrounding 
the important work of the "Code 

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.644
Girls" and the major 
contributions they made to the 

01:17:56.645 --> 01:17:59.705
course of the war, technology, 
code breaking, and what is now 

01:17:59.706 --> 01:18:02.145
known as cyber security.  We 
pledge to make sure their 

01:18:02.146 --> 01:18:04.575
stories are never again, at risk
of being lost to history.

01:18:08.036 --> 01:18:10.503
I need to thank the library 
staff, especially can Crawford, 

01:18:10.504 --> 01:18:12.504

Laura Turner, and Ken why for 
making all the extra efforts 

01:18:19.503 --> 01:18:22.343
they did to make it go as 
smoothly as it has.  Last, but
