00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.080
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: Good morning.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.970
My name is Elmer Eusman,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.070
I'm the chief conservative
here at the library.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.670
And I wanted to welcome you
all to the 80th TOPS lecture,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.700
topics and preservation
series, 80, I can't believe it.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.350
Before I introduce Andrew who
will introduce our speaker,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.900
I just wanted to announce that our
next TOPS lecture will be Monday,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.050
September 12, and it will deal
with using computer tomography

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.050
to digitally unroll
and render the text

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.540
from a circa 1500 BCE
Elephantine island roll of papyrus.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.030
So, for those of you
who are interested

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.580
in that, Monday, September 12.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.660
Here to introduce our
speaker is Andrew Robb.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.900
Andrew is the Head of Special
Format Conservation Section and in

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.700
that role, in charge
of the conservation

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.270
of the library's photographic
material.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.570
Andrew.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.990
&gt;&gt; Andrew Rob: Thank you, Elmer.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.630
A warm welcome to our
speaker, Rachel Wetzel.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.960
She's very familiar to us here.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.260
In 2003, she was a summer
graduate fellow with us,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.720
the conservation division and
it's wonderful to have her return

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.320
to give this lecture on her
work concerning the conservation

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.790
of early daguerreotypes, a topic
of great relevance particularly

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.410
to us in-- on our collection as
well as to many others who are here

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.670
in the audience and over the web.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.690
It would be great to have this on
our website archive so that people

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.940
in the future will be able
to access this presentation.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.610
Rachelle has been on the staff of
the Conservation Center for Art

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.900
and Historic Artifacts since 2007

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.420
where she's a conservative
photographs.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.940
In addition to her
work as a conservator,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.950
she also conducts surveys,
teaches photography-related courses

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.870
and workshops at graduate schools,
libraries, archives and museums.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.330
And she's been an officer of
the photographic materials group

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.530
at the American Institute
for Conservation.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.350
Her educational background
includes post graduate work

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.260
at the advanced residency
program in photograph conservation

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.290
at the George Eastman, now museum,
and the Image Permanence Institute,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.830
a master's degree in
art conservation

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.860
from the State University of
New York Buffalo State College.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.470
And a bachelor-- excuse
me, a bachelor's degree

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.630
from the University of Pittsburgh.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.430
Besides her work with
daguerreotypes,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.260
she's published several papers
on optical brightening agents

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.950
and [inaudible] photographic
materials.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.270 position:56%
So, her research interests are broad

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.730
and we welcome that
in our small field.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.900
Her presentation this morning
is conservation science

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.700
in the daguerreotype preserving our
earliest photographic treasures.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.510
Rachel.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.100
[ Applause ]

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.400
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: Thank you.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.700
Can you all hear me OK?

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.290
Great. Good morning, I'm very
happy to be back here at LC.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.260
This is, you know, sort of
where I started my career

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.750
in photo conservation so, it's nice
to come back and go back to all

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.160
of you, all of the things
I've been working on recently.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.670
In today's lecture, I'll be taking
you down in the historic path

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.400
of early photography,
how that was invented,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.040
how it arrived here in America.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.670
We will be exploring a little
bit of the improvements made

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.350
to the daguerreotypes process.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.140
I would explain exactly
what a daguerreotype is.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.230 position:56%
And then, from all of those bits of
information, I'll be able to explain

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.490
to you a little better
about why this project

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.010
with early daguerreotypes and
preservation is very important

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.260
and necessary for the field
of photo conservation.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.610
Oops.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.670
So, try to imagine a time
before there was photography

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.550
which right now is pretty hard
to do since we all have cameras

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.540
on our phones and it's
extremely common place and easy

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.410
to take a photograph but you
just go back another century

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.880 position:56%
to the 19th century and the earlier
part of it, there was no photography

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.090 position:56%
and people could not see a rendering
of themselves or a portrait

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.150
of a beautiful landscape outside.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.880
But the 19th century, the early
19th century is very centered

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.420
around inventing some sort
of photographic process.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.420
And it began pretty early in the
19th century, there were a lot

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.730
of people experimenting
and trying to do this

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.930
but with not much great success.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.330
So-- And these people
were scientist,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.590
they were some curious thinkers.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.120
And they were all trying to find
a way to sort of capture an image

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.900
and maintain it on
some sort of substrate.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.380
Only some of them would gain
some success in doing so,

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.560
but they would-- Silver would
keep printing out and printing

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.850
out until they had a dark piece
of paper or a dark metal plate.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.160 position:56%
But on January 17th 1839, one person
found a way to sustain an image

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.840
on a metal plate thus giving
rise to the birth of photography.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.220 position:56%
And that man was Louis-Jacques-Mandé
Daguerre, he was a Parisian artist

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.470
and he's credited for inventing
the first photographic process.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.260
And this is a daguerreotype
that was taken of him.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.810
So, Daguerre was a painter, he
wasn't a scientist like a lot

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.340
of the other people tinkering
around with inventing photographs.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.720
He actually in 19th century ran
a very successful diorama studio

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.020
in Paris.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.780
And the diorama was sort
of 19th century theatre.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.880
These are the predecessor
to motion picture film.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.960
And it was a room that utilized
several trompe-l'oeil style

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.810
landscape paintings.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.220
They were illuminated in various
ways that allowed one painting

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.270
to change in scenery form light

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.860
to dark making a very
dramatic effect on one image.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.500
So, the diorama provided a lot
of entertainment for Parisians

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.500
in the early 19th century.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.860
But to make these very large
scale paintings for the diorama,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.730
Daguerre utilized this piece of
equipment called the camera obscura

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.910
to project his sketches
on a large scale term.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.910
And it was with this particular
apparatus that he started to play

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.150
around with inventing with
what we now call photography.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.150
So, I suppose you can say
Daguerre was sort of a master

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.130
or manipulating light
in an artistic effect.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.940
So, Daguerre's process quite
aptly named after himself

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.100 position:56%
as many 19th century inventors would
probably call their photographic

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.070
process something that
included their name,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.320
was the sensitized silver plate
that utilized a long exposure

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.410
to produce a faint image
on a mirror surface.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.400
But at last, the, you know, this
landscape that you could see

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.020
in front of you could be contained
on this delicate piece of silver.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.660 position:56%
Proud of his amazing accomplishment,
the daguerreotype was presented

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.870
in front of the French
Academy of Sciences in 1983

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.560 position:56%
and it wowed the Parisian community.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.190
Never before had we
seen a photograph.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.430 position:56%
But Daguerre wasn't the only person,
as I mentioned, there were a lot

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.190
of people trying to
experiment to make a photograph.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.180
But one other person that was
sort of successful and was working

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.440
at the same as Daguerre was
a guy named Nicéphore Niépce.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.810
And Niépce a few hours
away from Daguerre

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.340
and he was inventing this
process called the heliograph,

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.910
which utilize the action of light
to harden an area of material

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.490
on a metal plate to
produce an image.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.640
Niépce set up his camera on
the window of his country home

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:08.230
and in 1826, he captured this image
on the right, and it was the view

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.370
of Le Gras, his country home,
and what we now know today

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.230
to be the oldest photograph
in existence.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.660
And this photograph is currently
housed at the Harry Ransom Center

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.700
at the University of
Texas in Austin.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.700
This particular image on
the right is what you see

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.650
if you Google search the heliograph
process or Niépce's photograph.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.160
And it's usually reproduced in
a very contrasty and greeny way

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.570
to make the image more visible.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.030
But 19th century photography
was pretty crude,

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.640
and what it actually looks
like is on the right.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.860
So, right now, we look at this

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.660
and we don't think it's
really that spectacular.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:57.440
But in 1829, it was pretty
phenomenal that this could--

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.900
what he was looking out his window

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.640
to see what he was actually
capturing on this plate.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:08.890
So, it's very rare and special
and very sensitive and delicate

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.690
and might not look like the best
composition of the photograph

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.370
or the best shape of the photograph

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.560
but this photograph
is very significant

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.980
to the history of photography.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.380
So, prior to 1839, Daguerre

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.060
and Niépce were both
working independently

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.630
and they were both
happen to be buying lenses

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.040 position:56%
for their camera obscuras from a man
named Charles Chevalier in Paris.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.450
And Chevalier knew of both men's
work and he suggested to one

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.630
of the men that they
perhaps collaborate

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.520
on trying to make a photograph.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.520
And Daguerre was very interested
in meeting with Niépce and trying

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.460
to collaborate and maybe helping
one another to sort of solve a lot

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.940
of issues they were having with
the printing out of the silver

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.040
and not being able to
contain the image permanently.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.860
Bu t Niépce did not want
to meet with Daguerre.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.650 position:56%
But Daguerre was very persistent and
he wrote several letters to Niépce

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.570 position:56%
over the course of a number of years
and eventually, the two men agreed

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.860
to meet and reveal
their particular--

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.220
the heliograph and the
daguerreotype to one another.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:25.600
But unfortunately,
Niépce passed away in 1833

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.120
so he never saw the official
birth of photography in 1839.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:39.440
So, there was one more man in
this long trail of the birth

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.350
of photography that is worth
mentioning here and that man is--

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.080
an English man named
Sir John Herschel.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.840
Herschel discovered that sodium
thiosulfate is the silver halide

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.720
solvent in 1819 and eventually,
this became the key element

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.230
to stopping the silver reaction
when making a photograph.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.560 position:56%
So this compound, sodium
thiosulface if you've done any black

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:06.290 position:56%
and white photography, we call fixer
today, and it's the one material

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.740
in the process of development

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.940
that will stop the
silver halide reactions

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.930
and make the silver
permanent for stable--

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.260
and stabilize the image
for permanency.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.230
So, it was Herschel's discovery

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.950
that helped Daguerre stabilize
his daguerreotype process

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.930
and make his image permanent.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.060
So, kind of without Herschel's
discovery Daguerre wouldn't be able

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.360
to do his.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.600
So there's a lot of people
contributing to the invention

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.330
of photography at that time.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.510 position:56%
And just shortly after Daguerre
presented his process at the Academy

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:44.920
of Sciences in Paris, Herschel was
presenting his discovery of fixer

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.110
at the Royal Society of London.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.660
So, everything was sort
of happening in 1839 based

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.120 position:56%
around this daguerreotype invention.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.050
So, Daguerre's process
created quite a bit

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.410
of enthusiasm upon its
announcement in 1839,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.540
and though he kept his secret-- his
formula secret, everybody wanted

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.380 position:56%
to make one of these
daguerreotypes, but nobody knew how.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.170
So, he was trying to coin
the market, rightfully so,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.500
he needed to make a living
and he invented this process.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.160
So, he was trying to
sell subscriptions

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.950
to how people buy his daguerreotype
plates but it just wasn't

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.330
as successful as he would
have liked it to have been.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.690
And Daguerre finally agreed
with the French government to--

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.460
in exchange for a finance--

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.680
to be financed or have a salary
from the French government,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.610
he had to release his
daguerreotype formula.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.430
And this happened in August.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.140
So, a number of months later
after it was officially announced

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:51.910
and then daguerreotype mania began.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.540
So, Daguerre's formula was quickly
translated into several languages

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.660
and distributed worldwide.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.950 position:56%
It made its way to the United States
and is shipped in September of 1839.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:08.310
And, however, while the
daguerreotype formula traversed the

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:13.500
ocean, the actual idea of the
daguerreotype existing had arrived

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.960
in America long before that.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.620 position:56%
So, in January of 1839 when Daguerre
was making his announcement,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.340
there was also a man
from the United States,

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.660
from New York named Samuel Morse.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.690
And Morse was over in Paris
presenting his new invention,

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.160
the electromagnetic telegraph and
you may know Morse from Morse code,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.290
he's quite-- he's also
made photographs

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.700
but he also invented
quite a few things.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.290
And Morse thought his invention was
going to be the hot topic in Paris,

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:47.160 position:56%
but unfortunately, all anybody could
talk about was the daguerreotype.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.500
So, being a curious-minded person,

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.620
Morse needed to know what this
daguerreotype was and he went

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.710 position:56%
to Daguerre studio and he had a look
at it and he was just fascinated.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.200
So, he wrote letters
back to United States

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.660
to his colleagues telling them
about this fantastic invention

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.510
that was happening in Paris.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.110
So, there was a lot of hype

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.700
about the daguerreotype
before we even knew how

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.250
to make one here in
the United States.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:21.720
So, when the formula
arrived in September of 1839,

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.310
the first man in Philadelphia
to attempt

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.080
to make a photograph was
this man, Joseph Saxton.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.950
So keep in mind, this
is early photography.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.840
In 1839, you couldn't
just go to a store

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.920
and buy all your photographic
equipment.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.840
You couldn't just buy
a camera and a plate.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.240
You had to procure all of these
materials and chemicals yourself

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.690
and you had to figure out how
to construct your camera and how

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.420
to measure out all the chemicals.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.890
It wasn't like you
bought Kodak fixer.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:56.030
So, Saxton, according to
the notes made his camera

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.920
out of a cigar box and
a ground glass lens.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.260
Saxton needed a metal plate to
make his daguerreotype and this--

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.180
on the right for you is the
daguerreotype that he made

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.830
from his window at the US Mint.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.690
But to make this plate,
he went down the street

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.790
to a metal working lighting shop
called Cornelius and Company,

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.010
where he requested silver
coated copper plates.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:27.050 position:56%
And that man who made his silver
coated copper plates was a man named

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.760
Robert Cornelius.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:34.450
So, Robert Cornelius, and this
is a later photograph of him,

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.600
not only was a metal worker
but he had an interest

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.970
and a background in chemistry.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.100
When learning of Saxton's
experimentation

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:48.640
with the daguerreotype, he
too, decided to give it a try.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.010
So, Cornelius set up
his daguerreotype camera

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:55.220
in the back alley of his
family's company shop

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.790 position:56%
and he placed is sensitized plate
and the camera and he stood in front

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:04.030
of the camera lens for quite a long
time to take what we know today

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:08.730
to be the very first self portrait.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.450 position:56%
So, some of the facts you should
know about the daguerreotype process

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.450
in 1839, as I mentioned, the
exposure times were quite long.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.740
So, they could range anywhere from
three to 15 minutes and upwards

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.040
to half an hour depending on
the light conditions outside

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.640
and the brightness of the sun.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.850
The long exposures prohibited
the capturing of motion.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:34.140
So, if you see most of the early
1839 daguerreotypes are landscapes

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.680
and then if you look at them,
you won't see any people on them.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.760
So, Daguerre took a lot
of street scenes of Paris

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.340
and there aren't any people in
most of those daguerreotypes.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.820
And the reason for this is that
because the exposure time could be

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.450
up to half an hour, if anybody was
just walking by on the streets,

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.510
they wouldn't get captured
in the image.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.360
You'd have to stand still
in the frame of the camera

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.780
for a significant amount of
time to procure a daguerreotype.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.450
So, a lot of people thought that
Daguerre woke up really early

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.130
in the morning when the
streets weren't busy

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.270
and took these photographs,
but actually,

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.810
it's just the long exposure time

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.940
that prohibits the
motion being captured.

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:21.130
So, Robert Cornelius, after
he made his self portrait,

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.210
he decides to collaborate
with another chemist

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.110 position:56%
from the University of Pennsylvania.

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:27.740
And if you've been to Philadelphia,

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.390
you know Philadelphia Center City
is quite small and compact and all

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.990
of these places were located sort

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.740
of within a block or
two of one another.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.240
So, here's University of
Pennsylvania, US Mint,

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.970
Cornelius's family business,
the Franklin Institute,

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.240
the American Philosophical
Science Society.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.530 position:56%
And all these places I'm going to be
talking about are within, you know,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.650
five minutes walk of one another.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.060
So, at the University
of Pennsylvania,

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:59.110
there was a man named Paul Beck
Goddard and he was a chemist

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.440
and he had an interest
in making daguerreotypes.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.840 position:56%
And on the right here is a
landscape daguerreotype that he made

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.310 position:56%
from his window at the University of
Pennsylvania in 1839 and it belongs

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.610
to the Franklin Institute.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.830
So because Cornelius had taken
the self portrait using the

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.240
daguerreotype process which as I
mentioned had a very long exposure

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.710
time, the two men saw
this marketability

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.610
and the daguerreotype
for portraiture.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.140
However, because the
exposures were so long,

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.240
it really made this
process unsuitable

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.590
for rendering the likeness
of a human image.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.590
As the sitter would have
to sit perfectly still

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.370
for a very long time, which
try to sit in your seat

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.930
for the next two minutes and
not move, it's really difficult.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.520
So, together, they experimented

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.680
with the sensitization
step of the process.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.190
And in order to reduce the
exposure time of the plate,

00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:00.030
they replaced one halogen, which
in Daguerre's original formula was

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.210
iodine with bromine.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.460
And first experiment show

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.740
that bromine had a little
bit of hazing on the plate.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.170
So, they were doing some
experiment with iodine

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.680
and bromine and then iodine again.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.320
But with these experiments
and changing out the halogen,

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.180 position:56%
they were able to make the exposure
time of the plate, they could cut it

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.400
in half, which made still
a long time to sit still

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.440
but way less excruciating
than, you know, 15 minutes.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.140
So, just a little side
note of interest, bromine,

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:38.060
the element wasn't even discovered
until 1826 and we're talking

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.840
about 1839 right now, so, this
is just a little over 10 years

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.560
after this element
is even discovered.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.760 position:56%
And legend has it that Cornelius and
Goddard bought up all the bromine

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.510
that they could possibly
get in the area.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.350
So, the philosophical
society in Philadelphia

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.340
and the Franklin Institute
were the main two places

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.050
where you would present
new scientific discoveries.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.970
So, Cornelius and Goddard presented
these two particular daguerreotypes

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.860 position:56%
there at one of the annual meetings.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.770
And the one on the left
the portrait of Goddard.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:18.040
So, this one was made before
Cornelius's studio opened,

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.180
but it would make sense that
you would take a picture

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.520
of your partner.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.300
So, in 1840, these were
presented with great praise

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.570 position:56%
at the American Philosophical
Society to the scientific community.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:38.490
So, Cornelius went on for the
next year making portraits

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.320
in his first studio at
8th and Lodge Alley.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.610
So, if you're familiar
with Philadelphia, it's--

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.820
8th between Chestnut and Market.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.640
And Lodge Alley no longer exists.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.080
All of these images were made
on plates that Cornelius made

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.510
since he was a metal worker.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.260
And all of these image are housed

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.860
in a very non-traditional
metal frame style

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.890
that Cornelius made himself.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.860
And these three examples are
some of the variants you will see

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.120
from his handmade housing samples.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.180
Additionally, on the verse of all
of the Cornelius daguerreotypes,

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.010
you will see a paper backing
that contains a paper label

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.510
with the Cornelius studio name.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.290
So, this was sort of the way

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.420
that an artist would sign
his painting, daguerreotype.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.660
This is the way to sign
your daguerreotype.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:35.120
So, the following year in 1841,

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.270
Cornelius set up a
second portrait studio.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.290
And this one was on a second floor
and it had better natural lighting.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:45.750
And at this point, Cornelius had
really kind of perfected his craft

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:49.740
of portraiture in the short time
that he was making daguerreotypes.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.320
And he was able to reflect the sun
from his window on to his sitters

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.120
in a way that made it much
more painterly and scholarly.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.660
And with this area or
portraiture, he also put his images

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.520
into traditional leather cases
that we use here in America.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.590
So, daguerreotypes in Paris
were put into his glass housing

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.690
that were called passepartout that
contain the reversed painted glass.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:20.310
But in America, we traditionally
used little leather-embossed cases.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:26.160
But while you can't see the
Cornelius paper label on these,

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.410
he did emboss his brass
mass with his name

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.610
and his studio address on them.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.660
So, you'll know which
ones are Cornelius's.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:43.210
Cornelius also-- He
retired in-- from--

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:47.250
he had a studio from
1840, he closed in 1843.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:52.310
There's not a lot of records left
behind or notes from his studio.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:57.490
There aren't list of people
he took his-- were sitters.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.160
So, all that's left there are
the artifacts of his labor.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.110
So we know that Cornelius's
family was

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.410
in the laying [phonetic] business

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.160
and the gas plants were coming
very popular at this time.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.270
So, whether he went back to
work in his family's company

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:16.220
out of necessity or he just grew
tired of making daguerreotypes,

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.190
I'm not really sure of the later.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:21.040
It seems feasible but
this is what you will read

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.140
in the historic literature.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:28.500
But he closed off his shop in
1843 and he did make a handful

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:35.570
of daguerreotypes post his
"retirement" up until 1847.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:44.970
So, as I mentioned, he didn't
leave behind any logbooks,

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.100
we don't have records
of his studio but his--

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.070
the portraits that he left behind
are really quite remarkable.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:57.360
And his first studio portraits
were very straight on,

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.150
straightforward images
and bust from the waist up

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.200
and they were very
nice and very skilled.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.830
But by the time he made
it to his second studio,

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:11.450
I think he really perfected
his angles of his sitters

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.290
and his portraits became
pretty phenomenal.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:18.460
And on the-- This is a comparison,
on the left is the first studio

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.450
and the right is the second studio.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.090
And it's not just me thing

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:28.040
that I think Robert Cornelius's
portraits were pretty great,

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.260
Daguerre himself found
Cornelius's portraits

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.190
to be pretty phenomenal as well.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:38.700
So, and he-- Daguerre sent
a mammoth-like daguerreotype

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:44.440
of Notre Dame to the Franklin
Institute in this note on the back

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.070
of the daguerreotype indicates

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:52.570
that Daguerre was sending this
particular daguerreotype to America

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.480
in exchange for portraits
made by Robert Cornelius.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.520
So, to have the inventor

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.930
of the process request your
daguerreotype is probably the

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:08.950
highest honor you could have.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.600
However, all that remains
in the legend

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.690
of Robert Cornelius can only
be deduced in the series

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:18.450
of beautiful portraits he
captured between 1839 and 1847,

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:22.180
in the earliest era of
photography in the United States.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:27.260
And as of now, there
are fewer than 50

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.280
of his daguerreotypes
known to have survived.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.540
And these are just
some of the locations

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.740
that hold Cornelius's
daguerreotypes.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.610
So, for those who don't know
what a daguerreotype is,

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.790
I will give you a little
explanation.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.480
So, it's a highly polished
silver plate,

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.580
it's most commonly a thin layer
of silver coated over copper

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.540
that has been smoothed
to a mirror finish.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:02.490
And the process of making a
daguerreotype goes as follows.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:06.560
Step number one is to prepare
your silver coated copper plate

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.310
by clipping the corners.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.530
This helps you with polishing.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.700
And the second step is to
polish your silver plate

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.660
to a mirror finish.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.960
This polishing takes
many, many hours to do

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.490
to get the daguerreotype
smooth and shiny.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.330
And you will often see when you
look at a daguerreotype and hold it

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.980
on a certain angle that you can see
the polished marks and you can tell

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:35.070
which direction they go,
up or down or side to side.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.670
Number three is to subject the
plate to vapors of halogen.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:43.200 position:56%
And as I mentioned before Daguerre's
original formula used iodine

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.160 position:56%
and then later, it's what we call
double sensitization, so it's iodine

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.860
and bromine or a combination
of the two.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.270
And that made the plate
light sensitive.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.190
At that point, you would place your
plate in the daguerreotype camera

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.190
to take the exposure
and after that was done,

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.890
you would develop your images
in the fumes or mercury.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.050
And to stop that silver
reaction, this is where that fixer

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.160
or sodium thiosulfate comes in.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:14.040
And then, the next step in
this timeline occurs post 1841

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.000
and doesn't apply to the
earliest daguerreotypes

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.040
but there was a step called gilding

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.200
and this was the coating
of gold chloride.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.350
And the gold chloride would be
put on the surface of the plate,

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:31.160
and I'll explain this a little
bit more in detail later

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:36.050 position:56%
but in the earliest of
Cornelius's experiments, this step--

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.430
sorry, step did not exist.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.810
And then the final step for all
daguerreotypes was to seal them

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:46.470
up because this is a highly
polished piece of silver

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.100
and it tarnished quite readily.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.760
So, they've figured out pretty
quickly that they needed to seal it

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.150
in some sort of environment

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.960
that would protect it
from the atmosphere.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.930
So, this is what the
finished product

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.130
of a daguerreotype looks like.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.810
And it's a little bit hard
to see when you pick one

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.610
up because it's a mirror
and it's reflective.

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:15.440
So, at a certain angle, with a dark
material blocking the reflectance,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.360
you can actually see
the daguerreotype image.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.590
So, you could see the woman here.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:23.490
And if you tilt it a little
bit, the image become--

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.770
appears more like a negative.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.650
So, the silver changes
and it makes the parts

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.850
that stick out sort of recess.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:37.220
And if you tilt it even more,
it just becomes a solid mirror.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.600
So, you can see the reflectance
of this newspaper in the image.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:48.290
So, as I mentioned before
daguerreotypes needed to be sealed

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:53.020
to slow down the sulfur and other
pollutants in the atmosphere to--

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.730
from tarnishing the silver plate.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.680
And I mentioned that the French
used the reverse painted glass

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.250
passepartout and in America, we
use these embossed leather cases

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.600
that were made into standard sizes.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:11.170 position:56%
So, the daguerreotype package would
generally include Daguerre brass mat

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.680
that was placed directly on
top of the daguerreotype plate.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.480 position:56%
Over that, a shade of glass would be
put on top and around the perimeter

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.930
of this package, it was usually
sealed off with some kind

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.680
of paper tape with an adhesive.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.540
And then, that tape would be
covered by a brass preserver

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:32.490
to cover the seal around
the daguerreotype package.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.700
And the entire daguerreotype
package will be fitted into one

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.500
of these custom leather
cases and the leather,

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.800
it was usually embossed leather
and there was on the lid side,

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.770
there's a material that
help with the reflectance

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.440
and viewing of the daguerreotype.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.020
So, in this particular one I have
on the screen, it's a solid piece

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.590
of silk and that's sort of
the earlier style of case

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.670
but later they became dark
colored embossed velvet.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.800
So, in addition of
providing the daguerreotype

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.840
with a special handheld housing,
the cases and passepartout served

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.990
as protection from the harmful
gases in the environment.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:18.410
Being pure of silver, the
plates had a tendency to tarnish

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.700
if they were left bare
and open to the elements.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.530
So, on the left is an example
where the tarnish is quite heavy

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:28.400
and the pattern that forms
corresponds to the shape usually

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.580
of the brass mat that
sat on top of it.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.550 position:56%
Color interference rings would cover
the surface obscuring the image

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.850
from the outside in.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:41.520
Daguerreotypes are also susceptible
to abrasion and that layer

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.990
of silver that's coated on
the copper is extremely thin.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.400
So, if you touched it with your
finger or some other material,

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.650
you could easily disrupt the silver

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.300
and the copper beneath
could be exposed.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.050
And if you have moisture
in the environment,

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.290
then copper corrosion can form
and little mushroom like areas

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:03.410
of copper byproducts can protrude
to the surface of the daguerreotype

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.190
and you can see that
in the daguerreotype

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:08.610
on the right, the sitter
on the left.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.130
One other common problem

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:14.070
that daguerreotypes have are
deterioration over time is

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.800
that the glass that's placed
on top of them also corrodes.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.970
And the glass will ooze out
silica and other byproducts

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:24.840
of the glass production and
so it's the lag type forms--

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.350
formations that dangle
down from the glass

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:31.220
on to the copper-- the
daguerreotype plate.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.830
So, the oldest of the
daguerreotypes--

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.400
daguerreotype plates
are at the greatest risk

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.640
to these naturally occurring
deterioration issues.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.940
And this is the rubber

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.780
in Cornelius's self portrait that's
owned by the Library of Congress.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.640
And you can see on the
right, in this detail

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.110
that the perimeter
tarnishing is quite heavy.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:03.600
And these two Cornelius plates
that is shown before exhibit,

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.030 position:56%
a white haze around their perimeters

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.840
and these are the byproducts
of historic cleaning.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.340
These two daguerreotypes are owned

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:15.690
by the American Philosophical
Society and they were brought to me

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.680
at the conservation center

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.020
by Philosophical Society's
conserver Anne Downey.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:26.200
And Anne was concerned that when
she began working at her job

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.190
that she had seen these and then
she'd look at them really recently

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:35.330 position:56%
and she thought they had changed and
had more tarnished and more hazing

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.440
than she remembered when
she started at her job.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.830
And she asked me if there was
anything I could do to treat them.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:47.140
And I knew they're Robert Cornelius
daguerreotypes and looking at them

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.070
that they were some of the earliest
daguerreotypes made here in America

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.660
and I told her there was no
way I can just do a treatment

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.780
on these two daguerreotypes.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.560
There has to be a huge
research project.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.470
We don't have a lot of information
about these early materials.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:08.060
So, my first step was to telephone
my colleague Adrienne Lundgren here

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.900 position:56%
at the Library of Congress because I
know she really loves daguerreotypes

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.330
as much as I do and I also knew
that there was a large collection

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:19.380 position:56%
of Robert Cornelius's holdings here.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:23.900
So, together we talked about,
you know, I explained my problem

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.120
and she was telling me that she had
the self portrait and it was not

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.420
in very good shape either.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:33.270 position:56%
So, together we decided we needed to
collaborate on a research project.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:39.840
So, several issues that post
challenges for conservators

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.040
with these materials, their--

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.120
the primary issue is that the
daguerreotypes that were made

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.240
between 1839 and 1841
were not gilded,

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.480
and I mentioned this gold
chloride stuff in the production

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.440
of the daguerreotype earlier.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:00.540 position:56%
So, the gilding added a protective
layer to the silver image particles,

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:04.910
it also helped make the image a
little more adorable and stable

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.910
than their ungilded counterparts.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:10.070
The gilding also helped
visually with some

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.960
of the contrast of the image.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.530
So, when you compare ungilded n
the left versus the gilded image

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.540
on the right, you can see the
ungilded image is a little

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.850
bit flatter.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:28.740
But both images, all daguerreotypes
are incredibly fragile materials,

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:33.550
it just happens that the ungilded
daguerreotype are even more prone

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.270
to abrasion, which limits a lot

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.460 position:56%
of the treatment options we have
currently for gilded daguerreotypes,

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.360
which comprises most of
the body of daguerreotypes.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:49.450
So, the tarnishing of the
silver is the second issue

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:51.160
that we need to consider.

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.760
So, tarnish was a problem from
the beginning of production

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.760
of daguerreotypes as I
mentioned and so much

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.860
so by 1850 it was very common

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.890
that tarnishes already occurred
on daguerreotype plates.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:07.560
And people in the 19th century
were cleaning daguerreotypes

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.990
with solution of potassium cyanide.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.960
So with this cleaner, it
might work miracles at time--

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.960
at that time and it might have made
the plate pretty shiny and new.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:26.630
But today, 177 years later residual
amounts of cyanide can be found

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.930
on the surfaces of
daguerreotype plate.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:35.740
And you can see deterioration
that was caused by the cyanide.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.190
So, cyanide can be found

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.420
on the daguerreotype
plate for many reasons.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.020
Sometimes, it was used in the
production of the plate cladding.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.620
Sometimes it was used
in the development.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:50.200
And sometimes, it could just be
caused from historic cleaning.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.530
In this side-by-side
comparison on the left,

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:55.780
you can see the corresponding
tarnish on the silver plate

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.210
with the pattern of the fluorescent
cyanide in the image next to it.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:03.940
So, the image on the right is an
image under ultraviolet light,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:09.240
under UVC and it shows all of that
fluorescence caused by the cyanide.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.580
You can't see that
with the visible eye.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.330
But you can look in the bottom
right corner and see sort

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.510
of a corresponding
pattern of deterioration

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:22.570
and that is pretty aligned
with the cyanide on the plate.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:29.970
And then later in the 20th century,
in the 1950s we had a new compound

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:32.660 position:56%
for clearing silver called thiourea.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:36.430
And thiourea started to be
used to clean daguerreotypes.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:40.080 position:56%
And again, this was another compound

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.370
that you'd clean your daguerreotype
with, probably looked pretty great

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:49.140
at the time, but now, you know, 40,
50 years later, we are seeing a lot

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:53.080
of white residues and hazing on
daguerreotypes that were cleaned

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.640
with thiourea and likely
not washed very well

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.340
or over cleaned with thiourea.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.550
And cleaning of daguerreotypes
with this solution was very popular

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:07.020
so much so that it was published
in a Time Life book series,

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.710
it was in many photographic
magazines.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.810
So, a lot of people were
cleaning their daguerreotypes

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:17.680
and not necessarily conservators
or scientists, people just--

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.420
who had daguerreotypes read

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.770
about this new cleaning method
and we're trying it out.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:26.780
So, this will play a big
part a little bit later

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.760
on what we're dealing with
today as conservators.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.670
So just to give you an idea,
this is the daguerreotypes

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.900
of Paul Beck Goddard that APS has.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:42.340
And this one was cleaned in
thiourea in the late 1970s.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.890
And I know this for a fact
because there's a note on the back

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.920 position:56%
of this daguerreotype indicating so.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:52.260
So, well, I'm sure it looked pretty
good at the time it was cleaned.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.920
Now, it doesn't look
so great 40 years later

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:59.510
and you could see there's a
white haze around the perimeter

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.570
so that area would have been
the heaviest area of tarnish.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:08.690
So that thiourea has left a
really undesirable white hazing

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:13.350
on the heaviest part of the silver,
but there's also a haze overall.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:18.510
And then another result of these
historic cleanings is what we

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:19.810
call measles.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.230
So, on the right if
you look at that image,

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.780
same image in specular
illumination and you can see all

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.860
of these brown tiny dots
on the surface of the plate

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:34.320 position:56%
and those are all residual
byproducts of the historic cleaning.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.010
And here's the detail
under the microscope.

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.160
You can see, this is the surface
of the plate and there are a bunch

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.920
of abrasions and scratches.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.800
And I'm not 100% certain
that these were products

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.770
of Cornelius's working style
or products of, you know,

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:54.070
a brush being applied to
this daguerreotype plate

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:56.680
when it was cleaned in the 1970s.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:03.030
But just to give you an indication
of how easily these can be abraded,

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.830
you can see it really
makes a bunch of scratches

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:09.020
on the surface which
cannot be removed.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:15.590
But to make matters worse for
this poor portrait of Goddard,

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:18.690
I looked at it under
ultraviolet illumination

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.700
and this one also has
cyanide all over the surface.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.490
So, it's likely-- it could
have been cleaned twice

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.760
with two different cleaners,
which isn't an uncommon phenomenon

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.880
for early daguerreotypes.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:37.770
And the portrait of
Pierre Etienne DuPonceau,

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:41.400
he survived a little
bit better than Goddard,

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.040 position:56%
so his plate on specular
illumination just shows a little bit

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.340
of the hazing.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:51.770
But what I wanted to point out here
is there are some distinct little

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:56.770
polish marks on the plate, which
we looked at and saw on a lot

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:59.050
of early daguerreotype plates.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:02.370
And we're thinking that maybe
at first these were significant

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:05.850
in particular to Robert Cornelius
but we're finding on a lot

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:10.360
of these old plates
from 1839 that were hand

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.810
on that these little tiny hash
marks in them that these could be,

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:20.200
you know, a good indicator for
authenticity of material later.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.150
So, conservation treatment

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:37.580
of the daguerreotype is rather a
controversial topic in the field

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.910
of photograph conservation.

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.240
And while there have been
people restoring art works

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.010
since there have been art around,

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:48.900
the field of photograph
conservation is really quite new.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.880
So, it formed its infancy in the
1970s at the George Eastman--

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.510
what was George Eastman house,

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:57.910
which is now George Eastman
museum in Rochester, New York.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:59.210
And a group of caretakers

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:02.380
of photographs were
developing treatment protocols

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.140
and preservation standards
for daguerreotypes.

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.530
And these people eventually served
as the folks who were mentors

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:13.520 position:56%
and teachers in the art conservation
programs that developed here

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.380
in the United States in the 1970s.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.780
And it was with all of
these people's efforts

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:23.570
that photograph conservation was
established as a career path.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:26.110
So, in reaction to all
of these well-intentioned

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.460
but rampant cleaning of
daguerreotypes that sometimes ended

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:33.560
in destruction or undesirable
effects for the daguerreotypes,

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:38.270 position:56%
these folks put a moratorium on
cleaning daguerreotypes in the 1980s

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:41.850
until they could further
study this issue.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:45.580
Nowadays, conservators are washing
daguerreotypes with various methods

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:49.050
that we have deemed to
be safe and ethical.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.620
Though there are some photograph
conservators to this day

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.630
who still will not
wash a daguerreotype.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:59.480
But still we need to intervene
with some aqueous methods sometimes

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.020
on daguerreotypes and we need

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:06.490
to understand their long term
effects including the modern day

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:07.910
techniques that we use.

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:12.430
But right now in our field, we
really don't have any protocols

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.550
for reducing or reversing effects

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.290
of the historic cleaners
on daguerreotypes.

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:21.650
We don't have any information on
cleaning ungilded daguerreotypes

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:25.450 position:56%
and we're not even 100% certain of
the longevity of our current methods

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.830
of cleaning gilded daguerreotype.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.960
Leaving us with the question--
I forgot to show you this.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:35.020
This is before and
after cyanide cleaning.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.250
So, this is just a quick path
to show what can be removed

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:42.440
with our modern day methods.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.500
So, we're left with
this question of,

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.070
can a conservator wash
these early daguerreotypes

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.600 position:56%
that have been suffering the effects

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:59.000
of multiple historic cleanings
over the last 177 years?

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:05.480
So, of course, that-- the question
is not a very simple answer.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:09.040
And as conservators, we can't
just experiment with these rare

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.100
and early daguerreotypes as we have
to follow strict codes of ethics

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.450
in our field to do no harm.

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.850
And in order to reverse
what we've already done,

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:22.070 position:56%
what's already been done, a thorough
conservation science-based research

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.710
project needs to be
conducted before any method

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:28.060
of treatment could even be
considered to be attempted.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:32.390
So, we need to understand the
effects of these historic cleaners,

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:36.140
we also need to know the effects
of our current cleaners and we need

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.890
to understand how to reverse
these damaging effects in a way

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:42.740
that it will be safe and
preserve these daguerreotypes

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.380
for the long haul.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.060
So, a study of such
would include mockups

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:52.010
that closely replicate
the early working methods

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:55.890
of the daguerreotypist that
were working in 1839 in order

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:58.840
to see what approach works best.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.410
Then and only then
when positive outcomes

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:03.350
and safe procedures can be devised

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:05.690
from these experiments
could we even think

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:08.770
about performing conservation
treatment on these early rare

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:12.330
and valuable daguerreotypes.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:15.320
So, with a project
of this magnitude,

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.060
a team of experts is needed.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:23.270
So, as I mentioned before, some
people are in the audience.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.390
Adrienne Lundgren is on the
left, she's my colleague

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:27.970
that I initially contacted.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.570 position:56%
And so, Adrienne and I on the right,

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:34.450
decided with her supervisor Angie
Rob [assumed spelling] who's also

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:37.140
here at Library of
Congress to develop a team

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.650
of people to work on this project.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:42.820
So, we need a scientist and
the person that we chose

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:47.130
for the project is Edward
Vicenzi who's at Smithsonian MCI.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.730
And he's worked with
daguerreotype projects in the past

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:54.460
with a man named Mike Robinson
who's in the bottom left.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.010
And Mike Robinson is a
modern day daguerreotypist.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:01.660
So, Mike is the person who is
making all of our test samples.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.540
But together, they have worked
on some research with Southworth

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:07.170
and Hawes that has been
recently published.

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:10.840
So, they were likely two
candidates for working

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.760
on a daguerreotype project
with Adrienne and I.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.740 position:56%
We also-- Part of the research team,

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:21.740
we're looking at the curatorial
aspects of daguerreotypes

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:25.000
and early daguerreotypists and
so we need a curatorial team

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.090
and the people that we have
are Beverly Brannan from--

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:31.870
she's a curator here of
photography at Library of Congress.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:35.900
Will Stapp who was former curator
at the American Portrait Gallery

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:40.550
and he is the author of the one
and only book on Robert Cornelius.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:44.290
And then recently joining our team
is Sarah Weatherwax who's curator

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:48.860
of Prints and Photographs at the
Library Company in Philadelphia

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:53.240
who holds a lot of daguerreotypes
by Robert Cornelius as well.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:59.370
So, these people will be helping us
with a grant project that's been--

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:03.270
that's application
process is current.

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:08.460
Hoping to get the grant to form
a database of focusing primarily

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:12.650
on the-- all of the works of Robert
Cornelius but also including other

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:17.070
of Cornelius's contemporaries from
1839 to 1841 that we're working

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:21.480
on this ungilded era
of daguerreotyping.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:27.600
So those, we plan to look at every
one of those and study their--

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.360
them from a science-base,
conservation-base

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.480 position:56%
and a curatorial-base aspect and
make a database that would be useful

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.190
for collecting information.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.010
How these early daguerreotypes,
you know, how they looked,

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.080
how they were constructed, how
they survived over the years.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.160
What kind of environments they
were in that will be useful

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.830
for later phases of our studies.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:55.140
So, later investigations of this
project beyond what we're looking

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.240
at now of just how the
historic cleaners affect these

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.230
daguerreotype plates.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:04.320
We'll include studies on protocols,
how to reduce the damaging effects

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.270
of these historic cleaners and
also how to develop proper storage

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:13.890
and housing on recommendations for
daguerreotypes so that, you know,

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:15.860
they don't tarnish in the future.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.380
It is of my personal
opinion that doing nothing

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.910
with these daguerreotypes
and just letting them tarnish

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:25.410
until they're completely
black is, you know,

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:29.700
kind of just as doing a disservice
to the daguerreotypes as, you know,

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.630
intervening with historic
cleaners or,

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:35.210
you know, trying out new methods.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:38.720 position:56%
I mean, we need to figure out a
proper way to do it before we try it

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.500
but I think we can't just let
them deteriorate into nothing.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:49.380
So, I personally would like
to see this team and pull all

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.390
of our collaborative resources,
our expertise and our knowledge,

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:57.930
our understanding of daguerreotypes
together to preserve all these rare

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:01.160
and valuable irreplaceable
daguerreotypes

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.170
that are the earliest
photographic treasures

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:05.980
that we have here in
the United States.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:14.810
And I would like to see them exist
in another 177 years and beyond.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.550
So, here's just an example
of some of the works

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:22.890
of Robert Cornelius starting at the
upper left with his self portrait

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.190
and moving to the bottom right

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:29.430
through the years you can see
how his photography progressed.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:35.510
And this is a time lapse video so,
those of you who are not familiar

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:40.660
with conservation, we
don't work really fast.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.170
So, until we can do
all this research,

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:47.860
we will just seal these
daguerreotypes back up in a way

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.880
that we know to be best using
our standard procedures and wait

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.460
for the outcome of the research.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.470
And hopefully, I will be
back along with my colleague,

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:01.200
Adrienne Lundgren, in a few years
presenting some positive results

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.750
from our collective research.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:10.020
So, photography is a fragile
miracle of science and I hope that,

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.100
you know, it can leave
and we can leave--

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:17.030
hope it leave an indelible
mark on generations to come.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:19.510
Thank you very much.

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:27.640
[ Applause ]

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.940
Any questions?

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.010
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:32.310
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: Sure.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:37.560
&gt;&gt; Really great topic and
very detailed in a good way.

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.140
Assuming some people who are
watching this has daguerreotypes

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.900
at home or in their
family collections

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.960
and then perhaps they may want
to donate them to the Library

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.680
of Congress in the future, it may
happen, what would you suggest

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.540
to them that they do
or not do to these?

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.740
Like, I'm guessing, let's
say, can we wash them?

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.040
Control the humidity?

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.340
What else would you say?

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.640
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: Sure.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.630
So, the question for
the web audience was,

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:08.480
if you have daguerreotypes
at home, what should you

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.330
or should you not do while you
have them in your possession.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:17.820
So, unfortunately daguerreotypes
are these things that people are

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:21.120
so curious about and they
love to pull out of the cases

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.520
and open them up, but really,
you should just leave them alone.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.870
People always think that there's
going to be a note or a patch

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:30.810
of hair underneath the
daguerreotype and the case.

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:33.090
But even just the action of
pulling the daguerreotypes

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:36.570
out of the case can cause
damage to the daguerreotype.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:39.580
And if you're taking off
brass mats and preservers

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:42.220
and disrupting things,
you're just opening things

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:43.520
up to the environment.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.970
So, they were putting
these cases for a reason.

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:51.850
So, the daguerreotypes, you should
keep them like most photographs.

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:55.550
Not in your basement
and not in your attic.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.260
Daguerreotypes are usually
in the American style case,

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.640
so they are sort of protected
from light themselves.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.370
But you, you know, might want to
keep them in an area of your house

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:07.290
that isn't near the light or
is, you know, isn't exposed.

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:09.780
It's not going to get exposed
through the leather case.

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.770
But, in general, for
photographs, we tell people

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.910
to keep them in the dark.

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:16.330
But yeah, I think, just--

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:19.430
like leaving them alone is
probably the best thing you can do,

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.730
if that helps.

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:23.500
&gt;&gt; Can you add storage to that?

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.360
Storage conditions like what kind
of box we should put them in?

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.660
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: OK.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.960
The question is in what kind

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.260
of boxes should you
put daguerreotypes in?

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:34.670
Any kind of archival
base box that is made

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:40.110 position:56%
from alkaline non-reactive materials
is fine to put the daguerreotype in.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:43.250
You can buy these readily
from archival suppliers.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:46.170
You can make your own
four flat boxes.

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:49.080
There are instructions you can
find on the internet to do this.

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.990
But just anything that's
non-reactive.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.290
Yes?

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.510
&gt;&gt; Where are you in your research?

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:00.220
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: The question
is where are we in the research.

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.640
So, I'm actually here this week,
we're here on the research.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.810
We have already made the plate,
so we're just in the process

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:10.400
of doing preliminary
testing, ACM testing.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.790
So, it's pretty early on.

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:16.510
In the back.

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:27.510
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:31.400
Sure. The question was about
how do we limit the exposure

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:36.330
of the ultraviolet illumination
when examining the photographs.

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:42.090
So, I just-- thankfully, for the
power of digital photography today,

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:44.430
it's-- you don't have to
expose it for very long.

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:46.970
So, really, in just
turning on the light

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.980
and then my photographers
clicking the camera

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:53.570
and a few seconds later,
we have an image.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:57.190
So, it doesn't get that much
light exposure to the ultraviolet.

00:52:57.190 --> 00:53:00.140
&gt;&gt; Just keeping it low.

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.330
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: Well, it had--
there's no like keeping it low,

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:06.080
it's just one setting of UVC but--

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:10.070
and a lot of people ask
me about light exposure

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:13.330
like scanning photographs, but
that tiny little light that you get

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:15.980
to take a photograph is
not going to be damaging.

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:19.380
It's a cumulative light that causes
the damage to the photographs.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:25.400
I can't tell if that's
a question or not.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.700
Any other questions?

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.000
In the back?

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.510
&gt;&gt; I just want to say thank
you for the presentation.

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:47.270
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:48.710
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: Oh great.

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:52.940
We have to stop by then.

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.500
Any other-- are there
web questions or-- Mary?

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.800
OK.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.870
&gt;&gt; Mary: Well, yeah, I just
want to clarify, I'm sorry.

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:06.470
If you do treat a daguerreotype,
do you throw out the old case?

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:07.960
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel:
So, the question is,

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.730
if I treated the daguerreotype,
do I throw out the old case?

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:13.480
And the answer is no, we
don't throw out anything.

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:16.930
Every once in a while a glass
is so deteriorated that we have

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:18.450
to replace it with another glass.

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:23.710 position:56%
But even in that case, I
personally return the original glass

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:26.520
to the client and keep
the original materials

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:30.540
with the object including the fact
that I've removed paper tape seals,

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.790
I will take those paper
tape seals off,

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.640
line them with a good
quality Japanese paper

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.250
and put them back on
the daguerreotype.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:40.330
So, yeah, I don't throw up anything
that is on the daguerreotype.

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:43.830
&gt;&gt; Could you just continue on
with that and talk a little bit

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:47.600
about attribution based on-- not
like how you would, say, the case

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:53.490
or all those things in the light
of attribution for [inaudible].

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:54.790
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: Yeah sure.

00:54:54.790 --> 00:55:00.090
So, in a case of the Cornelius's,
Cornelius made very specific cases

00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:04.430
and these are attributes
to his particular workings.

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:07.840
So, for example, the self portrait,

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.320
we do not have the original
case that it was in.

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.900
So, this is problematic.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:13.340
So, this is another
reason why you don't want

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.020
to take your daguerreotypes apart.

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.650
Because some of these
materials are specific

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:21.460
to the photographer's
working style himself

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:26.140 position:56%
and can give us valuable information
that helps determine what kind

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.480
of construction or working
methodology one conservator--

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.130
or I'm sorry, one photographer had.

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:36.230
And it will help us study a
broad collection of materials.

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:40.580
So, by, you know-- and it's a
pretty common practice in sort

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.550
of dealing industry to
take a daguerreotype

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:45.800
out of one case and
put it in another.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.170
But even-- there are, you know,

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:49.150
daguerreotype photography
became very popular

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:51.400
and there were quite a few
people making portraits

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.920
by the, you know, 1850s.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.800
But some of the earlier
things really need to remain

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.050
in these materials that they
were placed in originally

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:03.320
because they do provide a
lot of valuable information.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:08.160
And so, we can also tell a
lot of why things deteriorate

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.390
in a certain way based on
the materials that they used.

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:15.250
So, if you switch out a case and
we don't have the original case,

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:17.930
we don't know how that
material reacted

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:23.300
with the photograph over a time.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.050
Yes?

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:38.140
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you, do you
know at the time in the 1840,

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:42.550
'50s how expensive
it would have been

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:45.820 position:56%
to take a portrait of daguerreotype?

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:47.120
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: OK.

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.950 position:56%
The question is how expensive it was

00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:51.530
to have your daguerreotype
portrait made.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:57.130
As I mentioned, we don't have
any Robert Cornelius's notes,

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:07.000
but there's a lot of advertisements
from the early 19th century

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.540
from daguerreotype studios.

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:14.950
So, it was roughly $5 to have a
daguerreotype made, which was a lot

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:20.990
of money in 1830s, 1840s.

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:22.590
Any other questions?

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:24.450
&gt;&gt; What do you consider

00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:28.060
to be appropriate housing
for loose plates?

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.610
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: The
question is what do I consider

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:33.880
to be appropriate housing
for loose plates?

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.740
Well, loose plates are
extremely problematic

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:40.450
because they're 100%
exposed to the environment.

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:43.130
So, there were famous
daguerreotypist plate

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:48.010
that were found in these
wooden boxes that they used

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.800
in the 19th century to store
their box-- their daguerreotypes.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:55.470
But, you know, have
faired OK but in general,

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:58.160
we don't recommend any wood.

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:03.260
But I would definitely recommend
having a conservator seal

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:07.540
up your daguerreotype in
a very simple package just

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.100
so it isn't exposed
to the environment.

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.850
So, one-- in part of
this Cornelius project,

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:17.460
I have met with family
members of Robert Cornelius

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:21.450
who have some portraits
of family members.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:27.020 position:56%
And the one portrait that Al showed
to me, he handed me was a bare plate

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.420
and there was no image on it.

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:34.840
He just stuck it in my hand
and he was like, turn it over.

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.350
And I turned it over and
there's an etch on the back

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:40.100
that says portrait
by Robert Cornelius.

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.710
I'm like, why is this
in my bare hand?

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.560
So, you leave it out and
it tarnishes to, you know,

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.860
the images are 100% obscured.

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:47.160
So, you know, these plates,

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.460
particularly this one
really needed a housing.

00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:49.760
So, conservator is the
way to go for that.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.060
&gt;&gt; What was the wash bath
in the washing video?

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.360
&gt;&gt; Rachel K. Wetzel: The wash bath

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.660
in the washing video
was ammonium hydroxide

00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:54.960
which is our current
treatment method,

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.260
so ammonium hydroxide
and de-ionized water.

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.560
Any other questions?

00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.010
Well, thank you so much
for having me here.

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:01.150
[ Applause ]

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:04.800
