00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.420
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.570
I am Carla at Library
of Congress and I want

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.560
to welcome you to this
very special story time

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.860
at the library.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.560
I love reading, don't you?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.440
It is so much fun to let
our imaginations run wild.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.330
We are excited and have teamed

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.500
up with Ms. Ms. Dolly
Parton's Imagination Library

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.480
to introduce you to
some wonderful authors

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.320
who will share their
stories with us.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.370
This partnership works
through her imagination Library

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.470
and it is awe-inspiring.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.100
She and her team have given
away over 100 million books

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.430
to help encourage young readers
to read across the world.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.320
Here at the Library of
Congress we share that passion

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.890
for developing young readers
and we know that the best way

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.260
to encourage people like you
to read is to make reading fun

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.250
so that is what we will do.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.170
I hope you enjoy
today's story time.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.660
Even more, I hope you keep
reading at home and having fun.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.560
Today we will warm up by singing
some songs, touching your toes,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.460
and then get comfortable and
get ready to here stories.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.540
Now let's get started!

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.840
Good morning!

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.400
Good morning and
welcome to the library

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.970
of congress' fifth imagination
story time coming to you

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.130
from the beautiful pavilion and
today we have a special guest.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.440
My name is Caroline and I come
from the young reader's center

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.500
and today we are welcoming
Melissa from the music division

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.320
who is going to read
and play her flute.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.750
Melissa Wertheimer, I
should say her last name.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.030
So we are going to start

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.760
with our good morning
song, our hello, friends.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.740
We are going to sing and sign to
the tune of good night ladies.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.830
So the sign for hello is the
salute, just a little salute

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.840
and the sign for friends is
you take your two index fingers

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.970
and you hug them one way and
then the other way, and the some

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.700
for time is do you tap your
imaginary watch and the sign

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.770
for to say is you
touch your mouth.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.810
Okay? So hello, friends.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.840
Hello, friends three times.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.240
It is time to say hello.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.790
Hello, friend, hello,
friend, hello, friend,

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.580
it's time to say hello.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.430
Good job. [Applause] All
right so since we are going

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.980
to be reading about trains I
thought we should start off

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.320
with a little song
that everybody knows --

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.890
down by the station, down by the
station early in the morning,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.930
see the little puffer
bellies all in a row.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.120
See the little engine driver
pull the little lever, puff,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.940
puff, toot, toot, here we go.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.100
What is a puffer belly?

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.630
The designers called it
puffing Billy because all

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.110
of the steam it created.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:46.450
So here we go --
down by the station,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.520
early in the morning See the
little puffer bellies all

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.440
in a row See the engine driver
pull the little lever Puff,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.970
puff, toot, toot, off we
go Down by the station,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.050
early in the morning, see
the little puffer bellies all

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.080
in a row See the engine driver
pulled a little lever, Puff,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.360
puff, toot, toot, off we go!

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.740
[Applause] So now we are going
to do a little action rhyme

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.000
and we are going to make
our arms into the wheels

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.160
that go chugging
down the tracks.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.020
Can you get your arms bent?

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.710
And then we are going to
move them in a circle.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.470
Okay. This is choo-choo train.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.990
Here is a little choo-choo
train puffing down the tracks,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.620
now now it is, leaned forward,
and now it is going back.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.920
Leaned back.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.800
Now the bell is ringing,
ding, ding,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.970
now the whistle blows,
toot, toot.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:06.510
What a lot of noise it makes
(Cover your ears) Everywhere

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.810
it goes.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.110
One more time.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.410
Here is a little choo-choo
train coming down the tracks.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.750
Now it is going forward,
and now it is going back.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.040
Now the bell is ringing, ding,
ding Now the whistle blows,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:32.100
toot, toot What a lot of noise
it makes everywhere it goes!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.060
(Applause) Good job!

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:43.140
So miss Melissa is going
to read the classic 19 book

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.850
by Waddy Piper and
illustrated by Gerald

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.520
and Anne Houseman called
what do you think --

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.700
the little engine that could.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.400
Our theme today is called
persistence or perseverance.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.730
What does that mean?

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.790
It means sticking with something
no matter how hard it gets

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.600
and not giving us -- okay?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.850
The little engine
that could. »

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.910
: Good morning, everybody.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.890
I have a special job
for everybody out here.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:24.780
Your job is when ever hear
the sound, toot, toot,

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.550
do you hear that sound?

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.830
Your job is to make
the train go.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.870
We have to do our action
from our action rhyme.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.810
And we try that one more time?

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:43.220
This is the sound and you
have to make the train go.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.520
Toot, toot.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.360
So this is the little
engine that could.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:57.360
Toot, toot The little train
rumbled over the tracks.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.260
She was a happy little
train because she had

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.620
such a jolly load to carry
Her cars were filled full

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.280
of good things for boys and
girls There were toy animals,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.840
giraffes with long necks.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.870
There were teddy bears
with almost no necks at all

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.340
and even a baby elephant.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.640
Everybody be an elephant.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.790
We have a baby elephant
on the train.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:36.220
And then there were dolls, dolls
with blue eyes and yellow curls.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.940
Dolls with brown eyes
and brown bobbed heads

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.720
and the funniest toy
clown you ever saw

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.930
And there were cars full of toy
engines and airplanes, tops,

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.240
Jack Nieves, picture
puzzles, books, and every kind

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.620
of thing a boy or
girl could want.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.360
But that was not all --
some of the cars were filled

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.240
with all sorts of good
things for boys and girls

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.650
to eat Big gold oranges
and red-cheek apples,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.590
bottles of creamy milk for
their breakfast, fresh spinach

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.250
for their dinners, and lollipops

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:32.370
for after dinner treats The
little train was carrying all

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.520
of these wonderful things to
the good little boys and girls

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.280
on the other side
of the mountain.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.430
She puffed along merrily --

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:54.030
toot, toot And then all of a
sudden she stopped with a jerk.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.960
She simply could
not go another inch.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:06.020
She tried and she
tried toot, toot,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:11.000
but her wheels would
not turn What were all

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.280
of those good little boys
and girls on the other side

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.460
of the mountain going to do with
the wonderful toys to play with

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.120
and the good food to eat?

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.340
Here comes a shiny new
engine -- toot, toot toot --

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:34.200
said the funny little clown
that jumped out of the train.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.440
Let us ask him to help us.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.120
So all of the dolls and toys
cried out together, "Please,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.410
shiny new engine, won't
you please pull our train

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.710
over the mountain?

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.790
Our engine has broken down
and the boys and girls

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.600
on the other side won't have any
toys to play with or good food

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.850
to eat unless you help us!

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.400
But the shiny new
engine snorted.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.660
"I pull you?

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.060
I am a passenger engine.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.430
I have just carried a fine,
big train over the mountain

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.760
with more cars then
you ever dreamed of!

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:26.930
My train has sleeping cars with
comfortable births, a dining car

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:32.170
where waiters brings whatever
hungry people want to eat

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:37.140
and parlor cars in which
people sit and big soft tears

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.580
and looked out of place windows.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.290
I pulled the likes of you?

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.370
Indeed not!

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:53.090
" And off he seemed to the
Roundhouse where engines live

00:10:53.090 --> 00:11:05.050
when they are not busy Toot,

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:11.920
toot House sad the little
train and toys all felt.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.950
Then the little clown
called out,

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.780
"The passenger engine is not
the only one in the world.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.990
Here is another engine coming,
a great big, strong one.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:32.460
Let us ask him to help us!

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.020
" Toot, toot The little
toy clown waved his flag

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.900
and the big strong
engine came to a stop.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.050
"Please, oh, please big
engine, cried all the dolls

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.860
and toys together, won't
you please pull our train

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.580
over the mountain?

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.750
Are engine has broken down and
the good little boys and girls

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.380
on the other side won't have any
toys to play with or good food

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.760
to eat unless you help us.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:10.420
"But the big strong engine
bellowed, "I am a freight train.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.240
I had just pulled
a big train loaded

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.380
with big machines
over the mountains.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.150
These machines print
books and newspapers

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.530
for grown-ups to read.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:28.010
I am a very important
engine indeed.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.790
I won't pull the likes of you."

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:36.590
And the freight train
puffed off indignantly

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:48.340
to the Roundhouse Toot,
toot . Toot, toot.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:53.890
Toot, toot The little
trains and all

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.330
of the dolls was very, very sad.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.670
And now that we are all
sad and we feel defeated,

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.180
let's take a little break

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.930
for a happy song it is
called the railroad waltz

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.240
and it is a dance.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.180
And railroads are special
because we count to three.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.320
In everybody count to three?

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:20.580
123 123 all right.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.340
If you would like to dance,
here is a railroad waltz.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.290
We will get happy a little bit
because that way we will not be

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.970
so sad (Flute playing)

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.510
(Applause)

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.220
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.310
Does everybody feel
a little happier?

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.350
I hope so.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:47.090
So now we get back to our story
where the little train and all

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.530
of the dolls were very sad.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.360
"Cheer up, cried the
little toy clown,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.860
this right engine is not
the only one in the world.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.980
Here comes another."

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.450
Toot, toot.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:13.180
Toot, toot He looked
very old and tired,

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.620
but our train is so little.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.560
So perhaps he can help us.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:25.250
So the little toy
clown waved his flag

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:37.740
and the rusty old engine
stopped . "Please, kind engine,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.330
cried all of the dolls
and toys together,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.180
won't you please pull our
train over the mountain?

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.700
Our engine has broken down
and the boys and girls

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.390
on the other side won't have any
toys to play with or good food

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.370
to eat unless you help us.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:05.130
" But the rusty old engine
side, "I am so tired,

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.430
I must rest my weary wheels.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.940
I cannot pull even
so little A-Train

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.430
as yours over the mountain.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.080
I cannot. I cannot.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:26.450
I cannot. " And off he rumbled
to the Roundhouse, chugging.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.510
Toot, toot.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.680
Toot, toot.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.910
Toot, toot I cannot.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:40.530
I cannot. I cannot.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:47.330
Then indeed the little train
was very sad and the dolls

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.300
and toys were ready to cry.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.280
But the little clown called out,
"Here's another engine coming,

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.230
a little blue engine,
a very little one

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.020
but maybe she will help us.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.010
" Toot, toot.

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:10.950
Toot, toot.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.910
Toot, toot The very little
engine came chug, chug,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.800
chugging merrily along when
she saw the toy clown's flag,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.100
she stopped quickly.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:29.260
"What is the matter, my
friends, she asked kindly.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.400
" "A little blue engine,
cried the dolls and toys,

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.330
will you pull us
over the mountain?

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.030
Our engine has broken down
and the good boys and girls

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.580
on the other side won't have any
toys to play with or good food

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.420
to eat unless you help us.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.970
Please, please help
us, little blue engine.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:57.550
" "I am not very big, said
the little blue engine.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.150
They use me only for
certain trains in the yard.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.540
I have never been
over the mountain.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.580
" "But we must get over the
mountain before the children

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.190
awake, said all of
the dolls and toys."

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:15.680
And the very little engine
looked up and she saw the tears

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.250
in the dolls' eyes and she
thought of the good little boys

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.850
and girls on the other
side of the mountain

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:29.650
who would not have any toys or
good food unless she helped.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.130
Then she said, ""I
Think I Can....

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.930
I Think I Can....I Think I Can

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.530
and she hitched herself
to the little train.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:46.670
She chugged and she pulled and
pulled and tugged, and slowly,

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.790
slowly they started off.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:59.770
(Chugging, chugging) The toy
clown jumped aboard and all

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.390
of the dolls and toy
animals begin to smile

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:08.560
and cheer (Chugging,
chugging) Toot, toot Ding,

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:15.670
ding when the little
blue engine,

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:20.600
""I Think I Can....I Think I
Can....I Think I Can I Think I

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.630
Can....I Think I Can....I Think
I Can I Think I Can....I Think I

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.750
Can....I Think I Can.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.170
" Up, up, up, faster, and faster

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.950
and faster the little engine
climbed until at last,

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.900
they reached the
top of the mountain.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.640
Down in the valley lay the city.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.880
" Hooray! " Hooray!, cried
the funny little clown

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.630
and all the dolls and toys.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.450
The good little boys and girls
in the city will be happy

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:59.020
because you helped us,
kind little blue engine.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:04.730
And the little blue engine
smiled and seemed to say

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.250
as she puffed steadily
down the mountain --

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.850
(Chugging, chugging) chugging).

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.470
Toot, toot.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.920
Toot, toot.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.240
Toot, toot.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:21.260
Toot, toot (Chugging, chugging).

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.840
Toot, toot.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:29.750
Toot, toot I thought I
could, I thought I could,

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.800
I thought I could,
I thought I could.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:40.600
The end. (Applause)
How fabulous! »

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.810
: Thank you Ms. Melissa.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:52.750
Okay. So let's do
an old classic,

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.090
"I have been working
on the railroad.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.770
" We have been working
on the railroad, right?

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:06.490
So she is going to give us our
key (Flute playing) I had been

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:13.780
working on the railroad, all
the live day I have been working

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:21.080
on the railroad, just to pass
the time away Can you hear the

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:28.470
whistle blowing, rise
up so early in the morn.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:38.790
Can't you hear the captain
shouting, Dinah blow your horn.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:44.440
Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah,
won't you blow, oh, Dinah,

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.830
won't you blow your horn?

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:52.770
Dinah, won't you blow, Dinah,
won't you blow, oh, Dinah,

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:58.280
won't you blow your horn
Someone is in the kitchen

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:14.370
with Dinah Someone is in the
kitchen I know Is someone is

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.120

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:22.930
Stremming on the old
banjo Fee-fi-fiddly-eye-oh

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:29.350
Fee-fi-fiddly-eye-oh
Fee-fi-fiddly-eye-oh Strumming

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:34.020
on the old banjo.

(Applause) Wonderful!

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.970

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.120
All right, so we have come

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.040
Let's sing our goodbye song,

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.990
which is the opposite
of the hello, song.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:54.460
So we are going to wave
goodbye, friends, waved goodbye
