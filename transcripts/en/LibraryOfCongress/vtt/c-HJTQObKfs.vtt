00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: All right
everyone get your coffee, settle in.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.390
I'm glad to see most of you back
here today for the second day

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.860
of our symposium; Collections,
Collaborations and Connections.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.210
I think we had a fabulous day.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.520
I know the staff felt very
good yesterday about a lot

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.150
of the discussion and I'm really
thrilled to see so many people kind

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.310
of connecting, meeting each other.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.880 position:56%
Researchers talking with archivists.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.360
Imagine. So, we've got
another fabulous day.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.910
Again, I think focusing
on our collections

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.370
and in particular we're
going to be really zeroing

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.360
in on the wax cylinder collections
of Native American material.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.310
And you'll be meeting
some of the partners

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.910
that we're working with these days.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.470
And I think going to find out
about a really exciting project,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.120
a development that I
think in some ways kind

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.040
of brings the federal
cylinder project,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.340
which a few people
referenced yesterday,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.680
brings it into the 21st-century.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.680
But before we do that, we're
going to hear a little bit more

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.830
about the wax cylinder
collections from Judith Gray,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.930
our senior reference specialist.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.730
Judith.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.320
[ Applause ]

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.140
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: Good morning
and welcome to all of you.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.000
Actually, I'm taking as my role,
to set the stage even broader

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.400
for what the center has been about.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.950 position:56%
What the library has been about with
its Native American collections.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.430
I started looking back and realized

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.250
that probably the very earliest
field recordings that we received

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.260
that are tribal based came in
July1936 when Helen Roberts;

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.750
Helen Heffron Roberts gave
the library disk copies

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.190
of her Luiseño cylinder
recordings that she had made

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.950
in Pechanga, California in 1926.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.830
So, interestingly enough, the first
part of this whole discussion has

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.680
to do with migrating of formats.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.480
And so, the very first
recordings, field recordings,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.230
that we received here were
already a migrated format.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.080
She gave us the disc copies,
rather than the cylinders.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.780
Although the cylinders
themselves came later.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.750
We then go three years later, when
Willard Rhodes, a music professor

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.950
at Columbia University started
about a 15-year project.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.420
He had been hired by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs to go

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.090 position:56%
out in the summers and to record
contemporary native song traditions.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.840
And he went all over the US in
different years and collected many,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.620
many, many disc recordings
all through the 40s.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.660
While the recordings
were made for the Bureau

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.470
of Indian affairs there was
some sort of an agreement

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.350
that they would be
promptly deposited

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.370
in the Library of Congress.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.350
They are some of the most; some
of the best audio quality ones

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.530
that we have that are
early in that period.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.010
Then we have 1942, a rather
interesting year as it turns out.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.730 position:56%
Smack in the middle of World War II.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.830
But it was in that year in April

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.050
when Alan Lomax recorded
the Isleta Pueblo here

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.640
in the library's recording studio.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.650
All through the decades and such,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.940
many of the early cylinder
recordings were actually made here

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.270
in Washington DC, when people

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.560
from visiting delegations
were recorded here.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.890
And in fact, I believe we are
essentially directly over the place

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.290
where many early recordings
were made.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.300
Alice Fletcher had a townhouse,
in this block on the side

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.140
of the street back in the 1890s.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.560
And she recorded a great many
people visiting at that point.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.540 position:56%
So, I think the cylinders which were
here, went elsewhere, and elsewhere,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.070
and elsewhere have come
back home essentially.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.370
But we didn't get those
cylinders themselves

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.880
until significantly later.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.290
But back then, to 1942, so,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.860
April was when these Isleta
Pueblo governor was recorded.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.870
In September, the library had
already begun releasing sampler

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.180
albums of recordings
in its collections.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.190
And in that year, the
predecessor of this;

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:16.650
this is this is the LP version,
but it would've been six 78s

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.250
in an album, were released.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.890
The collection of William Fenton,

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.530
"Song from The Iroquois
Longhouse" recorded both

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.110
in New York and in Canada.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.120
The project, or the recordings
themselves were made in 1941.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.690
And that particular recording
project was sponsored by the Bureau

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.220
of American Ethnology and
the Library of Congress.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.300 position:56%
So, the library was already starting

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.280
to gather tribal recordings
at that point.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.300
That same summer, a woman named
Henrietta Yurchenco documented

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.600
Tarascan and mestizo music
in Michoacán, Mexico.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.770
Those recordings, which came here,

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:05.610
the Tarascan ones are perhaps
the first non US field recordings

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.320 position:56%
of indigenous people that came here.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.930
While that particular
project of hers was not done

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.700
in direct consultation, or
collaboration, with the library;

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:31.330 position:56%
her subsequent projects from 1944 to
1946 were sponsored by the Institute

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.930
of [speaking in foreign language],
and the Library of Congress.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.810
And in those years, she gathered
documentation of Cora, Huichol,

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.970
Seri, Yaqui, Tarahumara,
Tzotzil, and Tzeltal songs.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.050
Then we get to 1948.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.340 position:56%
One of the most significant
collectors of field recordings up to

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.040
that point for the Bureau

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.100
of American Ethnology was a
woman named Francis Densmore.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.720
The recordings; her
cylinder recordings and those

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.450
of many others made for the
BAE had been transferred

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.460
to the National Archives around
the beginning of the decade.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.200
But Densmore really had hopes.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.050
She knew about the
sampler disk publications

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.210
at the library was releasing.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.270
She managed to pull enough strings
and to influence enough people

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.690
that it was at that point, 1948,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.900 position:56%
when all of those early BAE
cylinder recordings were transferred

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:30.520
to the library in her hope there
was that she would then be able

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.400
to make the sampler
recordings of the same sort

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.640
that Fenton and others had done.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.000
To make those recordings
available in that case,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.960 position:56%
principally to educators, composers.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.560
She wanted the music,
the music of America

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.490
to be more broadly
heard and understood.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.300
It was not however, project aimed

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.820
at returning materials
back to tribal communities.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.890
This was definitely
outreach to other areas.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.410
So, after that, for the next
couple of decades, certainly,

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.850
the library was receiving
collections

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.870
that were tribally based.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.110
Materials then were being
copied, but they were being copied

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.450
by audio engineers who would've
had no particular knowledge

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.200
of what traditions
they were working with.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.270
They would've had no
particular documentation.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.550
So, it was sort of blind copying
and sometimes that resulted

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.660
in things being copied
at incorrect speeds.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.510
Sometimes incorrect names
being applied to collections.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.790
But it was an ongoing process.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.170
We then jump to 1976,
and the creation

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.750
of the American Folklife Center.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.520
And you've heard a lot about the
field projects that were underway

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.950
as soon as the center was created.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:55.160
But also, at that point,
an early outreach project,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.560
the Federal Cylinder Project.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:04.530
And, well I came on in 1983,
just at the time when a lot

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.370
of the original cataloging and
preservation had been done.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:14.470
And when people were
starting to actually get

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.730
into the process of dissemination.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.640
We got all sorts of good
advice on how to do this,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.440
how to make this happen
from various tribal experts.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.080
And in all we probably visited
at least 50 communities.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.220
We sent materials to others.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.540
And at that point I was
guesstimating that in the course

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.560
of any particular year, we were
in touch with representatives

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.240
from at least 70 different
communities.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.760
The big profit project though
was with the Omaha tribe.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.720 position:56%
And here, both Alan Jabbour and Carl
Fleischhauer had a big hand working

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.040
directly with the tribe.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.500
Going back and forth, bringing
tribal representatives,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.460
especially the tribal historian,
Dennis Hastings, here to DC.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.940
And going, having people going out

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:16.060
and documenting the annual
powwows in Macy, Nebraska.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.410
So, that interchange, but that
was then definitely designed

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.360
to return materials
to the communities,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:30.320
to the community of
origin in this case.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.500
So, in trying to set this up for
what you're going to be hearing

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:40.360
about FCP 2.0, as I've
been hearing it called.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:46.050
At that point then, through
the original cylinder project,

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.180
we were working very
much sort of outreach

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.170
from here to the communities.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.270
And trying to find
out what they needed,

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.120
trying to provide technical
assistance,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.520
trying to provide the
materials themselves.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.310
But then, I think things
sort of shifted.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:11.600
At that point, into the
90s and more recently,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.370
it's been much more a
process of collaboration,

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:22.160 position:56%
and a process of having people
decide when they need water from us.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.300
We can provide whatever they
are asking for, but it comes,

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.060
the initiation of most of
these projects since then,

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.540
has come from the tribes
themselves, from the communities,

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.350
from individuals who
are the culture keepers.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.850
And meanwhile, what we've
been doing is having more

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.120
and more collaborations with
the National Park Service

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.090
on the historic preservation
grants to tribes with keepers

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.700
of the treasures, was
another aspect of that.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.690
You heard yesterday
about Breath of Life.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.510
Many more partnerships being
established between agencies,

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.890
between archives and
between communities

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.520
where the materials belong.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.320
And it is that which is so exciting
to hear about the next project.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.510
So, with that, I turn
it over to you.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:19.640
[ Applause ]

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.340
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So,
while; hi I'm Guha Shankar,

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.050
good morning, thank you for coming.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.080
While I have Judith here, I
thought I would do something

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.460
that just gives me great pleasure.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.670
I think it will provide
you with some insight

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.970
into the work that she does.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.440
I have a visual aid.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.650
This is somewhat bedraggled
bag, it's from the Association

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.360
of Tribal Archives
Libraries and Museums,

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.450
which is an organization dedicated
to bringing together professionals

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.930
from across indigenous
communities around the world,

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.510
every year in an annual conference.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.270
Now ATALM every year
starting in 2007, identifies

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.440
and recognizes organizations
and individuals who serve

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.620
as outstanding examples of how
individuals archives, libraries,

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.360
museums, and individuals
contribute to the vitality

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.950
and cultural sovereignty
of native nations.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.310
The guardian award which
they give out, takes its name

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.840
from the sculpture that stands
atop the Oklahoma State Capitol,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.860 position:56%
and honors the words of the
seminal Chief Kelly Haney, who said,

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.600
"Dream big, work hard,
believe deeply

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.960
for this is just the beginning.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.560
To that end, we have
two former winners right

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.000
up here on stage with us.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.710
In 2012, Kim Christen,
here, took home the award

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:38.370
for the Plateau People's
Portal, web portal.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.430
An interactive online digital
archive that provides access

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.520
to Plateau people's
culture and materials

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.420
at Washington State University
through tribal curation.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.670
And you'll hear more
about all aspects

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.950
of that a little later
in this presentation.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.730
Last year, Donald Soctomah,
to my far left,

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.870
won the Lifetime Achievement
Award for his work

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.980
of significantly contributing
to preservation understanding

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.720
of indigenous cultural heritage.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.520
So, former winners.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.310
[ Applause ]

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:15.500
And in 2016, when all of you
I'm sure are going to be at the

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.070
on Tuesday, October 11 at the
Sheraton Grande Wild Horse resort

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.740
and spa, you will be there
obviously for the honoring ceremony

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.150
for our very own, Dr. Judith Gray,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.690
who has won the 2016 Honored
One Award from the Association

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.510
of Tribal Archives
Libraries and Museums.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:46.400
[ Applause ]

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.680
&gt;&gt; Judith Gray: I was floored.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.510
I got the word yesterday.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:55.230
So, thank you to all
and but it's you know,

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.890
in being honored this way
it's honoring the archives

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.930
and the work we do.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.730
Thank you.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:12.040
[ Applause ]

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.910
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: All right, so.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.780
Now, to the panel at hand.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.990
And I'm going to spare
you the details

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.370
of these distinguished
individuals' bios.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.000
You have them online, I'm sure
you've consulted them eagerly

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.200
over the course of
the last week or so.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.410
But starting to my
right Donald Soctomah,

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.970
from Passamaquoddy Nation in Maine.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.590
James Francis from Penobscot
Nation of Maine also.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.050 position:56%
Jane Anderson from New York
University and founder and developer

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.470
of the Traditional Knowledge Labels

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.370
through localcontext.org,
which you'll hear about.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.740
And, the aforementioned
Kim Christen who is

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.790
from Washington State University

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:53.580 position:56%
and the conceptual genius behind the
lucrative contact management system.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:59.580
So. Sorry, it's early in the
morning, I've had too much coffee.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.830
So, I'm going to turn it over
to them basically to tell you

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.960
about this project that we've
initiated called Ancestral Voices.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.940
It's a project that we
started as a pilot project

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.490
with the Passamaquoddy
Nation of Maine.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:17.040
We initiated it about, we
actually developed the program

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.940
about four years ago under the
behest of the former Library

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.040
of Congress, Dr. James Billington.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.700
And we've carried that through
in partnership with the very fine

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.190
and expert staff at the National
Audiovisual Conservation Center

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.810
out in Culpeper, Virginia.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.030
The audio engineers have
been working assiduously

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:38.800
on the collection of Jesse Walter
Fuchs is 1890 field recordings

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.100
of Passamaquoddy people.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.250
We have, you know, taken
at least the second pass

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.250 position:56%
on this particular set of materials,

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.440
but 20th-century technology
yielded reel to reel cassette,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.250
reel to reel tapes and cassettes.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.550
We have now gone back

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:58.210
and transferred those materials
using cutting edge tools in order

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.300 position:56%
to bring it into the digital domain.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.790 position:56%
And you will hear an example of that

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.840
when Donald speaks a little
later in the presentation.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:10.140 position:56%
This is a collaborative preservation
digitization and access project,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.410
which consists essentially of,
the central aspects involved,

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.420
digitally reformatting analog
media formats in order to recover

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.110
and preserve the recorded
voices of native peoples.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.750 position:56%
To be developed curatorial protocols

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.300
that address community
cultural practices

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.380
and perspectives regarding use and
access to new cultural materials,

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.770
as well as digital access tools

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.710
that embed Native American cultural
knowledge about and descriptions

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.330
of the content of recordings

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.420
and library collection
records to the extent possible.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.440
I'm going to shoot forgo for now
that we're talking about the work

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.520
that the library has done in
terms of digitization materials,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.630
but to tell you a little
bit about the technology

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.030
and have these folks explain

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.830
in their own words what the digital
tools enable us to do in terms

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.880
of providing an interface
between the library archives

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.190
such as ourselves,
and native peoples.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:05.720
Without necessarily calling into
question our own methodologies.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.700
It must be said that there's
a certain amount of agility

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.130
which external parties can employ
in terms of digital technologies

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.310
which the library, for many
reasons is not able to do.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.610
Not for lack of trying.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.580
But that's just the way
the technology works

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.880
to a certain extent.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.300
And one of the things
which is amazing to me,

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.980
is that of all the resources of
the library are brought to bear

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.850
on projects such as this,
as you know, as Lyntha

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.690
and Terry Eiler were
saying yesterday,

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.530
these materials have
been lying around,

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.820
and to paraphrase my colleague
John Bishop's evocative words

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.180
in a lead line vault somewhere
out in Culpeper, Virginia.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.070
And 40 years later they're able
to see the fruits of their work

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.860
through the digitization project

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.150
that Ann Hoog has been
championing here

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.320 position:56%
at the library of the field surveys.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.080
Likewise, the materials
which have been,

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:58.270
the Fuchs recordings have
a much older genealogy.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.200 position:56%
But again, in the 21st century we're
now able to hear some of the fruits

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.530 position:56%
of that digitization work and bring
1890s recordings up to date in 2016.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.370
Which I think is pretty
fabulous, I mean 126 years

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.580
after the fact is a pretty
interesting stretch of time.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.040
So, this project's envision
is a proof of concept.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:23.200
It's already bearing fruit and I'm
going to just cut myself off there

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.900
and turn it over to Kim who is
going to start the proceedings.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.510
And we're going to go through with
Kim, Jane, James, and then Donald.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.810
Take it away, Kim.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.350
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: Okay,
thank you, Guha.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.260
I am on. Thank you and Niki

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.030
and Betsy wherever you
are for the invitations.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.160 position:56%
And a big congratulations to Judith.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.600
It's a well-deserved award
and I know you were one

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.130
of the first people I met here
at the Library of Congress

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.220
and you've been, I know you've
just been working tirelessly

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.080
on this stuff so, congratulations,
well deserved.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.140
So, I am going to talk
about Mukurtu CMS,

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.070
which is a content
management system,

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.380
in just a moment, as Guha said.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.780
But I sort of also
want to frame this.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:07.540
Ad we'll get talking about the
larger project, and my piece in it

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.710 position:56%
in talking about Mukurtu, but I want
to sort of frame that in thinking

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.950
about sort of practices
of representation.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.260
Where Mukurtu comes from.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.370
We didn't, just sort of it
didn't come out of thin air.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:23.470
So, how is it that these histories
of colonialism, and display,

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:29.530
and archiving been interrupted by
indigenous peoples in many ways.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.600
And so, I want to talk
about that first.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.160
As you can see here, in Australia,
aboriginal practices of masking,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.780 position:56%
deleting or defaming images, objects
and artifacts are quite common.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:46.990
This was, I first saw in Australia
in, I believe this was in 1995

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.520
at Leroux, because an
elder had passed away.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.150 position:56%
The community members had gone in
with duct tape, as you can see here,

00:20:55.150 --> 00:21:01.750
much to the dismay of some of
the non-aboriginal curators.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:07.120
So, you can see this sort of very
physical masking in public places.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.940
And this has been taken
into the digital realm.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.730
We can see that, now you know it's
very common at least in Australia

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.860
to have these sorts of
warnings that you'll see

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.050
on websites, on books, on TVs.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:29.640
This one says, this may cause
sadness and distress to aboriginal

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.060
and Torres Strait Islander people.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.310
So, it's warning you
before, if you want to go.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.940 position:56%
Do you not want to see these images.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.750
In Canada, the Musqueam
Indian Band's online place,

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.160
name and archive exhibit
requires visitors

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.990
to accept their terms for viewing.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.110
And I love this because it's
a twist on terms of service.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.340
This is their terms for
viewing Musqueam places

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.320
and hearing Musqueam
stories in the Halkomelem?

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.560
language. So, you actually have to
accept, and only upon accepting,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.160
which includes being respectful and
then not reproducing any portion

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.460
of the site without permission.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.630
But it starts that you're actually,
you know you're obliged to act

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.180
in a certain way by
accepting these terms.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.550 position:56%
And so, I think whoever came up with

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.930
that in the Musqueam Indian Band
also deserves an award I think.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:24.210
Once you do click in, you
can still only see some

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.370
of the content, videos and maps.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.320
And you will hear them in
the Halkomelem language.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.720
And sometimes not translated into
English, which is another thing

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.020
that you'll find on sites.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:38.010 position:56%
It's that very disruption of what
most internet viewers are expecting,

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.440
is oh, I'm going to
hear it in this language

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.230
and then I'll be able
to understand it.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.730
Well, no you won't.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.380
Or you can go and talk to
somebody and learn about it.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.040
At the Northwestern Museum of
Art and Culture in Spokane,

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.320
where I work there is, I don't
work at the Northwestern Museum Art

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.000
and Culture, but in Spokane,
there's a room where access

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.580
to some materials are
restricted to the general public.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.170
So, you can see sacred
room restricted access.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:08.140
So, all of these, these are just a
small sampling of what's out there

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.850
when you start to look for
these sort of interruptions

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.600
to our viewing practices.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.580
They're sort of, they're
visual reminders of that sort

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.270
of really tactile material
and embodied ethical practice

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:26.190
about not seeing, and not retelling
or retelling in a different way.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.680
And all of those, I think call
into question our assumptions

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.580
about knowledge acquisition.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.880
How we learn.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.500
We should be able to see to learn.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.710
Especially in archives,
museums and libraries.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.970
These are very visual
and oral places.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.890
And we're expecting
those things to be open.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:46.400
So, what these actually help
us think differently though

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.790
about the circulation and access
of content in archival collections

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.550
and when they are digitized.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:57.450
So, Mukurtu CMS fits into
this landscape of interruption

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:01.780
and different modes of access and
circulation by providing a tool

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.560
that allows communities, however
those communities are defined,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.440
to use their own protocols
for viewing, sharing

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.570
and managing digital materials.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.640
Mukurtu is the Warumungu
word for dillybag.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.010
And the dillybag traditionally
held sacred items.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.940
And the elders had to
open up the dillybag

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.000
for the younger generations.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.610
But the younger generations also
had to ask and elicit those.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.270
And so, it's about a conversation.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.660
It wasn't about opening
up or keeping closed,

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.160
it was about that conversation.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.040
A dialogue and sharing
cultural knowledge

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.310
between generations about respect.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.270
And so, it was by the
Warumungu elder that I worked

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:44.990
with Michael Jampin Jones, said the
dillybag is a safekeeping place.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:48.970
And he also wanted Mukurtu, the
system we created in 2009 to be

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.960
that same sort of safekeeping
place that invites dialogue.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.760
That invites conversation.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.130
That's about sharing, but
sharing in a proper way.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:05.100
And so, flash forward 8 years
later, Mukurtu is now at a 2.0.5

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.610
as of three weeks ago release.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.680
Only those of you in the throes
of software releases know

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.670 position:56%
that that really matters in any
kind of way, but yeah us [laughter].

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:22.010 position:56%
And is see out in the audience,
too, a shout out to the multiple NEH

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:26.940
and possibly IMLS maybe program
officers who have been with us

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.360
from the beginning, Joel
Ruhl [assumed spelling]

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.280
and others, thank you very much.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.030
We were funded initially by an NEH
startup grant, and have been funded

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:37.310
by IMLS over the last few years.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.680
And also, Library of Congress and
AFC and Guha were one of the first

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.700
to jump onto this notion,
well how do we do this?

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.640
How do we think about this
in this other context?

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.210
So, Mukurtu is now a free
and open source piece

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.760
of software that's now
totally configurable.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.680 position:56%
So, it started out for one community
in the outback of Australia,

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.780
800 people serving a very specific
need, with very specific protocols.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.510
So, how do we take that and scale
that up so anyone can use that,

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:08.390
any community can use that in
conversation and in dialogue

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.340
with other institutions with
national repositories, etcetera.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.830
Because what we found, and what
indigenous communities already knew

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.620
is that a lot of those
collections are out.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.920
They're in other places.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.480
That's the history of colonialism
that we're talking about.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.490
The history of collection
is the history

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.930
of colonialism, right full-stop.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.410
So, how do we start there?

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.280
Yes, how do we start there?

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.590
So, how do we return these and
return these in respectful ways.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.100
So, the basis of Mukurtu
then is what we sort

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.000
of lovingly call the three C's.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.300
So, within Mukurtu,
there are communities.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.700 position:56%
So, you can define those communities
any way, then we'll hear from James

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.610
and Donald and their work
about thinking of this

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.150
in their own communities.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.510
Communities can be
2 people, 50 people,

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.430
500, 5000; it doesn't matter.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.300
They're defined however
you want to within Mukurtu,

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.430
nothing comes predefined.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.730
The second thing is
these cultural protocols.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.530
So, the communities
are the who of Mukurtu,

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.830
the cultural protocols are the how.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.130
And this is where it happens.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.160
How do you want those
material accessed?

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.430
So, we've seen lots of different
cultural protocols over the years

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:24.350
from communities, gender, kin,
clans, medicine societies.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.740
And now that we're working with
more tribal museums and archives,

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.370
we're also seeing things
like to be vetted,

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:33.780
or tribal council,
or you know curators.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.660
And then those can be layered.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.040
And so, you could have one
particular image, or a song,

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.020
or a video that might only be
able to be heard or seen by women

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.730
from a certain clan at
a certain time of year.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.920
So, it can get to that
really granular level

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.890
of access between open and closed.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.530
And this happens for every
piece of content within Mukurtu.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.590
Everything has to have a
community and a protocol.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.940
There is no default.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.880
And then, finally categories.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.270
The categories are
the what of Mukurtu.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:09.410
And so, we don't have
any predefined system

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.020
within Mukurtu for categorization.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.390
So, librarians and
archivists close your ears,

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.970
I know that hurts your
head to think about,

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.860
there are no controlled
vocabularies in there.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.780
You, communities can,
if they want use Library

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.490
of Congress subject headings,
but we found very early

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.690
on that those don't work.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:33.540
That a one bucket for Indians of
the Pacific Northwest does not work

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.210
for the range of communities.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:40.980 position:56%
So, how? It's very important also to
turn that history again on its head.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:45.850
And so, within Mukurtu, you
can customize these in any way.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.590
So, let me give you an example.

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.820
This comes from the
Plateau People's Web Portal

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.600
that Guha mentioned earlier.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.820
We're in our eighth year now of
the Plateau People's Web Portal.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.170
We work with the Northwest
Museum of Art and Culture.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:03.250
And this is in the Warm
Springs community in Oregon.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:07.450
And they choose this
bag to be digitized.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.250 position:56%
So, you can see we have the
Northwest Museum of Art and Culture.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.920
This is their metadata that came.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.420
This is all anybody knew about this
basket at the museum, obviously.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.090
And it's very sort of
standard museum metadata.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:27.320
And the text says, "a round
twine cylindrical cornhusk bag."

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.620
That's great.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.920
I'm okay with that.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.840
You know, if that's
as much as we have.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.340
However, after consultation
with the Warm Springs community,

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.670
they added their own record.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.680
So, visually, you see I just
moved from one tab to the other.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.130
It's not hierarchical,
it's not a comment.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.180
It's another record.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:48.690 position:56%
And in this record, now, the Warm
Springs record, we have their title.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:52.190
It's not a root basket, it's
actually the duck basket.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.530
We have their protocol.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.980
This actually says Warm
Springs Public Access.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.630
So, public is not a default.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:02.070
The protocol has to
be added to the item.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.680
And that's very purposeful
on our part.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.560
Because public is one
way of sharing only.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.670
And the Warm Springs actually
have about eight protocols,

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.730
but I'm only showing you the
public access ones obviously.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.550
And then they have their TK
label, which Jane will talk

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.110
about later, so I'm not going to.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.640
But then you can see here,
there's a cultural narrative,

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.320
and an oral history that
was given by three members

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.760
of the Warm Springs community.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:33.030
And in addition to that we
have a video that they created.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:38.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, to me this
looks like a legend on this bag.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:46.790
After you got it and
see that this is there,

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.480
[foreign word] for legendary.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.070
Then [foreign word] the ducks.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:58.780
Back in those days, you know,
the people themselves argued

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.850
over how the duck made its sound.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:10.170
And they says, no it goes like this
[clucking]; the other one says,

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:15.540
child, no it goes like
this [growling].

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:24.730
And, a coyote was listening to
them, pretty soon they separated

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:29.470
and the people divided
up because the ones

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.520
that agreed this is the way
the duck makes its sound

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.880
and others said no its this way.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:42.350
So, they divided up and left,
went and lived somewhere else.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: My grandpa
used to say that one

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.750
of these days I know I'm going
to go north and I'm going

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.520
to hear Wasco people talking

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.940
and it will be our long-lost
relatives [laughter].

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: See,
there they are talking.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: They're
talking [laughter].

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:07.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You'll need
to take a picture of that

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:11.110
and tell a story like
that [laughter].

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.930
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: So, this ends up
being really expanding the record.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.820
You get so much more
than that root twine bag.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.780
And that's really what
this is about.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.990
And I know Guha, I'm going to stop.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.960
I just wanted to say, that this
is really about the relationships.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.140
This happened over eight years.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.590
Again, thank you to NEH

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.250
for continued unfunded
extensions of our grant.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.750
But because it is really about
building these relationships.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.580
You don't walk in and
sit down with elders,

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.280
and they're going to
tell you a story.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.990
This was over eight years.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:46.720
And so, the work of this, although
the digital seems really fast,

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.020
it's not really fast.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.320
And that's okay.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.620
It's slow.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.170
If we have ten of these,
we have, well I'm not even

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:57.310
when people ask me about;
anyways, I'm going to stop now.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:58.610
So, I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:59.910
Sorry, sorry.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:01.630
Okay. So.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.040
[ Applause ]

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.340
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you, Kim.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.000
I think it calls into question one
of the tenants of archival practice

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.560
which has been a fashion lately

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.610
about the more product
less process methodology.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.290
And I, for one, have never been
comfortable with that notion.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:21.050
I think what Kim and folks
up here; Jane, and James,

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:24.580
and Donald will tell you about is
that the process is everything.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.620
No matter how long it takes.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.010
And that certainly holds
true as Judith as pointed

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.770
out for the extensive
consultation which the library did

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:35.200 position:56%
over the course of its time with the
Federal Cylinder Project and beyond,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.810
thanks to the vision, and
the work of Alan Jabbour

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.150
and other people here
at the library.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:41.920
That ends my two-minute sermonizing

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.050
for the library and
on to Jane Anderson.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.350
Jane, take it away.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.650
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson: Okay,
thank you, Guha.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.380
Again, thank you so much for
the invitation to be here.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.440
To Betsy and to Niki and
congratulations to Judith.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.210
It's an amazing honor.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.760
It's a privilege to be here.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.830
What I'm going to talk about is one
little piece of this larger complex

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:06.430
that really illustrates
just how much collections

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:08.470
of indigenous material
are different.

00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:11.910
And they're different, and they
need a different kind of politics

00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:15.590
of care, and politics
of engagement as well.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.980
So, if we think about the
conditions under which a lot

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.320
of this material was collected,
we also have to acknowledge,

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.920 position:56%
as Kim mentioned from the beginning,

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.390
that those conditions
were uneven and unequal.

00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:27.030
The research practices
that were in place

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:30.530
at that time did not
allow indigenous names

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.040
to be necessarily included
in catalog entries.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.950
But, the part that I'm going to
focus on, which is where I come

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:37.910
into it is around the
intellectual property rights,

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.910
around the copyright.

00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:43.030
The way in which copyright has
historically actually functioned

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.230 position:56%
as a tool of exclusion that is meant

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.300
that indigenous people
are not the owners

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.030
of this material to start with.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:53.370
And therefore, now in the present
have very difficult challenges

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:57.390
in terms of setting conditions
for access and for circulation.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:03.530
So, one of the kind of
encounters that we have

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.780
with intellectual property law is

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:11.160 position:56%
that because researchers were the
ones with the equipment and the ones

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.750
who did a lot of the
documentation, they became kind

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.570
of accidental owners
is how I term this.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.590 position:56%
They didn't necessarily know that
they were going to become the owners

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.390
of this material, the
legal rights holders just

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:24.880
because they pressed play
on the sound recordings,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.000
or that they took the photographs.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.340
That's an accidental kind
of copyright ownership.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.300
And copyright is largely just
interested in what the content is.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.670
It's kind of just how that
body of law functions.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.470
And what adds to that
complication in the present is

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:42.090
that copyright law has very
distinct forms of protection

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:43.960
for different kinds of materials.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.980
So, for instance, photographs are
protected for some period of time.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.470
Sound recording are protected
for another period of time.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.760
Manuscripts are protected
for another period of time.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.280
So, if you're from an indigenous
community coming to deal

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.540
with one person's collection,
which is largely made

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.720
up of sound recordings, photographs
and manuscripts, you're dealing

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.260
with quite complicated areas
of copyright law that you have

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.590
to then navigate and negotiate.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:09.230 position:56%
So, for example, in the United
States, just as kind of one example,

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.700
and that really matters for kind
of the issue of sound recordings

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.000
that we've been discussing.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.340
Sound recordings are
largely protected until 2067.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.760
So, even the earliest sound
recordings, that we're going

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.520
to be talking about
today, from 1893,

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.940
are still under protection
until 2067.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.550
That is an inordinately long period
of time to having to be thinking

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.210
about what that protection
means, to be getting permission

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:35.880 position:56%
and to be negotiating that kind of
term of copyright protection period.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:40.100 position:56%
So, the intervention that we came up
with and it was largely in response

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:44.280
to this problem of who owns the
materials and what does that mean

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.110
for control, and for access and
circulation, was to think initially

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.410
about coming up with a set

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:53.330
of very specific licenses
for indigenous material.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:57.250
And this just kind of came
out of the Mukurtu project.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.690
It was an issue that
came up for communities

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:02.960
that were having their material
returned back into Mukurtu.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.890
But we kind of struck a
rather significant problem

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.760
in that first iteration
of developing this project

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.450
around the traditional licenses.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:14.040
And that was that indigenous
communities largely don't own

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.340
that material.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.640
And if you don't own that material,

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.940
you can't create a
license around it.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:23.080 position:56%
And so instead of kind of putting
our efforts into developing licenses

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.890
that would only serve,
perhaps 10% of material

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.230
that we were dealing with.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:30.450
We kind of took a detour and came
up with another intervention,

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.030
which is a social and
educational intervention.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.840
It's not a legal intervention.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.700
But it is to deal with the
problem that nearly 90%

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.160
of the material we're
dealing with is not owned

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.980
by indigenous communities and
yet there is still a need to deal

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.260
with those problems of authorship,
and ownership and circulation

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.610 position:56%
in a way that kind of counters these
historical legacies of exclusion.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.250
And so, we came up with
the Traditional Knowledge

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.190
Labels Project.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:00.330
So, local context is the
platform that we established,

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.610
which is kind of, it's
got two purposes.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:06.930
The first is kind of an educational
framework, education in terms

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.230
of providing information

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.810
about intellectual property
law, about copyright.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.840
Giving kind of people capacity to
make informed decisions about when

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.880
to use copyright, or when
not to use copyright.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.290 position:56%
What do the terms of copyright mean.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.180
There's a whole educational
resources section,

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.220
that we are slowly,
slowly developing.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.970
And I should also say this project
has just received an amazing grant

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:30.640
from the NEH, so we're
incredibly grateful for that

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.270
in order to keep it moving along.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:36.140
And so, the first part
of the local context is

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.040
to provide these educational
resources, to provide tutorials

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.340
to help people understand.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.450
Because copyright is a
complicated area of law.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.320
It's a complicated area
of law for everybody,

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.830
not just indigenous communities.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.590
So, we were trying to really find
that way to provide those resources

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.780
that can be really used usefully.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.080
But the second part

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.990
of the intervention are these
traditional knowledge labels.

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:58.800
And they're probably the most
exciting part of this project.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.170
At the moment, we have 13
labels that we've developed,

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.840
though James we recently were
working with James with Penobscot

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.900
and there's another two labels
that we're going to develop out of

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.810
that work, which James is going to
talk a little bit about, presently.

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:15.110 position:56%
But what's interesting about the
labels is because they're not legal,

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:18.920
we're allowed a little flexibility
in what we can kind of label.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.760
And they really, we might want

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.720
to see the labels as
external protocols.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.740
So, we have labels for attribution.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.570
Attribution allow names to
come back into the record.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.740
So, so much of these collections,

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.410
they have not got indigenous
names with them.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.810
Either the name of the community,
or the name of the individuals

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:39.110
who were actually recorded.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.040
You might find that
way down in the notes.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.370
But it's not at the top when
you actually are searching

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:45.670
for that material.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.690
We have a label for
different kinds of uses.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:54.220
So, so much about these labels is
less that they're used internally,

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.630
though they are used internally

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:58.200
to help communities
navigate this material

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.780
within a system like Mukurtu.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.380
And you saw the TK
attribution label.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.040
They're really for external users

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.510
who encounter indigenous
material in all kinds of context.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:13.220
We have an outreach label
that is largely about sharing,

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.610
conditions of sharing, what
do those conditions look like?

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:21.730
When we initially imagined this
project, we had a sense that we,

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.280
what we would create on
local context was kind

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.910
of a template, a guide.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.040
What could you use this label for.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.300
I mean, also at a theoretical
level we were struck with a dilemma

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:35.490
of how do you standardize something
at the same time as allowing

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:38.980
for the unique expression
of community, ideals,

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.680
and decision making
within that label itself.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.980
And I'm going to show
you and example

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.760
of how that's kind of working.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:48.160
But this is kind of the
framework that we developed.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.380
It allows you to kind of see
why would you use this label,

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.680
and the TK label description.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.200
And for this one, for attribution,
and again, it's important

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.820
that it's not authorship, it's
important that it's not ownership.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:02.630
And we're really seeking to kind
of like again, twist these ideas

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:05.020
of what attribution and
authorship and authority

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.360
over cultural material is.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:11.300
And this labeled description
reads, this label, I can't see it.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.670
So, this label is being used
to correct historical mistakes

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.070
or exclusions pertaining
to this material.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.370
This is especially in relationship
to the names of the people involved

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:24.940
in performing or making this
work and/or correctly naming the

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.170
community from which
it originally derives.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.630
As a user, you are being asked to
also apply the correct attribution

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.110
in any future use of this work.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:37.120
So, you can see that it's kind
of a very specific intervention

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:42.970 position:56%
into the practices of citation, into
the practices of excluding names

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:45.920
in the way in which this material
is circulated into the future.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.350
So, this is a community
that we've been working

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:52.170
with for several years
now in British Columbia.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:53.560
This is the language.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.370
This material is we've been
working with for several years now.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.820
This is a Scowlitz band of
the Sto:lo First Nation.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:01.360
And they created a website that
they wanted to tell their story

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.750
of the history of archeology.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.660
And you can see at the top,
as part of their website,

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:09.460
they decided they wanted to
use, they chose full labels

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.660
from the suite of 13 that we have,
that help people navigate the site

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:18.080
and understand what Scowlitz
perspectives of user engagement

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.050
with their content could be.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.770
Again, it's asking people
to slow down and to kind

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:26.120
of take a different way of
understanding how you engage

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.850
with digital content
in this kind of way

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:32.360
in which we consume it so quickly.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:38.040
So, what we do with the TK
labels is we create workshops

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.700
that allow communities to define
these labels in their own terms.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:46.110
And this is the definition
that the Scowlitz came up with

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:47.990
for attribution, [foreign word].

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:55.150 position:56%
And you can see this is the; they've
decided to use their language,

00:42:55.150 --> 00:43:00.210
Halkomelem, as the rerouting
point to start thinking out of.

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:02.110 position:56%
And this is kind of what they wrote.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.090
This website represents
the true knowledge

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:05.980
and history of Scowlitz people.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.870
The attribution label, which really
means naming place in our language.

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:12.800
We ask everyone that visits this
website to attribute our knowledge

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.230
and histories to us, the Scowlitz
First Nation, the tribe of Sto:lo.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:19.790
Our history has not always been
respected or told correctly.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:22.130
Here, we tell our own
story in our own words.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:23.880
We are both holders and caretakers

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.470
of our own land, resources
and histories.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:29.130
It is the responsibilities of
our families and communities,

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:32.820
as Sto:lo people to take care of
these things in a respectful way.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.140 position:56%
Please feel free to contact us with
further questions about attribution.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.880
So, in that website which is
going to be launched in October,

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:46.390
I believe, I mean it's had so
much consultation involved in it,

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:48.280
so it's kind of slowly
being assembled,

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.660
but it's an amazing website,

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.820
where you can really see how
they've actually put these labels

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.500
on their content and really
asking people for a different kind

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.480 position:56%
of understanding of how this
material could be used, and accessed

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.230
and circulated on the
Scowlitz terms.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.070
And that's kind of
what these labels do.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:05.710
They reorient the terms
of engagement.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:10.080
I'm not going to talk to you much
about this, sorry, audio people.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:14.410
The project that we're
working on with Donald is

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:17.000
around the Jesse Fuchs' material.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.770
Again, you can tell from the
way in which we're talking

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:24.390
that Jesse Fuchs becomes the
primary indicator of the author,

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:27.380
rather than the speakers that,
the Passamaquoddy speakers

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.980
that were the people who
actually shared this material,

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.840
and shared the songs, and
shared the spoken word.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:38.010
What we're seeking to do here is
to kind of reroute the record,

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:42.930
in particular ways, add
important material back

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.380
into the marked record changes.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.390
This is kind of a markup
of some of the places

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:48.220
where that change will happen.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.320
And then this is a markup of
where those labels will be placed

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.140
within the kind of Library
of Congress catalog system.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:58.690
This is a markup on actually the
Omaha material, but we had to kind

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:01.560
of move through different kind of
spaces to have this negotiated.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:06.070 position:56%
But just to give you a sense of what
having that label in there starts

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:10.510
to do and what it starts
to look like.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:14.160
We also have developing an
adapter that allows communities

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.160
to develop their own labels
without us being present,

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.080
which is really important.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.180
We don't have time
to discuss that now.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.510
I'll kind of hand over to James.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:30.630
[ Applause ]

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.930
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you, Jane.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:35.310
This is a very exciting
development, as we all know.

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:39.130
And perhaps during the middle of
the discussion we can get Niki,

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:41.300
and or Maggie or other people
who have been working on it

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.230
from the library end to comment
on what it means for the library

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:48.060
to incorporate these
sorts of attributions

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.360
into our own catalog record.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.800
It's a significant develop.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.440
And again, paid party
political announcement,

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.670
I think it's really significant
that the National Library

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.850
of the United States,
is to undertaking this

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.570
as a first step among lots
of other different cultural

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:02.870
heritage agencies.

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:05.030
So, yeah for us.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:08.460
Now, Mr. James Francis.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:09.760
&gt;&gt; James Francis: Well, apparently,

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.780
I don't have a slide
for myself [laughter].

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:16.880
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: I can add one in
while you're talking [laughter].

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:20.090
&gt;&gt; James Francis: So, just a
little bit about our community

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:25.090
and how we kind of; who lived, give
us some context about why we kind

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:26.950
of move forward the way we do.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:32.310
We were a very mobile
society, moving seasonally

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:37.770
across the landscape in a very
sophisticated, migratory pattern.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:41.660
And when fall would come and
into the into the winter months,

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.970
we would gather in kinship groups.

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:49.170
So, you were with your family;
matrilineal, and with your family.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.810
And it was during those
winter moons when stories

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.340 position:56%
and oral histories were passed down.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.780
And so, what happens and when
you start looking at the history

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.260
of our community from
our community they come

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.960
down through familial lines.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.130 position:56%
They come down through family lines.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:10.800
And so, when you fast-forward to
today when you have a cultural

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.870 position:56%
and historic preservation department
which I am the director of,

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:18.600
it's not about us like
gathering up all this information

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.110
and holding all this information.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:23.580
Because that's outside
of the cultural norm,

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:27.160
because this information
falls within family lines

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.080
and it belongs to those families.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:34.100
But, how do we, as a
department, foster and help share

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.980
that information with
the broader community.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:44.360
And so, given the Mukurtu really
gave us this really safe platform

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:49.160
to be able to set the
protocols, you know, on our terms.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.940
Whether it's, you know,
familiar lines;

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.780
if they want to share
it outside of that.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.140 position:56%
But one of the things that we did
when we sat down and started looking

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:02.520
at the TK labels was to create
a community voice label.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:07.530
And what we really are looking
and excited about with Mukurtu is

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:13.540
to take a historic photo collection
that we have, and also photos

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:19.220
of material culture and
really start to elicit

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.520
from the community
voice about that stuff.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:26.720 position:56%
You know, it isn't up to the Culture
and Historic Preservation Department

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.770
to be the be-all end-all of all
information about Penobscot.

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:32.460
We want a community voice.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:39.750
We want to hear from you know, my
grandmother, or their grandmother,

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:43.850
or just people living in
California who are tribal members.

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:47.120
And this digital platform
allows us to do that.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:52.290
And to share, safely, a story that
is very intimate to your family.

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:54.590
And only share it with
either your family,

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:58.160
or with the broader
Penobscot community.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.520
And so, what happens over time is
these stories start to snowball.

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:08.030
And we start to, we start to have
our history unfolding before us.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:11.940
And so, it's a really
exciting time for us.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:19.210
Because you know, we're
starting to hear these stories

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.780
that haven't been told
for a long time.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.180
You know, oftentimes, we
got criticized by, you know,

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:28.890
ethnographers that there's
three different versions

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:31.190
of that same story,
which one's right.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:33.190 position:56%
Well, there's three different
versions, because they probably came

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:35.000
through three different families.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.610
And none of them are wrong.

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:39.910
They're all correct.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:42.190
They all hold that
core belief system.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:47.630
You know the beautiful thing about
oral history is that it's told

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:50.570
by an elder to a younger.

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:53.890
And then, that younger holds
that story for his whole life,

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:56.800
before he becomes an
elder and retells that.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.510
But when he does retell that,

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:03.070
that story has his life
experience woven into it.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:07.460
He uses examples that are
relevant to his contemporaries.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:11.190
He uses language that are
relevant to his contemporaries.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:15.830
So, as oral histories are passed
down through time, they evolve

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:18.060
and change with the people.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.270
That core belief is always there.

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:21.570
You know, people ask, you know,

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.350
do you still have oral
stories in your community?

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:26.390
And I always say absolutely.

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:30.610
They may not look like you know
[inaudible] and the moose stories,

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:36.180
but that same understanding about
what you need to hunt to get food

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.010
for your family are
passed down within,

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:40.990 position:56%
from the lines within our community.

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:44.960
And that's the core belief
of what oral stories do.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:49.880
And what's great about
Mukurtu and the TK labels is

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:56.300
that this has given us a digital
presence, a safe digital presence.

00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:00.380
And I stress the safe
because you know,

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:05.610
in our communities we're
often guarded about,

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:08.900
you know, archives and sharing.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.880
Because so much take, take, take,
take, take, take, take, take, take,

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:18.980 position:56%
take, take has been happening in
our communities and it's time for us

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.830 position:56%
to protect ourselves and protect
our stories, you know, on our terms.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:27.490
And Mukurtu and the
TK labels are exactly

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:30.770
that tool that's going
to allow us to do that.

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:35.530
And while meeting our community
members where they're at

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.100
and where we're all at
these days are in front

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:42.170
of a screen looking
at digital material.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.350
So, that's all I have to say.

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:47.610
I just wanted to thank
these lovely ladies

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:53.010
for bringing this technology
to the communities.

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.140
It's changing our community
for the better.

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.940
Thank you.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:02.090
[ Applause ]

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:03.390
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you, James.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:06.110
Parenthetically, I'll note
that both Donald and James,

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:10.700
and other native committee members
will be here this week visiting the

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.190
archives at the American
Folklife Center.

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:14.490
Also, our colleagues

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:15.830
in the manuscript division
here at the library.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:18.730
But also going out to our
friends and colleagues

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:21.090
at the National Anthropological
Archives of the Smithsonian

00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:23.820
and the Museum of the
American Indian.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:27.950 position:56%
So, it's an honor, and a pleasure
and a privilege to host these folks.

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:32.320
And now, we come to Mr.
Donald Soctomah, sir.

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:38.310
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah: [Foreign
word] Good morning to everybody.

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:40.830
Thank you.

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:44.360
I'm really honored to be here.

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:52.790
I'm really honored to be
engaged in this activity,

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:57.340
because it's bringing voice
back to our community.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:02.550
About 100 years ago, our
community was 100% fluent,

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:09.470
today in the language 10% of our
population are fluent speakers

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.690
in the Passamaquoddy language.

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:19.590
But the life expectancy in
our tribe is right around 50.

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:25.430
And, so we have a problem with our
fluent speakers are really dying

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:28.050
at a fast rate.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:33.690
So, that makes our job more
important, because we have to reach

00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:39.040
out to the community in
a short amount of time.

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:43.880
We recently had a man
pass on, he was 99.

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:47.430
And he was the leader

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:51.710
of the language revitalization
in our community.

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:53.970
And he eventually, with help,

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:59.410
developed the first Passamaquoddy
dictionary which is online.

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:03.310
It's an audio dictionary.

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:07.160
But he was our link to
these wax cylinders.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:11.770
Ninety-nine, his godfather was one

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:15.140
of the speakers in
the wax cylinders.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:19.180
So, we were able to, just
by listening to him talk,

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:22.590
tell us exactly what he was saying.

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:25.420 position:56%
Because in 100 years, voices change.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:30.370
A hundred years ago French
was our second language.

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:33.270
So, when somebody speaking
Passamaquoddy they're going

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.310
to have a little French accent.

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:40.350
Well, today pretty much English
has taken over everything.

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:43.910
And the accent is a
little bit different.

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:48.820
So, if you don't know
that you sort of get lost

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:51.950
in the wax cylinder recordings.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:58.200
So, it's a real treasure for these
to come back to the community.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:04.330
A hundred years ago, not only
our language was declining,

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:08.410
but our ways to go underground.

00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:15.120
I was interviewing this elder
one time and she told me,

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:19.640
she said when the lights
went out at the convent,

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:25.100
we'd go to the tribal hall
and start to play the drum,

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.550
and would sing the old songs.

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:32.220
And then, they'd do
that about once a week.

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:37.640
It was safety for them to do that.

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:41.980
And it just showed me how strong
our culture is and how, you know,

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:46.120
we have to keep pushing
forward to save the culture.

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:50.840
Because they had to do it
because they'd be punished.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.160
They'd be punished for
singing the old songs.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:56:00.700
They'd be punished by not getting
food or being looked down upon.

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:05.460
As I was growing up in the 1960s,

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.870
there were still traditional
families in our community

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:12.080
that practiced their own way.

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.980
And people from the church
would call them witches.

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:20.190
So, it was a way of looking
down upon those people.

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:24.890
But they continued to push
forward and here we are, you know,

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:29.190
those people are leaders
in our culture,

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:31.850 position:56%
because they kept that cultural way.

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:35.360
So, it goes with the
wax cylinder recordings.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:38.590
The wax cylinder recordings,

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:41.550
some of the songs almost
disappeared in our community.

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:47.450
The elders remembered bits
and pieces of the song.

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:50.260
They say, I remember that
when I was little, you know.

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:52.150
And then when we're able

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:57.260
to hear these wax cylinders,
they broke out in song.

00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:01.380
And we have an example
here, are two examples.

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.750
One of the snake song
from the wax cylinder.

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:07.210
If you haven't heard wax cylinder
recordings that were recorded

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:12.990
in the 1890s, these were the first
field recordings of wax cylinders.

00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:14.290
So, yeah, lets.

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:15.590
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: Do you
want me to play that?

00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:16.890
Yeah. I think it needs to go off

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:26.280
of the folk life grand
here for a minute.

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.970
Okay.

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:32.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Make
song and description

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:33.730
by Newel Georgia [assumed spelling]

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:35.530
of the Passamaquoddy tribe
[inaudible], March the 18th 1890.

00:57:35.530 --> 00:58:32.840
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:37.070
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah:
So, you know, this is,

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:41.820
today this is played
during our ceremonial days.

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:44.630
The snake song is a
very powerful song.

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:47.040
A lot of the tribes
across the nation

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.940
and in Canada do the snake dance.

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:55.210
And the snake is a
very powerful creature.

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:57.090
And I want you to hear.

00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:02.870
One of our singers heard
the song for the first time,

00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:07.920
and thoughts of her youth, and
thoughts of hearing bits and pieces

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:13.440
of the song came back and
she broke out into a song.

00:59:14.510 --> 01:00:43.050
[ Singing in Foreign Language ]

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:49.190
You'll have to excuse my
singing in the background,

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:51.970
I didn't realize I was singing.

01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:55.550
I'll remember not to sing that.

01:00:55.550 --> 01:01:00.700
But, so what I'm doing with
the wax cylinder recordings,

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.700 position:56%
is I'm taking them to the community,

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:06.730
we're having group
listening sessions.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:11.520
And some of our younger singers
that can't speak the language,

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.050
but they understand music,
they're taking the beat.

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:18.290
The beat is really important.

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:22.520
And then, they're learning
the language to fill that in.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:28.090
And it's making the complete
circle like I spoke to before

01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:30.720
about the circle, how it comes

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.260
around it comes back
to the community.

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.920
Now, we have our ancestors
from 1890 speaking to us.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.350
You know that's really
powerful, really powerful.

01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:47.060
And you wouldn't believe, but
some of the people, you know,

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:51.860
the older people break down and
cry when they hear the songs

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:55.830
of their great-great-grandfather,
or the stories

01:01:55.830 --> 01:01:58.570
that they heard bits
and pieces of before.

01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:03.280
So, the labels are going to be
powerful on this too because some

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.270
of these songs are only
meant for certain ceremonies.

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:10.120
Some are only meant for men.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.880
Some are only meant for women.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:17.060
And then the stories; some of
the stories, what I'm afraid

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:22.200
of is somebody might hear the
story and write a book about it.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.280
And then they claim
ownership of the story.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.710
You know, that's happened before.

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:33.410
One of our neighboring tribes the
Maliseet, there was a researcher

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:41.090
in their community back in the
thirties and he wrote down stories.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:45.870
He spent two years in the
community gathering stories.

01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:49.410
And he promised the community
that the stories were theirs.

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:55.370
Well, he passed on, his children
ended up having the book published.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:03:00.660
And now the Maliseets are told
you don't own these stories.

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.550
You know, that's not right.

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:11.140
So, I'm glad I have the opportunity
to come here, to talk about it.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:16.740
To work with Guha, the
Library of Congress.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:23.140
And it's really going to
bring back some of the songs,

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:26.470
some of the stories
to our community.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.270
Thank you.

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:34.030

&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you, Donald.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:36.630
Thanks to all the panel.

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:40.250
I just wanted to make note that
that particular session was filmed

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:44.100
at a community consultation
visit that Jane

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:48.420
and Kim very kindly invited me
along to in March, was it March?

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:51.560
Something like that, which was
actually quite I don't know March

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.860
or something like that.

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.160
March or April.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.200
So, we were not but
about 100 yards away

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.840
from where Jesse Walter
Fuchs recorded Little Joseph

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.540
and Peter Selmore [assumed
spelling], the two men you hear

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.280
on the recordings of
the Passamaquoddy.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.930
I thought that was a
pretty special moment.

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:13.710
I'm going to open up for questions.

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:16.530
I think I see some nodding
heads and some other people.

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:18.950
Obviously, some of the
people we'd like to hear form

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:22.190
and also again acknowledge the
support of the federal government

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:25.540
for this particular set of
projects between Kim and Jane,

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:28.950
which have a very direct
benefit to the community.

Our colleagues from NEH and IMLS.

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:35.830
So, thanks again for making the
feds look good in this day and age.

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:42.170
But, do we have, we have people
standing by with microphones,

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:44.030
and I'm happy to jump
in with questions.

01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:50.510
But, please there's two
questions right to your right.

01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:53.070
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I want to
acknowledge our visitors

01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:59.960
from Penobscot and Passamaquoddy.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:04.420
I'm working with Latin
American indigenous communities,

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.020
media production.

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.230
Mostly analog right now.

01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:13.280
And in the TK label project
I noticed there's a button

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.680
that says translate.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:19.020
So, how do we make these
best practices conveyable

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.850
to other communities?

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.190
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson: Yeah,
that's a great question Malia,

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:23.510
thanks for coming as well.

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:27.630
So, we're in the process of
actually translating them.

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:29.550
A colleague of yours Maria
Montenegro [assumed spelling],

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:34.020
who you know, who's been involved
in the translation of these labels.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:36.200
Because we have acknowledged from
the very beginning that there needs

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.860
that translation capacity
because there are large amount

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.770
of communities who would
like to use these labels.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:45.880
So, Spanish is our first language
that we're doing translation into.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:49.820
Given the enormous amounts of
material that are also held

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.600
in institutions and
in other context.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:57.200
So, I mean in many ways this
is a very, very new project.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.080
It's only four years old and
the work that we're trying

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.830
to do is you know, is
emergent in many ways,

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:08.830 position:56%
in the sense that we respond largely
to communities that we get contacted

01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:11.890
by and then we kind of build
different kinds of components

01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:14.630
that support those communities.

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:18.670
We've just been contacted by, and
why did do that Spanish translation

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:22.730
for a community in
Chile who is thinking

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:24.030
about starting to use the labels.

01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:27.390
And so, we're kind of working
closely in relationship with that.

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:30.000
Don't necessarily know what
that's going to look like yet,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.080
but it's kind of the
direction that the labels,

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.630
they tend to have their own
life, which is very interesting

01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:38.270
in how they get adapted, and
adopted and re-appropriated

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:40.020
within each context
is very different.

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.690
And we're kind of like
slowly amassing examples

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:43.990
of what that looks like.

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:45.700
Because they're really
largely in the testing phase.

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.000 position:56%
And we're still in the testing phase

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.490
of what this is and
what this can be.

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:54.280
What's very clear for us, is
how they do work for communities

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.770
in the sense that they
allow communities

01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:58.730
to express their own cultural
protocols in their own terms

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:01.880
and also in their own
languages as needed.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.510
And also, on the flipside
for institutions,

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:06.970
they give institutions a
mechanism to start dealing

01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:10.130
with these colonial legacies
that many institutions know

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.240
that they have in their collection,

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.350
but there is no real
device to get at that.

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:18.280
And so, having these labels
really functions as a means

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.620
to bringing institutions
and communities together

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.810
in a different kind of
engaged relationship.

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:28.050
But also changing these historical
practices that have been uneven.

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:30.860
They allow communities to be
at the decision-making table

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.160
in a different kind of way.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:35.810
And that's what we're really
trying to change as a practice.

01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:38.200
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: And on a
technical side with the NEH grant

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.150
that we have right now,
that we just started,

01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:43.180
so it will be another few years,
but we do have a beta version

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:48.930
of the adapter/generator,
which will allow.

01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:50.870
Because right now Jane
and I go around

01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:52.650
and then we do custom versions

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:55.120
and that model obviously
isn't sustainable

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.620
for a whole bunch of reasons.

01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:59.860
But, we do also know that
communities always ask us,

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:02.640
well who else is using this
and what have they done.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.890
So, part of the local context
website will have examples

01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:09.120
of communities who want to share
the labels that they've created.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.790
Because that's always a powerful
way to get communities started.

01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:16.780
But what adapter/generator will
do will be allow communities

01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.430
to translate and transcribe

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:24.070
and adapt the labels in
any way they see fit.

01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:28.080
And so that will, you know,
we have a demo version of it,

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:37.560
and in another year and a half or
so, we'll have the final version.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: All right,
can you hear me?

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.790
Thank you for the presentation,
it was really interesting to hear

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:46.940
from all of you and such
a range of experiences.

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.630
In the examples that I have heard

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:52.650
over the past few years form
the TK labels and Mukurtu,

01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:55.250
it's all been examples
from the US and Canada.

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:57.660
And so, my question is
actually similar to yours.

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:00.380
Are there examples of communities

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.810
where you're taking this
further south in the hemisphere?

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:08.180
My work here is mostly doing
research on indigenous groups

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:12.740
in Central America and
so I see that need daily.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.430
And just interested
in what's happening.

01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:17.950
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson: Yeah, in one
project that we've been engaged

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:20.340
with recently is with
Oxford University.

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.070
And they are working in Bolivia.

01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:27.660
It's an ornithology collection and
they're trying to create a database

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:30.580
that tells stories
about birds from kind

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:31.910
of all these different contexts.

01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:33.420
And Bolivia is one of the sites

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.620
that they've actually been
working in for a very long time.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:39.800 position:56%
And they have started to incorporate
the labels into their kind

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.540
of digital databases as well.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.180
Just again, giving
this kind of expression

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:46.730
of when should this material
be shared, when is it actually

01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:51.360
for particular families, what's at
stake in those sharing processes

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:54.400
and the labels allow that
kind of conversation.

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:58.780
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: No, there
are a couple examples

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:04.740
from archaeological
collaborations through the Center

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:08.730
for Digital Archaeology who hosts
Mukurtu sites and have done,

01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:11.620
they have a couple bilingual sites.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:15.690
But, as Jane said, so far,
I mean it's about, you know,

01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:18.640
communities who have come to us.

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.260
So, you know, although Mukurtu is
you know a free and open source,

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.830
and people can download it.

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:28.130
So, in some senses we don't
know exactly how many.

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:32.390
In other senses the
biggest communities so far

01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:35.140
that we've been working with are
Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:37.970
We have quite a few
Maori communities who've

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:41.670
in the last year taken it up
with quite a lot of vigor.

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:45.350
And so, you will see various
translations on those sites.

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:46.910
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Let
me, actually extend

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.110
that question toward
James and Donald.

01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:53.240 position:56%
I know it's early days for your
projects with Mukurtu and TK labels.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.200
But does this work in a bilingual
context for you, or do you want it

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.800
to work in that particular way?

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.300
Either one start.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.310
&gt;&gt; James Francis: Well, we
have just digitized our entire

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:07.610
Penobscot dictionary.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:09.960
Had the speakers say
each and every word.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:17.060
And one thing, in our previous
training, with Michael,

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:23.300
who works with Kim, was a kind of
a plug-in from Mukurtu that had

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:26.670
to do with, for a dictionary.

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:30.760
And so, although we
have an online database

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.100
with all the words
and those are spoken.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.420
We really want to start to look
at the language differently

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:41.370
in these kind of what we
call cultural clusters.

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:44.720
You know, I had an elder once tell
me to truly understand the culture,

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.190
you must understand the language.

01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:49.190
And to understand the language you
have to understand the culture.

01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:54.550
And it always seemed this kind of
catch 22 paradoxical thing where,

01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:56.330
you know, which way do I go.

01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:58.850
But, you know I think that as a way

01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:01.580
that Dr. Siebert [assumed
spelling] set up the dictionary,

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:05.610
was he alphabetized
everything by Penobscot word,

01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:10.410
which was in an alphabet
that he created.

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:13.660
And he failed to.

01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:20.510
Kind of decode the words.

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:25.160
So, if there's a word for salmon,
it just says, Atlantic salmon.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:28.650
You know, so here's the Penobscot
word for Atlantic salmon,

01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:31.080
then in English is just
says Atlantic salmon.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.860
And a lot of times for
nouns, that's all you get.

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:39.560
And there's no translation really.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.650
I mean we know it's a salmon.

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:43.920
So, you have to look at the
words that are adjacent to it

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.370
in the dictionary and
you find things

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:49.240
like it ricochets off the water.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.890
So, there's this action that's
happening that's related

01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:55.930
to how my ancestors saw the salmon.

01:12:55.930 --> 01:13:00.560
So, these kind of cultural
clusters are really important

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:06.600
and I've been thinking about how
we can use the platform on Mukurtu

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:11.540
to kind of start that work
of decoding some of that.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.420
Because you know there's
a lot of healing that has

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:16.280
to happen in our community.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:23.860
We don't have the luxury of having
10% of our population be speakers.

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.560
As the Passamaquoddy's do.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:32.240
We're in you know dire straits
as far as that's concerned.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.970
So, there's a lot of
healing that has to happen

01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:37.370
in our community around
language loss.

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:42.360
And so, language is
really kind of held closely

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.780
to those language keepers.

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:48.470
And really want to share
it within the community.

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:53.780
And so, Mukurtu is you know, really
seen as a platform that's going

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:57.250
to allow us to share it with only
those who we want to share it with.

01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:58.550
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson:

01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:01.460
I think translation is just
a really interesting question

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.350 position:56%
within the project in and of itself.

01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:07.230 position:56%
Particularly, when you saw the
Scowlitz translation of attribution,

01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:08.890
which was name and place.

01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:12.180
When we were recently working
with you, the translation

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:15.450
of attribution was
this is the correct way

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:18.440
with what Penobscot
is kind of putting

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.380
out as what attribution means
from a Penobscot standpoint.

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.670
So, that's kind of interesting
translation components that happen

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:26.140
at that interface as well.

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.300
Because attribution
doesn't necessarily have a

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.600
direct translation.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.580
It's kind of what the community
thinks about when they're thinking

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.670
about how do they want
to present this

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:36.720
within a label for an institution.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.250
And it's like, well this is
the right way of doing that,

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:42.900
which is kind of again coming out
of the standpoint of the language,

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.170
of the Penobscot language,
not out of the standpoint

01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:48.590
of the English language,
so it's interesting.

01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:49.890
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Donald
can I ask you to take

01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:51.480
that question on as well?

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:57.240
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah: We're just at
the starting stages of the concept

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:04.120 position:56%
of Mukurtu, and it's going to take a
lot of work in our community to get,

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.660
to move to the next step.

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:12.220
But we're going to do
anything we can to preserve.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.780
If there's a unique way like
this to preserve the language,

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:21.190
to preserve culture,
we're going to do it.

01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:24.970
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: Actually, the
language was one of the first.

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:27.580
It's always been important
for Mukurtu.

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.920
All the features and functions
of Mukurtu came from communities

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.170
who wanted them, starting
with the Warumungu community.

01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:38.740
And we have a community
development software way

01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.290
that we scope out things.

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:42.280
So, communities ask us for things.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:46.380
And a dictionary's been something
that communities have asked

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:49.020
for for the last six years.

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:52.030
And James saw a sneak
peek and I'm happy to say

01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:57.010
that the dictionary will
actually be a baked in feature

01:15:57.010 --> 01:15:59.240
in 2.06 October 10,
so you heard it here.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.990
It will be October 10.

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:03.740
The reason it takes so long,
is that, I mean part of it,

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.720
yes is technical, and
part of it, yes, is money.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.020
I'm not saying that.

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:10.460
But part of it is imagining
what a dictionary means.

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.860
Some of these are, it's
a very sort of western

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.390
and colonial this listing,
and we've had to think,

01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:18.700
how can we make something
flexible enough for Penobscot,

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:21.570
for [inaudible] all these
communities who we're working with,

01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:26.160
so we took a lot of input and
we had to make it as flexible

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.950
as possible while also making sure
that it upholds the, you know,

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:33.230
sort of cores, the heart
and soul of Mukurtu.

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:36.340
So, every word can
have a protocol on it.

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:37.640
This is important.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.140
And this came out of my first work

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.960
in aboriginal communities
in Australia.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.260
That's central.

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:45.650
It's like the words themselves,
they're not open and out there.

01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:48.390
And so, there are many things that
couldn't be heard by other people

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:52.660
and so ways to do that and
also to make it this sort

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:56.330
of rounded experience, with
audio, with video, for learning,

01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:57.760
for all these different things.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.480
So, it is something.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.840
Language is, you know, is sort

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.170
of the foundation of
many of these things.

01:17:04.170 --> 01:17:06.900
And it was great, the workshop
we were at, Jane was talking

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.280
about with Scowlitz, about
translating the labels.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.140
When they translated the sacred
label and translated these others,

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:18.040
just those conversations around I
think on the local context platform

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.950
when communities, you
know, start sharing these,

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:25.260
it will I think be a powerful
you know, just set of examples

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:28.190
of turning that language
around itself.

01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:29.490
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you.

01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:30.790
Jessie?

01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:32.090
&gt;&gt; Jessie: Yeah, good morning.

01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:33.390
Thank you so much.

01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:36.750 position:56%
This is a wonderful panel and I
guess on behalf of my NEH colleagues

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:39.610
and other funders, it's
always wonderful to hear

01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:40.990
about the work that we supported.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:45.850
But mostly congratulations
for such powerful impacts.

01:17:45.850 --> 01:17:51.990
But, speaking from
a personal capacity.

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:56.600
Kim, you made a powerful
statement I think, that the history

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.170
of collecting is a
history of colonialism.

01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:02.170
And I think that's something
that in cultural heritage

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:05.320
and in professional practice
at least, we often cover

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.830
up with standards and
best practices.

01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:09.690
And so, it's very powerful
to see the way

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:13.720
that this work is impacting
communities.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:17.900 position:56%
And it's such a powerful way to
illustrate that with seeing examples

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:21.770
from collections in the way that
you've reached source communities.

01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:27.970
Picking up on the previous
question, I'm wondering though,

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:31.320
what the uptake is
among institutions here.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:35.050
It's great to hear that the
library is integrating them,

01:18:35.050 --> 01:18:37.750
but I wonder if you could
talk a little bit about that.

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:41.960
And I think particularly because
hearing this sort of example

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:49.420
where we can see the actual impacts
of you know, on communities the way

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.540 position:56%
that we relate to these collections.

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:56.910
And just to pick one
example, you know the Society

01:18:56.910 --> 01:19:02.100
of American Archivists has kind
of you know front relationship

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:04.310
with the protocols for
Native American materials.

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:05.610
And there's many more.

01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:06.910
So, I'd be interested just

01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:10.160
to know how this work is impacting
those professional practices

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.610
that I think we often like to
forget about these histories.

01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:16.920
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: There's
a whole bunch of threads

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.290 position:56%
in your question, Jessie, thank you.

01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:20.590
And thank you.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:21.890
And thank you to the NEH.

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:27.790
So, I was going to sort of
go on a rant there at the end

01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:32.640
about standards, about
user, you know about impact

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.560
and these, because I get asked.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.650
And I'm fine because
I know the impulses.

01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:38.290
Well how many, well how many.

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:39.590
And I get that.

01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:41.030
I do understand.

01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:44.390
But that's only one
way to measure impact.

01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:46.760
And you know, I get
emails from people.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.320 position:56%
How many people are using Mukurtu,
or how many people are using portal,

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.820
or what's your data on the portal.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:53.390
It's like I could go look at
the analytics for the portal,

01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:55.900
and I actually just like,
really just didn't answer,

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:59.310
I just blew someone off there,
because I got tired of them asking,

01:19:59.310 --> 01:20:02.880
because I don't want to answer
how many pieces of content are

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.530
in the portal after eight years.

01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:06.970
How many this, because
it doesn't matter.

01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:10.360
The relationships matter.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:15.680
And I have to say that NEH
and IMLS are supportive

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:19.730
of understanding differential types
of impact and community impact.

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:21.030
So, thank you to funders.

01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:22.640
But that has changed.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.040
The first two proposals

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:31.150
in 2006/2007and I kept the
reviewer's comments for the portal,

01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:36.000
were very, very hostile somewhat,

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.400
to the notion of, Joel
can attest to this.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.120
To the notions of everything
not being open.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:47.800
I mean, you know, that this type of
access, and how can they have this.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.900
I mean it was really,
there was very telling

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:53.610
to whoever the reviewers
were, that we don't know.

01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:56.020
But having said, you know all that,

01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:58.520
we know that there are
users of Mukurtu worldwide.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.070
So, we know there's in
Australia, and New Zealand,

01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:02.850
and Canada, and the United States.

01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:07.450
We know the numbers of workshops
that we do every year for those.

01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:12.180
And we can see that the biggest
change has been the nonnative

01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:14.300
repositories now coming to us.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:18.050
That's the biggest change in the
last two or three years is that.

01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:23.750
You know, and Guha, and Betsy
and Niki have been a charge.

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:27.270
They saw the Plateau People's Web
Portal 2008 and hat's off to them

01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:30.060
to think how can we do
something like this,

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:31.360
what can we do something like this.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.300
Now it did take eight years to get
something like the labels in here.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:37.040
So, it is that slow process.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.430
And we also have to remember
that standards are set

01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:41.730
from a certain perspective.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:46.560 position:56%
And they're the standards of you
know a certain type of professional,

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:51.130
professionalism that discounts what
we're talking about here in terms

01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:52.600
of oral histories that change.

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:55.370
And these aren't, you know,
the metadata doesn't stick

01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:58.980
and stay the same because it's
fuzzy, or it's you know dynamic,

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:01.040
or those sorts of things, so.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.830
Does that kind of answer you?

01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:05.260
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson: I'm going to.

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.560
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: Are you going to?

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.860
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson: I'm
going to follow up.

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:09.160
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: Okay.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.460
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson: I mean it's
interesting to see where desire

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:14.260
around using this kind of material,
like these devices comes from.

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:18.040 position:56%
And you know, so what can Penobscot,
Penobscot have collections

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:21.220
in over 30 institutions
in the United States.

01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:25.030
And so, slowly with the project
that James has been developing

01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:28.010
for the Penobscot collections
project,

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:32.340 position:56%
that is going to have the
implications that those institutions

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.210
that have Penobscot
material are going

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:36.230 position:56%
to start using the Penobscot labels.

01:22:36.230 --> 01:22:39.950
So, that just kind of, that
moves from one direction.

01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:46.770
Already, for Penobscot, the
Abbe Museum and the University

01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:48.830
of Maine wanting to use the labels.

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:51.350 position:56%
Because they again, I mean it what's
really interesting is it takes

01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:53.710
people within institutions
to recognize the problems

01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:55.410
that they have with
their collections.

01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:57.440
And that's always going to
be the first starting point.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:00.360
And so, it's always going to be
those relationships to start with.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.590
Those relationships that
acknowledge that the histories

01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:07.800
of these collections is problematic
and has all of these kind

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:11.710
of components that have legacies
that deeply carry themselves

01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:15.240
into the present, and into
any kind of sharing futures

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.680
that you might want to have.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:20.840 position:56%
If you have an ethical commitment to
understanding that communities need

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:23.190
to be engaged in that process
form the very beginning.

01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:27.550
You know, then we have
institutions like the Field Museum,

01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:31.150
which you know, they have very,
very complicated collections.

01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:34.480
And they kind of come to us and
say, well who could we partner

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.710
with in order to test these
labels in our institution?

01:23:37.710 --> 01:23:40.130
And I'd have to say, in every
instance that we're working

01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:43.380
with an institution, it's testing
to what extent this is possible.

01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:46.390
Because so much invisible
labor happens

01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:50.560
at an institutional level too
in order to build the capacity

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.580
for the institution to
take on these questions.

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:55.370
And then to actually
develop different practices

01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:56.670
and to implement.

01:23:56.670 --> 01:23:58.340
And so that just takes time.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.090
So, the project we've
been working on,

01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:05.130
this is like in its already
third year, nearly fourth year

01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:07.140 position:56%
around the Ancestral Voices Project.

01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:09.640
So, you know that's just kind
of like getting to this stage.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.840
So, there's still so
much to be done.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:15.690
But it's a kind of slow burn,
but then sometimes it kind

01:24:15.690 --> 01:24:17.500
of picks up and goes really fast.

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.880
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: I guess frankly, I
would say, I mean just as you want

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.120
to question the notion
of you know more product,

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.130
less process in this
particular instance,

01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:27.030
we also want to question
the notion of scaling.

01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:30.140
And when I hear the word
scaling, it's always scaling up.

01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.440
Why not just scale?

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.580
You know, why not just
human scale at the level

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:35.490
where people can actually
interact with the material.

01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:37.250
So, there are 31 cylinders,

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:40.040
or recordings that the
Passamaquoddy have.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.560
There's a dictionary
of Father [inaudible]

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:44.840
in the National Anthropological
Archive, that's yet another piece

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:49.070
of this puzzle of what language
revitalization language reclamation

01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:50.370
might take.

01:24:50.370 --> 01:24:53.240
American Philosophical
Society has certain materials.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.300 position:56%
So, all of these have to be
approached, not by us at the Library

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.540
of Congress, and not by
somebody out there; Jane,

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:01.750
or you know Kim can't
necessarily make those kinds of,

01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:04.580
they can make some interventions,
but at the end of the day,

01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:08.330
it's up to people like Donald
and James to make those decisions

01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:10.720
which are going to affect
them on a daily basis.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:14.300
So, I think the question
that people might have

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:17.850
about how many, is
really out of place.

01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:19.810
It's not up to us to
determine how many.

01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:22.090
I mean it's up to the Passamaquoddy
to say we have just enough

01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:24.710
for our own needs, or
for our own purposes.

01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:30.100 position:56%
So, that's something we might also
wish to consider at a certain level.

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:33.260
As a matter of fact, I think
we're excited because in ways

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:37.820
that we would not be able to
do, Mukurtu, and Passamaquoddy

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:41.370
and Penobscot are actually doing
the aggregation work of all

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:43.760
of these different institutions
and bringing collections together

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.060
in ways that we never could.

01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:47.150
We know they're out there, but
we're not going to be able to build

01:25:47.150 --> 01:25:49.890
that platform or that portal
to do that intellectual work

01:25:49.890 --> 01:25:52.230
of gathering those
things in one place.

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:56.000 position:56%
That really is I think a fundamental
shift, I mean it's 180 degrees away

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.590
from the way in which we
think about curating it.

01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:59.890
Because that's the point about all

01:25:59.890 --> 01:26:02.810
of this is the community
co-curation is at the heart

01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:05.440
of this very venture,
and it goes back to what,

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.800
you know Carl was saying and
Alan was saying about the way

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.740
in which American Folklife Center
approached the Federal Cylinder

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:14.180
Project in the 1980s.

01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:17.920
It came at that moment of sharing
and a co-responsibility among

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.020
and between communities
and the federal agencies.

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:23.000
So, yeah. Sorry, and a question.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.690
Yes, Chris.

01:26:24.690 --> 01:26:27.130
&gt;&gt; Chris: Hi, my name is Chris
from the Brooklyn Arts Council

01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:32.020
and I just wanted to address how
Mukurtu has impacted the work we've

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.100
been doing in New York State.

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:38.440
I've been working on a project
for the past three years

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:42.770
to address how folklorists
throughout New York State,

01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:46.610
and there's about 30 of us,
organizations that receive funding

01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:49.920
from the New York State Council
on the Arts folk arts program,

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.570
how we share our information

01:26:51.570 --> 01:26:55.380
and we are building a
portal built on Mukurtu.

01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:57.380
That does so much for us.

01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:02.770
It not only allows us to
place our materials online,

01:27:02.770 --> 01:27:05.570
which we have a lot of pressure
to do in the public sector.

01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:08.080
But it brings the communities
into the process,

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.810
which has just been so incredible.

01:27:09.810 --> 01:27:15.590 position:56%
In addition, what I found is that
the idea of sharing in a proper way,

01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:19.150
we've been contacted by very,
very small organizations.

01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:21.320
One in particular in
Osceola, New York.

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:24.940
They have an old-time fiddler's
Hall of Fame and they heard

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.720
about the way we're doing this.

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.760
And they don't even have
internet, and there they are.

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.690
But they have a wonderful
collection.

01:27:31.690 --> 01:27:35.440
But they're excited about the fact
that Mukurtu provides a platform

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:39.160
to share in a proper way to
allow those cultural protocols.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:43.050
So, I just wanted to say
thanks, but also give an example

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:45.860
of how we're implementing,
or Mukurtu is being used

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.750
in a different sort of environment,

01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:49.650
and allowing public
sector folklorists

01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:52.610
to bring communities back in
to the collections that many

01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:55.350
of us have large collections,
so thanks.

01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:57.470
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: Yeah, and I
was contacted by an archivist

01:27:57.470 --> 01:28:00.450
who is working with a transgender,
this is the great thing.

01:28:00.450 --> 01:28:02.520 position:56%
I've been doing this for nine years.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:05.770
And you know it started off, you
know it was a very personal project

01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:08.520
with the community in Australia
that I was working with

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.160
and it's grown into this thing.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:15.830
And now, we're starting to see it
move beyond indigenous communities,

01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:17.810
just you know it's
transgender archives.

01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:20.190
So, there's things in here
that would be, you know,

01:28:20.190 --> 01:28:23.500
potentially put people at risk.

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.600
So, we want to use
Mukurtu as the platform

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.540
to share these oral histories
around this transgender archive.

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.430
It's because it's that same set of,

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:33.000
it's going to be safe
for them to do that.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.670 position:56%
So, I think there's you know these
other multiple instances of its use.

01:28:36.670 --> 01:28:40.400
So, it's great to hear
your use, Chris, thank you.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.920
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you for
that, because that just reminds me

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.670
of what Andrea Kitta and
folks in various roles

01:28:44.670 --> 01:28:47.060
and others were saying yesterday
about the notion of access

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:51.660
and discoverability of
individuals whose you know work is,

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.660
and it places them at
certain kinds of risk.

01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:56.330
And this is yet another
interesting residence,

01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:58.070
which I thank my colleagues

01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:59.680
for having brought all
these folks together.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.980
Because I'm just really interested

01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:03.260
in the crosstalk that's
been happening here.

01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.610
Yes, please.

01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:05.910
Cliff.

01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:08.750
&gt;&gt; Cliff: Hi, I'm curious,
James and Donald,

01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:14.590
if you had to get tribal government
buy-in into doing this kind of work

01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:17.600
and collaborating with
these folks over here.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.140
And if so, how did you kind of
successfully make that case.

01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:24.550 position:56%
How did you kind of bring people in,

01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:28.040
you know within your
communities into this cause.

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:31.590
You know, I'm sure you must have
proper channels that you have to go

01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:34.530
through for this sort of thing.

01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:36.260
&gt;&gt; James Francis: Yeah,
a couple of things.

01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:42.350
First of all, we have a
rights protection board

01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:47.220
that was formed in
the last five years.

01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:52.180
It was a re-formation of some
older research review boards

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:55.320
that really try to
protect Penobscot culture.

01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:01.600
So, the tribal council had approved
the formation of this board,

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.200
which has some subcommittees
under that and one

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:08.640
of them is intellectual
property rights committee.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:12.030
That kind of looks at, you
know what is Penobscot,

01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:16.310
what do we feel is
important to protect.

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:23.140
And so, it was that committee who
really made the decision to work

01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:28.120
with Jane on this grant to
move forward with the Mukurtu.

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:33.620
So, you know, there are
some kind of channels of,

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:36.160
you know it's just not me saying,
you know let's move forward.

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:39.710
You know, it's a group
of people who feel work

01:30:39.710 --> 01:30:41.830
like this is important
in the community.

01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:45.330 position:56%
And again, you know, we're using the
platform not for us to have a voice,

01:30:45.330 --> 01:30:47.350
but for the community
to have a voice.

01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:57.610
So, you know, it's; and that's
ultimately the most important piece

01:30:57.610 --> 01:30:58.910
for us.

01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:00.210
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah:
For us what we did

01:31:00.210 --> 01:31:03.700
when we formed our historic
preservation office,

01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:11.530
the tribe sort of, our
mission was to do this.

01:31:11.530 --> 01:31:18.640
And the tribe is busy with
business, with community issues

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:23.230
for the preservation issues,
that's our assignment.

01:31:23.230 --> 01:31:29.480
So, I usually consult with
elders in our community.

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:37.250
And I have a small group of elders
that point the direction to go.

01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:40.670
And anything that has to be signed,

01:31:40.670 --> 01:31:46.440
like any type of agreement
goes back to council.

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:50.800
But I have to develop and
work with organizations

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:53.430
to develop any type of agreement.

01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:57.580
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: And I think
that's also another way of talking

01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:01.270
about scale in these
particular kinds of projects.

01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:04.540
We're, the anti-DPLA,
that's the case.

01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:07.050
You know, we're not working
at this like mass scale,

01:32:07.050 --> 01:32:09.400
we're working at individual.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:10.700
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: We're not
anti, we're not against.

01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:12.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Anti, the non-DPLA.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:15.870
Sorry, semantics will
trip us up every time.

01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:17.170
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: They're
recording this.

01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:19.470
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Yeah,
of course they are.

01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:21.950
Hi. Hello, DPLA.

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:24.800
The point being that again,
each of these is a case,

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.350
I mean it's a case
by case basis, right?

01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:29.570
It's not mass digitization just
for the sake of mass digitization.

01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:31.550
Were it the case that
would be great.

01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:34.880
But every individual community
has cultural protocols,

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:38.900
which are internally vetted
and then passed out to us.

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:43.270 position:56%
Right? It's not something, again,
as very carefully the way that Jane,

01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:46.890
and Kim, and Donald, and
James have talked about this,

01:32:46.890 --> 01:32:49.590
it's all the negotiated moment.

01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:54.440
And we're privileged and proud
to be part of that negotiation.

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:57.930
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: And I would say
from our end we get, you know,

01:32:57.930 --> 01:33:02.960
coming through out support
desk on our site every day,

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:10.420 position:56%
90% comes from cultural preservation
offices, archivists, librarians.

01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:14.280 position:56%
It's not their IT department making
the decision what content management

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.370
system they should use, because
yes, it is a content system,

01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:18.910
but, you know, but it's not.

01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:21.990
It's not like making a
choice to use content DM

01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:24.000
that the IT people
get together and make.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.400
And so, we get down the line, we
get their ID departments involved.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.310
But it's rare.

01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:31.610
It has happened.

01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:35.200
But it's rare that we get contacted
by you know, an IT department

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:38.830
or something with those more sort
of standards based questions.

01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:41.500
And it's really word of mouth.

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.710
And that's, you know
and it has really sort

01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:45.450
of taken off in the last few years.

01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:50.780
But that really is
how it's been for us.

01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:52.080
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Any
other hands out there?

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.380
Yes, Mary?

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.340
&gt;&gt; Mary: Hi there.

01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:01.780
I guess this question is for Jane,
but others can comment on it.

01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:06.760
What are the training needs
for people in institutions

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.760 position:56%
for this kind of work to take place?

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.540
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson: It's a
very good question, Mary.

01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:15.990
I mean the kind of the
first training needs are

01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:18.290
around recognizing those
histories of collections.

01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:22.080
So, it's an educational training
need on just kind of one level.

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.380
And then, I mean I think the
Library of Congress kind of proof

01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:28.760
of concept has been a really
good example for thinking

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.150
about what the different kinds
of training needs are in terms

01:34:32.150 --> 01:34:35.590
of thinking about implementation.

01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:37.440
What does it take to
work with the community?

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.690
What kind of time period
needs to exist?

01:34:39.690 --> 01:34:42.690
Also, what are the questions
of copyright that arise

01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:44.010
in each kind of collection.

01:34:44.010 --> 01:34:49.250
Understanding what those questions
are about are also a training need.

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:51.490
Partly, because it's
not necessarily clear

01:34:51.490 --> 01:34:52.980
or people haven't necessarily
been thinking

01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:55.290
about what those copy
right questions are

01:34:55.290 --> 01:34:58.520
that either allow the circulation
of material, or actually close

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.010
down the circulation of material.

01:35:00.010 --> 01:35:02.790
So, that's kind of
at least one point.

01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:07.330
There's also training needs
around recognizing how

01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:09.300
to work with communities.

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:14.000
And that's a time-based project
and a relationship based project.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.520
And its things don't
happen instantly.

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.170
So, there's kind of a sense of
what kind of temporal limits

01:35:21.170 --> 01:35:25.320
of a project need to
also be in place.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.800
Training, in terms of implementing
the labels, it's not that difficult

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.690
at all, but there has
to be the conversations

01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:36.020
between different sections of
the institutions so that they're

01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:38.650
in conversation with each other in
order to make that happen as well.

01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:41.160 position:56%
And actually, maybe Niki, you could
actually state a little bit to that,

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.470
I think that would be great.

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:43.770
If you wouldn't mind.

01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:47.250
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: Yeah, that
actual technical implementation.

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:48.730
&gt;&gt; Niki: Hi.

01:35:48.730 --> 01:35:50.820
Speak to which element
in particular?

01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.120
Because there are several.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.320
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: I think
the technical; well,

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.370
the sort of meta technical
implementation,

01:35:56.370 --> 01:35:58.300
all those meetings we had,
like where it would go

01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:01.650
in your content management system,
because it's indigenous to Mukurtu.

01:36:01.650 --> 01:36:04.450
If you get Mukurtu
you get the TK labels.

01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:06.040
It's like a two for one.

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.970
But if you have a different
content management system.

01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:11.290
&gt;&gt; Niki: Right, so there were,
yeah, there was lots of discussion

01:36:11.290 --> 01:36:14.240
about how big will the label be,
where will it display and all

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.930
of those are still open questions.

01:36:15.930 --> 01:36:17.910
So, nothing's been finalized.

01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:21.250
But yeah, I mean we have
certain technical limitations

01:36:21.250 --> 01:36:24.710
like anybody else with the system
that you know if you put something

01:36:24.710 --> 01:36:27.500
in this field, it's going to
display at the bottom, you know,

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.240
because that's what we do
with all the other zillions

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.610
of records we have in our catalog.

01:36:30.610 --> 01:36:35.780
So, yeah, we're talking
about how to work that out.

01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:38.450
I think your question about
training is really good.

01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:42.640 position:56%
I think one of the, I want to just
add that one of my initial concerns,

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:46.940
and I was getting it from
others was, well, you know,

01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:51.010
how are you going to navigate this
once they're on to the next project

01:36:51.010 --> 01:36:54.920
and you're stuck, you know
figuring out how to dispute issues

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.590
around takedown or changing labels.

01:36:57.590 --> 01:37:00.360
And, you know, you
made the point, Jane,

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.100 position:56%
that we're frontloading this, right?

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:05.940 position:56%
Like we're doing all this engagement
upfront so that theoretically,

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:08.800
you know, this has
been really worked out.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:11.770
And so, that was a real
turning point for me with this,

01:37:11.770 --> 01:37:15.570
where I got my head, you
know, around it more.

01:37:15.570 --> 01:37:16.980
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: And
I guess the training,

01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:19.620
just in a particular example
from the Library of Congress,

01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:22.710
is that those are conversations
that's being had not just

01:37:22.710 --> 01:37:26.830
between Niki, and Jane,
and Kim, and the community,

01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:30.350
and myself in going out,
you know, on site visits.

01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:33.760
But also, Maggie Kruesi, who is
on the cataloging staff here,

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.840
but also our project
1 team, which is our,

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:40.410
which provides the access point for
all of our public facing portals.

01:37:40.410 --> 01:37:44.080
So, that's a lot of moving, and
also general council who's talking

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.730
precisely about rights issues.

01:37:45.730 --> 01:37:47.840
And so, the training, then is not;

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.920
I'm not sure training is
perhaps the right word for it.

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:53.370
But you better be trained to be
having a lot of conversations among

01:37:53.370 --> 01:37:56.080
and between your people at
the institutional level.

01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:00.760
So, that's something which,
it doesn't force you to talk

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.650
to each other, but it
just makes conversation

01:38:02.650 --> 01:38:05.930
and the project outcome a lot
smoother if you have people

01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:08.980
who are talking to each other
and not in these legendary silos

01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:11.540
which we always hear
about within institutions.

01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:13.470
And sorry, Niki?

01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:16.500
&gt;&gt; Niki: Well, I mean to the
library's credit we took this

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:20.320
to the powers that
be, who govern the web

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.620
and they were very receptive.

01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:24.070
I mean there was lots of talk
about we want to keep it a pilot,

01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:26.350
and we want to you know, put
certain boundaries around it.

01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:28.950
But they were hip to the need.

01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:31.180
And they knew we needed
to do something.

01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:34.580
And so, kudos to us in that regard.

01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:36.540
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: But I think
to Mary's one of the things

01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:39.720
for Mary's question is on the local
context site and with the grant

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:42.300
from NEH one of the things we are
going to do is have those sort

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.140
of frequently asked questions.

01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:46.000 position:56%
And we have this on our Mukurtu site

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
because we have had
enough questions.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.670
What does your IT department
need to know?

01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:51.170
What does your tribal
council need to know?

01:38:51.170 --> 01:38:52.580
What does your archivist
need to know?

01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:53.880
So, we have all of this.

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.870
And so, we have, and I think
we'll do the same thing

01:38:55.870 --> 01:38:58.010
on the local context site,
now that we're seeing.

01:38:58.010 --> 01:38:59.910
And the Library of Congress,

01:38:59.910 --> 01:39:03.480
this project is actually a really
good one for us to be doing

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.350 position:56%
to figuring this all out, because
the scale of the federal government.

01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:09.370
It's like if we can
navigate this, you know,

01:39:09.370 --> 01:39:12.160
hopefully we can navigate
other things, right?

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.040
I think we've had meetings
with everybody.

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.540
Yeah, so we're aces.

01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:17.110
So, I just think.

01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:18.730
But because we do.

01:39:18.730 --> 01:39:23.180
You know, we are thinking, not
necessarily about scale in terms

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:26.560
of number, but we're thinking
about sustainability in terms

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.220
of how do we get the
information out to the people

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:31.380
who need it, if we can't always go.

01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:33.050
And we love to do these workshops.

01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:35.900
This moment with Gracie when
she started singing the song.

01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:38.670
I mean it was like,
that was it we're done.

01:39:38.670 --> 01:39:42.230
At the time it was like if nothing
else happens with this project,

01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:44.770
honestly, if no label
gets put on, if we don't;

01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:47.430
if they never have Mukurtu,
if nothing, like being there

01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:52.730
in that moment was so amazing, it's
what it's all about, that you know,

01:39:52.730 --> 01:39:55.430
that's what we mean in
terms of sustainability.

01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:58.710
So, you know, I don't want to blow
off Jessie's question or think

01:39:58.710 --> 01:40:02.970
that it was, you know it is a
factor, but let's think about,

01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:06.210
you know, sustainability,
human interaction,

01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:08.040
relationships for the long term.

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:11.840
Because if we do, if we are
starting from you know the history

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.180
of collection is the
history of colonialism,

01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:15.480
then we have a lot to repair.

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:18.450
So, we start with the relationships
and that's why I'm really glad

01:40:18.450 --> 01:40:21.420
that Donald, and James, and
that we could all be here.

01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:23.690
You know, because it is
all of us working together.

01:40:23.690 --> 01:40:26.630 position:56%
None of these parts work separately.

01:40:26.630 --> 01:40:29.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Our able timekeeper
has given us the time sign.

01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:33.170
But I would like to leave it
to our guests form Penobscot

01:40:33.170 --> 01:40:35.790
and from Passamaquoddy
to take a moment

01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:41.100 position:56%
to say what their final say might
be, if you have such a thing to say.

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:46.290
Unless you just want
to get to the coffee.

01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:47.590
&gt;&gt;

01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:48.890
&gt;&gt; James Francis: All I have
to say is [foreign word].

01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:52.600
So, we have no word in the
Penobscot language for good-bye,

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:55.890
it means I will see you again.

01:40:55.890 --> 01:40:57.420
Thank you.

01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:07.130
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah: And I just like
to thank again all the powers to be

01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:09.180
that gave us the opportunity.

01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:13.940
You know, we live in this
remote corner of the country.

01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:17.910
And being remote sort
of saved our language.

01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:24.960
But now, being remote
is sort of hard to try

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:27.180
to get this material back.

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:38.200 position:56%
So, I want to thank whoever put this
together, you know, for helping us

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:43.570
because this is going
to bring the energy back

01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:48.930
into our community that's really
needed right at this time.

01:41:48.930 --> 01:41:52.690
And thanks for the
shot of energy yeah.

01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:54.510
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you.

01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:57.810
[ Applause ]

01:41:57.810 --> 01:41:59.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well,

01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:04.170
we've reached the final collection
feature here at the symposium.

01:42:04.170 --> 01:42:08.400
So, we want to talk now about one
of our most important projects

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:09.820
and most important collections,

01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:12.110
which is the Veterans
History Project.

01:42:12.110 --> 01:42:16.810
It's been going on now for
over 10 years and has collected

01:42:16.810 --> 01:42:21.500
over 100,000 collections
from American veterans.

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:24.460
Like the American Folklife
Center, it was established

01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:26.440
by legislation of the Congress.

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:29.400
And so, it's one of those programs

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:33.240
that that the Congress has decided
is an important priority for us

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:36.930
to be collecting the oral
histories of American veterans.

01:42:36.930 --> 01:42:41.480
And so, we're lucky to have with
us a senior reference specialist

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:44.380
from the Veterans History
Project, named Megan Harris.

01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:47.770
And I should tell you that there's
this great magazine out there,

01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:50.670
we haven't mentioned this yet,
but one of the things on the table

01:42:50.670 --> 01:42:53.880
out there is a magazine, "The
Library of Congress Magazine,"

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:57.540
which featured AFC as
its main kind of theme.

01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:59.270
So, that's why we selected
this issue.

01:42:59.270 --> 01:43:02.980
It's not the most recent issue, but
it's the issue that deals with AFC.

01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:05.280
So, please pick this up on
your way out and when you do,

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:07.520
you'll find that Megan
is a celebrity.

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:11.990
Because she's featured as
the "My Job Feature" in a

01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:13.290
"Library Congress Magazine."

01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:15.030
So, she can tell you about her job,

01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:19.480
but also about the Veterans
History Project in general and what

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.000
that great project is up to.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.510
So, without further
ado, Megan Harris.

01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:31.110
[ Applause ]

01:43:31.110 --> 01:43:33.280
&gt;&gt; Megan Harris: Hi, everyone.

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:35.480
Thanks so much for attending today.

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:41.900
So, my plan for the next
10 to 15 minutes or so is

01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:43.830
to give you a little
bit of a brief overview

01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:46.370
of the Veterans History Project.

01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:49.610
And then, also talk
specifically about the reference

01:43:49.610 --> 01:43:51.300
and research end of things.

01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:54.100
Because that's my little
sphere of influence

01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:56.290
or piece of the pie so-to-speak.

01:43:56.290 --> 01:43:59.970
And then, also talk about a
few of our recent acquisitions

01:43:59.970 --> 01:44:02.120
that have come in, in
the last year or so.

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:05.160
Some of the most really
intriguing and interesting things

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:07.570
that we've had come
through the door.

01:44:07.570 --> 01:44:12.200
It's a little strange not to have
a monitor in front of me here.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:17.110
So, if I screw up with the slides;
oh, perfect, all right, great.

01:44:17.110 --> 01:44:19.030
Thank you.

01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:20.960
So, I'm not sure how
familiar folks are

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:22.740
with the Veterans History Project,

01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:25.520
but just to give you
a brief overview.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.770
We were created by Congress
in 2000 to collect, preserve,

01:44:29.770 --> 01:44:35.510
and make accessible the stories
of America's war veterans.

01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:42.050
And in the yeah, in the 15
years since we've been around,

01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:47.650
we've collected material relating
to over 100,000 different veterans.

01:44:47.650 --> 01:44:51.800
In addition to oral histories, we
also collect other items that help

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:53.790
to tell a veteran's story.

01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:58.560
Things like original letters,
diaries, journals, photographs,

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:04.910
memoires, military papers,
two-dimensional pieces of artwork.

01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:07.480
Essentially, everything, but
three-dimensional artifacts

01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:11.510
that would explain a veteran's
experience and their story.

01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:16.020
And we organize material under
each individual veteran's name.

01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:18.900
So, when I speak of a
collection, that might refer

01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:23.650
to a single oral history, or it
might refer to an oral history,

01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:30.910
and five original photographs, or
50 letters, or a 200-page memoir,

01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:34.290
or even something like
500 or 1000 letters.

01:45:34.290 --> 01:45:37.550
So, our collections really
vary in terms of size,

01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:42.390
but all of them relate back to
that individual veteran's story.

01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:47.790
So, in terms of how this
material comes to be here,

01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:49.860
we essentially asked
the general public

01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:52.750
to become Folklife practitioners.

01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:54.980
And to go out into their community,

01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:57.960
or maybe just out into
their own family

01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:00.620
and interview the veteran
in their life.

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.800
And the project is
really setup with the idea

01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.030
that anyone can participate
in the project.

01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:09.170
That you don't have to
have any sort of background

01:46:09.170 --> 01:46:12.730
in oral history interviewing,
or folklife,

01:46:12.730 --> 01:46:15.590
or journalism, or interviewing.

01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:20.180
That anyone can take part
and sit down with a veteran

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:23.610
and our field kit, and
go through the process

01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:26.770
of either conducting an
interview, or documenting

01:46:26.770 --> 01:46:28.550 position:56%
that veteran's story in another way.

01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:33.210
And then submit it here to
the library to be archived.

01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:37.690 position:56%
We provide veterans and interviewers
with a field kit that has a list

01:46:37.690 --> 01:46:41.280
of suggested questions,
and all of the paperwork.

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.430
All of the release forms that
they would need to participate.

01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:48.590
And so, using that field kit,
and then drawing on the expertise

01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:50.700
of our staff if they need to.

01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:53.610
They simply conduct the
interview, and send it in here

01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:56.970
to Veterans History
Project to be archived.

01:46:56.970 --> 01:47:00.130
We have collections that
are donated by individuals,

01:47:00.130 --> 01:47:03.770
folks who just maybe only went
and interviewed their relative,

01:47:03.770 --> 01:47:06.730
or their next-door
neighbor, or their postman.

01:47:06.730 --> 01:47:10.600
But we also have collections that
are done on a much wider scope

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:17.830
by different organizations such as
the VFW, and the VA, the Red Cross,

01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:21.240
libraries, colleges, and
universities, Boy Scout,

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:24.410
Eagle Scout troops and those
sorts of organizations.

01:47:24.410 --> 01:47:28.350
So, individual participation and
then group participation as well.

01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:33.110
So, the goal of our
project is really

01:47:33.110 --> 01:47:36.490
to document the experience of war.

01:47:36.490 --> 01:47:44.640
And we take a very folklife
oriented take on that.

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.280
We consider ourselves a social
or cultural history project

01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:50.950
and not a straight
military history project.

01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:55.120 position:56%
And our collections really bear this
out, bear out the focus that we have

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:56.570
and the approach that we have.

01:47:56.570 --> 01:48:01.560
So, in addition to providing
information and testimony

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:07.800 position:56%
about more military focused aspects,
things like battles and campaigns,

01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:11.830
and unit movements, conflicts.

01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:16.270
Our collections also have
a lot to do with things

01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:19.940
like military traditions
and folklore.

01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:24.780 position:56%
One of the pictures I included here
was of a crossing the line ceremony,

01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:31.290
which is a naval tradition, that
involves costumes and role-playing,

01:48:31.290 --> 01:48:34.960
and it's a fantastic
military tradition that a lot

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:37.940
of our naval collections discuss.

01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:40.640
I included another picture
here, it's a little hard to see

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:46.280
of a veteran eating some canned
peaches that were in ration.

01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.090
And food ways are a really
interesting part of our collection.

01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:54.110
Looking at how collections; how
veterans in their collections talk

01:48:54.110 --> 01:48:58.200
about the experience of food
and eating in the military.

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.330
And we also have collections
that include original artwork,

01:49:01.330 --> 01:49:04.670
the ways in which veterans
made sense of their experience

01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:07.380
and described it in
original artwork.

01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:11.700
Drawings, and photographs, and
paintings, and that kind of thing.

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:16.230
So, our collections
have this focus and bear

01:49:16.230 --> 01:49:22.860
out this social cultural bend that
we have and really explore things

01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:28.310 position:56%
that you might not expect to find in
military oral history collections.

01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:32.980
So, because of our broad
collecting scope, the research use

01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:35.610
of our collections
is similarly broad.

01:49:35.610 --> 01:49:38.270
We have researchers who
use our collections in some

01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:41.190
of the very typical ways
that you might expect.

01:49:41.190 --> 01:49:46.670
Things like documentaries
that had to do with say,

01:49:46.670 --> 01:49:52.740
the USS Indianapolis, or Pearl
Harbor, or Battle of the Bulge,

01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:56.790
D-day, some of those
more traditional scopes.

01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:59.360
But then we also have
researchers who use or collections

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.700
in very surprising
and unexpected ways.

01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:07.230
Folks who have investigated,
using our collections,

01:50:07.230 --> 01:50:12.730 position:56%
the history of martial arts, in the
United States, looking at how boxing

01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:15.450
in World War II really
impacted the development

01:50:15.450 --> 01:50:17.700
of martial arts after the war.

01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:20.010
Or the history of mah-jongg.

01:50:20.010 --> 01:50:23.330
Or one recent inquiry had
to do with World War I

01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:28.060
and how troops were
entertained during the war.

01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:30.690
Both the entertainment that
the military provided to them

01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:33.410
and then how they make
their own entertainment.

01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:36.810
So, a really wide variety
of different research uses.

01:50:36.810 --> 01:50:38.840
And our researchers
come from all over,

01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:41.000
and all different walks of life.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.660
Students and teachers,
documentarians,

01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:47.850
folks from other agencies such
as the Department of Defense

01:50:47.850 --> 01:50:51.290
and the National Park Service,
have all used our collections

01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:53.590
in various different ways.

01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:58.630
And they've also then used
them in different things

01:50:58.630 --> 01:51:05.010
like museum exhibits, print
media, educational resources.

01:51:05.010 --> 01:51:06.310
There's currently, on display,

01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:11.330 position:56%
down at the Atlanta Airport actually
is a huge display honoring veterans

01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:13.550
that drew about 100
different photographs

01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:16.200
of veterans from our collections.

01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:19.310
Really interesting use
of VHP collections.

01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:22.300
So, if you happen to be travelling
through Atlanta you can check

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:27.940
out the VHP images as
part of that display.

01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:32.250
So, lots of varied uses
of our collections.

01:51:32.250 --> 01:51:35.890
And ways that they pop up around.

01:51:35.890 --> 01:51:37.700
All right.

01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:41.100 position:56%
So, in terms of recent acquisitions,

01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:44.360
we get about 100 different
collections a week.

01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:47.290
Roughly about 4-500
collections a month.

01:51:47.290 --> 01:51:50.950 position:56%
All of them are interesting, but
there have been a few that have come

01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:54.350
through the door that give you a
sense of some of the initiatives

01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:55.970
that we've been working on.

01:51:55.970 --> 01:52:01.340
But also, things that just pop
through, unexpected acquisitions

01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:03.600
that have come through our door.

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:09.140
One initiative that I have been
involved in is with a professor

01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:11.400
out in Monterey Bay, California.

01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:14.960
She's a professor at California
State University, Monterey Bay,

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:18.680
and she, along with her students
has been documenting the history

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:22.230
of a decommissioned military
base called Fort Ord,

01:52:22.230 --> 01:52:26.690 position:56%
which was a real center for military
personnel up through the 1990s,

01:52:26.690 --> 01:52:28.580
when it was decommissioned.

01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:34.050
And she has long been documenting
the history of Fort Ord.

01:52:34.050 --> 01:52:38.350
So, we partnered with her recently,
not only to interview veterans

01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:41.440
of the surrounding
area, but specifically,

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:44.240
one of our processing technicians,
Timmy Kabran [assumed spelling]

01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:47.690
and I went out to Monterey
Bay to take part

01:52:47.690 --> 01:52:49.930
in something called a stand down,

01:52:49.930 --> 01:52:53.930
which was put on by a local
veterans transition center.

01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:57.330
And they essentially
brought homeless veterans

01:52:57.330 --> 01:53:00.570
from the surrounding
area to Fort Ord

01:53:00.570 --> 01:53:04.220
and provided them social
services for a weekend.

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:06.160
We went out there to
help facilitate,

01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:09.120
not only interviewing
veterans, homeless veterans

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:14.460
who were being provided services,
but also some of the volunteers

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.950
who were supporting the efforts.

01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:20.150
And that garnered around 40
different oral histories.

01:53:20.150 --> 01:53:24.930
Not only of the homeless veterans,
but also of the volunteers.

01:53:24.930 --> 01:53:29.230
And it was a really
wonderful example of something

01:53:29.230 --> 01:53:34.010 position:56%
out of the ordinary that also speaks
to and helps document the stories

01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:39.210
of a very underserved, under
documented population demographic

01:53:39.210 --> 01:53:40.980
which is homeless veterans.

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:44.120
So, it's a really unique
set of collections

01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:47.650
that came out of that initiative.

01:53:47.650 --> 01:53:50.980
We had a couple of different
diary collections come

01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:53.100
through the door recently.

01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:59.170
One came through last December and
it involves a diary that was given

01:53:59.170 --> 01:54:05.310 position:56%
to us by the family of Glenn Piercy,
who might be a familiar name to you.

01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:09.280
He has a wonderful civil rights era
photograph collection that's part

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:13.370
of the American Folklife
Center along with his brothers,

01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:18.620
Glenn Piercy provided us with
a diary relating to his uncle,

01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:22.120
who was a POW in the Pacific
theater during World War II

01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:25.670
and unfortunately,
did not make it home.

01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:29.270
So, along with this original diary,
he gave us letters and photographs,

01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:33.400
you know, just a tremendous
collection relating to his uncle.

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:39.000
He made this collection, we
were kind of blown away by it,

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.880
and ended up writing
a blog post about it.

01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:47.110
And then about six weeks after
we were contacted by the family

01:54:47.110 --> 01:54:50.330
of a friend of his who
he had served with.

01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:20.060
Who volunteered that their family
also had an original diary.

01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:23.960
So, we now have two of these
very unique, very rare,

01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:26.490
original Pacific POW diaries.

01:55:26.490 --> 01:55:30.610
They're the only two diaries of
their kind in our collections.

01:55:30.610 --> 01:55:31.950
And they're interconnected.

01:55:31.950 --> 01:55:33.540
They speak to of another.

01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:37.610
Because they come from two
veterans who were buddies.

01:55:37.610 --> 01:55:40.880
One of whom made it home
and one of whom did not.

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:43.260
So, that was a really amazing,

01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:45.640
both of those acquisitions
were really interesting,

01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:48.390
really wonderful acquisitions.

01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:50.540
We also have seen a real uptick

01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:54.080
in World War I collections
coming through out door.

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:59.470 position:56%
You might think that with the demise
of the actual World War I generation

01:55:59.470 --> 01:56:03.290
of soldiers who served in the
war, that we wouldn't see any more

01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:08.010
of those collections, but in fact,
we've seen a definite steady uptick

01:56:08.010 --> 01:56:11.360
in our World War I collections
coming through the door.

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:14.030
Mainly things like
correspondence collections,

01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:16.280
and photograph collections.

01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:21.080
Including one really notable
collection that came from someone

01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:25.690
who served with a well-known
unit called the Lost Battalion.

01:56:25.690 --> 01:56:28.590
Well-known, infamous for the losses

01:56:28.590 --> 01:56:32.470
that they incurred during
one particular battle.

01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:35.710
And this, you probably can't
tell at all from the PowerPoint,

01:56:35.710 --> 01:56:39.120
but the diary is quite lyrical.

01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:43.330
Beautiful prose describing the
veteran's experiences training

01:56:43.330 --> 01:56:44.750
and then in combat.

01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:47.470
But it's most notable
because it's written

01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:51.270
in teeny, teeny, tiny script.

01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:54.550
And it's essentially
illegible at this point.

01:56:54.550 --> 01:57:00.180 position:56%
It's almost as if the veteran had
written it using a magnifying glass,

01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:04.550
even though I don't
think that was the case.

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:05.910
And it's just tremendous.

01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:09.350
And it was also transcribed
in the 1930s.

01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:13.560 position:56%
So, we have a full transcript of it,
in addition to having the original,

01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.060
which was donated by
the veteran's grandson.

01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:21.040
So, that has been one of our most
notable World War I collections.

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.770
We've had a lot of researchers
come through recently looking

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:25.990
at our World War I material.

01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:27.700 position:56%
And a lot of it will be incorporated

01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:30.980
into the library's World
War I exhibition next year.

01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:35.650
So, that's sort of a very brief,
very quick me talking really fast

01:57:35.650 --> 01:57:37.870
about the Veterans History Project.

01:57:37.870 --> 01:57:40.620
But I'm glad to answer any
questions if we have any time?

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:41.920
No? No, questions.

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:43.220
No time. All right.

01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:46.980
Feel free to email me, I'm glad to
answer any questions you might have

01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:51.360
about VHP and our collections,
scope, using the collections

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.260
for your own research or
anything to do with that.

01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:56.060
So, thank you very much.

01:57:56.060 --> 01:58:08.040
[ Applause ]

01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:09.640
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, once
again that was Megan Harris

01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:13.320
from the Veterans History Project
and I should mention a couple

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:17.310
of things that she
mentioned in her talk,

01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:19.830
including our blog,
"Folklife Today."

01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:22.460
So, we haven't talked about that
yet, but it's a great way to find

01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:26.100
out what's going on at AFC
and VHP, it's a shared blog

01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:28.670
between those two parts
of the library.

01:58:28.670 --> 01:58:34.390
So, you know, we have blog posts
about general folklife issues,

01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:37.770
but also a lot of blog posts about
the Veterans History Collections,

01:58:37.770 --> 01:58:39.880
including great pieces
written by Megan,

01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:42.050
she's one of our favorite bloggers.

01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:46.130
So, I'm the general editor of that
blog and you can just find it,

01:58:46.130 --> 01:58:49.320
the easiest way to find it
actually is on the table outside,

01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:51.550
there are bookmarks for
the Folklife Center,

01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:54.780
one of which specifically
says Folklife Today on it.

01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:58.900
So, look for that one ad you'll
find all the information on there.

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:03.160
So, now we're going to continue
and wrap up the whole symposium.

01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:07.670
Because we have with us a great
speaker, and as a great thinker,

01:59:07.670 --> 01:59:11.050 position:56%
a great brain who has been part of
the Folklife Center for a long time.

01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:14.550
So, Tom Rankin has been
associated with the Folklife Center

01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:20.220 position:56%
in various ways, including as a
field worker, in our field projects.

01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:24.780 position:56%
But most recently, as a member of
our Board of Trustees and as a chair

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:26.660
of our Board of Trustees
for some years.

01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:34.710
Tom has also been the director of
the Center for Documentary Studies

01:59:34.710 --> 01:59:38.520
at Duke University, and associated
with that center for a long time.

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:42.560
And also, he's a terrific
documentary photographer himself.

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:46.510 position:56%
But mainly we love him for his great
brain, that tying up all the issues

01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:49.020
that we have in our symposia.

01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:50.850
And he's going to come up here

01:59:50.850 --> 01:59:52.640
and give us some wonderful
closing remarks.

01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:55.510
So, please welcome Tom Rankin.

01:59:55.510 --> 02:00:02.280
[ Applause ]

02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:08.940
&gt;&gt; Tom Rankin: Well, subtract
the hyperbole there and I could,

02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:11.840
you know, I if I was
a 21st century guy

02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:15.350
with this crowd sources,
this wrap up.

02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:22.060
But, I'm more of a dust to digital
guy, an all deference to Lance.

02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:26.480
So, I've been sitting for the
last day and a half taking,

02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:27.930
I feel like I'm back
in graduate school.

02:00:27.930 --> 02:00:29.570
You know, I couldn't
not pay attention,

02:00:29.570 --> 02:00:33.320
because I'm supposed
to wrap up, right?

02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:34.620
Which is a good exercise.

02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:39.450
And I'm not sure I can do
justice to what's come before,

02:00:39.450 --> 02:00:43.620
or to Steve's notion
that I'm a good thinker,

02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:47.520
but I'm going to try
to say a few things.

02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:52.970
You know, it's so interesting
to be at this moment

02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:55.550
at the crossroads of
analog and digital.

02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:56.950
Or least I think that way.

02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:59.430
You know whatever, however
long this moment is.

02:00:59.430 --> 02:01:02.810 position:56%
I mean we can very easily reach back

02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:07.300
and as we've been hearing
we're constantly trying to stay

02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:13.590
on the outer edge of what's
possible with this digital moment.

02:01:13.590 --> 02:01:17.310
We can still shoot film if we
want, but we digitize everything.

02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:23.260
And so, that is and no joke
aside, this sort of dust

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:25.450
to digital to analog, and digital.

02:01:25.450 --> 02:01:29.370
Most of us were born analog,
we'll all die digital.

02:01:29.370 --> 02:01:34.650
And I think that that's a really
interesting place to get to live.

02:01:34.650 --> 02:01:36.640
I often think about
how our, you know,

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:39.420
how are great archival
collections built?

02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:41.420
However large or small?

02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:42.930
How are they made?

02:01:42.930 --> 02:01:46.580
Whose act and whose intent
brought them together.

02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:49.910
And I think this notion of intent
that came up a lot, is key.

02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:54.670
We find many documentary
collections that had their origins

02:01:54.670 --> 02:01:59.510
in just moments of impulse and
chance, and kind of a daring,

02:01:59.510 --> 02:02:03.360 position:56%
Bergis Jules talked in the dark
now, and about Ferguson is you know,

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:07.770
nobody sat down and did an
RIB proposal before they took

02:02:07.770 --> 02:02:11.570
to the streets and became
documentarians there.

02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:15.870
And it's a good thing they didn't
because they were activists.

02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:18.880
They were going on gut.

02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:22.940
And yet, we also know that
careful planning, and forecast,

02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:30.060
and thinking about what goes on say
in those Archie Green proposals.

02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:34.040 position:56%
Not that those projects don't have
chance and impulse embedded in them.

02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:36.740
But there's all this sort
of thinking beforehand

02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:39.190
about what's going to happen.

02:02:39.190 --> 02:02:41.670
Our great collections are
built by both of those things

02:02:41.670 --> 02:02:45.670
and all kinds in between.

02:02:45.670 --> 02:02:52.880
The you know, the recording the
making the picture, the interview,

02:02:52.880 --> 02:03:00.290
going out and doing things
is the thrilling and easier,

02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:04.170
and more inspiring a piece
of this puzzle I think.

02:03:04.170 --> 02:03:09.830 position:56%
But how we do things that last, that
are distinctive, that are important.

02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:13.680
That then last and live
responsibly as they last.

02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:19.450
How do we take the work that we
want to do and make it relevant,

02:03:19.450 --> 02:03:23.150
and then accessible,
and enduring for others.

02:03:23.150 --> 02:03:28.230
And again, with this whole notion
that the history of doing so much

02:03:28.230 --> 02:03:31.630
of this is the history of
colonialism, or the history

02:03:31.630 --> 02:03:35.760
of having the equipment and
therefore you get to tell the story

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:37.060
because you happen to be able

02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:41.580
to afford the thing,
the piece of equipment.

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:45.240
The discussions of the last day and
a half have been so clearly to me

02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:51.000
about intent, and the deliberate
understanding of goals and intent

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.550
that we see when we start talking

02:03:53.550 --> 02:03:54.990
about how we should
document the web.

02:03:54.990 --> 02:03:57.790
Probably an area that
I know the least about

02:03:57.790 --> 02:04:01.750
and was finding myself
most sort of engaged with.

02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:04.600
Because it's humbling
to even think about,

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:10.390
what should we preserve
from that whole world.

02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:15.220
I was struck in those presentations
by the more the world is virtual.

02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:19.860 position:56%
And I realize these words at least
in the academy are really contested,

02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:23.090
virtual and I'll put aside actual.

02:04:23.090 --> 02:04:30.770
But the more the world is virtual
and the more we understand the web

02:04:30.770 --> 02:04:34.320
to be that virtual world, the
more it may call forth some

02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:37.480
of the old verities of
the actual to work in it.

02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:39.520
The local, the placed.

02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:45.500
When talking about the
Ferguson collection,

02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:50.080
we heard that it became most
understood and most useful

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:55.450 position:56%
to hear the people who made the work
that ended up in the Tweets talk

02:04:55.450 --> 02:04:57.590
about making the work that
ended up in the Tweets.

02:04:57.590 --> 02:05:02.290
The actual grounded the virtual.

02:05:02.290 --> 02:05:05.620
That, if I talk too much about that
I would begin to sound like a kind

02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:09.610
of a luddite, but I think
there's some truth there.

02:05:09.610 --> 02:05:14.800 position:56%
Or, when we hear about vaccines, you
know doing work on line about sort

02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:18.390
of vaccination feelings in
northeastern, North Carolina.

02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:20.350
Without the actual interviews

02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:23.870
of people what sense
does any of that make?

02:05:23.870 --> 02:05:30.720
How do we get to context without
some of those older approaches.

02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:34.690
Let me take my watch off
so I keep track of this.

02:05:34.690 --> 02:05:40.830
Just as we have and should probably
forever ponder what right we might

02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:44.360
have to go in somebody's
backyard and take a photograph.

02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:48.110
You know when Montana Miller
was talking about the web,

02:05:48.110 --> 02:05:52.940
she's talking about it as a
similar tender ethical space

02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:58.320
that requires us to think of it,
not just as a virtual landscape,

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.790
but maybe as something
a little more actual.

02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:03.680
Those are complicated things.

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:07.100
But I think the way that
ethics is central to all

02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:11.580
of it comes really clear and we may
see it more clearly when we look

02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:16.470
at something that we
think of as so virtual.

02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:21.580
I think that thinking about working

02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:23.980
in those spaces may will
require simply to double

02:06:23.980 --> 02:06:28.410
down on the essential
notions of the old.

02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:35.600 position:56%
The survey projects, you know, I'm
so intrigued to hear Allen, and Carl

02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:37.450
and others talk about
sort of the origins

02:06:37.450 --> 02:06:39.100
of the of the survey projects.

02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:41.800
Not that they can; not
that they know themselves

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:44.210
where all the influences came
from, where all the water

02:06:44.210 --> 02:06:48.990
of that confluence came for
them to think about photography

02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:54.030
and recording, and you know
what influence was the FSA.

02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:56.250
And so on, and the
building of these teams.

02:06:56.250 --> 02:06:59.620
But to hear that and to
get a sense of that kind

02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:02.030
of contextual information.

02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:06.590
Also, to see you know, how often
they photographed the doing

02:07:06.590 --> 02:07:10.870
and the word reflexive.

02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:14.720
You know they were meta
before meta was coo,

02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:18.390
to paraphrase a country song.

02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:21.010
And why they did it.

02:07:21.010 --> 02:07:22.560
Who knows.

02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:26.070
Were they doing it so they could
come back here and should people

02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:29.560
at the library that they
were actually working?

02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:33.170
Were they doing it so that we,
because they were looking forward?

02:07:33.170 --> 02:07:34.470
Were they doing it
because they noticed

02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:36.960
in the FSA there were a
few pictures like that,

02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:38.550
and they were really intriguing?

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:39.850
Who knows?

02:07:39.850 --> 02:07:45.920
But I think it allows us to
engage with the process in a way

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:49.460
that just gets us talking
just like I'm talking now.

02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:50.770
And to think about it.

02:07:50.770 --> 02:07:52.880
And to think about what
it means to be there

02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:56.570
and to do those kinds of work.

02:07:56.570 --> 02:08:01.000
When Terry Eiler talked about
standing in the same place.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:05.340
Two photographers standing in
the same place, taking pictures

02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:09.380
of the same thing, but
very different pictures,

02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:12.710
is an interesting story, but
it's a much larger metaphor

02:08:12.710 --> 02:08:17.490
of what it means to think about how
to build documentary collections.

02:08:17.490 --> 02:08:21.740
You know, two people
happen to be married,

02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:23.270 position:56%
but who see things very differently.

02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:28.240
Two photographs building
teams, getting different points

02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.140
of view on the same story.

02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:34.080 position:56%
Understanding that of course
there's no one version of any story.

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.220
There's no one photograph
of anything.

02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:38.390
To really humble us to understand

02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:45.900
that these artifacts we create are
impotent even as they are powerful.

02:08:45.900 --> 02:08:52.920
The you know we live
in a moment where sort

02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:57.570
of gated property has never
been more important to people.

02:08:57.570 --> 02:08:59.950
Physical and intellectual.

02:08:59.950 --> 02:09:02.920
And the standard and model
of the survey project to be

02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.030
in the public domain, it will
raise some challenges, probably.

02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:09.930
And there'll be some pictures
and recordings, that go out

02:09:09.930 --> 02:09:14.190 position:56%
and people say, man I didn't realize
my grandfather signed that form.

02:09:14.190 --> 02:09:16.350
Of course, it's not perfect.

02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:20.400
But, if we look at the Farm
Security Administration,

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:23.360
and I tell my students there
are some great photographers

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:29.350
in the FSA club and
great photographs.

02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:31.960
But, I always ask them, don't you
think maybe the reason we look

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:35.020
at those pictures so much is
because we can actually use them.

02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:37.040
We can actually get to them.

02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:40.140
What's the relationship
between quality and access?

02:09:40.140 --> 02:09:42.950
Or between accuracy and access?

02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:45.750
And I think the survey projects
will take on a life of their own,

02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:53.230
which is a little scary probably
for some people even in this room.

02:09:53.230 --> 02:09:56.940
But, what better legacy than if 70
years from now people are trying

02:09:56.940 --> 02:10:02.280
to download Terry's pictures
and use them for something.

02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:06.150
As opposed to the alternative.

02:10:06.150 --> 02:10:10.190
So, you know, I think that
we can learn from that.

02:10:10.190 --> 02:10:11.520
And I don't know what that means

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:14.750
for our work going
forward and for projects.

02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:17.470
But that notion of being
able to get to work.

02:10:17.470 --> 02:10:20.470
And yet we've heard stories
where work needs to be

02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:22.910
where the documentary
evidence needs to be really,

02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:28.870
the access needs to be limited.

02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:35.120 position:56%
This notion that Kevin Bradley said,
you know, I think I got this right,

02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:38.810
at the interview he wants
to talk we want to listen.

02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:42.950
It's so much at the foundation
of much of what we do.

02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:48.830
The Archie Green Projects
in occupational lure,

02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:52.120
and this whole notion
of a quiet revolution,

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:54.250
or the whole notion
of recovering voices.

02:10:54.250 --> 02:10:57.620
The whole idea of giving
a voice to people

02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:02.270
that we don't normally hear from,
or normally pay attention to.

02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:05.360
A hairdresser in Lumberton,
North Carolina.

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:07.700
You know, we don't
know anything about,

02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:13.000
taking us places we've never been
and may not even, wouldn't think

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.590
to go and building
archives around that.

02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:19.150
It's so much the bedrock of what
the Folklife Center is about

02:11:19.150 --> 02:11:21.620
and what documentary
fieldwork is about.

02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:27.100
And I think that Nancy Gross said
something that is a question,

02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:31.480
not to answer now, but she said
you know occupational projects

02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:33.620
or folklore goes through trends.

02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:35.160
People are interested
and not interested.

02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:38.740
But I can't think of
anything more important to get

02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:43.730
to than why people work, what
they do, how they feel about it.

02:11:43.730 --> 02:11:47.520
To really get to where we all live.

02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:53.760
I'm really struck by
what we can learn.

02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:56.410
You know how is it that we can
learn so much about what we ought

02:11:56.410 --> 02:12:02.780
to do now by how people are
handling wax cylinder repatriation,

02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:06.950
reciprocation from the 1890,
recordings made in the 1890s.

02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:13.770 position:56%
And what the problems of responsibly
returning that to communities.

02:12:13.770 --> 02:12:16.970
But also making it
accessible to all of us.

02:12:16.970 --> 02:12:20.320
And ownership, and ethics.

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:23.270
What we can learn from the way
those are being handled now

02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:24.720
and software created.

02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:28.000
It really can inform how
we do our fieldwork now.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.130
How we do contemporary fieldwork
which is a lot of my own interest,

02:12:32.130 --> 02:12:34.580
is you know, what's
going on around us?

02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:35.960
What matters?

02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:37.870
And what are you going
to do about it?

02:12:37.870 --> 02:12:42.130
Which I think is what
documentarians often need

02:12:42.130 --> 02:12:45.430
to be thinking and do anyway.

02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:55.000
In talking about Ferguson, I
think Bergis said something

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.510
like is there a way to communicate,
you know with a collection,

02:12:58.510 --> 02:13:03.740
through a collection, is there a
way to communicate how the values;

02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:06.620
the values of a collection
and how it should be used.

02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:08.230
You know, what are the values,

02:13:08.230 --> 02:13:10.570
kind of now how valuable
is the collection,

02:13:10.570 --> 02:13:14.370
but what are the embedded
values in that collection.

02:13:14.370 --> 02:13:17.580
And I think that's so
key to figuring out,

02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:19.740
and sometimes that's
a personal choice,

02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:22.880
if it's a personally
created body of work.

02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:25.540
And sometimes it's a
vastly communal choice

02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:28.480
as I think he was referring to.

02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:29.960
One way, and I've got, what?

02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:33.250
I've got about 10 minutes
is that right?

02:13:33.250 --> 02:13:36.410
I want to talk, close with sort

02:13:36.410 --> 02:13:39.730
of what do I worry about,
what do I fret about?

02:13:39.730 --> 02:13:41.890
I like to fret more than worry.

02:13:41.890 --> 02:13:48.430 position:56%
But what do I fret about in thinking
about sort of where we are and some

02:13:48.430 --> 02:13:56.250
of the things I've heard and
this whole thing we call folklife

02:13:56.250 --> 02:13:58.200
and documentary, and
building of collections,

02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:01.260
and then creating access
to those collections.

02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:05.720
And one of the things I kind
of, and fret is not as bad

02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:08.010
as worry, so don't worry.

02:14:08.010 --> 02:14:12.440
One of the thing sis just the
sheer abundance and excess

02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:16.970
of documentation of today.

02:14:16.970 --> 02:14:21.210
That calls for even more skills
of discernment, of intent,

02:14:21.210 --> 02:14:23.580
of point of view, of
kind of the vision.

02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:28.810
You know, the word
of the decade talked

02:14:28.810 --> 02:14:32.600
about by everybody is this
word curation, which both;

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:37.950
I find another way to
sort of build walls.

02:14:37.950 --> 02:14:43.050
I mean it sounds so important
that we curate our Facebook page.

02:14:43.050 --> 02:14:49.160
But this notion of curation, of
what matters and what doesn't.

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:52.110
And so, while we can sort of
rejoice at the fact that everybody

02:14:52.110 --> 02:14:56.750
in this room at this moment could
take a picture of something,

02:14:56.750 --> 02:15:03.820 position:56%
simultaneously, or make a recording,
or you know, is there a way in which

02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:09.370
that fact, that mere fact makes us
less discerning, less intentional,

02:15:09.370 --> 02:15:12.690
and gives us less of a purpose
in what we were going to.

02:15:12.690 --> 02:15:17.530
If it all is recorded,
then why record anything.

02:15:17.530 --> 02:15:21.800
And if all is, we're probably
being recorded by something anyway.

02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:25.740
And so, so what is it we
want to record and why?

02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:29.550
And in some ways, that fact
that anything can be done

02:15:29.550 --> 02:15:33.020
and that everybody has a camera
in every community at any moment,

02:15:33.020 --> 02:15:38.320
you're not going to be the first
one with the camera at a scene.

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:43.050 position:56%
So, what do you want to do about the
fact that you can make a picture?

02:15:43.050 --> 02:15:44.600
And how deep do you want to go?

02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:47.360
In some ways it liberates
us from doing surveys.

02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:52.920
I don't mean that literally, survey
projects, but it liberates us

02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:54.920
from having to go far and wide.

02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:59.170
Because there's people out there
far and wide, that can do it

02:15:59.170 --> 02:16:02.530
with their equipment,
with their ideas.

02:16:02.530 --> 02:16:05.680
I also fret about this
notion of what will last.

02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:09.490
Doug Boyd, very eloquently
told about the challenges just

02:16:09.490 --> 02:16:11.610
of the preservation and
access of something as simple

02:16:11.610 --> 02:16:17.700
as a cardboard box full of
cassette tapes, analog tapes.

02:16:17.700 --> 02:16:21.290
You know, whether to
transcribe or not.

02:16:21.290 --> 02:16:24.210
How long it takes to digitize,
all those kinds of things.

02:16:24.210 --> 02:16:26.300
And so, when you add to
that the great proliferation

02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:31.390
of expressive material that
digital technology brings.

02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:35.580
And there are projects that
are sort of like story core,

02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:39.810
that sort of anticipate
that, and wire it in.

02:16:39.810 --> 02:16:42.310
But there are other times
and there are other places

02:16:42.310 --> 02:16:45.370
where that's not really possible.

02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:49.690 position:56%
So, the robust proliferation creates
a real problem of preservation

02:16:49.690 --> 02:16:52.820
and privilege, and perpetual care.

02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:54.990
The term that they
use in the cemeteries,

02:16:54.990 --> 02:16:58.450
but it's just as relevant
to what we do.

02:16:58.450 --> 02:17:02.740
You know, how do small grassroots
community-based organizations

02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:06.040
or institutions, or families
for that matter, care for

02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:10.890
and ensure the lasting existence
of everyday digital documents.

02:17:10.890 --> 02:17:17.580
The answer I often get is the
Cloud , which is you know,

02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:20.460 position:56%
if you think about it is a metaphor,
it's really not much of an answer.

02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:22.900
But it is somewhat
of an answer I guess.

02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:27.170
But those digital documents won't
fit in a shoebox under the bed,

02:17:27.170 --> 02:17:28.790
or the corner of a public library

02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:31.930
where maybe those Penobscot
photographs were

02:17:31.930 --> 02:17:34.510
that are now being
reintroduced to the community

02:17:34.510 --> 02:17:38.750
and in the metadata gotten
from community engagement.

02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:43.110
Digital files don't wait
patiently to be a restored

02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:45.790
like glass plate negatives
or 35-millimeter film

02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:50.900
or 16-millimeter motion
picture film, or wax cylinders.

02:17:50.900 --> 02:17:53.930
The preservation clock
begins almost at the moment

02:17:53.930 --> 02:17:56.170
of conception of the image.

02:17:56.170 --> 02:17:57.470
And I worry about that.

02:17:57.470 --> 02:18:00.920
I worry about it because
I care about what lasts.

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:04.400
We regularly intervene
in to work to reframe,

02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:06.820 position:56%
and reclaim, and reaffirm ownership.

02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:09.100
But if things don't last,
it's very hard to do.

02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:12.130
It's very hard to build
that reciprocal loop

02:18:12.130 --> 02:18:16.980
that the cylinder project has been
doing for quite a number of years

02:18:16.980 --> 02:18:20.640
in different ways, if we
don't have the cylinders.

02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:24.820
So, I worry about that.

02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:29.660
And I also worry about the, not
that; I've got 2 minutes, so,

02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:33.390
and 140 characters right?

02:18:33.390 --> 02:18:39.990
Not to worry about, not to make
light of Twitter or posting,

02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:43.310
but posting is not a destination.

02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:47.070
And neither is sort of
simply mining the web.

02:18:47.070 --> 02:18:52.300
It has to be done with
this notion of intent.

02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:57.360
And so, I think that when I
talk about fret I want our work

02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:01.220
to be distinctive, and because
it is so fragile I want us

02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:03.430
to understand how fragile it is.

02:19:03.430 --> 02:19:05.990
And that alone should make us
take it even more seriously.

02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:07.290
And I think it does.

02:19:07.290 --> 02:19:11.080 position:56%
And I think that's one of the things
we've heard today and yesterday.

02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:13.960
Is the fragility of this
material, and of the ideas,

02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:18.610
and of the emotions, and of the
ethics is what calls us back

02:19:18.610 --> 02:19:21.910
and makes it something
we're drawn to do.

02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:27.360
And we should understand that
and play on that, work on that.

02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:31.820
Eudora Welty said about
her own photographs,

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:36.490
if exposure is essential, still
more so is the reflection.

02:19:36.490 --> 02:19:38.670
And I think it's really
the reflection,

02:19:38.670 --> 02:19:40.310
a lot of what we've
been talking about.

02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:43.270
And you know how do we
want to reflect on work,

02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:45.600
how does work reflect on us?

02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:48.880
How can we see ourselves
in that reflection?

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:52.480
And how can we see ourselves with
other people in that reflection?

02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:55.490
It's easier than ever
to make the exposure.

02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:58.860
But what are we going to
do about it after that

02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:00.160 position:56%
and how are we going to care for it?

02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:02.930
How are we going to
make it relevant?

02:20:02.930 --> 02:20:04.230
How are we going to look down

02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:09.360
and see the word time
[applause], that I'm up.

02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:14.650
And that is really I think the
bedrock of what's been talked

02:20:14.650 --> 02:20:20.850
about across all these
things from the web

02:20:20.850 --> 02:20:23.400
to Native American communities.

02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:25.090
&gt;&gt; Thanks to Tom.

02:20:25.090 --> 02:20:28.180
I think he's to run
and catch a plane.

02:20:28.180 --> 02:20:32.170
But I think he took most
of my time, so that's.

02:20:32.170 --> 02:20:33.970
&gt;&gt; Tom Rankin: Thank you.

02:20:33.970 --> 02:20:39.260
[ Applause ]

02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:41.560
And no questions.

02:20:44.770 --> 02:20:47.340
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: Thanks
to Tom, I think he's got to run

02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:51.690
and catch a plane, but also I
think he took most of my time,

02:20:51.690 --> 02:20:57.400
so that's also, that was a
good thing, because [laughter].

02:20:57.400 --> 02:21:01.450
Well, here we are, we are
at the end of this event.

02:21:01.450 --> 02:21:06.140
And as someone said earlier,
I'm not going to say good-bye,

02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:09.090
but we will see you again,
and in fact I do want

02:21:09.090 --> 02:21:12.990
to invite everyone here if you are
going to be around this afternoon,

02:21:12.990 --> 02:21:15.960
to please come by the
American Folklife Center.

02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:19.740
We are in the building across the
street in the Jefferson Building.

02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:22.360
Staff would love to
see you this afternoon.

02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:26.650
We'd love to show you around,
show you our collections.

02:21:26.650 --> 02:21:29.830
So, come and hang out with us.

02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:33.800
I also want to say please pick
up materials as you're leaving.

02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:37.340
Certainly "Folklife and Fieldwork."

02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:40.200
If you want some copies of that,
we would love for you to take

02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:42.190
that back to where you're going.

02:21:42.190 --> 02:21:46.890
And also, just a reminder
that this has been videotaped.

02:21:46.890 --> 02:21:52.720
And it will make its way onto
our website in the near future,

02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:55.900
not immediately, but soon, soon.

02:21:55.900 --> 02:22:02.360
And finally, just a sincere
heartfelt thank you to all of you.

02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:05.190
There was so much great
dialogue here.

02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:13.250 position:56%
I think as several people commented,
and certainly as Tom commented a lot

02:22:13.250 --> 02:22:20.510
of the issues are about access, but
I think we definitely got to see

02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:25.280
that a lot of the work that we're
doing right now is revisiting some

02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:27.220
of the work from before.

02:22:27.220 --> 02:22:31.870
And these things aren't you know,
just massively, or harkening back

02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:37.010
to somebody talking about scale,
and time, and slow archiving.

02:22:37.010 --> 02:22:42.760
I think we're probably the
personification of slow archiving,

02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:46.130
but I think the last
panel, especially.

02:22:46.130 --> 02:22:51.160
I mean looking at how long
that material has been around,

02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:54.390
I mean for centuries
in the community.

02:22:54.390 --> 02:22:59.600
How the documentation has
evolved, how it's care has evolved,

02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:02.580
how the ideas about
access have evolved.

02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:05.100
And how it is being reimagined now,

02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:09.080
and how it will be
reimagined 40 years from now.

02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:12.930
It's a very humbling thing
and I think perhaps some

02:23:12.930 --> 02:23:16.790
of the what I've picked
up to day and yesterday is

02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:19.370
about kind of right sized access.

02:23:19.370 --> 02:23:21.960
I think we have many
different projects here,

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:25.830
they all demand different
care, different approaches,

02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:30.460
different solutions about how we
can make this material available.

02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:34.140
How we can get people to
engage with it going forward.

02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:37.640
And you've given us
a lot to think about.

02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:42.160
There's such incredible innovation
going on and we look forward

02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:45.970
to having continued
dialogue with everyone.

02:23:45.970 --> 02:23:51.440
And so, please keep in touch and
thank you so much, once again,

02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:55.770
and thank you for enjoying this
moment and talking about the work

02:23:55.770 --> 02:24:00.220
that we're doing for the last 40
years, and for the next 40 years.

02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:02.720
So, go forth.

02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:05.510
Thank you [applause].

02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:08.080

presentation of the Library

02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:11.520
