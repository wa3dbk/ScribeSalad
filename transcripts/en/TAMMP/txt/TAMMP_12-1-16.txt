Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr

Speaker 2:          00:00:03       going on. Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       um, it's, uh, what the fuck is it? It's um, it's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Just checking in on you. Ah, just checking in on you. Just seen how your week's going. Huh? Is it going the way you planned it? Did you have any plants? Think about that. That's like some self helps you think about that.

Speaker 3:          00:00:33       But like when you start your workweek deep, do you have a plan?

Speaker 4:          00:00:41       I mean other than getting in your car, kissing your wife or, or, or, or, or a husband or, or, or, or, or, or, or a partner or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or are, are, are, are, are, are,

Speaker 3:          00:00:51       and you drive down the street and, and an end and you get yourself a coffee

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       and you're going to work. But, but do you have a plan beyond just taking the vessel that holds your saw

Speaker 3:          00:01:06       into that workplace? Do you have a plan? Cause I'll tell you right now, God has planned, God has a plan for you and you and you and each and every one of you, but you have to listen.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       How can we know what our plan, what

Speaker 3:          00:01:34       if we don't listen? That right there is why I don't go to church. The the, the use of, of vocal dynamics they always get, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:01:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       And they come in for the whisper, right? That's how it works. It's called the Sandusky. I'm sorry, everyone from Penn state. I know your teams ranked. I know you're thinking you're going to fucking somehow slip and slide your way out of the horrors of that shower and that no asshole sports fan like me is going to bring it up. Oh No. It's going to be brought up. Jesus Christ. I'm going to take all the shit I took for some fucking air pressure. You know, you think you're going to take down one God damn statute. We all know you're going to put it back up one of these days. We all know Joey. Pause coming back up. Where you gonna put it? Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:02:27       Were you going to put it? Probably in the boosters room, right when they bring all the money in, they're all sitting there going, it's okay Joe, you didn't know it. We all know you never took a shower and fucking 60 years. Why am I, why am I doing this? I, you know what, I don't know why. Cause I've got a bunch of shit to do today and that's the first thing that came to my head. You know why? Because God, God has a plan for me. He has a plan for me to go on this podcast each and every Thursday and just checking on your week. That's my mission. You what? I finished Westworld

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       and I have to rewatch the final episode again because I didn't get it all right. Granted I was fucking nod off like a big headed drunk jackass on a cross country flight, you know, head wakened me up. I didn't quite get it. Um, but I know there's going to be a season two, so I would think there would be, I gotta I gotta figure out what the fuck happened. Uh, I'll watch it again. But it was really hard to watch it because my wife wasn't in, she wasn't into this series. So she would, every time I would watch an episode, she would come in when the song was coming on and she would just sing along. She would sing like a, a robot's focking people, people dress like cowboys something, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Blue. What does it mean? Like, I don't know, there's a certain, you know, there's certain kinds of white shit that Nia just can't watch. And I found that it's like pre, I don't know what it is. It's, there's a, I think anything pre happy days, you know, she's just like, yeah, this was not, you know, it's like the Louis CK bit. Like, you know, these weren't the good old days for us. So I think when she sees white dudes walking around in cowboy hats, yeah, she just does not get a good warm, fuzzy feeling.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       Sorry. If you could bend tune in in late to the podcast, you haven't turned tuned in lately. Um, I, I have a touch of a bola, but fortunately it's just quarantined into my trope. You know what it is, is I got this cough and then I smoked a couple of cigars and then I came back into a house where, you know, whenever they say the job is finished, it's not finished. They have their punch list and that's a, all this shit they need to do and then the jobs fucking done. So they keep kicking up dust here. And um, anyways, so, oh, Billy red velvet cake is, um, the last few weeks was not working out because he had this little bit of a cough and I am exaggerating the cough before and you guys are like, Jesus shaking my head, fuck my life. Lol. You only live once, um, all over my Twitter account.

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       I, uh, yeah, I haven't been working out or anything, so I just got on the little fucking scale and I in the five I lost. I type, I just put it right back on, you know what I mean? I'm really disappointed in myself. So, uh, I did the half hour cardio this morning. Do it with me. Here you go, everybody. I'm doing a half hour cardio every day. Every fucking day. I'm getting on that fucking elliptical and I'm going to try to lose two pounds a week, drop eight pounds, get my fucking fat freckled ass down to about a buck 75 sliding into the fucking, you know why? Because God, God wants you to be skinny. He doesn't want you, one of the seven deadly sins is that spaghetti. Oh, fatty motherfucker laying face down in his bull shit

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       from that movie seven. Um, so anyway, so I've gotten back in, I got my, I got the sports channels now. So I've been watching my bro ends. Is there a, you know, get through this fucking season here, trying to figure out what's gonna work? What does it, um, we lost it. The filthy floor. You know what sucks? It was, I watched the first two periods. It was too, nothing flyers and a very subdued, quiet fucking crowd. Two would make me feel bad. You know what I mean? Usually the Bruins and flyers get together. It's a rowdy fucking crowd, I think because we're both fucking transition. I don't, you know, and you know what happened? He looked at the standings. Maybe the flyers are good this year. I don't know. So I go out to the kitchen, you know, the brand new kitchen that's still is the fucking punch lists to make myself something to eat. And I swear to God it felt like I was gone for five minutes. I came back, it was two to two, right. Marshawn scored. I forget who else. And uh, we went into overtime and then we lost it. Sorry. No, we fucking lost it. So, and I'm kind of keep my eye on the Celtics. I know we got Sacramento next. Um, but uh, you know what's so fucking dumb was that complete non story of our center Al Horford getting criticized for four missing. Uh, I think he missed a Miami heat game because he, cause you know he was with his wife because she was giving birth to his daughter. Oh Jesus. Who has the fucking nerve to call me during my podcast. Don't you know God has a plan.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       People, when you walk away from your recorder, always make sure you take off your headphones. Cause if you don't, you're going to yank that fucker right across the Roman. Then you're going to have all that silence that you just heard. Unless I took the time to edit it out, which I probably will. I'll probably do your solid and I know what a lot of you millennials are probably saying. Actually I don't know what you're saying. You know, you probably too busy having a fucking uh, doing the mannequin challenge or something else. Really important. Um, why talk down to the youth bill? Why would you do that? Huh? Is it cause you're your everyday creeping towards death? Um, I know what you fucking technological douchebags it probably, why don't you just get some wireless headphones? You know why? Cause I think I got enough satellites pointed at my fucking head.

Speaker 1:          00:08:22       How about that? I've got enough signals going in there. I can't remember shit. I've had this cough for two weeks. He know when I'm blaming wireless headphones. You hear that echo in my office. That's cause I cleaned the fucker up a Cli, this fucker and I got rid of a bunch of shit. I organized a bunch of stuff. I shredded a bunch of shit and I'm feeling good about it. I know we're all, my stuff is, I'm, I'm selling the Prius and you're, it's funny, I have the title to every God Damn fucking car I've ever had except for one. You know, my first one, but I, I had an 88, I had an 88 fucking a Honda accord LX that I bought in like 1996, five speed. I fucking love that car. And I had it for like four or five years before I sold it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:15       When I moved back to New York. And, uh, I found a copy of that title. I found every fucking God damn title that I needed except for the fucking, the one for the car that I'm selling. So now I had to send it away. I got to send away for it, for the, uh, to the fucking DMV. So I got to do that bullshit today and do it. I get to taste something. It's laugh all you want about the Toyota Prius, say as much homophobic stuff as you want at people who drive Toyota. Paresis not only is that a great God damn car, it's got great resale value. People want that fucking car. You know Tony, that gas smells laugh all you want. Say it looks like a doorstop. Say it's gay, it's soulless. She got no balls. You know, I don't understand people that identify themselves with their car.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       I understand liking cars. I love cars. You know what I mean? But I don't like look at something that another man built an act like I had something to do with it. Like a lot of these other cons. Now it's one thing if you fucking, you know, you, you, you know whatever. You go down to the God damn junkyard like the gas monkey guys and your build it from fucking scratch. Then you can have some pride. All right? But if you're that fucking huckleberry that walks out of their lot and then buys it for four to five grand more than what you should have fucking paid for, then you walk around leaning against it as you drink an astrologer beer, right? Standing there like you won a war. I don't understand that aspect of it. Which brings me back to the Toyota Prius. All right. The Toyota Prius. Like most of you, I did not build that car. Oh right. So why are you trying to put that on to my personality? You know it takes a strong man to drive a Prius. Nia.

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       Yeah, you up?

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       What do you mean? How can you not be? You are awake earlier when I talked to you.

Speaker 2:          00:11:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       No, pull that shit. You already ruined my day with all the jobs you have for me. Can you please come up here and sing your Westworld Song?

Speaker 2:          00:11:20       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       can you do that? Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, booboo. What are you so grumpy about? The God damn door open. You're screaming at the top of your lungs. It's like, what are you doing to me? What do you want? I'm making money. What can you do a quieter? Hey, let me hear the Oh, shut up. You've already awake. That's your big complaint. That's your big complaint in life. What are you doing any other places? Well, sit here. Well, are you moving

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       on my shit? Come on man. You got to sing the song. What? Are you pregnant or something? Yeah, I just came up the stairs and I'm out of breath. Do you want from me? I'd like a little sunshine today. Do you want another microphone or what you want to be on the podcast?

Speaker 5:          00:12:11       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:12:11       no, Jesus. I got to hit pause. Liver. Catch your breath. All right. What back? Hell, Nia. I want you to show called Westworld. Please don't flashed me. Huh? I'm not flashing. Sorry. I got my bathrobe. Sorry. Like Sharon Stone right now. It's a good stay. Oh, there's the, there's the Photoshop for the fucking week. You're on your red sox row with nothing on underneath it. Yeah. Can you have a little consideration for the listeners? They don't want to think about that. Jesus Christ, they worked out. I'm a fuck a guy. You know, you take a shower, you put on a robe, you have a couple of fucking eggs. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to get all this shit done before you fucking all the crap that you decided in your head that I was doing today without checking with my schedule. Yeah, yeah, I did that. Yes you did. Okay. All right. Well no one the Westworld song.

Speaker 5:          00:13:22       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo robots. Fucking people. People dressed as cowboys. That's as far as I got fucking ruin the whole song every time I went to go watch it. Now let me ask you this, you kind of, I noticed like there's certain types of fucking white movies you don't like and cowboys is one of them. Anytime the cowboys you fucking tune out early. I'm just not particularly interested in certain areas of white history. That's what I'm saying that I called that earliest a certain things I'm just not particularly interested in. I talked to him. You don't see a lot of black cowboys in those movies. It's weird. Where were the black people there that, let's see. Well it depends on when it was. It was like the 1880s you mean they had, you know, did you guys have your own stage coaches at that point? Oh yeah. Definitely.

Speaker 3:          00:14:13       Had our own stage air shocks on him and shit on businesses. Yep. I thought you did initially and you started kicking the shit out of white people cause then it, then they went, whoa, Whoa, Hey Z. Hey z that happen right after slavery. Now there wasn't then you guys, a bunch of you got elected and shit and then acted to what? Well, cause you had numbers. Numbers for what? What are you talking about right now? I can't remember if this was a video game, if this was actually okay. No, like right after you guys got free or your sense of history is just, it's amazing. I thought like you guys got fried and then like you started

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       succeeding and then all the broke ass white people around you lie. Why? Why you don't man. And that's when they came up with the Klan. Maybe. Maybe too many of these Tarantino movies where he fucks with history. I don't know what's going on, but I thought, I thought you were doing it right. None of this, none of this is correct. I'm not a historian, but I didn't the clumps do something around then to the whole, the clumps. Who are the clumps? Eddie Murphy and fucking knows, oh, he's just being silly. Silly. All right, whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:15:21       So Nia, what? What exactly are a that that that song was a little disappointing, but I don't really have much. What was I saying? I was like Anthony Hopkins playing God.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       Yeah, you'd ruin the whole fee. Every time I would go to watch it, you'd stick your head in the room,

Speaker 3:          00:15:36       Jeffery. Right? They get there and he knew them.

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       Hbo is a bunch of perverts. They always have these shows. Everybody's just fucking naked. Ahs. Westworld, three kings, one of the, fuck. Hey, we're all in the castle. Look out for the Dragon. Game of Thrones, game of Thrones, eight year old king. Hey, we're, hey, we're all, I don't get how an eight year old guy again. How does an eight year old king fucking sentence someone to death. I never watched you just said, what'd you say? You Little Shit. I have no idea. What tip you over in that giant fucking chair. What are you gonna do about it? A little evil fucker. Dude. That kid needed the living shit kicked out of him.

Speaker 3:          00:16:15       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:16:16       Yeah, I didn't watch a lot of episodes, but if ever I could throw an eight year old off a building or a castle,

Speaker 3:          00:16:24       definitely I'd want them to live to this theories. I, I have no idea.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       I saw one of them, he pulled a guy's fucking tongue out cause he didn't like the song he was playing.

Speaker 3:          00:16:34       Yeah. There's like too much like incest and dragons and shit. I'm just that, that kind of genre. I'm not really into, although I did love game. No, not cancer. Um, uh, Lord of the rings. That was an awesome movie. But I don't know what the part of white history does that take place. It doesn't, it's make believe it's not real. I like fan like some fantasy stuff, but I don't like there's no middle earth. I don't think so. If middleware it had to vote, which way would they go? Nia? That's a good question. I don't know. You'd have to talk to some like tolken nerds for that. They might be able to tell you if they're more liberal or conservative and this fantasy in a nerds, Chris Hardwick from the Nerdist,

Speaker 1:          00:17:24       he's doing a fucking game show that I'm calling it right now is going to be the biggest hit game show since. Who wants to be a millionaire? It's called the wall. I don't know what it is, but it's fucking broke ass people who could possibly win 12 million bucks in the fact that so many people are upside down in their houses and the look of fucking hope on these people's faces. It's the APP

Speaker 6:          00:17:51       like

Speaker 1:          00:17:52       literally almost breaking down crying like you never see that on the prices, right? You don't see that on the wheel of fortune. You certainly don't see it on jeopardy, but this wall thing, they got these fucking people like, like these people are so excited to win the fucking prize in the trailer that they're going to need some sort of counseling if they lose, if they blow it. Right. Do they ever do that shit anymore on game shows? Remember back in the day when you could fucking bully people and tease him where it's like, do you want to take that money in my pocket now? I do, I number tell them. And they'd be like, and people always just like, fuck you money for it. Right then. Then they'd will listen to the crowd and there'd be 700 bucks, which could buy you like a fucking, you know, I don't know why they probably buy a mercury monarch back then or some shit and nice down payment on one.

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       Anyways, you'd put it back into the guys Ron Burgundy sport coat and then they would open up the door and half the time it'd be like a fucking donkey or a yak or some shit. And they go dunk on the tone back and do that on, let's make a deal with Wayne Brady or do they still do that? Still have that show? Yeah, he's the host of it. I've only, yeah, but this is the thing. But they all dress, they're all dressed up though. So that takes the shame away from it because you can hide in your costume back in the day you stood there and you looked like what you look like and then the next day you were walking down the street, you're like, oh my God, you're that guy that could have fucking one seven or eight minute, wait a minute. I didn't. I when we were in that, that rental home with the Campbell that only had an oldies television for some strange reason, I saw an episode of let's make a deal.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       And there was a couple that was dressed up as raggedy Ann and rack the, yeah, no, no, absolutely. And it was like in the 70s that show they did. But I'm saying that was all, there was all these other game shows where people didn't dress up and there was always the booby prize is what they called it and it was not tiddy alright, wanting something fucking nuts. This is a complete non fucking story. I started to talk about it. And then of course they'll fucking went away. And the God damn cables out, not the cable, the fucking Goddamn Internet, like press the reset button on the right, the router. So this, this Guy Al Horford who plays for the Celtics, he used to play for the Atlanta for the sellies. He used to play for the Atlanta Hawks. This year we were making a big, uh, we want to try to get Kevin Durant and then we couldn't.

Speaker 1:          00:20:13       So then evidently all the money that we were going to give him to rant, we gave three quarters of it to this Guy Al Horford give him like 130 fucking million dollars over four years or something crazy like that. Um, maybe a little less than that came out to about 28 million years. So listen to this shit. So this fucking guy, his wife has a kid, right? It has a daughter. So he misses a game and some fans bitched about it on like a social media. And it actually became like a story he thought out of game because he wanted to go to his daughter's birthday party and then a couple of Douche bags are like, oh the fog to pay

Speaker 3:          00:20:47       you all the morning put ball Lou. And then the media picked up on it and then he actually, he actually had the comment on Twitter nerds and it was like one sports show that brought it up are his priorities. What are you going to do in here if I don't show up? You know if I'm at the Rose Bowl hammered and you give birth or um, we've already, this guy don't even joke about it hammered. We've already discussed the plan for the Rose Bowl. Can I tell you something? Even if I walked into delivery room blind drunk, you can't, you're still going to be totally fine because everybody doing all the heavy lifting is there. Like I, I shouldn't even be there. I don't understand why you keep trying to like evade any kind of like role of being like my support and comfort Mike. My emotional support. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:21:42       You don't even stand in the room when I get my teeth cleaned. That's a little bit different than you think. Yeah. What if they want removing a tooth? Would you stand there and hold my fucking hand? No. For God damn sure. That is not the same thing. Why are you even bringing that up? Because it's fucking bullshit that the guy has to be in there. And every guy I talked to, nine out of 10 of them go, yeah, it's bullshit. Just stay north to the fucking blanket. And it keeps them happy. You just weren't emotionally support me. And when we went to the class the other day and you watch the birthing story, you leaned over to me and you were like, oh, I understand now I understand why. No, when he was walking with her, went walking with her in the halls, I understood that being in there for the procedure, I completely don't understand.

Speaker 3:          00:22:27       And I just think that that is one of those things that it's just one of those does that fucking hat thing that you guys do and rub right. Rub My back and be like, you got this. You're good. Just breathe like you're okay. Yeah. All that kind of, it's just like every time I walk out the fucking door and I got all this shit to do. You always throw a couple more things. Hey, go get the dry cleaning. Can you go do this? And he'd go do that and yet you're dumping your fucking, you'd taken the it off of your pile. You take the dog to the vet actually.

Speaker 7:          00:23:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:23:03       I'm not taking the dog to the vet. You're taking the dog to the vet. Okay. Yeah. I'm moving all that other shit down there. [inaudible] you're going to have some help. You're not the only, I mean, you know my brother is because you're on the podcast that you're coming with this, this fucking arrogant tone I don't know, is because of you're on the podcast and you're coming at me with this extra fucking Douchey vibe.

Oh yeah, we went to the hospital yesterday cause they, the hospital till they give you a tour of the hospital near goes, hey, let's take a tour of a couple of hospitals to see where we want to fucking deliver. So I'm like, all right, I'm thinking we'll walk around. Yeah, look at those nurses. They're pretty hot. Let's go here. Right? We fucking show up. We got to sit down in another class in and she's like, this is going to be 90 minutes long. It's like, fuck me.

Speaker 3:          00:35:06       Fuck me 90 fucking minutes. So we're sitting there and she goes to finish first. Let's go around the room and introduce each other. Say Your names and what you're having and all that. So write down, I'm like, this is going to be, by the end, I loved her. I thought she was great. But like I am, I, you know, I'm a comedian. Yeah. I don't, I don't do well in the group dynamic at seen how bad I wanted to say. My name was Russel. This lie. Yeah. I wanted to lie and I just wanted to lie about what we were having. I just wanted to lie. One of the lie through all of it's nothing, you know folk and just show me where she's going to fucking have it. I sat there for 90 minutes people, all I have to do is fucking pull up, drop her off, go to the fifth floor, make a right and I dial four numbers and I'm done. And I had to sit there for 90 minutes.

Speaker 3:          00:35:57       One hour was her talking and then 30 minute, he's a great speaker though. She was and she was adorable and she was a great mom and I loved her and they gave all the dads diaper bags at the end, which was very, very cool. I thought. But the last day always talked to us like we're dopes the last 30 minutes we actually watched guys, I mean you're going to be standing there with your fucking head up your ass. I'd so want to sit there and be like, you realize men built this hospital and all major medicine was because of men. I'm just saying they took every fucking thing when it comes to the male and female dynamic, when they talk about the guy, if there's a woman running it, the shit that they say, they always talk to us like we're fucking stupid. The exact fucking thing that all these broads who are feminists say they don't want done to them.

Speaker 3:          00:36:40       It happens all the time to us all the fucking time and look at you. You could care less the same way. I don't give a shit that you make a dollar less than hour than I do to go down to the Laverne and Shirley plant and put little caps on those beer bottles. Shimmy all shemozzle.

They got these little, these little fucking, he showed us some newborns and it was so cute. But they have a, they have a security in place these days for babies. I did not know. They had a little ankle bracelet on the thing like it, like it was on house arrest just in case somebody came into the hospital and started stealing babies, which I've never fucking heard of that ever. That. It's slowly getting, you used to having that thing now it's just on their ankle. Oh, booed. You do boop, boop, boop. And then eventually it's fucking in them telling you to get off. That's all. When the baby steps baby steps, you baby step your way into something that they have an id tag on one ankle and then they have a little

Speaker 5:          00:38:24       cool

I have a lot of friends that are no longer here. I got a couple of benefits to promote peak common. Um, this Tuesday, great friend of mine unfortunately passed away, uh, uh, about a month ago and, uh, we're having a benefit for him. Eight o'clock at the laugh factory. I'm going to be doing a bunch of time trying on all this new stuff. We're going to have a great time. And um, he really was, you know, 92 to 99. He was just somebody I saw like practically almost every day, and we had so many great gigs before he went into writing and all that type of stuff. So it's an honor to do something in his memory, um, for a, for his is wonderful kids. Um, and then we have to Patrice O'Neal benefit. Do you know yesterday was the five year anniversary? Can you believe that? Wow. I can't believe I haven't talked to him in five years. That's crazy. I'm been trashed by him. Heard him laughing. Oh yeah. And think of everything that happened. I remember when, when he speaking of sent Dusky right after he died was when all of that shit came out. And I just remember

Speaker 1:          00:41:18       just trying to imagine what he would have been talking about and I know that his angle, somehow he would've made, he would have made that absolutely hilarious. Um, but anyways, uh, the next benefit is, um, Tuesday, February 21st, um, tickets has always have been and been going along steadily. They makes a great Christmas gift. Ladies, if you want to get something for your husband, um, it's going to be Leslie Jones. Gary Gulman, Dan Soder, Jim Norton, Rich Vos, Bobby Kelly, myself, Keith Robinson. I think I got everybody know he's trying to have an eight or nine people. Um, it's such a,

I'd better not be going on after. Uh, can I just say being in the Green Room at tough crowd with Colin Quinn, with Patrice, like I dunno, like two times a week is probably the most like fun. I lacked every single day on that job and he was definitely him. Geraldo, you know, we're such like a big part of that. And like, I dunno, it's just having Patrice around saying the most offensive, like a horrible, horrible things that you can say as a man to a woman. But they were always funny. Like I can't deny the fact that like, I'd be like, fuck you, but I would be so funny. At the same time. It's like, that's the infuriating thing about comedians. It's like, it's like you guys say the most fucked up shit, but it's so funny. So it's hard to stay mad at you. So we're just fucking around. I know. No, and it's all, it's all like whatever. You shouldn't be laughing at this, but it's so,

Speaker 1:          00:43:04       well, you want to hear a classic come comedians story real cause it David tell story. Hmm. So we're at fucking standup New York and there was a little person in the room, right? I'm a little person in the comedy club. I think I kind of just fucked the whole thing up. Right. Was there. So the fucking club owner was all like, you know, okay, there's a, you know, it's a little person is, you know, at the show tonight, let's not make any joke with Bob Bland, so everybody's not doing jokes and stuff, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he says it's to Dave [inaudible]. Dave just goes, AH, okay. Yeah. Right. And he walks right up on stage in a me first thing in his mouth. He just goes, I understand. We have a little man in the room.

Speaker 3:          00:43:41       Yeah. Whole place labs. The dude laughed. Sorry. Sorry,

Speaker 1:          00:43:46       just went red line that he fucking laughed any fucking set all of this shit and the guy loved it and had a great fucking time. Yeah. And I, I dunno man, I was just one of those things where I moved. I was brand new when I saw him do that. Like to meet up to just disobey an order from a New York City club owner. I was like, oh my God. And he's still going to get spots. If I went a minute over where I was on the, on the ladder at that point, if I went over like one fucking minute. Um, David tell at a bunch of those that he did the gator growl one time, which is he went down to the swamp, which is like this fucking with the gators play football and um, you were supposed to work squeaky clean. The uh, Dean didn't want you to fucking say anything dirty. Brewer told me this story. This is another one I'm going to fuck up and cough my way through.

Speaker 1:          00:44:37       Said everybody works squeaky clean. When he was sitting there wondering how David Tell was going to handle it. And Dave came out and just did the most filthiest fucking joke from his act right up front and then looked right over at the, at the whole board of the things that he goes, fuck you Dane. This one's for this students. And the whole place went fucking nuts. And then he murdered for like a half hour and then I coughed myself to death. All right. I gotta put some clothes. Oh, Billy balled out. Hopefully Paul said you cough, your robe opens. It's a little bit more. Well, you know what, Nia, you got to tease the crowd a little. All right. That's the podcast for Thursday. Have a great weekend. Your comments. Um, and I'll talk to you on Monday there.

Speaker 5:          00:45:38       MMM.

Speaker 9:          00:45:39       Anyways, new Pope a Boston. Billy loved the podcast. Keep up the good work. Thank you. What do you make of all this news about the pope retiring? Oh Geez. Geez. Personally I'm not that religious and don't really care that much. Maybe if they elected a new pope that was young. Well that was a young, some young hot lady in her twenties I would give a shit. What do you think bill? Is there more to the story than that? They're not telling us where his age and health issues. The only reason he retired is the church covering anything up. Um, I'll come on do it. Are they covering anything up? They fucking have been. Certain percentage of them have been covering up other fucking kids.

Speaker 5:          00:46:21       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:46:21       For a long time, you know, during World War Two there was a, you know, they got in bed with the Nazis. I mean, it really is one of the worst organization as far as some of the shit that they've done, you know, but people are so wrapped into not pissing off the invisible guy in wanting to go to the happy place and get to eat marshmallows for the rest of you fall fucking eternity. That they are actually, it's really, it's, it's disturbing.

Speaker 5:          00:46:51       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:46:51       That people can still be part of that religion.

Speaker 9:          00:46:55       You know what I mean? I don't understand how, you know, the stuff that they've done. So, uh, yeah, I would say, yeah, there's probably something going on. I don't know. Maybe he said something like, Hey, you know, ah, maybe we should apologize for, uh, having that clam bake with Adolf Hitler. She'll be a maybe clear the air with that one. Hey, what do you say? Oh, we actually don't help to pay for the lawyers of the people in our organization who put their dicks in the acids of kids. You know, maybe he said something like that. I have no idea. Anyways, he said also, what are some, some of the ways that they could make the church more interesting? For example, maybe let broads become priests. I bet more people would pay attention. Or how about letting people sit in lazy boys instead of sitting and kneeling and those terrible rock hard benches they call pews.

Speaker 9:          00:47:48       I know, it's so dumb. The whole thing is to get you like you're not worthy. You're not worthy. You're not worthy. Get on your fucking knees and it's in, it's all, it's all made up by human beings taking a guess and, and other adults because they get into it as kids. They, they, I don't know why. I actually know why. Cause I believe that there was like a spirituality and I believe that you feel good when you do good things. And I just think that you can't corral that nobody owns it and you can't put a fucking like,

Speaker 2:          00:48:22       okay,

Speaker 9:          00:48:23       I think that all churches should just be philosophies rather than this, this hardened way of looking at things. Um, just the amount of death that it has caused. I don't, I'm not saying anything fucking know. You guys know how I feel on this shit. Um, finally, how about we live in up the music a bit and add some newer sounds. Maybe a little guitar and drums. Well, what you need to do is go to a Baptist church, go to a church where you don't see any white people going in there. Um, that, that would be a good one to start with. And I bet you're amazing. You'll, you'll hear people who are actually in those churches probably sing bay better than half the people who won grammys that year. I mean, how many times you've seen some emaciated whore sticking her finger in a year. Lao who trying to act like they know how to sing and what do they, what's behind them all the fucking time. It's always like fucking three black chicks or two black chicks to some black dude. I mean, that's where the music is. That's where it's coming from. If that's what you want, just fucking go there.

Speaker 2:          00:49:18       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:49:19       They're not going to give a shit. Right. They might look at you weird, but after a while, once they see you feel the music, you should be fine. You should be fine. The rest of the Shit, I dunno. I think that they should maybe update the stories every once in a while.

Speaker 2:          00:49:33       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:49:34       Maybe, uh, just make up some new shit. Just say, Oh, you know what, God, God came back again and the burning Bush said, uh, you know, let he who never a illegally downloaded the song. Just something to fucking update it. I don't know what to tell you. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:49:53       I don't know.

Speaker 9:          00:49:55       Updated, I guess. You know, there are some sort of, some of those new age,

Speaker 1:          00:49:59       the new age ones are just to scary because then somehow somebody always ends up saying there, Jesus, and the next thing you know, you're surrounded by the FBI and there's tank shooting flames at yet, or you're waiting for some aliens to come. And next thing you know, everybody's drinking some poison and you're dying of fucking bunk bed, you know, or in the middle of the jungle with some sweaty fucking Conga player or whatever the fucking that guy's name was.

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:50:25       You know, I think you're is, when it comes to us spirituality and that type of shit, I think you're really, you're better off on your own. Um, I think, you know, I think generally speaking, if you're not a psycho, you kind of know how to be a decent human being. I'm not saying that you're always succeed in it. I certainly don't, but, um, I don't know how the fuck do I put it. I would rather sit at a bar about six, seven beers in and talk to somebody else who is in the same mind frame and talk about life than I would to actually go to a church and listen to some guy up there going, Eh, any did shop day Gaddy did shop thing. Aus, hey did it for you. He died painfully. I hope you appreciated. Then I'll lay low yarrow way. We are, you're not fucking worthy. We want you to remember this. Your a of Shit. You better hope he's not mad at you. I lay Lou. Yeah. Wow. Lailu yeah, I mean who the fuck wants to sit there through that? I mean there's still telling stories about lepers.

Speaker 9:          00:52:32       Okay. There you go. There's a natural check. The whole thing is just like, as far as the Catholic way, it's just like just flogging yourself.

Speaker 9:          00:52:41       Do you understand how fucked up? But you got one fucking life. You should be out having the time of your life, you know, not hurting anybody, but having the time, you life and enjoying it because you fucking deserve it because you were lucky enough to be born a human being and not a fucking house fly. What if reincarnation is true? All right? And you're gonna fucking come back is, is uh, uh, I don't know. Something a snaky what? Those little fucking lizards sitting at Darton around. Even if you don't get eaten by a snake, you only live like 14 days. You can fucking drive a car, you know, gave you never see a lizard doing that shit.

Speaker 10:         00:53:20       Good

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       sleep.

Speaker 9:          00:54:05       Scottish, Cardinal. Oh, Brian. Cardinal O'brien apologizes for my sexual conduct. You know, I'm getting sick of people apologizing for shit and they dance around.

Speaker 5:          00:54:16       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:54:16       This guy basically to use my new word, he buggered some kids. All right? He took out his holy Cock Oleo and stuck it in their fucking uh, uh, uh, what the fuck was Jesus born in a shed? What do they always call it?

Speaker 5:          00:54:34       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:54:34       You know, at are always around Christmas. I remember what it's called. What was he boys born in a barn, but they give it some biblical, what's the name for a Biblical Barn? I don't give a fuck. Anyways, it says a Scottish cardinal who had earlier earlier challenged allegations of his sexual impropriety, claims that once again claims at once again shine an international spotlight and the alleged alleged sexual abuse evolving row involving Roman Catholic clergy reverse course Sunday. And the guy, I apologize, this is how he apologizes for Bass. I for as far as I can tell, fucking children in the ass.

Speaker 5:          00:55:10       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:55:11       He said, I wish to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest. Archbishop. And cardinal

Speaker 9:          00:55:26       in recent days, certain allegations which have been made against me have become public initially. There are anonymous and nonspecific nature led me to contest them to those I have offended. I apologize and ask forgiveness to those. I've offended. You know, I've been lucky enough in my life to have never been unwantedly fucking banged in the ass by a fucking priest. But I don't, I think I can be empathetic enough and say that if this was happening, at no point would I be turning around going, you know, that's what you're doing is really offensive. I find this, you know what the fuck.

Speaker 9:          00:56:12       When you apologize, you should have to say what the fuck you did. And if you're going to talk like this, there should be somebody obnoxiously yelling off the mic like what you did like during this should have been like, I wish to take each opportunity to admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest. Yeah. And it's a fucking human being. You're not supposed to fuck kids. And regent days, certain allegations fucking of children which have been made against me have become public Bob flock and tie. Initially there are anonymous and nonspecific nature led me to contest them. How many different ways to play it? You talk, you're fucking dead to put in their ass. You get the point. Um, good lord to those. I have offended to those you're raped. You're a fucking rapist. And like, like how like he tries to tie in the fact that he's a priest like below the standards expected of me as a priest, Archbishop, archbishop and Cardinal.

Speaker 5:          00:57:23       Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:57:23       So like what if you, if you were a pope that was okay or was it because you never became a pope? So these guys basically been dental and kids ever since he got into that fucking hurt. How is that thing still in business is just fucking do,

Speaker 5:          00:58:08       hey, what's going on?

Speaker 11:         00:58:10       It's the Monday morning podcasts that I'm actually doing this week on a Sunday just because tomorrow, um, I have to uh, have to be on set. Yeah, look at me. Big Time. Hollywood guy. Sorry people, I don't have time for you tomorrow. I have to be on set. Oh, you like that for us. I'm actually shooting. I'm shooting something tomorrow, so I got to do that tomorrow. There you go. You like, you like how I worked at in, you guys didn't even ask me. I didn't have to tell you. I'm one of those guys. I arrogantly work my resume into every sort of conversation. You think it's going to rain tomorrow? Well, you know, when I was taping, I love the 80s. They were telling me that tomorrow it's supposed to, you know, people do that. Then you want to fucking do something violent or maybe, maybe not.

Speaker 11:         00:59:00       Maybe not. Maybe people aren't like me. It makes you realize what a fucking angry asshole I am. Um, on a whole nother level. This past month, I just, uh, I'm just really, uh, difficult to be around and um, that's it. Say, yeah, it's a fucking, it's a pretty hardcore moment to have with yourself. Stay yourself in the mirror and to be like, dude, if I could somehow walk out of this fucking situation, I would. And I was supposed to be here with you. So, um, anyways, I hope everybody had an, uh, a nice, happy thanksgiving. I hope you had a good time. And, uh, I had a great one and a I fucked up last week though. I was, I was, I had done basically like, you know, seven attempts at this podcast and uh, you know, trying to make sure I was thanking everybody and I totally fucked up on the seventh take and I forgot to thank uh, Michael Hanes, the uh, the announcer for the Colorado avalanche.

Speaker 11:         01:00:01       A Guy I met on the road, whoever dental, he likes my comedy and found out I was a hockey fan. So the, he the fuck it avalanche. We're playing the kings hooked me up with some tickets and interviewed me in between periods, you know, like I was fucking Diane Cannon at a Laker game. You know, it's sort of a drop off with celebrity when he got, when you go to the La King game, you know you go to La Laker game, you know, who are you going to get? You know you got Jack Nicholson fucking Willsmith, all those guys. Even if he go to a clippers game, Billy crystal sits court side along with that black dude from a different world where that guy with the glasses, the round John Lennon glasses. But when you go to a kings game, now that John Candy died, actually when did he die? He died a long time ago.

Speaker 11:         01:00:50       But ever since he died, the kicks, I like that. That's like, it's classic La. When Gretzky showed up then all and all the fucking people came out, you know, and then he leaves and John Candy dies. That was sort of a combo, you know, boom, boom. And everyone's like, fucking, I'm not going to go there. So now, what am I trying to say here? I'm trying to say that if they Yanka celebrity out of the fucking stands at a kings game, you're going to get somebody at my level, basically a non celebrity who hasn't had the decency to at least become fat or an an addict. So you could enjoy me on a reality show. I am a responsible, semi noticeable human being who pays his bills on time. And if that isn't compelling, I don't know what it is. Actually, you know some, I went to La Kings game one time a long time ago back at the La Forum and I saw, uh, I saw, why am I thinking Mike Adam Lee, it's not Mike anime.

Speaker 11:         01:01:47       That was the host of NFL 81 with Bryant Gumbel. I'm totally going. Who's the fucking guy who did a he? Jesus Christ. He was the announcer when, ah, the miracle on ice. Uh, Michael Al Michaels, Jesus Christ, they go al Michaels was there, big fan of hockey. I saw him and I really wanted to say something to him, but he had, I could see the wrinkles in his forehead that he was like, I know, I know you like me, but please I'm here with my kid. And I was like, all right. And we set it all with the wrinkles in our foreheads. Pretty amazing moment. You know, I've always had that kind of connection with people to be know, like communicate through the third eye. Um, all right. If you knew to my podcasts where the fucking event, I've been doing them for over a year, you know? No, now what you jumping on the bandwagon because I'm finally over 20 listeners, you know, because I actually got a compliment today from somebody in a jolly old England.

Speaker 11:         01:02:46       I got something in England. Listen to this shit. He liked that. I'm on two different continents, so it's not numbers, it's not the amount of people you have listening to your podcast. It's the amount of, of uh, of countries. All right, look at me. I'm going global just like everybody else, just like everybody else. So, uh, so anyways, um, could I really do the podcast and I'll talk about the guy who got trampled at Walmart. I mean, if it's just fucking unbelievable, I just don't, I, you know, how bad is the fucking economy that, you know, some guy opening the door to a fucking store that sells garbage cans, shack it's, and fucking rakes gets trampled to death. What the fuck were those people running for? I Dunno. I like, are they trying to say people broke down the door? I really don't think they did. I think that they were being pressed up against it. If you're first in line, why are you going to break down the door? You know, think about that analogy. You want to be extra first. That doesn't make any sense. And people were pushing from behind. They basically created a, they had general seating like the who in Cincinnati. He can't fucking do that shit. And for years, right? Every, every year at Christmas, you see the doors, they burst open. There's always a big black girl loses her fucking wig when she falls on the ground.

Speaker 11:         01:04:10       And it always a dirty white dude with the wranglers and one of his pant legs gets ripped off as he tries to come in through the, the overnight mailbox. You know, it was inevitable. It was fucking inevitable. What of God damn way to go. That's I absolutely fucking tragic. And I don't even know why I brought it up. I just, I can't get over it. I can't get over that. Somebody died doing that. You know how you supposed to die at Walmart? You know, I dunno. Maybe you stocking the shelves. He just come fucking slamming down on that linoleum floor. Even then coma benefit, you know, you get to meet the local sports hero. You know, you're out on long island. Bill Guerin comes in and signs of fucking island, his jersey, his just fucking, and you know, you know, you're not supposed to die a Walmart. That's just, that's like a really, I dunno. What do you guys think about that? Do you think Walmart is at fault there? Keep me for years. You know, I don't, I don't know who's at fault there. I mean Walmart, you know, they come into the town, they basically fucking fuck over every small business there. Now, I bet all those people with small business owners, they don't have any fucking money now. So now they're pressed up against the glass. Oh my God, I need to get a rake.

Speaker 11:         01:05:36       It's fucking nine. Open the doors. I mean, they literally created that fucking thing. Jesus Christ went, why don't I read before I do these? I really build. And they literally created what in your head. You fucking moron. All right, let's get to the podcast questions. Like I said, if you're new to my podcast, people send me questions. Uh, they send me comments. They, uh, they tried to educate me on certain things and I them, but it doesn't happen so much that way because I'm a moron. So let's get to the first question of the week. Question number one. Boy Did I even think Michael has. Yeah. So Michael, thank you very much for putting me on in between periods, man. That was a, uh, it was unbelievable. And, uh, they actually let me, had given Peter McNabb let me hang out as the game started and I really realized how hard it is to tell stories as you're watching the game.

Speaker 11:         01:06:25       Like I couldn't even focus and I actually talked over a goal. I was elite in the middle of telling a story during a breakaway and I didn't even, I'm so into trying to be funny on TV. I didn't notice that it was like a fucking two on one and then the guy scored. So I had to cut my story short by saying, oops. I was like, yeah. Then my dad was crazy. Oops. That's what I literally said. Oops. On national television at that point I wanted to crawl out the studio, but it was still awesome. Anyways. All right, here we go. Podcast questions of the week. Question number one, Bill, have you ever been confronted by midgets about your bit midgets or done it in front of midgets? Um, actually, uh, I had a, uh, I had a small person, whatever you supposed to call them, send me an email.

Speaker 11:         01:07:15       And the bit was basically, I don't understand why the word midget is offensive, you know, it's not like Mitch, it's foot dragged here from another country, you know, packed into a boat, you know, the whole Amistad thing and then fucking forced to uh, you know, have them in 38 of their friends crawl out of a car in the middle of a circus. You know, I did jokes like that, you know, I don't understand. You know, it's just a word that's a table. That's the lamp and you're a midget. That's how the joke went. Plus Niche. It sounds tough. Fucking midget, you know. But then this guy actually a little person actually wrote me and said, actually midget is offensive because it came, I get somebody on Barnum, Bailey came up with it and it, it's actually a form of the word and Mitch, which I guess is some sort of little bug.

Speaker 11:         01:08:02       So it somehow came out of that. So you basically say, Mitch, you just saying that they're just a little, little bug that you could just step on. I'm going to be tier one of their legs off and watch them run around in a circle. So yeah, it is offensive. So I have been confronted, um, you know, some left last night, somebody did a joke about a dwarf and there was a, I think a little person in the crowd and, uh, I looked over at him, so their face, you know, sorta crinkle up a little bit. Like even on a holiday weekend, I have to deal with this and I felt a little bad for him. I try not to look at the crowd when I talk because uh, you know, I got a lot of shit that could bug people. Can I answer that? Okay. Question number two, Bill.

Speaker 11:         01:08:45       I want to be a standup comedian. Do you want to be a standup comedian? Sure. We all do. We hear it. The Vri. Um, okay. Dave said on insight, I'm assuming this is Chappelle sent on inside the actor's studio, that if you want to be a standup comedian, you have to take acting lessons. Did you take acting lessons? Uh, yes, I have. Although you would never know it if you ever saw me act. Thank you. Um, yeah, I've taken acting lessons and uh, I haven't taken them in a while, but, um, I dunno why. I Dunno why I stopped taking acting lessons. Why did I, you know, why? Cause I hated the classes. They were too fucking long and then I was always, um, I dunno, I would, it was always like that one person who, who, uh, who sucks so bad that it made me want to quit the class.

Speaker 11:         01:09:43       You know, we used to call them bathroom, bathroom break guy. Like, you know, like when they went up to do this scene, you went to go take a bathroom break. But I would tell you this, if you want to become a comedian, I mean, I don't know if acting helps you stand up or not, but I know it definitely helps you when you get to the next level of this business when you have to shoot something like I do tomorrow, that a, if you've taken acting lessons that you had, you know, you actually know how to do it. So, um, I mean if you wanted to be a comedian, just write five minutes of shit you think's funny. Sign up for an open mic when they call your name, go up there. Um, you know, you'll be fine. You don't have to recite Shakespeare, but, um, as you get going along, I would definitely take acting classes, improv classes for as much as comedians make fun of it.

Speaker 11:         01:10:27       Improv class has really helped you. Uh, I think enacting, because you're literally improving with other, another person in stand up is so solitary. You're just standing on stage in and with the crowd, but it's still all you and you don't really have to wait for someone else. I could go on forever about this shit. So yeah, right. Five minutes of Shit you think's funny and um, sign up for an open mic and then, you know, once you get that thing going, take, take anything. Sketch a sketch class as many things as you can learn. I would, you know, I mean, the amount of times I kicked myself for not learning how to tap dance. I mean I just can't tell. No, Kim. I was just thinking back to the Vaudeville days when you had to be a triple threat. Funny. Be able to dance and sing before it became, you know, it's like the NFL.

Speaker 11:         01:11:16       You just, I just play on special teams. You know I'm the long snapper. You ever feel like football teams back in the 20s they had like eight guys on him. All right. Question number three. All right, Bill. Tonight, me and my friends were having an art. We're having an argument about ac DC. He was saying how Angus young is hands down the coolest motherfucking guitar player of all time. While I agree with that, I just think it's time for him to lose the schoolboy outfit. I mean, isn't a dude like approaching 60 believe it or not, Angus is only 53 years old. He made it when he was like 19 or 20 he was born in 1955 Malcolm young was born in 1953 and bond Scott I believe, was born in 1946 okay. I just established that I'm a geek. Now let's get back to ACDC.

Speaker 11:         01:12:02       You know what, I got to agree with you. I think a actually read an article recently where he was talking about, Angus was talking about having to put on that schoolboy outfit and he said, and quote unquote, I have to become that guy. But um, I dunno, that's a very like I would totally, I don't know. What would it look like if Angus actually puts some jeans on and started bouncing around the stage like that? It would definitely take a minute. But you're really fucking with, uh, the whole formula and ACDC formula has never wavered. They're like, we're singing about balls, the devil and Pussy and drinking and they have not veered away from that for over 33 years. So I mean, I don't know if you put pants on, is the whole house of cards come down? I think it would take a minute, but I wouldn't have a problem.

Speaker 11:         01:12:57       I wouldn't have a problem you put pants on. I really would not have a problem with it. Um, you know what they should do? They should do an ACDC unplugged where they still play electric. But Angus gets to sit down and around with all the other band members kind of like on Elvis has come back special where it was still like electric. Well, so, ah, Mama, remember that one? All right. Um, all right, question number four. So not even answer that, do I think it's time to like, I wouldn't bother me, but I can definitely see why he continues to wear that outfit because a, I wouldn't want to fuck with that formula. So podcast question number four. Hey Bill, I signed up for your email list. Uh, thanks for the confirmation email. Very corporate like, yeah, fuck you. Like I got a guy running my website a little bit.

Speaker 11:         01:13:47       What do you want from me? You know, we, we basically have, you know, my email list on my website. Basically what happens is people who have an AOL email, if two of them mark you as spam, you get kicked off the Internet. So I'm trying to get rid of all the, all people who don't want me. That's why I sent that out. Okay. And that's why we confirmed it. Okay. Anyways, he says, I'm 19 and I haven't sex since 2006. Jesus Christ. Where's this going? When I was 16 years old, well first of all, I'm not sympathetic because I didn't lose my virginity until I was fucking 19. Um, I dunno what the Hell's going on. Uh, and I wanted to know how long your longest dry streak was and how you ended it. Well, I just ruined the joke the first 19 years of my life.

Speaker 11:         01:14:33       Uh, how did I end it? I met some chick who sang in a band who was fucking about 37 years old and I think you can fill in the blanks. Um, okay. Well I don't want you saying once, once I was in the game, what's the longest I went? Uh, I think the first fucking year and a half, maybe two years of my comedy career. I swear to God, I was finishing college. I was living at home with my parents and I was doing standup at night. I mean, I barely had time to rub one out. Not to mention, I had like, you know, people say I had, I have no game with women. If you know in technically there's no way to be lower than ground zero. Somehow I was, I was below, I was below ground zero. Have no game with women to the point like, do you ever hear the end of whole lot of love when Robert Plant's sings the echo of what he's about ready to sing comes first to indicate that he's in hell.

Speaker 11:         01:15:36       That's like when I would hit on girls, the echo of the awful line that I was going to say to them that that would come out first. And then my awful said they were already walking away before I opened my mouth. So probably about two years. So what are you on your about two years? Yeah, but dude, you know some, I know another comic he got laid at like 14. He didn't get laid again until he was like 18. Um, don't worry about it. You know, how can you get out of it? It's just, it's a numbers game. Just, you know what, rub one out before you go out. So that takes the pressure off. Now you don't give a shit and then just go out there and start saying the shit that your brain is telling you. Not to say like, don't say that that will offender. That's the kind of shit you need to start saying. I mean, I don't mean walk up to her and just be like, Hey, what's up? You fucking can't.

Speaker 11:         01:16:27       I'm not saying say that. I'm just saying that. You know what I mean? I can't even think of a fucking example. Just, I dunno. He just, you know, and you start steering the conversation towards sex and when she acts like she's offended, just tell her that she's not offended. You know? You know, you just do that shit. You just keep it. It's one of those things you just have to learn. You have to learn what your style of being an asshole is. This is if you're going to try to get laid, if you want to meet the woman of your dreams, don't do that. Then you have to, I guess listen to your heart. And I have no idea why. It just made me feel creepy. Um, which is probably why not married. Okay. Um, all right, let's move along. Okay. Question number five. Thank you.

Speaker 11:         01:17:08       Thank you. Thank you. In large capital letters, they're like, I forgot the word capital, so I had to say large so I could buy time in my brain to come up with capital capital's okay. Um, I'm so tired of people trashing conspiracy theory. All this was last week. Why defendant can sips conspiracy theory. I'm so tired of people trashing conspiracy theory without looking into it. I'm not saying that all of the theories are valid, but I also think people have a tendency to be, to be questionless sheep. I just want to say thank you for telling those fucks to think for themselves a bit. Um, yeah, I mean, I wasn't going in that hardcore. Yeah. But I definitely think, yeah, people just, yeah, if it's on TV, it's true. If it's on the Internet, then if that's the Internet's were all the lies are, that's kind of like racism.

Speaker 11:         01:17:50       Like all the racist white people are just in the south, but everybody in Connecticut is cool. You know, those, that type of mindset. Anyways, here's this question. Why aren't you coming to Chicago anytime soon? Make it happen is all I'm saying. Jesus Christ. All right. I'm very demanding. Um, while I was there in March when me and I don't know where the hell you are, there's a lot of cities out there. I try to come through about once a year. Chicago is definitely on my, uh, I felt like a politician right now. Yeah, we're definitely looking into that and uh, it's definitely on the agenda and when the time is right, we're going to handle the situation in Chicago Nets. Next question please. All right Phil, how many emails do you get with the word dude in the subject? Probably a shit ton. Here's another one. Deal with it.

Speaker 11:         01:18:39       You know, so I think people are starting to feed off my attitude where you guys are being assholes to me for no reason. Kind of like how I'm assholes to people. The West me questions for no reason. All right, Bill. I was making my breakfast and my 900 square foot, $450,000 condo this morning, attempting to determine what, which optane of gasoline I was going to use to burn down my bank. Okay. And then finally, this bailout ass raping, uh, really clicked. I mean, I knew we were getting bent over the table on this whole deal, but not in such an obvious manner. Our government is taking our money via taxes, getting it to bank so they can loan us our own money back and interest that fucking taking our money so they can loan it back to us for more money. And the cop mitigating ass clowns in Washington are all voting yes on this shit.

Speaker 11:         01:19:33       How the fuck did this happen? Um, I mean, I don't know, I'm not in the Senate, but I would imagine that if you print the money, you have enough money to pay off politicians. So they basically do whatever the banks want them to do. I mean, I dunno, it's, it's brutal. I'm trying to get out from underneath the house of Rothschild trying to get out from underneath the red shield. That's what I'm doing. Um, yeah. I don't know what to tell you do. How do they do it? Because they're the guys run and shit. And uh, if you can just print, what would you do if you could print money, you know, and everybody accepted the money that you are printing. I mean I could you handle that level of power. I I couldn't, you know, and what if your job depending on, you know, dependent on doing what those guys wanted you to do.

Speaker 11:         01:20:28       I mean they were right above you. I guess you would do it right. I have no idea. You know what's fascinating? That's like I said, like those, that's like one of those will Smith summer blockbuster movie kind of plots. I don't know why they're voting yes on it. I think some are voting yes on it because they want to keep their positions. I don't think other people are voting yes on it cause they don't really understand it. Kind of like make like you just think, well, if we own the old billion dollars, why don't they just print $1 billion? Just pay it off. And the reason is because I guess you still owe the money to the bank because the Federal Reserve Princeton and you've got to pay interest on the billion dollars. So you'd never get out of debt. I Dunno, I can't even fucking explain it anymore. Probably sound like a moron, which I am.

Speaker 11:         01:21:19       I've been really meaning to read that book the case against the Federal Reserve. I really have been. All right. Question number seven. Hey, just wondering if you have a version of the aristocrats joke and what you thought of that documentary Jillette made of it. Um, I don't think Penn, I don't think Penn Jillette made that documentary. I was a, I'm like, God, I just went blank on his name. It's another comedian who made that. Maybe I can Google it, um, on, anyways, it's like Google this. I am DB it Paul Paul Provenza, he's a guy. Made it. Paul Provenza directed that. Um, anyways, let me get back to the questions here. Was, I have an incoming call. I gotta wrap this podcast up here. All right. What did I think about a, do I have a version? Do I have a version of the aristocrats jokes? No, I don't. And I never heard of that joke until I saw the, uh, the documentary on it.

Speaker 11:         01:22:14       I bet in a lot of green rooms and in 16 years coming up on 17 years of doing stand up, I've never, I never even heard the joke. So, uh, but I thought I liked the movie. I thought it was funny and Bob Saget was my favorite because he seemed to be the guy, like he was improving so much that he was making himself laugh at all the filthy shift that he was coming up with. Um, and yeah, if you haven't seen it, I would definitely run it cause I think it's a funny, funny documentary. There you go. And it's Paul Provenza not pendula. Alright. And I don't even look that up, but I, I'm pretty sure that's true. All right. Question. Are you drinking again so that I can buy you a bear when you come to Tampa? Yes, I am. I am drinking again. Um, that's the name of my neck.

Speaker 11:         01:22:58       Stand up. Special Bill Berg drinking again. I'm going to come on stage, completely shit faced and just fucking berate people. I'm glad to see that you're finally coming by the way. And what better time than January. Well, what happens in Tampa in January? I guess I'm getting out of the winter. Um, all right. Overrated. Underrated. Before I wrap up this podcast, overrate it, Barack Obama. Seriously, the guy was senator for two years and he hasn't even taken office yet. And people think he's the second coming. I'm not hating on the man, but I'm not ready to worship him yet. Um, well I think a lot of it has to do with, uh, you know, just the last eight years have been a little rough without getting too political, you know, I mean, George Bush literally should have been doing speeches with a flashlight under his chin. He was so busy scaring the shit out of people for the last eight fucking years.

Speaker 11:         01:23:47       I think it's just going to be a relief to have somebody come in. Uh, you know, Jesus Christ, just somebody different, somebody different. But yeah, I mean of the elders, you know, just feel good thing. Yeah. We elected a black guy. That means we're not as ugly a country as we were before. You know, I don't know. I think everybody's life is in the shitter and that, just hoping that somebody can do something. But I definitely agree with you. If you're waiting for one guy to take that office and to turn your life around you, uh, you know, it's kind of like when I get in this business, you get a manager and an agent, you're like, well, I guess I don't need to do any more work. They just going to bring shit to me. It doesn't work that way. All right. Underrated. Playoff hockey.

Speaker 11:         01:24:31       Every round is so fucking intense. And the fact that they play a seven game series makes the drama in the bad blood continue for one game to the next. Uh, I would definitely say that I think the NHL package is a underrated. I have that. Here's the last one and then I'm wrapping this up for this week. Um, overrated. I love this one. This is such a great one. Overrated first impressions. Uh, my first impressions are wrong. Most of the time, society needs to drop the significance of first impression. There go, there goes me generalizing. Maybe. Um, I just have horrible judgment. Now you don't, I think that's great. Yeah. My first impressions are mostly wrong and people's first impressions of me, a lot of times the wrong, um, I think they are my girlfriend staring at me right now. Like bullshit. You know, I fuck you.

Speaker 11:         01:25:22       It's true. This is the deal. You know what? This is what, this is what I found. If you're a quiet person and you meet an, an a, uh, an insecure person, they misinterpret your quietness for arrogance and they start thinking, this guy thinks he's fucking better than me. Then they think you're a Douche bag. That's what people used to think of me before I became a loud mouth asshole and removed all doubt that I am an arrogant cunt. But a lot of shy, a lot of people considered arrogant are, are not arrogant. They're fucking, you know, that doing what I'm doing, they're being quiet because they're questioning everything they did in the last 17 minutes. I don't know if that makes sense, but I definitely think that's true because I, you know, there's a number of people I thought were dicks when I first met him and it turned out that I was the Dick.

Speaker 11:         01:26:11       And then there's been other people I've been like, you know, this guy's a cool fucking guy. He's a real cool guy. And then they turn out to be a complete psycho. So, uh, I dunno, I don't know what to tell you what, that, that's like that thing where he went for every saying there's another saying that can fucking cancel it out. Penny saved is a penny earned. You've got to spend money to make money, walk softly, carry a big stick greasy wheel. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. You know what I mean? Does that even make sense? I don't fucking know. Cause, yeah, your first impressions, you know, your mind might be wrong, but then you gotta go with your gut, you know, that got that says, uh, I shouldn't turn this trek because I think this person's going to snap my neck. You know, it's the prostitute that listens to that.

Speaker 11:         01:26:57       They're the ones they get to continue living the dream of sucking cock until they're 55, you know, and finally having enough money to get out from underneath their pimp to go to night school. Those are the ones because they listen to that gut. But I got to admit, yeah, I would have to go with you on the first, uh, that I mentioned. I bought a Credenza and you believe that most adult thing I ever did, I like looking at him pretending like I have some sort of official business to do. Um, okay. That's it. And uh, other than that, um, well I got, I got Carolyn Carolyn's coming up this week. I got a brand new hour for you. So all you bastards who are still full of Turkey, um, hit the fucking treadmill and come down to the club. I got a brand new, our shit that I'm really proud of and I'm putting it together and hopefully I'll be taping another special next year so I can get on this doing a special every two, two and a half years.

Speaker 11:         01:27:49       So why can have some sort of body of work at the end of this shit? But I will not take any special before its time. What, what fucking, what, what a, what? Advertise. And we will serve no wine before it's time. No, fuck was that, I can't remember. Anyways, that's it. Everybody have a good week. And, uh, keep the podcast questions coming. And people keep asking me if I'm going to be on Facebook. Um, I like my space. You know what I mean? I, you know, I like, I gotta be loyal somewhere in my life. I'm sticking it out with these fucking guys. And, uh, you know, I'm going to go through a couple of rough years with my space when, when we look in, like, I'm still wearing bell bottoms, but eventually it's going to come back in style again. And you guys can all be like, oh yeah man, I'm fucking back on my space again.

Speaker 11:         01:28:36       And I'd be like, Oh yeah man. Well I never fucking left. So that means I'm cooler than you and that'll make me feel good for six minutes before it become miserable again. All right everybody, thank you so much for listening to the podcast. I hope you all have a great week. Thanks again to Michael Hanes for letting me sit in on the ass game. Sorry, I didn't think last week I fucking space cause I'm a moron. And uh, how about those broken? Any hockey fans out there hiding Canadian out there? How can we not talking to any shit? You like those two watts as you took it, the hands of the points this month. And Are you singing jackasses? Goddammit. The fucking, you gotta respect the Canadian. So I saw him the other night coming back against the buffalo Sabres. So sons of bitches, those fucking people start singing.

Speaker 11:         01:29:19       It's like gladiator. And all of a sudden though, does, if they start skating faster and then you just know they're going to score that goal to fucking tie it up every God damn time. It's like watching Derek Jeter, guy on his tie and runs on second, you know he's going to slap, it's a right. He's going to go the other way with it. He's going to hit a double, you know he's actually going to do okay for all you fucking American League pitchers. He's going to look for fast ball. The first pitch, that's what he does, and he tries to pull it every fucking time. In that situation, that's what he looks for. Okay? But then if you give it to them out over the plate, he'll kill. Take what he gives you and then he slaps it to right field. All right, so why don't you throw a high fucking inside fastball that the bottom drops out of and at least get strike one on the fuck. Can you please do that?

Speaker 11:         01:30:04       Okay. Sorry. It's got a little upset there. I actually, you know, next time I go, I know when I'm in New York, if you're a Yankee fan and he'd come out to my Caroline show, uh, if you want to see my impression of Derek Jeter at taking a strike right down the center of the plate, if you want me to do that impression, um, just yell out there in the show. I'm actually encouraging people to heckle me. What am I doing? Or whatever. After the show, I'll give you my impression of Derek Jeter. Add Bat standing there that does not move off the shoulder and it's a strike right down the center of the plate. Without a fucking doubt, it is a strike. A goddamn moron could call it a strike. I will do my impression of his body language taking strike right down the plate. How many different times you're going to explain it. All right, I'm done. Have a great day.
