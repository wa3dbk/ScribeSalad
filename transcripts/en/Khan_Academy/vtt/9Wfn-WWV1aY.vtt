00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.590
I will now introduce you to
the idea of a homogeneous

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.840
differential equation.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.580
Homogeneous is the same word
that we use for milk, when we

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.490
say that the milk has been--
that all the fat clumps have

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.640
been spread out.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.690
But the application here,
at least I don't see the

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.510
connection.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.340
Homogeneous differential
equation.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.880
And even within differential
equations, we'll learn later

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.180
there's a different type
of homogeneous

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.950
differential equation.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.050
Those are called homogeneous
linear differential equations,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.210
but they mean something actually
quite different.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.930
But anyway, for this purpose,
I'm going to show you

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.640
homogeneous differential
equations.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.190
And what we're dealing
with are going to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.750
be first order equations.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.450
What does a homogeneous
differential equation mean?

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.110
Well, say I had just a regular
first order differential

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.650
equation that could be
written like this.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:57.140
So dy dx is equal to some
function of x and y.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.350
And let's say we try to do this,
and it's not separable,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.900
and it's not exact.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.985
What we learn is that if it can
be homogeneous, if this is

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:09.680
a homogeneous differential
equation, that we can make a

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.860
variable substitution.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.310
And that variable substitution
allows this equation to turn

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.710
into a separable one.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.690
But before I need to show you
that, I need to tell you, what

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.550
does it mean to be
homogeneous?

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.310
Well, if I can algebraically
manipulate this right side of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310
this equation, so that I can
actually rewrite it.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.890
Instead of a function x and
y, if I could rewrite this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.990
differential equation so that
dy dx is equal to some

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.440
function, let's call that G,
or we'll call it capital F.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.410
If I can rewrite it
algebraically, so it's a

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.090
function of y divided by x.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.790
Then I can make a variable
substitution

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.350
that makes it separable.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.870
So right now, it seems
all confusing.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.120
Let me show you an example.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.800
And I'll just show you the
examples, show you some items,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.850
and then we'll just do
the substitutions.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.100
So let's say that my
differential equation is the

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.216
derivative of y with respect
to x is equal to

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:12.170
x plus y over x.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.100
And you can, if you'd like,
you can try to make this a

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.380
separable, but it's not
that trivial to solve.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.240
Or at least, I'm looking at an
inspection, and it doesn't

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.130
seem that trivial to solve.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.860
And as we see right here,
we have the derivative.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.870
It's equal to some function
of x and y.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.570
And my question is to you, can
I just algebraically rewrite

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.270
this so it becomes a function
of y over x?

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.240
Well, sure, if we just divide
both of these top terms by x.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.380
This is the same thing as
x over x plus y over x.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.110
This equation is the same
thing as dy over

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.310
dx is equal to this.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.970
Which is same thing as
rewriting this whole

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.300
equation-- I'm going to switch
colors arbitrarily-- as this,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.890
dy over dx is equal to x divided
by x is equal to 1, if

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.120
we assume x doesn't equal 0.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.790
Plus y over x.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.340
So you're probably wondering
what did I mean by a function

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.650
of y over x?

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.090
Well, you can see it here.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.070
When I just algebraically
manipulated this equation, I

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.350
got 1 plus y over x.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.350
So if I said that y over x is
equal to some third variable,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.750
this is just a function of
that third variable.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.330
And actually, I'm going
to do that right now.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.140
So let's make a substitution
for y over x.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.380
Let's say that v-- and I'll do v
in a different color-- let's

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.550
say that v is equal
to y over x.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.380
Or another way, if you just
multiply both sides by x, you

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.240
could write that y
is equal to xv.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.060
And we're going to substitute v
for y over x, but we're also

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.050
going to have to substitute
dy over dx.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.530
So let's figure out what
that is in terms of the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.520
derivatives of v.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.640
So the derivative of y with
respect to x is equal to--

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.750
what's the derivative of
this with respect to x?

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.970
Well, if we assume that v is
also a function of x, then

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.350
we're just going to use
the product rule.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.790
So the derivative of x is 1
times v plus x times the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.700
derivative of v with
respect to x.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.290
And now, we can substitute this
and this back into this

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.070
equation, and we get--
so dy over dx,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.000
that is equal to this.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.440
So we get v plus x dv dx, the
derivative of v with respect

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.450
to x, is equal to-- that's just
the left hand side-- it's

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.370
equal to 1 plus y over x.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.900
But we're making this
substitution that v is equal

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.720
to y over x.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.790
So we'll do 1 plus v.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.190
And now, this should be pretty
straightforward.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.720
So let's see, we can subtract
v from both

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.970
sides of this equation.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.980
And then what do we have left?

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.620
We have x dv dx is equal to 1.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.670
Let's divide both sides by x.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.490
And we get the derivative of
v with respect to x is

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.710
equal to 1 over x.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.110
It should maybe start becoming
a little bit clearer what the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.980
solution here is, but let's
just keep going forward.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.150
So if we multiply both sides by
dx, we get dv is equal to 1

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.120
over x times dx.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.440
Now, we can take the
antiderivative of both sides,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.130
integrate both sides.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.490
And we're left with v is equal
to the natural log of the

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.530
absolute value of x plus c.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.680
And we are kind of done, but it
would be nice to get this

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.180
solution in terms of just y and
x, and not have this third

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.980
variable v here.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.390
Because our original problem was
just in terms of y and x.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.100
So let's do that.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.230
What was v?

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.765
We made the substitution that
v is equal to y over x.

00:05:49.765 --> 00:05:52.850
So let's reverse substitute it
now, or unsubstitute it.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:00.790
So we get y over x is equal to
the natural log of x plus c,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.840
some constant.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.770
Multiply both sides times x.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.510
And you get y is equal to
x times the natural

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.590
log of x plus c.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.490
And we're done.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.340
We solved that seemingly
inseparable differential

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.320
equation by recognizing that it
was homogeneous, and making

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.320
that variable substitution
v is equal to y over x.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.540
That turned it into a separable

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.700
equation in terms of v.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.150
And then we solved it.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.290
And then we unsubstituted
it back.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.390
And we got the solution to the
differential equation.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.410
You can verify it for yourself,
that y is equal to

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.520
the x natural log of the
absolute value of x plus c.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.050
Oh, actually, I made
a mistake.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.960
y over x is equal to the natural
log of x plus c.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.740
If I multiply both sides of this
equation times x, what's

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.790
the solution?

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.500
It's not just x natural
log of x.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.250
I have to multiply this
times x, too, right?

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.970
Distributive property-- that
was an amateur mistake.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.580
So the correct solution is y is
equal to x natural log of

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.710
the absolute value of
x plus x times c.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.020
And if you want to figure out
c, I would have to give you

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.030
some initial conditions.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.980
And then you could
solve for c.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.600
And that would be the particular
solution, then, for

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.900
this differential equation.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.610
In the next video, I'll just
do a couple more of these

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.100
problems. I'll see you then.
