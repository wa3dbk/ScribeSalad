00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.420
We saw on the last video that
if I have some sort of

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.910
orthonormal basis, I should have
a shorthand for this-- if

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:17.860
I have an orthonormal basis,
then to find for a subspace V,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.290
and if I want to find the
projection of some vector x in

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:30.670
Rn onto V, the transformation
matrix simplifies to A times A

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.030
transpose times x.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.040
Where A is equal to essentially,
or exactly, the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.490
matrix with the basis
vectors as columns.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.780
So lets say v1, v2, all the way
through vk, these are the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.790
basis vectors.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.290
Basis orthonormal, maybe I'll
write it like this,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.150
orthonormal basis
vectors for V.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.380
We saw this in the last video,
and that was another reason

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.970
why we like orthonormal bases.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.670
Let's do this with an actual
concrete example.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.530
So let's say V is equal to
the span of the vector

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.940
1/3, 2/3, and 2/3.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:33.160
And the vector 2/3, 1/3,
and minus 2/3.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.560
Now, we've already seen that
these two guys are linearly

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.060
independent and they both have
length 1, and then they're

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.160
both orthogonal to each other.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.390
So we could say b, so we can say
the set-- let me write it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.220
this way-- we'll call this
vector 1 for shorthand, if

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.780
that's v1 and that this is v2,
we know that the set of v1 and

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:08.370
v2, is an orthonormal
basis for V.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.040
Now, we want to use this result
to find the projection.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.040
We want to find the
transformation matrix for the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.930
projection of any vector x in
R-- well in this case, it's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.440
going to be in R3, onto
our subspace, onto V.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.430
And the subspace is going
to be a plane in R3.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.480
What's it going to be?

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.550
Well, we found the result that
we just have to construct-- we

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.400
have to construct a matrix A,
which is equal to-- which has

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.060
these guys as a column
vectors.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:51.930
So 1/3, 2/3, 2/3, and 2/3,
1/3, and minus 2/3.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.490
And if we construct A in that
way, then the projection of x

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.270
onto V, this linear
transformation can be

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:05.200
represented as A times
A transpose times x.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.490
So to find our transformation
matrix, we just have to

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.770
multiply this guy times
his transpose.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.190
So let's do that.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.300
Let me just copy
and paste this.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.310
OK, let me do it right here.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.720
So that's A.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.870
I need to multiply that
times A transpose.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:39.590
A transpose is just going to
be 1/3, 2/3, 2/3, 1/3, and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.930
then 2/3, minus 2/3.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.490
That's A transpose.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.530
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.020
We have a 3 by 2, times a 2 by
3 matrix, so it's going to

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.375
result in a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.970
Which makes sense, because this
thing right here should

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.830
be a mapping from R3 to R3.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.190
Right?

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.110
You give me some member of R3,
and I'm going to give you

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.370
another member of R3 that is in
my subspace V, and is the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.019
projection of x onto V, and
we've also seen, the closest

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.410
member of V to x.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.269
So what is this going to be?

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.960
It's going to be a
3 by 3 matrix.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.540
We have a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.000
And so this first term, right
here, we're going to dot this

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.380
guy with this guy.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.210
So it's going to be 1/3 times
1/3, which is 1/9,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.320
plus 2/3 times 2/3.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.010
So it's going to be
1/9 plus 4/9.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.590
So I think we're going to be
dealing with a lot of ninths

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.520
here, so let me just divide
everything by nine.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.220
So it's going be 1/9 plus 4/9
which is 5/9, but I'll just

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.440
write a 5 here.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.660
And just know that we're
going to divide

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.720
everything by 9 at the end.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.990
So that's that guy dotted
with that guy.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.330
Now let's take the dot of
this guy with this guy.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.480
I'm going to get 2/9
plus 2/9, right?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.370
That's 4/9.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.520
Now I'm going to dot this
guy with this guy.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:22.170
2/9 minus 4/9, that
is minus 2/9.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.470
Now let's take the dot of the
this row, we're in the second

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.010
row and we're going to have to--
the dot of 2/3 and 1/3 is

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.706
2/9 plus 2/9, that is 4/9.

00:05:32.706 --> 00:05:34.910
Let's put a 4 there,
we have 4/9.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.400
Then we have 2/9 plus
1/9 is 3/9.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.110
Let me get make sure
I got that right.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.290
2/9-- oh sorry, 2/3 times 2/3 is
4/3, so it's 4- sorry, 2/3

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.360
times 2/3 is 4/9, plus
1/9, is 5/9.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.110
And then we have 4/9
minus 2/9 is 2/9.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.110
And then, let's do this last
one, we're almost there.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.320
I hope you already appreciate
that this is a lot less

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.040
painful than we had to take A
transpose A, and then inverse

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.640
it in between.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.870
We're just taking A
times A transpose.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.150
So 2/3 times 1/3, that's
2/9 minus 4/9, so

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.260
that's minus 2/9.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.560
And then we have 4/9 minus
2/9, that's 2/9.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.850
And then we have 4/9 plus
4/9, so that is 8/9.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.990
So just like that we were
able to figure out the

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.730
transformation matrix for the
projection of any vector in R3

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.700
onto our subspace V.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.700
And this was a lot less painful
than the ways that

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.670
we've done it in the past.
