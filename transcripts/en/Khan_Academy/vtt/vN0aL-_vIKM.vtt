00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:11.000
simply 3x squared minus 8x plus 7 plus 2x to the third minus x squared plus eight x minus 3

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.800
so when we simplify this we're essentially going to add up like terms

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.133
and just as a reminder we can only add or subtract like terms or simplify like terms

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:24.533
and just a reminder and what I mean by that if I had an x squared to an x squared

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:28.467
these are like terms they're both x terms raised to the same power

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.067
the same degree

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:35.800
so if I have one x squared and another x squared well then I have 2x squared - this is 2x squared

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.733
If I have an x to the third - let's say I have 3x to thirds plus another 4x to the thirds

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:45.400
Well that means I have 7x to the thirds - 7x to the thirds

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:53.333
I can't take an x squared and add it to an x to the third I cannot simplify this in any way, so this you cannot simplify

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:59.333
cannot simply - these are not like terms just because they both have Xs

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:03.400
The Xs are not to - they are not to the same degree

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.733
With that in mind let's look at the Xs to the same degree

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.133
Let's start with the highest degree

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:12.533
So the highest degree or the highest exponent on an x here - is actually this x to the third here

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:17.200
but it looks like the only one it's the only place where we're raising x to the third power

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.800
so that can't be merged or added or subtracted to anything else

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.467
so let's just write that down.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:25.333
so we have 2x to the third

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:31.200
and let's look at the x squared terms. We have 3x squared over there

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.133
and we have a minus or we can view as a negative x squared over there

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:43.000
so if we want to simplify we can add these two terms - we can add- so let me just write it down

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.800
we can add 3x squared to negative x squared

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.933
so I'm just rearranging it really right now

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:54.400
I'm putting the like terms next to each other so it'll be easy to simplify

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.200
now let's just worry about the x to the first terms or just the x terms

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.867
you have a negative 8x term right over here

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:03.000
so let me write it over here

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
negative 8x and then you have a positive 8x term right over here, so let me write that down

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.067
so positive 8x

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:13.733
and then finally let's look at the constant terms

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.733
you can view those as times x to the zeroth power

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:21.400
and the constant terms are - you have a positive 7 over here - so plus 7

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.533
and then you have a negative 3 over here

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.067
you have a negative 3

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:31.133
so all I'll I've done is I've really just used the communative property of addition

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:36.667
to just change the order - or addition and subtraction - to change the order in which I'm doing this

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:40.467
I've just rearranged the things so the like terms are next to each other

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:41.800
but now we can simplify

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.333
so we have 2x to the third - nothing to simplify that with

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:50.733
but then if we subtract - if we have - let me do that in the same blue color

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:55.200
if we have 3x squared and from that we're taking away an x squared

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.733
well, we're only gonna have 2x squared left

00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:01.067
so that's gonna be plus 2x squared

00:03:01.067 --> 00:03:04.667
and then over here if we have negative 8 Xs

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:08.400
and then we add 8 Xs to it or you can actually swap these around

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.067
you could view it as you are subtracting 8 x from positive 8x

00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:16.733
we'll those are just going to cancel out

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:22.067
so it's just going to be zero - I could just write plus zero here, but that'd just be redundant it wouldn't change the value

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:27.067
and then finally I have a plus 7 minus 3 well that is just clearly

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:30.533
7 minus 3 is 4 so I have plus 4

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:32.667
And we're done! We've simplified it!

00:03:32.667 --> 99:59:59.999
2x to the third plus 2 x squared plus 4
