00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.950
Determine whether the following
numbers are prime, composite,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.510
or neither.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.200
So just as a bit of
review, a prime number

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.560
is a natural number-- so one of
the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.810
4, 5, 6, so on and so forth--
that has exactly two factors.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.580
So its factors are 1 and itself.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.080
So an example of a
prime factor is 3.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.090
There's only two
natural numbers that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.330
are divisible into 3-- 1 and 3.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.080
Or another way to think about
it is, the only way to get 3

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.220
as a product of other
natural numbers is 1 times 3.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.280
So it only has 1 and itself.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.890
A composite number
is a natural number

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.510
that has more than just
1 and itself as factors.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.150
And we'll see examples of
that and neither-- we'll

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.050
see an interesting case
of that in this problem.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.082
So first let's think about 24.

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:00.540
So let's think
about all of the-- I

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.760
guess you could think of
it as the natural numbers

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.739
or the whole numbers,
although 0 is also

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.870
included in whole numbers.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.370
Let's think of all of the
natural counting numbers

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.060
that we can actually
divide into 24

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.550
without having any remainder.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.610
We'd consider those the factors.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.660
Well, clearly it is
divisible by 1 and 24.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.580
In fact, 1 times
24 is equal to 24.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.520
But it's also divisible by 2.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.540
2 times 12 is 24.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.890
So it's also divisible by 12.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.510
And it is also divisible by 3.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.110
3 times 8 is also equal to 24.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.910
And even at this point,
we don't actually

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.390
have to find all of the factors
to realize that it's not prime.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.760
It clearly has more factors
than just 1 and itself.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.065
So then it is clearly
going to be composite.

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:54.460
This is going to be composite.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.470
Now, let's just finish factoring
it just since we started it.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.290
It's also divisible by 4.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.560
And 4 times 6-- had just
enough space to do that.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.390
4 times 6 is also 24.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.660
So these are all of the
factors of 24, clearly

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.669
more than just one and 24.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.660
Now let's think about 2.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.010
Well, the non-zero whole numbers
that are divisible into 2,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.430
well, 1 times 2
definitely works, 1 and 2.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.850
But there really
aren't any others

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.370
that are divisible into 2.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.990
And so it only has two
factors, 1 and itself,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.650
and that's the definition
of a prime number.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.350
So 2 is prime.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.575
And 2 is interesting because it
is the only even prime number.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.760
And that might be
common sense you.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.930
Because by definition, an
even number is divisible by 2.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.720
So 2 is clearly divisible by 2.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.930
That's what makes it even.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.461
But it's only
divisible by 2 and 1.

00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:03.710
So that's what makes it prime.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.490
But anything else
that's even is going

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.550
to be divisible by
1, itself, and 2.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.420
Any other number
that is even is going

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.277
to be divisible by
1, itself, and 2.

00:03:18.277 --> 00:03:19.860
So by definition,
it's going to have 1

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.480
and itself and something else.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.350
So it's going to be composite.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.440
So 2 is prime.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.880
Every other even number
other than 2 is composite.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.480
Now, here is an
interesting case.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.820
1-- 1 is only divisible by 1.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.570
So it is not prime,
technically, because it only

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.070
has 1 as a factor.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.840
It does not have two factors.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.814
1 is itself.

00:03:48.814 --> 00:03:50.230
But in order to
be prime, you have

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.850
to have exactly two factors.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.400
1 has only one factor.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.960
In order to be
composite, you have

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.630
to have more than two factors.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.660
You have to have 1, yourself,
and some other things.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.860
So it's not composite.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.090
So 1 is neither
prime nor composite.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.438
And then finally we get to 17.

00:04:13.438 --> 00:04:20.250
17 Is divisible by 1 and 17.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.990
It's not divisible by 2,
not divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.590
7, 8, 9 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, or 16.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.000
So it has exactly two
factors-- 1 and itself.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.928
So 17 is once
again-- 17 is prime.
