00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.590
I had dinner between the
last video and this one.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.300
So I might have forgotten
what I just did.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.740
I think I was about to-- if
what I see on my board makes

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.010
sense-- I was about to use the
Taylor series, or in this

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.990
specific example the Maclaurin
series approximation, to figure

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.410
out a polynomial version, a sum
of polynomial terms to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.480
approximate e to the x.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.200
And remember let me write
here what the definition of

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.380
the Maclaurin series was.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:42.560
That we said that f of x is
equal to the sum from n equals

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.890
0 to infinite of the nth
derivative of f evaluated at

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.460
0-- I don't know if I
remembered to put it evaluated

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.840
at 0 last time I wrote this
down-- times x to the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.990
n over n factorial.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.430
And hopefully that
makes sense to you.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.920
This might seem really
confusing and strange.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.930
But now that we're going to
apply it to e to the x, this

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.780
should maybe be a little
bit more concrete.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.650
And I think at the end of the
last video I said that if f of

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.140
x is e to the x, f of 0 is
e to the 0, which is 1.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.180
And f prime of x, any
derivative of e to the x

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.810
is equal to e to the x.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.090
So you take any derivative of
at 0, and it equals 1 for e to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.490
the x for this particular
case of f of x.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.200
And that's really neat.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.770
That means that the rate of
change of y with respect to x

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.300
is for every 1 you move in x,
you move 1 in y at e to the 0.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.610
But that also means that
the rate of change of the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.710
rate of change is also 1.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.060
At the rate of change at
the rate of change at the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.030
rate of change is also 1.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.470
So at either the 0 or x equals
0 of e to the x, the slope of

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.470
the slope of the slope of the
slope of the slope of the slope

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.710
of the slope, they're all 1.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.420
Which to me tells me something
mysterious is happening.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.040
It's another reason why you
should just sit and ponder e.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.240
But anyway, back to what
we were trying to do.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.370
So how would we do this?

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.805
How would be write
the approximation?

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.680
Let me write the approximate.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.800
I'll call that p of x.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.620
Because it's going
to be a polynomial.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.040
Well in this particular case,
what's the derivative of any

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.590
derivative evaluated at f of 0?

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.490
Well that term is 1.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.290
We wrote that down right here.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.890
f of 0 is 1.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.490
The first derivative at 0 is 1.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.830
The second derivative
at 0 is 1.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.010
Right?

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.410
That's what's special
about e to the x.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.680
So all of these terms
are going to equal 1.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.740
So this polynomial simplifies
to the sum from n equals 0 to

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.470
infinite of x to the
n over n factorial.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.920
That to me is very neat.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.010
Remember these are
all 1 in every term.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.960
So that's why I took it out.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.810
So what does that mean?

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.960
Well that tells us that e to
the x can be approximated.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.630
And actually, I don't
prove it here.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.660
But it actually turns out that
we take the infinite sum that

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.030
the Maclaurin series not only
approximates e to the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.245
x at x equals 0.

00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:23.620
When you take the infinite
series, it actually

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.460
equals e to the x.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.490
So when you take a Maclaurin
series at 0, and the resulting

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.670
function, the resulting
polynomial actually converges--

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.560
and that's something we'll
learn a little bit more

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.340
rigorously hopefully later when
we start doing analysis-- but

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.090
it can actually converge to the
function at all points.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.490
And it actually is the
case with e to the x.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.240
So we can actually say
that e to the x is equal.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.050
I didn't prove this.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.330
But you can take
my word for it.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.100
And you can even test it
out with some numbers.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.340
It equals this sum.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.060
Well what is this sum?

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:08.020
It's x to the 0 over 0
factorial plus x to the 1 over

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.660
1 factorial plus x-squared
over 2 factorial.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.780
And you keep going.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.780
Of course that's equal.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.950
So e to x is equal
to-- x to the 0 is 1.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.870
0 factorial, I said in
the last video is 1.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.740
So it's 1 plus this is just x,
plus x-squared over 2 factorial

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.610
plus x to the third over
3 factorial plus x to the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.810
fourth over 4 factorial.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.790
And you just keep
going on forever.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.480
And that's e to the x.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.490
And to me that is amazing.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.810
Because this strange number e,
this 2.7 whatever, whatever,

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.130
that we got from compound
interest, it can be written as

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.600
an infinite polynomial, this
polynomial series or this

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.730
Maclaurin series, that actually
has a certain beauty to it.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.870
This number is kind of ugly
when you write it out,

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.380
2.7 whatever, whatever.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.560
But when you write it to an
exponent power as an infinite

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.960
sum, it kind of has
a nice rhythm to it.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.680
It's very patterned.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.540
Who would have guessed that
you could have written it

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.390
in such a simple form.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.460
And even more, what happens
when x is equal to 1.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.770
Right?

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.770
So what's e to the 1?

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.125
Well then we set x equal
to 1 on both sides.

00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:25.820
And I think I have space to
do it here, e to the 1,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.350
which is equal to e.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.810
We just set all the x's to 1.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:35.570
So we get that's equal to 1
plus 1 plus 1 over 2 factorial

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.340
plus 1 over 3 factorial plus 1
over 4 factorial plus

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.070
1 over 5 factorial.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.950
That to me, once
again, is amazing.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.170
That the number e, and we've
just stumbled on another

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:56.400
definition of e, e is equal to
the sum from n equals 0 to

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.490
infinite of 1 over n factorial.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.270
That is amazing.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.790
So now we have two
definitions for e.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.520
We have this one that we
stumbled on, and of course we

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.320
had the ones from compound
interest that I will

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.750
do in magenta.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.150
The limit as n approaches
infinite, 1 plus 1

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.690
over n to the n.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.510
That also is equal to e.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.280
This is starting to
give me chills.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.660
Because this very strange,
bizarre number is popping out.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.210
This might not seem
so natural to you.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.340
But it's neat.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.520
And it comes out in compound
interest, and continuously

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.920
compounding interest.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.170
But this is even simpler.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.550
I just keep picking one over
the factorial of numbers and

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.420
I add them all together.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.010
And if I take every number
really in existence, and I

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.320
sum them all up, I get e.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.170
That to me is amazing.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.890
1 over n factorial of
essentially every integer

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.200
from 0 to infinite.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.860
If I sum them up, I
get the number e.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.740
You hopefully are getting
chills right now.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.170
Well anyway, let's do the
Maclaurin series for a

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.990
couple more functions.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.090
And then we'll get to something
that is even more mind-blowing.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.140
I'll see you in the next video.
