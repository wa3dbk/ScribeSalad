00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.850
In the last video, we had a
word problem where we had-- we

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.130
essentially had to figure out
the sides of a triangle, but

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.650
instead of, you know, just
being able to do the

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.540
Pythagorean theorem and because
it was a right triangle, it was

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.220
just kind of a normal triangle.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.610
It wasn't a right triangle.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.460
And we just kind of chugged
through it using SOHCAHTOA and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.360
just our very simple trig
functions, and we got

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.480
the right answer.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.300
What I want to do now is to
introduce you to something

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.850
called the law of cosines,
which we essentially proved in

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.100
the last video, but I want to
kind of prove it in a more--

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.360
you know, without the word
problem getting in the way, and

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.600
I want to show you, once you
know the law of cosines, so you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.810
can then apply it to a problem,
like we did in the past,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.480
and you'll do it faster.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.480
I have a bit of a mixed opinion
about it because I'm not a

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.010
big fan of memorizing things.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.290
You know, when you're 40 years
old, you probably won't have

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.070
the law of cosines still
memorized, but if you have that

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.190
ability to start with the trig
functions and just move

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.560
forward, then you'll
always be set.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.090
And I'd be impressed if
you're still doing trig

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.560
at 40, but who knows?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.980
So let's go and let's
see what this law of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.300
cosines is all about.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.700
So let's say that I
know this angle theta.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.475
And let's called this
side-- I don't know, a.

00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:14.620
No, let's call this side b.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.230
I'm being a little
arbitrary here.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.640
Actually, let me stay in
the colors of the sides.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.030
Let's call that b and let's
call this c, and let's

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.150
call this side a.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.080
So if this is a right triangle,
then we could have used

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.630
the Pythagorean theorem
somehow, but now we can't.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.310
So what do we do?

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.490
So we know a-- well, let's
assume that we know b, we know

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.120
c, we know theta, and then
we want to solve for a.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.130
But, in general, as long as you
know three of these, you can

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.560
solve for the fourth once you
know the law of cosines.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.610
So how can we do it?

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.820
Well, we're going to do
it the exact same way we

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.170
did that last problem.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.580
We can drop a line
here to make-- oh, my

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.210
God, that's messy.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.420
I thought I was using
the line tool.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.165
Edit, undo.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.320
So I can drop a line like that.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.150
So I have two right angles.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.220
And then once I have right
triangles, then now I can start

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.610
to use trig functions and
the Pythagorean theorem,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.350
et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.210
So, let's see, this is a right
angle, this is a right angle.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.750
So what is this side here?

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.770
Let me pick another color.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.560
I'm probably going to get too
involved with all the colors,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.380
but it's for your improvement.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.400
So what is this side here?

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.720
What is the length of that
side, that purple side?

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.700
Well, that purple side is just,
you know, we use SOHCAHTOA.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.605
I was just going to write
SOHCAHTOA up here.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.700
So this purple side is adjacent
to theta, and then this blue or

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.910
mauve side b is the hypotenuse
of this right triangle.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.140
So we know that-- I'm just
going to stick to one color

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.760
because it'll take me forever
if I keep switching colors.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.790
We know that cosine of theta--
let's call this side, let's

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.660
call this kind of subside--
I don't know, let's

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.200
call this d, side d.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.850
We know that cosine of theta
is equal to d over b, right?

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.290
And we know b.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.870
Or that d is equal to what?

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.660
It equals b cosine theta.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.750
Now, let's call this
side e right here.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.810
Well, what's e?

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.340
Well, e is this whole c
side-- c side, oh, that's

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.780
interesting-- this whole c side
minus this d side, right?

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.630
So e is equal to c minus d.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.320
We just solved for d, so
side e is equal to c

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.980
minus b cosine of theta.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.590
So that's e.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.900
We got e out of the way.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.340
Well, what's this magenta
side going to be?

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.690
Well, let's call this magenta--
let's call it m from magenta.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.340
Well, m is opposite to theta.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.350
Now, we know it.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.110
We've solved for c as well, but
we know b, and b is simple.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.210
So what relationship gives us
m over b, or involves the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.400
opposite and the hypotenuse?

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.110
Well, that's sine:
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.670
So we know that m over b is
equal to sine of theta.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.520
We know that-- let
me go over here.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.180
m over b, right, because this
is the hypotenuse, is equal to

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:08.550
sine of theta, or that m
is equal to b sine

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.500
of theta, right?

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.470
So we figured out m, we
figured out e, and now

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.690
we want to figure out a.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.070
And this should
jump out at you.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.960
We have two sides of
a right triangle.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.750
We want to figure
out the hypotenuse.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.410
We can use the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.490
The Pythagorean theorem tells
us a squared is equal to m

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.510
squared plus e squared, right?

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.660
Just the square of
the other two sides.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.920
Well, what's m squared
plus e squared?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.970
Let me switch to another
color just to be arbitrary.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.360
a squared is equal
to m squared.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.030
m is b sine of theta.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:53.590
So it's b sine of theta
squared plus e squared.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.790
Well, e we figure out is this.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.820
So it's plus c minus b
cosine theta squared.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.940
Now, let's just chug
through some algebra.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:13.090
So that equals b sine-- b
squared sine squared of theta.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.970
Sine squared of theta
just means sine of

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.480
theta squared, right?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.700
Plus, and we just foiled
this out, although I

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.420
don't like using foil.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.620
I just multiply it out.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:33.810
c squared minus 2cb cosine
theta plus b squared

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.420
cosine theta, right?

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.490
I just expanded this out
by multiplying it out.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.310
And now let's see if we can
do anything interesting.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.780
Well, if we take this term and
this term, we get-- those two

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:54.360
terms are b squared sine
squared of theta plus b squared

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.110
cosine-- this should be squared
there, right, because

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.350
we squared it.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.780
b squared cosine squared of
theta, and then we have plus c

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:10.350
squared minus 2bc cosine theta.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.470
Well, what does
this simplify to?

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.735
Well, this is the same thing
as b squared times the

00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:22.470
sine squared theta plus
cosine squared of theta.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.420
Something should be jumping out
at you, and that's plus c

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.330
squared minus 2bc cosine theta.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.170
Well, this thing, sine
squared plus cosine

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.910
squared of any angle is 1.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.010
That's one of the
earlier identities.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.930
That's the Pythagorean
identity right there.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:47.210
So this equals 1, so then
we're left with-- going

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.970
back to my original color.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:56.230
We're almost there-- a squared
is equal to-- this term just

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.020
becomes 1, so b squared.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:07.160
We're just left with a b
squared plus c squared

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:16.330
minus 2bc cosine of theta.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.940
That's pretty neat, and this
is called the law of cosines.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.410
And it's useful because, you
know, if you know an angle

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.460
and two of the sides of
any triangle, you can now

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.930
solve for the other side.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.170
Or really, if you want to, if
you know three sides of a

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.810
triangle, you can now solve
for any angle, so that

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.780
also is very useful.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.150
The only reason why I'm a
little bit, you know, here,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.050
there, is I don't-- if you are
in trigonometry right now and

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.590
you might have a test, you
should memorize this because

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.490
it'll make you faster, and
you'll get the answer

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.650
right quicker.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.310
I'm not a big fan of just
memorizing it without knowing

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.600
where it came from, because a
year from now or two years from

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.530
now when you go to college and
it's been four years since you

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.040
took trigonometry, you probably
won't have this memorized.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.990
And if you face a trig problem
all of a sudden, it's good to

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.030
kind of get there from scratch.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.820
With that said, this is the law
of cosines, and if you use the

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.450
law of cosines, you could have
done that problem we just did a

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.070
lot faster because we just--
you know, you just have to set

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.620
up the triangle and then just
substitute into this, and you

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.600
could have solved for a in
that ship off-course problem.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.780
I'll see you in the next video.
