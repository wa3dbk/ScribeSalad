00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.940
Solve the following application
problem using three equations

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.510
with three unknowns.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.540
And they tell us the
second angle of a triangle

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.910
is 50 degrees less than
four times the first angle.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.200
The third angle is 40
degrees less than the first.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.090
Find the measures
of the three angles.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.280
So let's draw ourselves
a triangle here.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.300
And let's call the first angle
a, the second angle b, and then

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.076
the third angle c.

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:29.950
And before we even look
at these constraints,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.990
one property we
know of triangles

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.200
is that the sum of their
angles must be 180 degrees.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.472
So we know that a plus b plus
c must be equal to 180 degrees.

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:44.180
Now, with that out of
the way, let's look

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.400
at these other constraints.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.530
So they tell us the second
angle of a triangle--

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.650
let me do that in
another color--

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.750
they tell us the second
angle of a triangle

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.370
is 50 degrees less than
four times the first angle.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.440
So we're saying b
is the second angle.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.840
So they're saying, the
second angle of a triangle

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.730
is 50 degrees less than
four times the first angle.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.850
So 4 times the first
angle would be 4a,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.040
we're calling a the first angle.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.780
So 4 times the
first angle is 4a.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.770
But it's 50 degrees less
than that, so minus 50.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.670
Now the next constraint they
give us, the third angle

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.250
is 40 degrees less
than the first.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.970
So the third angle is 40
degrees less than the first.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.070
So the first angle, a, is
going to be 40 degrees less

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.590
than that.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.930
So we have three equations
with three unknowns.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.830
And so we just have
to solve for it.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.320
And let's see, what's a
good first variable to try

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.270
to eliminate?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.940
And just to try to visualize
that a little bit better,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.990
I'm going to bring these a's
onto the left hand side of each

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.820
of these equations over here.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.840
So I'm going to rewrite
the first equation.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.950
We have a plus b plus
c is equal to 180.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.340
And then this equation,
if we subtract 4a

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.920
from both sides of this
equation, if we subtract 4a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:16.670
we have negative 4a plus
b is equal to negative 50.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.630
And then this equation
right over here,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.400
if we subtract a
from both sides we

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:33.620
get negative a plus c
is equal to negative 40.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.280
I just subtract a
from both sides.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.600
So we now want to
eliminate variables.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.340
And we already have--
this third equation

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.750
here is only in
terms of a and c.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.480
This is only in
terms of a and b.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.850
And this first one is
in terms of a, b, and c.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.240
So if we could-- let's see, this
is already in terms of a and c.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.240
If we could turn these
first two equations,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.580
if we can use the information
in these first two equations

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.250
to end up with an
equation that's

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.380
only in terms of
a and c, then we

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.510
could use whatever
we end up with along

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.770
with this third equation
right over here,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.690
and we'll have a system of two
equations with two unknowns.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.519
So let's do that.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.060
So if we wanted to just end up
with an equation only in terms

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.180
of a and c using
these first two,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.009
we would want to
eliminate the b's.

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:15.800
So we could multiply
one of these equations

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.966
times negative 1, and one
of these positive b's will

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:19.110
turn into a negative b.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.950
So let's do that.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.560
Let's multiply this first
equation over here, let's

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.350
multiply it times negative 1.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.020
So it'll become
negative a minus b

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.280
minus c is equal
to negative 180.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.100
And then we have this
green equation right

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.990
over here, which is really just
this equation, just rearranged.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.600
So we have negative 4a plus
b is equal to negative 50.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.927
And now we can add
these two equations.

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:50.760
Actually, let me do
that in the other color,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.056
just so you see where
that's coming from.

00:03:53.056 --> 00:03:55.060
I'll do it in that green color.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.160
So this is negative 4a plus
b is equal to negative 50.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.620
We can add these two up now.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.370
And we get negative a
minus 4a is negative 5a.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.030
The b's cancel out.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.279
We have a minus c is equal
to negative 180 minus 50

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.600
is negative 230.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.260
So now using these
top two equations

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.357
we have an equation only
in terms of a and c.

00:04:22.357 --> 00:04:24.440
We have another equation
only in terms of a and c.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.210
And it looks like if we
add them together their c's

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.020
will cancel out.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.007
So let me just rewrite
this equation over here.

00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:30.590
And you have to be
careful that you're

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.720
using all of the equations.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.950
Otherwise you'll do
a circular argument.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.460
You have to be careful that over
here this first equation came

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.430
from these two over here.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.250
Now I want to combine that
with this third constraint,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.270
s constraint that's not already
baked into this equation

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.980
right over here.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.320
So we have negative a plus
c is equal to negative 40.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.800
And we add these two equations.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.040
Negative 5a minus
a is negative 6a.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.740
The c's cancel out.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.530
And then you have
negative 230 minus 40.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.190
This is equal to negative 270.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.080
We can divide both
sides by negative 6.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.550
And we get a is equal
to negative 270 over 6.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.630
Let me see how many times--
let me see something.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.110
270 is divisible
by both 3 and 2.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.870
So it should be divisible by 6.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.350
So let me just divide it.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.280
The negative signs
obviously will-- a negative

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.280
divided by a negative is
going to be a positive.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.210
And if we take 6 into 270,
6 goes into 27 4 times.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.420
4 times 6 is 24.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.670
We subtract.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.670
We get 3, bring down the 0.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.970
6 goes into 30 five times.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.725
So we get a is equal to 45.

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:53.100
Now let's look at
the other ones.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.316
We can substitute back
in to solve for c.

00:05:55.316 --> 00:05:58.930
c is equal to a
minus 40 degrees.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.270
So that is equal to-- let
me write it right over

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.320
here in yellow-- so c
is equal to 45 minus 40,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.020
which is equal to 5 degrees.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.490
So, so far we have a
is equal to 45 degrees,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.740
c is equal to 5 degrees.

00:06:22.826 --> 00:06:24.700
And then you could
substitute into either one

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.470
of these other ones
to figure out b.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.730
We could use this one
right over here in green.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.170
B is equal to 4a minus 50.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.310
So b is going to be equal to
4 times 45 is-- let's see,

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.580
2 times 45 is 90.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.110
So 4 times 45 is 180.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.680
So it's going to
be 180 minus 50,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.840
by this equation
right over here, which

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.110
is equal to 130 degrees.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.342
So we get b is equal
to 130 degrees.

00:06:52.342 --> 00:06:54.050
And then we can-- let
me write over here.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.330
So a is equal to 45.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.780
So if I wanted to
draw this triangle

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.870
it would actually look
something like this.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:07.150
a is a 45 degree angle, b is a
130 degree angle, and c is 5.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.150
So it'll look
something like this.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.570
It will look
something like this,

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.370
where this is a at 45
degrees, b is 135 degrees,

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.030
and then c is 5 degrees.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.680
And you can verify
that it works.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.210
One, you can just
add up the angles.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.310
45 plus 5 is 50.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.780
Oh, sorry, this isn't 135.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.382
It's 130.

00:07:28.382 --> 00:07:29.590
We solved it right over here.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.630
It's 130 and this is 5.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.530
So when you add them
all up-- 45 plus 130

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.830
plus 5-- that does
indeed equal 180 degrees.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.440
45 plus 5 is 50 plus 130.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.150
So this does
definitely equal 180.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.010
So it meets our
first constraint,

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.050
Then on our second
constraint, b needs

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.040
to be equal to 4a minus 50.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:58.880
Well, 4 times a is 180
minus 50 is 130 degrees.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.860
So it meets our
second constraint.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.780
And then our third constraint,
c is a minus 40 degrees.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.200
Well, a is 45, c is 5.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.890
So if you subtract 40 from
45 you get 5, which is c.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.140
So it meets all of our
constraints and we are done.
