00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.470
Let's tackle a slightly
harder problem than what

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.640
we saw in the last video.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:11.550
I have here x minus 3
over x plus 4 is greater

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.550
than or equal to 2.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.630
So the reason why this is
slightly harder is I now have

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.690
a greater than or equal to.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.490
And the other thing that makes
it slightly harder is I don't

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.330
just have a simple 0 here,
I actually have a 2 here.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.360
So I'm going to do this
problem the same way.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.240
I'm going to do it two ways.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.800
I'm going to do the same two
ways we did last time, but I'm

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.170
going to reverse the order of
the two ways that I do it.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.180
So the first thing I can do,
I might be tempted-- let me

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.770
multiply both sides of this
equation times x plus 4.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.120
And like we saw in the last
video we had to be very

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.350
careful because we have
an inequality here.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.200
If x plus 4 is greater than
0 then we're going to keep

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.050
the inequality the same.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.840
If it's less than 0
we're going to swap it.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.800
So let's look at those
two situations.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.600
So one situation is-- let
me make it right here.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.720
One situation is x plus
4 is greater then 0.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.650
And remember, it can ever be
equal to 0 because then this

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.740
expression would be undefined.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.300
So let's explore x plus
4 is greater than 0.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.650
If we subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation this is

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.610
equivalent to saying-- these
are equivalent statements.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.810
If we subtract 4 from
both sides that x is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.800
greater than minus 4.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.720
So if we assume that x is
greater than minus 4 then

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.040
x plus 4 is going to
be greater than 0.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.425
And then when we multiply
both sides of this times

00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:28.430
x plus 4-- let's do that.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.660
x minus 3 over x plus 4.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.020
You have your 2.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.720
We're going to multiply both
sides of this times x plus 4.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.710
Since we're assuming x is
greater than minus 4 or that x

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.690
plus 4 is greater than 0, we
don't have to switch

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.010
the inequality sign.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.010
We're multiplying both
sides by a positive.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.300
So the inequality stays
the same as in our

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.530
original problem.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.380
And the whole reason why we
did that is because this

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.810
and this will cancel out.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.390
And then we have 2
times x plus 4.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.870
Let's see what we get.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.700
x minus 3 is greater than
or equal to 2 times x plus

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.420
2 times 4, which is 8.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.120
And now what can we do?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.530
We can subtract x
from both sides.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.700
We get minus 3 is greater
than or equal to x plus 8.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.860
I just took x from 2x.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.900
And then we can subtract
8 from both sides.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.640
So you subtract 8
from both sides.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.150
You get minus 3 minus 8
is minus 11 is greater

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.580
than or equal to x.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.130
And of course, then we subtract
an 8 so this guy disappears.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.720
So if we assume that x is
greater than minus 4, then

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.610
x has to be less than
or equal to minus 11.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.100
Now that seems a little
bit nonsensical.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.300
In order for this statement to
be true, x has to be both

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.150
greater than minus 4 and it has
to be less than minus 11.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.460
Anything greater than
minus 4 is going to be

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.240
greater than minus 11.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.310
So there's no x that
satisfies this equation.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.230
So if we assume that x plus 4
is greater than 0, we just end

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.080
up with a nonsensical solution.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.090
So we can actually
ignore that path.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.280
There's no situation in which x
plus 4 is going to be greater

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.030
than 0 and we're going to
actually have a solution

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.250
to this equation.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.840
So let's assume what happens
when x plus 4 is less than 0.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.850
I'll do it here.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.120
So what happens when x
plus 4 is less than 0?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.860
And once again, that's an
equivalent statement.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.580
If we subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.530
to saying that x is
less than minus 4.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.880
These are equivalent
statements.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.780
So if we assume that x is less
than minus 4, then when we

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.090
multiply both sides of this
equation times x plus 4 and

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.300
you're multiplying it by
x minus 3 over x plus 4.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.840
And you have your 2 and
you're multiplying

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.860
that times x plus 4.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.320
Since we're taking the other
situation where x is less than

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.945
minus 4, which makes this
expression negative-- since

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:08.630
we're multiplying both sides of
the equation by a negative, we

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.780
swap the inequality
just like that.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.960
And let's see what we get.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.550
This and this cancel out.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:22.170
And then we get x minus 3 is
less than or equal to 2 times

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.190
x plus 2 times 4, which is 8.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.100
And we do the same algebra.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.080
Let's subtract x
from both sides.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.955
We get minus 3 is less than
or equal to x plus 8.

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:41.410
If we subtract 8 from both
sides we get minus 11 is

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.800
less than or equal to x.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.790
If we assume this is
negative, we get x has

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.290
to be less than minus 4.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.800
If x is less than minus 4, in
order for this equation to

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.160
hold up, x also has to be
greater than minus 11.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.130
And this is actually possible.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.440
You can have an x, so x has
to be-- we can rewrite

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.480
this-- greater than
or equal to minus 11.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.230
I just swapped the two sides.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.970
And x has to be
less than minus 4.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.720
And there are x's that satisfy
these two constraints.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.980
There weren't x's that satisfy
these two constraints.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.330
Nothing satisfies both of
these, but there are things

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.870
that satisfy both of these.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.630
For example, minus 5.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.910
Let's draw this on
the number line.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.590
Let's draw a solution
to this problem.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.320
Let me keep the problem there.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.820
If I draw a number line,
I want to switch colors.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.390
So we have minus 11.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.010
We can be greater than
or equal to minus 11.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.370
So this is minus 11.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.740
And then we have
minus 4 over here.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.240
Maybe 0 sitting over there.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.980
We have to be less
than minus 4.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.820
Remember, we can ever be equal
to minus 4 because that

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.240
would make this undefined.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.390
So we have to be less than
minus 4, so we don't

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.010
include minus 4.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.490
We're less than minus 4,
but we have to be greater

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.670
than or equal to 11.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.730
So we can't go less than
11, but we include the 11

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.630
because this is greater
than or equal to.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.820
So anything in this, where I've
shaded it in-- anything on this

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.960
range will satisfy that
equation over there.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.920
Now let's do it the other way.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.460
Let's do it where we-- the
numerator and denominator

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.830
both have to be
positive or negative.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.530
Let's see if we can do the
same problem that way.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.330
So let me rewrite it down
here, maybe in a new color.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.880
So the same problem.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:44.370
x minus 3 over x plus 4 is
greater than or equal to 2.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.410
Now, in order to do that
reasoning that I did in the

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.330
first video, remember the first
video I said, well, it's a

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.060
divided by b is greater than 0.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.470
Either both of these are
positive or both of

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.520
these are negative.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.450
But this only worked when
we had a 0 over here.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.180
But we don't have a 0 here we
have a 2 so we can't at least

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.120
immediately do that rationale.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.360
But maybe we can if we
subtract 2 from both

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.650
sides of this equation.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.740
So let's do that.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.610
So you have x minus 3 over x
plus 4 minus 2 is greater

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.330
than or equal to 0.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.420
Just subtract a 2
from both sides.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.510
I can add or subtract without
messing up the inequality.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.460
Never have to worry about that.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.630
It's only when you multiply
by negatives that you

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.380
swap the inequality.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.120
And now, what is this?

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.160
You know, this doesn't look
like a rational expression.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.100
But I can rewrite
minus 2, right?

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.930
Minus 2 is the same thing
as minus 2 times x

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.640
plus 4 over x plus 4.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.380
This is minus 2 times 1.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.640
This is the same thing.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.925
And this is the same
thing as minus 2x plus--

00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:47.540
let me be careful.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:54.020
This is the same thing as minus
2x minus 8 over x plus 4.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:59.680
This right here is the exact
same thing as minus 2.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.420
I just multiply it times
x plus 4 for x plus 4.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.300
Let's write it this way
because then we can add them.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.620
So if we write that way, so I
have x minus 3 over x plus 4.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.960
And I wrote it that way so I
have a common denominator.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:19.900
And then I have plus minus
2x minus 8 over x plus

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.250
4 is greater than 0.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.255
I have a common denominator.

00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:25.690
That was my whole
point of doing this.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.590
And so I have a denominator of
x plus 4 and then when you add

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.720
these two things you
get x minus 2x.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.340
That's a minus x.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.120
And then you have minus 3
minus 8-- that's minus

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.410
11-- is greater than 0.

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:46.050
So now I simplify the problem
into something like this.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.430
So there's two situations.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.710
Oh, let me be very careful.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.010
This was greater than or equal.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.900
This must be greater
than or equal.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.370
Don't want to lose that
little equal sign.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.190
That was the whole
point of this problem.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:01.370
So now I'm ready to
operate just like this.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.370
Actually, before I even
do this, let's get one

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.430
thing out of the way.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.966
Let's be very clear.

00:09:05.966 --> 00:09:08.960
x can never be
equal to minus 4.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.930
Because if x is equal to minus
4, this whole statement-- that

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.960
original problem is undefined.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.850
So let's just write that first.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.475
You know, we could have
written that from the get-go.

00:09:16.475 --> 00:09:19.460
x cannot be equal to minus
4, for any solution.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.370
That will make this
expression undefined.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.570
Now, we have this and we saw in
the first video and we saw

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.030
right there that there's
two situations.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.600
Either both of these
are positive.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:36.070
So they're either both
positive, so minus x minus 11

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:40.090
is greater than or equal to 0.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.560
This could be equal to 0.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.740
Actually, if this is equal
to 0, then this whole

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.570
thing is going to be true.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:51.220
So either that is greater than
or equal to 0 and this right

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.980
here is greater than 0.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.460
It can't be equal to 0.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.110
And x plus 4 is greater than 0.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.650
That's the situation where
both of them are positive.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.510
Or they're both going
to be less than 0.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.820
And I'm running out of space.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:15.480
Or minus x minus 11 is
less than or equal to 0.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.850
And-- I'll write and like that.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.780
And x plus 4 is less than 0.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.470
Remember, it can't
ever equal 0.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.130
So they're either both
positive or both negative.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.810
That's the only way they we're
going to get something.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.680
Well, the numerator can be
equal to 0 because this

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.720
thing can equal 0.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.150
Or they're both positive to
get something positive.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.840
Or they're both negative, so
that when you divide a negative

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.780
by a negative you still
get something positive.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.030
So let's look at these two
situations and see if we get

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.540
any solutions that make sense.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.180
So right here, if we add x to
both sides of this equation we

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.830
get minus 11 is greater
than or equal to x.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.200
Or another way you could
say it, is x is less than

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.820
or equal to minus 11.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.080
I just swapped these two sides.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.500
And then here, if we add minus
4-- if we subtract 4 from

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:07.510
both sides we get x is
greater than minus 4.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.750
But once again, this
makes no sense.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.300
There's no way that I
can have-- remember

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.710
there's an and here.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.670
Both of these have to be true.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.160
There's no x that is
greater than minus 4

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.740
and less than minus 11.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.630
So this right here,
there's no constraints.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.560
So both of these can never be--
both the numerator and the

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.820
denominator can never both be
positive at the same time

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.320
because in order for them both
to be positive you get an

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.890
impossible constraint to fill.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.720
So let's look at the situation.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.840
The other situation is when
they are both negative.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.970
When both this numerator
and this denominator

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.840
are both negative.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.040
Let me be clear.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.610
You can't make a statement
about these two not

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.550
being positive.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.450
These two things can
ever be positive.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.390
Remember, because we had to get
the 0 here in order to use

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.940
this logic to begin with.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.310
So the fact that when we tried
to figure out x's that would

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.810
make both of these positive, we
got a nonsensical, impossible

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.890
to fill constraint, tells me
that both this numerator and

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:06.550
this denominator can never both
be positive for any given x.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.860
Now let's see if they
can both be negative.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.800
So for both of them to be
negative or the numerator

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.410
could also be equal to 0.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:17.130
If we add x to both sides
of this we get minus 11 is

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.890
less than or equal to x.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.560
Or we could say that x is
greater than or equal to minus

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.280
11 just swapping around.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.390
Over here, if we subtract
4 from both sides we have

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.250
x is less than minus 4.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.210
And-- and this is an and.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.430
So x has to be greater than or
equal to minus 11 or less than

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.850
minus 4, which is exactly what
we came up in the last problem.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.660
I can draw the
number line again.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.720
We have to be greater than
or equal to minus 11.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.860
So that's minus 11 there.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.890
We could be equal to it or
greater than, but we have

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.250
to be less than minus 4.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.860
So this is minus 4.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.380
We can't even be equal to minus
4, that'll make our denominator

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.070
undefined or our whole
equation undefined.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.590
It will make our denominator 0.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.140
And so this is our
solution set.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.460
Anything right here that I've
shaded in, including minus 11,

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.220
but not including minus 4.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.530
So if you could get this
problem I think you can handle

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:13.270
pretty much any rational
equation problem.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.110
Hope you enjoyed that.
