00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.920
Determine whether 380 is
divisible by 2, 3,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.210
4, 5, 6, 9 or 10.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.010
They skipped 7 and 8
so we don't have

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.460
to worry about those.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.000
So let's think about 2.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.524
So are we divisible by 2?

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:20.220
Let me write the 2 here.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.880
Well, in order for something to
be divisible by 2, it has

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.160
to be an even number, and to be
an even number, your ones

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.560
digit-- so let me rewrite 380.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.450
To be even, your ones digit
has to be even, so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.780
this has to be even.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.270
And for this to be even, it has
to be 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:51.970
this is 0, so 380 is even, which
means it is divisible by

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.360
2, so it works with 2.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.710
So 2 works out.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.530
Let's think about the
situation for 3.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.130
Now, a quick way to think about
3-- so let me write just

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.010
3 question mark-- is to add
the digits of your number.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.890
And if the sum that you get is
divisible by 3, then you are

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.980
divisible by 3.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.110
So let's try to do that.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.900
So 380, let's add the digits.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:22.290
3 plus 8 plus 0 is equal to--
3 plus 8 is 11 plus 0,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.770
so it's just 11.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.150
And if you have trouble figuring
out whether this is

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.420
divisible by 3, you could then
just add these two numbers

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.240
again, so you can actually add
the 1 plus 1 again, and you

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.480
would get a 2.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.100
Regardless of whether you look
at the 1 or the 2, neither of

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.730
these are divisible by 3.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:45.700
So not divisible by 3, and maybe
in a future video, I'll

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.860
explain why this works, and
maybe you want to think about

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.590
why this works.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.710
So these aren't divisible by
3, so 380 is not divisible.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:05.560
380, not divisible by 3,
so 3 does not work.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.100
We are not divisible by 3.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.880
Now, I'll think about the
situation for 4, so we're

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.880
thinking about 4 divisibility.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.200
So let me write it in orange.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.430
So we are wondering about 4.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.930
Now, something you may or may
not already realize is that

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.310
100 is divisible by 4.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.580
It goes evenly.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.130
So this is 380.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.940
So the 300 is divisible by 4, so
we just have to figure out

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.030
whether the leftover, whether
the 80, is divisible by 4.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:46.050
Another way to think about it
is are the last two digits

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.220
divisible by 4?

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.410
And this comes from the fact
that 100 is divisible by 4, so

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.870
everything, the hundreds place
or above, it's going to be

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.450
divisible by 4.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.760
You just have to worry
about the last part.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.230
So in this situation, is
80 divisible by 4?

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.530
Now, you could eyeball that.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.760
You could say, well, 8 is
definitely divisible by 4.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.700
8 divided by 4 is 2.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.340
80 divided by 4 is 20,
so this works.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.740
Yes!

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.540
Yes!

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.910
So since 80 is divisible
by 4, 380 is also

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.290
divisible by 4, so 4 works.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.855
So let's do 5.

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:27.910
I'll actually scroll
down a little bit.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.370
Let's try 5.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.280
So what's the pattern when
something is divisible by 5?

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.580
Let's do the multiple of 5?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.930
5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.270
So if something's divisible by
5-- I could keep going-- that

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.690
means it ends with either
a 5 or a 0, right?

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.215
Every multiple of 5 either has
a 5 or a 0 in the ones place.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.860
Now 380 has a 0 in the
ones place, so it is

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.040
divisible by 5.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.800
Now, let's think about
the situation for 6.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.450
Let's think about what
happens with 6.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.780
So we want to know are
we divisible by 6?

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.769
So to be divisible by 6, you
have to be divisible by the

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.010
things that make up 6.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.960
Remember, 6 is equal
to 2 times 3.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.950
So if you're divisible by 6,
that means you are divisible

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.120
by 2 and you are
divisible by 3.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.830
If you're divisible by both
2 and 3, you'll be

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.500
divisible by 6.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.680
Now, 380 is divisible by 2, but
we've already established

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.990
that it is not divisible by 3.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.780
If it's not divisible by 3, it
cannot be divisible by 6, so

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.780
this gets knocked out.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.710
We are not divisible by 6.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.960
Now, let's go to 9.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.790
So divisibility by 9.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.100
So you can make a similar
argument here that if

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.950
something is not divisible by
3, there's no way it's going

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.270
to be divisible by 9 because
9 is equal to 3 times 3.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.940
So to be divisible by 9, you
have to be divisible by 3 at

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.090
least twice.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.060
At least two 3's have to go
into your number, and this

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.120
isn't the case, so you could
already knock 9 out.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.870
But if we didn't already know
that we're not divisible by 3,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.870
the other way to do it is a very
similar way to figure out

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.050
divisibility by 3.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.670
We can add the digits.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.300
So you add 3 plus 8 plus
0, and you get 11.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.710
And you say is this
divisible by 9?

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.170
And you say this is not
divisible by 9, so 380 must

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.550
not be divisible by 9.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.720
And for 3, you do the same
thing, but you test whether

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.540
the sum is divisible by 3.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.320
For 9, you test whether
it's divisible by 9.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.090
So lastly, we have
the number 10.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.230
We have the number 10, and
this is on some level the

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.110
easiest one.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.050
What do all the multiples
of 10 look like?

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.190
10, 20, 30, 40, we could just
keep going on and on.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.790
They all end with zero.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.030
Or if something ends with zero,
it is divisible by 10.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.470
380 does end with zero, or its
ones place does have a zero on

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.080
it, so it is divisible by 10.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.210
So we're divisible by all
of these numbers except

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.050
for 3, 6 and 9.
