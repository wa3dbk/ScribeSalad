00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.100
I will now show you my preferred
way of finding an

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.770
inverse of a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.220
And I actually think it's
a lot more fun.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.150
And you're less likely to
make careless mistakes.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.020
But if I remember correctly from
Algebra 2, they didn't

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.760
teach it this way
in Algebra 2.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.900
And that's why I taught the
other way initially.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.170
But let's go through this.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.140
And in a future video, I will
teach you why it works.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.310
Because that's always
important.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.780
But in linear algebra, this is
one of the few subjects where

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.670
I think it's very important
learn how to do the operations

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.790
first. And then later,
we'll learn the why.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.430
Because the how is
very mechanical.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.880
And it really just involves
some basic arithmetic

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.380
for the most part.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.070
But the why tends to
be quite deep.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.170
So I'll leave that
to later videos.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.820
And you can often think about
the depth of things when you

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.550
have confidence that you at
least understand the hows.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.730
So anyway, let's go back
to our original matrix.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.090
And what was that original
matrix that I

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.280
did in the last video?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:03.850
It was 1, 0, 1, 0,
2, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.160
And we wanted to find the
inverse of this matrix.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.910
So this is what we're
going to do.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.710
It's called Gauss-Jordan
elimination, to find the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.720
inverse of the matrix.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.840
And the way you do it-- and it
might seem a little bit like

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.860
magic, it might seem a little
bit like voodoo, but I think

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.370
you'll see in future videos that
it makes a lot of sense.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.770
What we do is we augment
this matrix.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.560
What does augment mean?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.440
It means we just add
something to it.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.830
So I draw a dividing line.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.486
Some people don't.

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:31.290
So if I put a dividing
line here.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.080
And what do I put on the other
side of the dividing line?

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.640
I put the identity matrix
of the same size.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.140
This is 3 by 3, so I put a
3 by 3 identity matrix.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:51.600
So that's 1, 0, 0,
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.870
All right, so what are
we going to do?

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.670
What I'm going to do is perform
a series of elementary

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.620
row operations.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.940
And I'm about to tell you what
are valid elementary row

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.610
operations on this matrix.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.440
But whatever I do to any of
these rows here, I have to do

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.360
to the corresponding
rows here.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.690
And my goal is essentially to
perform a bunch of operations

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.150
on the left hand side.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.830
And of course, the same
operations will be applied to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.690
the right hand side, so that I
eventually end up with the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.320
identity matrix on the
left hand side.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.310
And then when I have the
identity matrix on the left

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.400
hand side, what I have left on
the right hand side will be

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.690
the inverse of this
original matrix.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.680
And when this becomes an
identity matrix, that's

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.950
actually called reduced
row echelon form.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.320
And I'll talk more about that.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.200
There's a lot of names and
labels in linear algebra.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.480
But they're really just fairly
simple concepts.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.790
But anyway, let's get started
and this should become a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.180
little clear.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.290
At least the process
will become clear.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.460
Maybe not why it works.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.610
So first of all, I said I'm
going to perform a bunch of

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.280
operations here.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.950
What are legitimate
operations?

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.720
They're called elementary
row operations.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.920
So there's a couple
things I can do.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.970
I can replace any row
with that row

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.680
multiplied by some number.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.960
So I could do that.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.260
I can swap any two rows.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.850
And of course if I swap say the
first and second row, I'd

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.450
have to do it here as well.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.410
And I can add or subtract one
row from another row.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.590
So when I do that-- so for
example, I could take this row

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.790
and replace it with this
row added to this row.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.520
And you'll see what I
mean in the second.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.500
And you know, if you combine it,
you could you could say,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.880
well I'm going to multiple this
row times negative 1, and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.580
add it to this row, and replace
this row with that.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.690
So if you start to feel like
this is something like what

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.290
you learned when you learned
solving systems of linear

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.510
equations, that's
no coincidence.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.990
Because matrices are actually
a very good way to represent

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.130
that, and I will show
you that soon.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.430
But anyway, let's do some
elementary row operations to

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.100
get this left hand side into
reduced row echelon form.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.780
Which is really just a fancy way
of saying, let's turn it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.610
into the identity matrix.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.660
So let's see what
we want to do.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.290
We want to have 1's
all across here.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.750
We want these to be 0's.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.870
Let's see how we can do
this efficiently.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.560
Let me draw the matrix again.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.350
So let's get a 0 here.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.445
That would be convenient.

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:19.769
So I'm going to keep the
top two rows the same.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.209
1, 0, 1.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.000
I have my dividing line.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.370
1, 0, 0.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.450
I didn't do anything there.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.000
I'm not doing anything
to the second row.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.875
0, 2, 1.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.700
0, 1, 0.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.120
And what I'm going to do, I'm
going to replace this row--

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.260
And just so you know my
motivation, my goal

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.490
is to get a 0 here.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.540
So I'm a little bit closer
to having the

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.200
identity matrix here.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.080
So how do I get a 0 here?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.750
What I could do is I can replace
this row with this row

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.280
minus this row.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.000
So I can replace the third
row with the third row

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.630
minus the first row.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.040
So what's the third row
minus the first row?

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.340
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.670
1 minus 0 is 1.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.860
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.150
Well I did it on the left hand
side, so I have to do it on

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.900
the right hand side.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.300
I have to replace this
with this minus this.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.010
So 0 minus 1 is minus 1.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.610
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.810
And 1 minus 0 is 1.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.270
Fair enough.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.800
Now what can I do?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.830
Well this row right here, this
third row, it has 0 and 0-- it

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.530
looks a lot like what I want
for my second row in the

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.720
identity matrix.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.470
So why don't I just swap
these two rows?

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.360
Why don't I just swap the
first and second rows?

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.740
So let's do that.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.590
I'm going to swap the first
and second rows.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.950
So the first row
stays the same.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.790
1, 0, 1.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.760
And then the other side stays
the same as well.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.830
And I'm swapping the second
and third rows.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.020
So now my second row
is now 0, 1, 0.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.990
And I have to swap it on
the right hand side.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.520
So it's minus 1, 0, 1.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.540
I'm just swapping these two.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.450
So then my third row now
becomes what the

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.450
second row was here.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.920
0, 2, 1.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.990
And 0, 1, 0.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.160
Fair enough.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.770
Now what do I want to do?

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.910
Well it would be nice if
I had a 0 right here.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.070
That would get me that much
closer to the identity matrix.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.260
So how could I get as 0 here?

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.390
Well what if I subtracted 2
times row two from row one?

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.360
Because this would be,
1 times 2 is 2.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.920
And if I subtracted that from
this, I'll get a 0 here.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.140
So let's do that.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.250
So the first row has
been very lucky.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.260
It hasn't had to do anything.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.580
It's just sitting there.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.670
1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.120
And the second row's not
changing for now.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.430
Minus 1, 0, 1.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.110
Now what did I say I
was going to do?

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:13.240
I'm going to subtract 2 times
row two from row three.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.960
So this is 0 minus
2 times 0 is 0.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.990
2 minus 2 times 1,
well that's 0.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.150
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:38.210
0 minus 2 times negative 1 is--
so let's remember 0 minus

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.880
2 times negative 1.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.520
So that's 0 minus negative
2, so that's positive 2.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.970
1 minus 2 times 0.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.810
Well that's just still 1.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.240
0 minus 2 times 1.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.490
So that's minus 2.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.130
Have I done that right?

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.810
I just want to make sure.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:04.800
0 minus 2 times-- right, 2
times minus 1 is minus 2.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.910
And I'm subtracting
it, so it's plus.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.150
OK, so I'm close.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.140
This almost looks like the
identity matrix or reduced row

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.680
echelon form.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.950
Except for this 1 right here.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.740
So I'm finally going to have
to touch the top row.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.450
And what can I do?

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:23.170
well how about I replace the top
row with the top row minus

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.060
the bottom row?

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.480
Because if I subtract
this from that,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.550
this'll get a 0 there.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.790
So let's do that.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.720
So I'm replacing the top
row with the top row

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.790
minus the third row.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.570
So 1 minus 0 is 1.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.659
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.000
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.559
That was our whole goal.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:48.000
And then 1 minus 2
is negative 1.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.490
0 minus 1 is negative 1.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:58.950
0 minus negative 2., well
that's positive 2.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.460
And then the other rows
stay the same.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.590
0, 1, 0, minus 1, 0, 1.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:15.550
And then 0, 0, 1, 2,
1, negative 2.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:16.640
And there you have it.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.650
We have performed a series
of operations on

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.720
the left hand side.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.380
And we've performed the
same operations on

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.960
the right hand side.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.670
This became the identity
matrix, or

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.410
reduced row echelon form.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.530
And we did this using
Gauss-Jordan elimination.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.180
And what is this?

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.570
Well this is the inverse of
this original matrix.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.960
This times this will equal
the identity matrix.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:46.750
So if this is a, than
this is a inverse.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.580
And that's all you have to do.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.700
And as you could see, this took
me half the amount of

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.260
time, and required a lot less
hairy mathematics than when I

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.310
did it using the adjoint and
the cofactors and the

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.110
determinant.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.990
And if you think about it, I'll
give you a little hint of

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.420
why this worked.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:06.910
Every one of these operations
I did on the left hand side,

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.570
you could kind of view them as
multiplying-- you know, to get

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.370
from here to here,
I multiplied.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.500
You can kind of say that
there's a matrix.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.240
That if I multiplied by that
matrix, it would have

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.670
performed this operation.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.250
And then I would have had to
multiply by another matrix to

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.550
do this operation.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.250
So essentially what we did is
we multiplied by a series of

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.440
matrices to get here.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.500
And if you multiplied all
of those, what we call

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.410
elimination matrices, together,
you essentially

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.070
multiply this times
the inverse.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.590
So what am I saying?

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:43.470
So if we have a, to go from
here to here, we have to

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.300
multiply a times the
elimination matrix.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.630
And this might be completely
confusing for you, so ignore

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.990
it if it is, but it might
be insightful.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.250
So what did we eliminate
in this?

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.470
We eliminated 3, 1.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.120
We multiplied by the
elimination matrix

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.670
3, 1, to get here.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.740
And then, to go from
here to here, we've

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.220
multiplied by some matrix.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:07.970
And I'll tell you more.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.160
I'll show you how
we can construct

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.940
these elimination matrices.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.830
We multiply by an elimination
matrix.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.150
Well actually, we had
a row swap here.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.070
I don't know what you
want to call that.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.240
You could call that
the swap matrix.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.730
We swapped row two for three.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.830
And then here, we multiplied
by elimination

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.110
matrix-- what did we do?

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.030
We eliminated this, so
this was row three,

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.270
column two, 3, 2.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.320
And then finally, to get here,
we had to multiply by

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.470
elimination matrix.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.740
We had to eliminate
this right here.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.220
So we eliminated row
one, column three.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.590
And I want you to know right
now that it's not important

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.420
what these matrices are.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.210
I'll show you how we can
construct these matrices.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.530
But I just want you to have kind
of a leap of faith that

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.600
each of these operations could
have been done by multiplying

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.040
by some matrix.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.510
But what we do know is by
multiplying by all of these

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.760
matrices, we essentially got
the identity matrix.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.930
Back here.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.450
So the combination of all of
these matrices, when you

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.600
multiply them by each
other, this must

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.370
be the inverse matrix.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.420
If I were to multiply each of
these elimination and row swap

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.420
matrices, this must be the
inverse matrix of a.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.680
Because if you multiply
all them times

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.130
a, you get the inverse.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.630
Well what happened?

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.780
If these matrices are
collectively the inverse

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.400
matrix, if I do them, if I
multiply the identity matrix

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.620
times them-- the elimination
matrix, this one times that

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.270
equals that.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.970
This one times that
equals that.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.510
This one times that
equals that.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.360
And so forth.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.870
I'm essentially multiplying--
when you combine all of

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.050
these-- a inverse times
the identity matrix.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.520
So if you think about it just
very big picture-- and I don't

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.470
want to confuse you.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.910
It's good enough at this
point if you just

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.370
understood what I did.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.500
But what I'm doing from all of
these steps, I'm essentially

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.800
multiplying both sides of this
augmented matrix, you could

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.450
call it, by a inverse.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.080
So I multiplied this by a
inverse, to get to the

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.300
identity matrix.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.740
But of course, if I multiplied
the inverse matrix times the

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.130
identity matrix, I'll get
the inverse matrix.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.990
But anyway, I don't want
to confuse you.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.410
Hopefully that'll give you
a little intuition.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.130
I'll do this later with some
more concrete examples.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.850
But hopefully you see that this
is a lot less hairy than

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.115
the way we did it with the
adjoint and the cofactors and

00:13:30.115 --> 00:13:32.540
the minor matrices and the
determinants, et cetera.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.290
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
