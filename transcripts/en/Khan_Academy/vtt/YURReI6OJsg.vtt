00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.520
Let's figure out the electron
configuration for nickel,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.300
right there.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.520
28 electrons.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.360
We just have to figure
out what shells and

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.540
orbitals they go in.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.580
28 electrons.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.210
So the way we've learned
to do it is, we

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.000
defined this as the s-block.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.830
And we can just remember that
helium actually belongs here

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.350
when we talk about orbitals
in the s-block.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.810
This is the d-block.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.300
This is the p-block.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.210
And so we could start with the
lowest energy electrons.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.145
We could either work forward
or work backwards.

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:34.630
If we work forwards, first
we fill up the first two

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.020
electrons going to 1s2.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.690
So remember we're
doing nickel.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.670
So we fill up 1s2 first
with two electrons.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.785
Then we go to 2s2.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:51.670
And remember this little small
superscript 2 just means we're

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.820
putting two electrons
into that subshell

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.140
or into that orbital.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.440
Actually, let me do each shell
in a different color.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.870
So 2s2.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.440
Then we fill out 2p6.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.700
We fill out all of these,
right there.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.220
So 2p6.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.310
Let's see, so far we've filled
out 10 electrons.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.600
We've configured 10.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.390
You can do it that way.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.590
Now we're on the third shell.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.990
So now we go to 3s2.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.190
Remember, we're dealing with
nickel, so we go to 3s2.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.480
Then we fill out in the third
shell the p orbital.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.730
So 3p6.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.810
We're in the third period, so
that's 3p6, right there.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.660
There's six of them.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.470
And then we go to the
fourth shell.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.450
I'll do it in yellow.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.700
So we do 4s2.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.990
And now we're in the d-block.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.540
And so we're filling in one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.670
seven, eight in this d-block.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.160
So it's going to say d8.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.010
And remember, it's not
going to be 4d8.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.650
We're going to go and backfill
the third shell.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.650
So it will be 3d8.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.650
So we could write 3d8 here.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.350
So this is the order in which
we fill, from lowest energy

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.420
state electrons to highest
energy state.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.200
But notice the highest energy
state electrons, which are

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.100
these that we filled in, in the
end, these eight, these

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.860
went into the third shell.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.200
So when you're filling the
d-block, you take the period

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.580
that you're in minus one.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.890
So we were in the fourth period
in the periodic table,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.550
but we subtracted one, right?

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.940
This is 4 minus 1.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.110
So this is the electron
configuration for nickel.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.790
And of course if we remember,
if we care about the valence

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.170
electrons, which electrons are
in the outermost shell, then

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.090
you would look at these
right here.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.280
These are the electrons that
will react, although these are

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.430
in a higher energy state.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.550
And these react because they're
the furthest. Or at

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.520
least, the way I visualize
them is that they have a

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.560
higher probability of being
further from the nucleus than

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.220
these right here.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.060
Now, another way to figure out
the electron configuration for

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.490
nickel-- and this is covered
in some chemistry classes,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.250
although I like the way we just
did it because you look

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.180
at the periodic table and you
gain a familiarity with it,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.510
which is important, because then
you'll start having an

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.250
intuition for how different
elements react with each

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.830
other-- is to just say, OK,
nickel has 28 electrons, if

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.410
it's neutral.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.710
It has 28 electrons, because
that's the same number of

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.750
protons, which is the
atomic number.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.600
Remember, 28 just tells you how
many protons there are.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.150
This is the number of protons.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.610
We're assuming it's neutral.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.230
So it has the same number
of electrons.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.700
That's not always going
to be the case.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.040
But when you do these electron
configurations, that tends to

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.050
be the case.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.180
So if we say nickel has 28, has
an atomic number of 28, so

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.430
it's electron configuration we
can do it this way, too.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.290
We can write the
energy shells.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.570
So one, two, three, four.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.980
And then on the top
we write s, p, d.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.180
Well we're not going
to get to f.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.510
But you could write f and
g and h and keep going.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.080
What's going to happen is you're
going to fill this one

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.060
first, then you're going to fill
this one, then that one,

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.720
then this one, then this one.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.560
Let me actually draw it.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.480
So what you do is, these are the
shells that exist, period.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.950
These are the shells that
exist, in green.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.620
What I'm drawing now isn't the
order that you fill them.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.930
This is just, they exist. So
there is a 3d subshell.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.340
There's not a 3f subshell.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.140
There is a 4f subshell.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.090
Let me draw a line here,
just so it becomes

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.430
a little bit neater.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.710
And the way you fill them is
you make these diagonals.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.780
So first you fill this s shell
like that, then you fill this

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.620
one like that.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.930
Then you do this diagonal
down like that.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.410
Then you do this diagonal
down like that.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.560
And then this diagonal
down like that.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.420
And you just have to know that
there's only two can fit in s,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.340
six in p, in this
case, 10 in d.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.040
And we can worry about f in the
future, but if you look at

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.610
the f-block on a periodic
table, you know how many

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.740
there are in f.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.820
So you fill it like that.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.300
So first you just say, OK.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.460
For nickel, 28 electrons.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.010
So first I fill this one out.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.260
So that's 1s2.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.660
Then I go, there's no 1p,
so then I go to 2s2.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.840
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.480
So then I go right here, 2s2.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.000
That's that right there.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.530
Then I go up to this diagonal,
and I come back down.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.720
And then there's 2p6.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.380
And you have to keep track of
how many electrons you're

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.320
dealing with, in this case.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.050
So we're up to 10 now.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.710
So we used that one up.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.260
Then the arrow tells us to go
down here, so now we do the

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.650
third energy shell.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.660
So 3s2.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.460
And then where do we go next?

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.520
3s2.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.550
Then we follow the arrow.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.260
We start there, there's
nothing there, there's

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.980
something here.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.020
So we go to 3p6.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.660
And then the next thing
we fill out is 4s2.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.820
So then we go to 4s2.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.390
And then what's the very
next thing we fill out?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.510
We have to go back to the top.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.790
We come here and then
we fill out 3d.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.470
And then how many electrons do
we have left to fill out?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.720
So we're going to be in 3d.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.530
And how many have
we used so far?

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.820
2 plus 2 is 4.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.650
4 plus 6 is 10.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.760
10 plus two is 12.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.040
18.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.550
20.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.600
We've used 20, so we have 8 more
electrons to configure.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:51.950
And the 3d subshell can fit the
8 we need, so we have 3d8.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.130
And there you go, you've got the
exact same answer that we

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.670
had when we used the
first method.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.770
Now I like the first method
because you're looking at the

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.090
periodic table the whole time,
so you kind of understand an

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.250
intuition of where all
the elements are.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.260
And you also don't have to keep
remembering, OK, how many

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
have I used up as I
filled the shells?

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.480
Right?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.700
Here you have to say, I used
two, then I used two more.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.770
And you have to draw this kind
of elaborate diagram.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.230
Here you can just use
the periodic table.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.440
And the important thing is
you can work backwards.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.230
Here there's no way of just
eyeballing this and saying,

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.920
OK, our most energetic electrons
are going to be 3d8,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.930
and our highest energy shell
is going to be 4s2.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.820
There's no way you could get
that out of this without going

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.330
through this fairly
involved process.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.740
But when do you use this method,
you can immediately

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:44.620
say, OK, if I'm worried about
element Zr, right here.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.790
If I'm worried about
element Zr.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.000
I could go through the whole
exercise of filling out the

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.430
entire electron configuration.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.800
But usually the highest shell,
or the highest energy

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.780
electrons, are the ones
that matter the most.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.580
So you immediately say, OK, I'm
filling in 2d there, but

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.360
remember, d, you go
one period below.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.230
So this is 4d2.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.550
Right?

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.640
Because the period is five.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.890
So you say, 4d2.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.130
And then, before that,
you filled

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.950
out the five s2 electrons.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.410
And then you could keep
going backwards.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.660
And you filled out the 4p6.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:31.450
And then, before you filled out
the 4p6, then you had 10

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.390
in the d here.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.400
But what is that?

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.820
It's in the fourth period, but d
you subtract one from it, so

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.620
this is 3d10.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.890
So 3d10.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.910
And then you had 4s2.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.140
This is getting messy.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.929
Let me just write that.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.920
So you have 4d2.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.400
That's those two there.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.800
Then you have 5s2.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.870
Then we had 4p6.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.130
That's over here.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.830
Then we had 3d10.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.930
Remember, 4 minus 1, so 3d10.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.660
And then you had 4s2.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.640
And you just keep going
backwards like that.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.620
But what's nice about going
backwards is you immediately

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.310
know, OK, what electrons are
in my highest energy shell?

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.450
Well I have this five as the
highest energy shell I'm at.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.320
And these two that I filled
right there, those are

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.850
actually the electrons in the
highest energy shell.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.480
They're not the highest
energy electrons.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.010
These are.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.280
But these are kind of the ones
that have the highest

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.030
probability of being furthest
away from the nucleus.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.780
So these are the ones that
are going to react.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.400
And these are the ones
that matter for

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.450
most chemistry purposes.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.180
And just a little touchpoint
here, and this isn't covered a

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.200
lot, but we like to think that
electrons are filling these

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.780
buckets, and they stay
in these buckets.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.100
But once you fill up an atom
with electrons, they're not

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.010
just staying in this nice,
well-behaved way.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.980
They're all jumping between
orbitals, and mixing together,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.330
and doing all sorts of crazy,
unpredictable things.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.750
But this method is what allows
us to at least get a sense of

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.350
what's happening in
the electron.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.440
For most purposes, they do tend
to react or behave in

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.500
ways that these orbitals kind
of stay to themselves.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.220
But anyway, the main point of
here is really just to teach

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.230
you how to do electron
configurations, because that's

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.710
really useful for
later on knowing

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.630
how things will interact.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.125
And what's especially useful is
to know what electrons are

00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:15.520
in the outermost shell, or what

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.770
are the valence electrons.
