00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.090
 

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.890
I've been requested to do a
video on the cross product,

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.390
and its special circumstances,
because I was at the point on

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.580
the physics playlist where I had
to teach magnetism anyway,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.050
so this is as good a time as any
to introduce the notion of

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:15.870
the cross product.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.170
So what's the cross product?

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.890
Well, we know about vector
addition, vector subtraction,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.840
but what happens when you
multiply vectors?

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.960
And there's actually two ways to
do it: with the dot product

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.200
or the cross product.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.300
And just keep in mind these
are-- well, really, every

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.140
operation we've learned is
defined by human beings for

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.500
some other purpose, and there's
nothing different

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.700
about the cross product.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.830
I take the time to say that
here because the cross

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.130
product, at least when I first
learned it, seemed a little

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.810
bit unnatural.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.740
Anyway, enough talk.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.180
Let me show you what it is.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.140
So the cross product of two
vectors: Let's say I have

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.600
vector a cross vector b, and the
notation is literally like

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.150
the times sign that you knew
before you started taking

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.130
algebra and using dots and
parentheses, so it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.770
literally just an x.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.400
So the cross product of vectors
a and b is equal to--

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.130
and this is going to seem very
bizarre at first, but

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.670
hopefully, we can get a little
bit of a visual feel of what

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.180
this means.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.830
It equals the magnitude of
vector a times the magnitude

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.350
of vector b times the sine of
the angle between them, the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.430
smallest angle between them.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.580
And now, this is the kicker, and
this quantity is not going

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.040
to be just a scalar quantity.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.340
It's not just going
to have magnitude.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.190
It actually has direction, and
that direction we specify by

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.760
the vector n, the
unit vector n.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.630
We could put a little
cap on it to show

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.540
that it's a unit vector.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.790
There are a couple of things
that are special about this

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.370
direction that's
specified by n.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.730
One, n is perpendicular to
both of these vectors.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.890
It is orthogonal to both of
these vectors, so we'll think

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.140
about it in a second
what that implies

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.580
about it just visually.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.789
And then the other thing is the
direction of this vector

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.840
is defined by the right
hand rule, and we'll

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.620
see that in a second.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.290
So let's try to think
about this visually.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.780
And I have to give you an
important caveat: You can only

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.050
take a cross product when
we are dealing in three

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.890
dimensions.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.970
A cross product really has--
maybe you could define a use

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.760
for it in other dimensions or a
way to take a cross product

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.230
in other dimensions, but it
really only has a use in three

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.820
dimensions, and that's useful,
because we live in a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.420
three-dimensional world.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.120
So let's see.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.280
Let's take some cross
products.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.300
I think when you see it
visually, it will make a

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.490
little bit more sense,
especially once you get used

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.332
to the right hand rule.

00:02:43.332 --> 00:02:49.250
So let's say that
that's vector b.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.550
I don't have to draw a
straight line, but it

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.130
doesn't hurt to.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.610
I don't have to draw
it neatly.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.370
 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.320
OK, here we go.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.650
Let's say that that is vector
a, and we want to take the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.690
cross product of them.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.040
This is vector a.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.230
This is b.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.250
I'll probably just switch to one
color because it's hard to

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.550
keep switching between them.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.690
And then the angle between
them is theta.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.350
Now, let's say the length of a
is-- I don't know, let's say

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.060
magnitude of a is equal to
5, and let's say that the

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.815
magnitude of b is equal to 10.

00:03:32.815 --> 00:03:34.310
It looks about double that.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.060
I'm just making up the
numbers on the fly.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.730
So what's the cross product?

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.910
Well, the magnitude
part is easy.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.660
Let's say this angle is
equal to 30 degrees.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.880
30 degrees, or if we wanted
to write it in radians, I

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.200
always-- just because we grow
up in a world of degrees, I

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.400
always find it easier to
visualize degrees, but we

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.780
could think about it in terms
of radians as well.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.030
30 degrees is-- let's see,
there's 3, 6-- it's pi over 6,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.670
so we could also write
pi over 6 radians.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.280
But anyway, this is a 30-degree
angle, so what will

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.810
be a cross b?

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.120
a cross b is going to equal
the magnitude of a for the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.000
length of this vector, so it's
going to be equal to 5 times

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.950
the length of this b vector, so
times 10, times the sine of

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.150
the angle between them.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.690
And, of course, you
could've taken the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.100
larger, the obtuse angle.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.970
You could have said this was the
angle between them, but I

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.780
said earlier that it was the
smaller, the acute, angle

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.505
between them up to 90 degrees.

00:04:38.505 --> 00:04:46.900
This is going to be sine of 30
degrees times this vector n.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.690
And it's a unit vector, so I'll
go over what direction

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.770
it's actually pointing
in a second.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.100
Let's just figure out
its magnitude.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.910
So this is equal to 50, and
what's sine of 30 degrees?

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.930
Sine of 30 degrees is 1/2.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.520
You could type it in your
calculator if you're not sure.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:11.780
So it's 5 times 10 times 1/2
times the unit vector, so that

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.870
equals 25 times the
unit vector.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.310
Now, this is where it gets,
depending on your point of

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.250
view, either interesting
or confusing.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.090
So what direction is this
unit vector pointing in?

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.310
So what I said earlier is, it's

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.140
perpendicular to both of these.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.300
So how can something be

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.710
perpendicular to both of these?

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.480
It seems like I can't
draw one.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.240
Well, that's because right here,
where I drew a and b,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.340
I'm operating in
two dimensions.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.270
But if I have a third dimension,
if I could go in or

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.540
out of my writing pad or, from
your point of view, your

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.350
screen, then I have a vector
that is perpendicular to both.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.190
So imagine of vector that's-- I
wish I could draw it-- that

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.620
is literally going straight in
at this point or straight out

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.290
at this point.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.350
Hopefully, you're seeing it.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.590
Let me show you the
notation for that.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.010
So if I draw a vector like this,
if I draw a circle with

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.670
an x in it like that, that is a
vector that's going into the

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.290
page or into the screen.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.690
And if I draw this, that is a
vector that's popping out of

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.190
the screen.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.106
And where does that convention
come from?

00:06:20.106 --> 00:06:21.920
It's from an arrowhead,
because what does

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.810
an arrow look like?

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.900
An arrow, which is our
convention for drawing

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.410
vectors, looks something like
this: The tip of an arrow is

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.680
circular and it comes to a
point, so that's the tip, if

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.520
you look at it head-on, if it
was popping out of the video.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.980
And what does the tail of
an arrow look like?

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.742
It has fins, right?

00:06:43.742 --> 00:06:46.020
There would be one fin here
and there'd be another fin

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.680
right there.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.840
And so if you took this arrow
and you were to go into the

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.070
page and just see the back of
the arrow or the behind of the

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.050
arrow, it would look
like that.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.140
So this is a vector that's going
into the page and this

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.650
is a vector that's going
out of the page.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.390
So we know that n is
perpendicular to both a and b,

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.890
and so the only way you can
get a vector that's

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.110
perpendicular to both of these,
it essentially has to

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.750
be perpendicular, or normal,
or orthogonal to the plane

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.260
that's your computer screen.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.020
But how do we know if it's going
into the screen or how

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.130
do we know if it's coming out of
the screen, this vector n?

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.950
And this is where the right hand
rule-- I know this is a

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.680
little bit overwhelming.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.550
We'll do a bunch of example
problems. But the right hand

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.620
rule, what you do is you take
your right hand-- that's why

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.560
it's called the right hand
rule-- and you take your index

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.010
finger and you point it in the
direction of the first vector

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.960
in your cross product,
and order matters.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.410
So let's do that.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.940
So you have to take your finger
and put it in the

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.330
direction of the first arrow,
which is a, and then you have

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.800
to take your middle finger and
point it in that direction of

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.290
the second arrow, b.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.770
So in this case, your
hand would look

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.850
something like this.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.110
I'm going to try to draw it.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:11.760
 

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.490
This is pushing the abilities
of my art skills.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.950
 

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.100
So that's my right hand.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.510
My thumb is going to be
coming down, right?

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.530
That is my right hand
that I drew.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.510
This is my index finger, and
I'm pointing it in the

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.200
direction of a.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.760
Maybe it goes a little bit more
in this direction, right?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.850
Then I put my middle finger, and
I kind of make an L with

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.169
it, or you could kind of say
it almost looks like you're

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.150
shooting a gun.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.520
And I point that in the
direction of b, and then

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.540
whichever direction that your
thumb faces in, so in this

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.220
case, your thumb is going
into the page, right?

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.040
Your thumb would be going down
if you took your right hand

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.150
into this configuration.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.700
So that tells us that the vector
n points into the page.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.110
So the vector n has magnitude
25, and it points into the

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.810
page, so we could draw it
like that with an x.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.720
If I were to attempt to draw
it in three dimensions, it

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.890
would look something
like this.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.250
Vector a.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.150
Let me see if I can give
some perspective.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.030
 

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:22.060
If this was straight down, if
that's vector n, then a could

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.085
look something like that.

00:09:23.085 --> 00:09:25.610
Let me draw it in the
same color as a.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.670
a could look something like
that, and then b would look

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.230
something like that.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.170
I'm trying to draw a
three-dimensional figure on

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.320
two dimensions, so it might look
a little different, but I

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:34.900
think you get the point.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.630
Here I drew a and
b on the plane.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.300
Here I have perspective
where I was able to

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.770
draw n going down.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.940
But this is the definition
of a cross product.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.910
Now, I'm going to leave it
there, just because for some

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.020
reason, YouTube hasn't been
letting me go over the limit

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.490
as much, and I will do another
video where I do several

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.880
problems, and actually, in the
process, I'm going to explain

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.600
a little bit about magnetism.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.960
And we'll take the cross product
of several things, and

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.810
hopefully, you'll get a little
bit better intuition.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.760
See you soon.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.260
