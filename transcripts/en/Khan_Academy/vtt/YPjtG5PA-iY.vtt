00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
Sal: I want to make a quick
correction to my second

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.550
oxidation video.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.029
It was pointed out that I made
an error that you will

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.980
probably find confusing.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.780
So I had written down
hydrogen peroxide.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.490
Because this was one of the
situations or the special

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.680
cases where oxygen's oxidation
state isn't

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.080
necessarily minus 2.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.580
So hydrogen peroxide is 2
hydrogens, 2 oxygens.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.780
And it's structure
looks like this.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.470
The oxygens are bonded to each
other, and they're each bonded

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.740
to a hydrogen.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.350
And we know oxygen is really
electronegative.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.800
It likes to hog electrons.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.890
And I said that in that video.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.870
And because it hogs electrons,
the hydrogens lose their

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.500
electron to oxygen, or at least
from the oxidation state

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.570
point of view.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.910
So they each have a plus 1
oxidation state, which I did

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.760
say in that video.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.240
And then I went on and my brain
was clearly-- and this

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.850
is actually a good point for you
to realize how confusing

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.150
this can sometimes
be if you're not

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.920
careful with your work.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.620
I say in the last video,
and obviously

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.970
oxygen gains an electron.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.530
And then I say and it's
oxidation state is plus 1.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.470
Which clearly makes no sense.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.440
If you gain an electron,
that will reduce

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.250
your oxidation state.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.810
It will reduce that hypothetical
charge.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.470
And so your oxidation
state is minus 1 in

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.230
each of these oxygens.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.250
And, of course, this is
a special case because

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.240
traditionally, oxygen in
the case I always show

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.030
it with, is in water.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.160
When it takes 2 electrons, 1
from this hydrogen and 1 from

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.340
that hydrogen, it normally has
an oxidation state of minus 2

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.760
and, of course, in this case,
it's plus 1 and plus 1 for the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.810
2 hydrogens.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.630
I think later, when I go back
to the molecular formula, I

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.920
kind of corrected in my head.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.220
But I want to be very
clear to you.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.190
Oxygen does not have an
oxidation state of plus 1 in

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.070
hydrogen peroxide.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.370
It is minus 1.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.950
I said it gained the electrons,
but then my brain

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.370
obviously heard the word gaining
and wanted to put a

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.230
plus sign there.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.820
No.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.080
it gained an electron that
reduces the oxygen.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.190
It makes its oxidation state
minus 1 for hydrogen peroxide.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.390
So hydrogen peroxide has 2
hydrogens with a plus 1

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.590
oxidation state.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.210
And it has 2 oxygens with a
minus 1 oxidation state.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.910
One times 2 minus 1 times 2 is
equal to 0, so we're all cool.
