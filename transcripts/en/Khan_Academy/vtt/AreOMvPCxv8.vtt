00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.550
Let's say I've got a triangle.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.900
There is my triangle
right there.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.550
And I only know the lengths of
the sides of the triangle.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.490
This side has length a, this
side has length b, and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.360
that side has length c.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.480
And I'm asked to find the
area of that triangle.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.870
So far all I'm equipped with is
the idea that the area, the

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.930
area of a triangle is equal
to 1/2 times the base of

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.380
the triangle times the
height of the triangle.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.570
So the way I've drawn this
triangle, the base of this

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.060
triangle, would be side c, but
the height we don't know.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.900
The height would be that h
right there and we don't

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.750
even know what that h is.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.200
So this would be the h.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.360
So the question is how do
we figure out the area

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.660
of this triangle?

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.150
If you watched the last
video you know that you

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.440
use Heron's formula.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.910
But the idea here is to try
to prove Heron's formula.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.530
So let's just try to figure
out h from just using

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.970
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.190
And from there, once we know h,
we can apply this formula and

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.100
figure out the area
of this triangle.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.370
So we already
labeled this as h.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.120
Let me define another
variable here.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.270
This is a trick you'll see
pretty often in geometry.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.990
Let me define this is x, and if
this is x in magenta, then in

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.990
this bluish-purplish color,
that would be c minus x, right?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.710
This whole length is c
-- the whole base is c.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.560
So if this part is x, then
this part is c minus x.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.060
What I could do now, since
these are both right angles,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.250
and I know that because this is
the height, I can set up two

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.600
Pythagorean theorem equations.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.890
First, I could do this left
hand side and I can write that

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.880
x squared plus h squared
is equal to a squared.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.690
That's what I get from
this left hand triangle.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.000
Then from this right hand
triangle, I get c minus x

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.030
squared plus h squared
is equal to b squared.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.760
So I'm assuming I know a, b and
c, so I have two equations

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.950
with two unknowns.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.290
The unknowns are x and h.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.220
And remember, h is what
we're trying to figure out

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.270
because we already know c.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.540
If we know h, we can
apply the area formula.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.900
So how can we do that?

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.200
Well, let's substitute
for h to figure out x.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.360
When I say that I mean let's
solve for h squared here.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.890
If we solve for h squared
here we just subtract x

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.320
squared from both sides.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.540
We can write that x squared --
sorry, we could write that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.720
h squared is equal to a
squared minus x squared.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.770
Then we could take this
information and substitute

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.640
it over here for h squared.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.030
So this bottom equation
becomes c minus x

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.990
squared plus h squared.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.610
h squared we know from this
left hand side equation.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.620
h squared is going to be equal
to -- so plus, I'll do it in

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.160
that color -- a squared minus x
squared is equal to b squared.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.650
I just substituted the
value of that in here, the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.280
value of that in there.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.860
Now let's expand this
expression out.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.750
c minus x squared, that
is c squared minus

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.320
2cx plus x squared.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.200
Then we have the minus --
sorry, we have the plus a

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.280
squared minus x squared
equals b squared.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.060
We have an x squared and
a minus x squared there,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.610
so those cancel out.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.790
Let's add the 2cx to both
sides of this equation.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.930
So now our equation
would become c squared

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.720
plus a squared.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.490
I'm adding 2cx to both sides.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.440
So you add 2cx to this,
you get 0 is equal to

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.580
b squared plus 2cx.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.370
All I did here is I canceled
out the x squared and then I

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.600
added 2cx to both sides
of this equation.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.130
My goal here is to solve for x.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.580
Once I solve for x, then
I can solve for h and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.350
apply that formula.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.090
Now to solve for x, let's
subtract b squared

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.040
from both sides.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.200
So we'll get c squared
plus a squared minus b

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.020
squared is equal to 2cx.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.160
Then if we divide both sides by
2c, we get c squared plus a

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.600
squared minus b squared
over 2c is equal to x.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.880
We've just solved for x here.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.290
Now, our goal is to solve
for the height, so that

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.930
we can apply 1/2 times
base times height.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.120
So to do that, we go back to
this equation right here

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.040
and solve for our height.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.800
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.290
We know that our height
squared is equal to a

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.520
squared minus x squared.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.330
Instead of just writing x
squared let's substitute here.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.430
So it's minus x squared -- x
is this thing right here.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.880
So c squared plus a
squared minus b squared

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.670
over 2c, squared.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.320
This is the same
thing as x squared.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.090
We just solved for that.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.950
So h is going to be equal to
the square root of all this

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.610
business in there -- I'll
switch the colors -- of a

00:05:51.610 --> 00:06:00.070
squared minus c squared plus
a squared minus b squared

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.150
-- all of that squared.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.800
Let me make it a little bit
neater than that because

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.720
I don't want to--.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.980
The square root -- make sure I
have enough space -- of a

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:20.130
squared minus all of this stuff
squared -- we have c squared

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.800
plus a squared minus b
squared, all of that over 2c.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.670
That is the height
of our triangle.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.310
The triangle that we
started off with up here.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.360
Let me copy and paste that
just so that we can remember

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.070
what we're dealing with.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.600
Copy it and then let me
paste it down here.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.300
So I've pasted it down here.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.210
So we know what the height
is -- it's this big

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.830
convoluted formula.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.180
The height in terms of a, b
and c is this right here.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.570
So if we wanted to figure out
the area -- the area of our

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.270
triangle -- let me
do it in pink.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.772
The area of our triangle is
going to be 1/2 times our base

00:07:03.772 --> 00:07:09.850
-- our base is this entire
length, c -- times c times our

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.260
height, which is this
expression right here.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.680
Let me just copy and
paste this instead of--.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.390
So let me copy and paste.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.450
So times the height.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.910
So this now is our
expression for the area.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.810
Now you're immediately saying
gee, that doesn't look a lot

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.790
like Heron's formula,
and you're right.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.360
It does not look a lot like
Heron's formula, but what I'm

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.820
going to show you in the next
video is that this essentially

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.230
is Heron's formula.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.050
This is a harder to remember
version of Heron's formula.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.000
I'm going to apply a lot of
algebra to essentially simplify

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.260
this to Heron's formula.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.430
But this will work.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.520
If you could memorize this,
I think Heron's a lot

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.050
easier to memorize.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.300
But if you can memorize this
and you just know a, b and

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.700
c, you apply this formula
right here and you will get

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.940
the area of a triangle.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.290
Well, actually let's just apply
this just to show that this at

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.710
least gives the same
number as Heron's.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:15.920
So in the last video we had a
triangle that had sides 9, 11

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:22.350
and 16, and its area using
Heron's was equal to 18

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.290
times the square root of 7.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.780
Let's see what we get when we
applied this formula here.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:36.260
So we get the area is equal
to 1/2 times 16 times the

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.300
square root of a squared.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:49.330
That is 81 minus -- let's see,
c squared is 16, so that's 256.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:58.020
256 plus a squared, that's
at 81 minus b squared,

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.250
so minus 121.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.120
All of this stuff is squared.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.530
All of that over 2 times c
-- all of that over 32.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.150
So let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.770
81 minus 121, that is minus 40.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.790
So this becomes 216 over 32.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.470
So area is equal to
1/2 times 8 is 8.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.530
Let me switch colors.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:38.820
1/2 times 16 is 8 times the
square root of 81 minus 256.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.370
81 minus 121, that's minus 40.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.370
256 minus 40 is 216.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:48.270
216 over 32 squared.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.630
Now, this is a lot of
math to do so let me

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.870
get out a calculator.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.140
I'm really just trying to show
you that these two numbers

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.440
should give us our same number.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.290
So if we turn on
our calculator--.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.440
First of all, let's just
figure out what 18

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.420
square root of 7 are.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.590
18 times the square root
of 7 -- this is what

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.580
we got using Heron's.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.100
We got 47.62.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.160
Let's see if this is 47.62.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:26.700
So we have 8 times the square
root of 81 minus 216 divided

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:35.140
by 32 squared, and then we
close our square roots.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.990
And we get the
exact same number.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.890
I was worried -- I actually
didn't do this calculation

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.580
ahead of time so I might have
made a careless mistake.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.310
But there you go, you get
the exact same number.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.170
So our formula just now gave
us the exact same value

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.350
as Heron's formula.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:54.030
But what I'm going to do in the
next video is prove to you that

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.690
this can actually be reduced
algebraically to Heron's.
