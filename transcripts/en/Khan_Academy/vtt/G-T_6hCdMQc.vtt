00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.017
Let's just do a ton of more examples,

00:00:03.017 --> 00:00:07.036
just so we make sure that we're getting this trig function thing down well.

00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:11.447
So let's construct ourselves some right triangles.

00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:13.668
Let's construct ourselves some right triangles,

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:15.186
and I want to be very clear.

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:18.042
The way I've defined it so far, this will only work in right triangles.

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:23.475
So if you're trying to find the trig functions of angles that aren't part of right triangles,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.704
we're going to see that we're going to have to construct right triangles,

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:27.867
but let's just focus on the right triangles for now.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:31.344
So let's say that I have a triangle,

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:33.897
where let's say this length down here is seven,

00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:37.757
and let's say the length of this side up here,

00:00:37.757 --> 00:00:39.452
let's say that that is four.

00:00:39.452 --> 00:00:42.516
Let's figure out what the hypotenuse over here is going to be.

00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:45.720
So we know -let's call the hypotenuse, "h"-

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.200
we know that h squared is going to be equal to seven squared plus four squared,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.194
we know that from the Pythagorean theorem,

00:00:55.194 --> 00:00:57.469
that the hypotenuse squared is equal to

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.974
the square of each of the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:04.533
h squared is equal to seven squared plus four squared.

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:09.776
So this is equal to forty-nine plus sixteen,

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:11.800
forty-nine plus sixteen,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.553
forty nine plus ten is fifty-nine, plus six is sixty-five.

00:01:18.553 --> 00:01:21.107
It is sixty five. So this h squared,

00:01:21.107 --> 00:01:25.705
let me write: h squared -that's different shade of yellow-

00:01:25.705 --> 00:01:28.818
so we have h squared is equal to sixty-five.

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:33.533
Did I do that right? Forty nine plus ten is fifty nine, plus another six is sixty-five,

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:37.600
or we could say that h is equal to, if we take the square root of both sides,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.200
square root

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.933
square root of sixty five. And we really can't simplify
this at all.

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.699
This is thirteen.

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:47.463
This is the same thing as thirteen times five,

00:01:47.463 --> 00:01:50.388
both of those are not perfect squares and

00:01:50.388 --> 00:01:51.804
they're both prime so you can't simplify this any more.

00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:55.467
So this is equal to the square root of sixty five.

00:01:55.467 --> 00:02:02.114
Now let's find the trig, let's find the trig functions for this angle up here.

00:02:02.114 --> 00:02:05.457
Let's call that angle up there theta.

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:06.533
So whenever you do it

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:09.467
you always want to write down - at least for me it works out to write down -

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.714
"soh cah toa".

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:13.120
soh...

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.464
...soh cah toa. I have these vague memories

00:02:16.464 --> 00:02:18.786
of my trigonometry teacher.

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:21.293
Maybe I've read it in some book. I don't know - you know, some... about

00:02:21.293 --> 00:02:23.867
some type of indian princess named "soh cah toa" or whatever,

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:26.123
but it's a very useful mnemonic,

00:02:26.123 --> 00:02:27.564
so we can apply "soh cah toa".

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:31.046
Let's find, let's say we want to find the cosine.

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:34.436
We want to find the cosine of our angle.

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:37.965
We wanna find the cosine of our angle, you say: "soh cah toa!"

00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:40.800
So the "cah". "Cah" tells us what to do with cosine,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.027
the "cah" part tells us

00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:46.371
that cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:51.433
Cosine is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:55.798
So let's look over here to theta; what side is adjacent?

00:02:55.798 --> 00:02:57.702
Well we know that the hypotenuse,

00:02:57.702 --> 00:03:00.767
we know that that hypotenuse is this side over here.

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:04.761
So it can't be that side. The only other side that's kind of adjacent to it that

00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:07.133
isn't the hypotenuse, is this four.

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:10.473
So the adjacent side over here, that side is,

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:14.374
it's literally right next to the angle,

00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:15.754
it's one of the sides that kind of forms the angle

00:03:15.754 --> 00:03:17.133
it's four over the hypotenuse.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:21.108
The hypotenuse we already know is square root
of sixty-five.

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:25.380
so it's four over the square root of sixty-five.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.142
And sometimes people will want you to rationalize the denominator which means

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:32.625
they don't like to have an irrational number in the denominator,

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:35.227
like the square root of sixty five,

00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:39.359
and if they - if you wanna rewrite this without a irrational number in the denominator,

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.634
you can multiply the numerator and the denominator

00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:43.306
by the square root of sixty-five.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.094
This clearly will not change the number,

00:03:45.094 --> 00:03:48.122
because we're multiplying it by something over itself,

00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:49.111
so we're multiplying the number by one.

00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:52.780
That won't change the number, but at least it gets rid of the irrational number in the denominator.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.127
So the numerator becomes

00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:57.800
four times the square root of sixty-five,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.461
and the denominator, square root of 65 times square root of 65, is just going to be 65.

00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:07.130
We didn't get rid of the irrational number, it's still there, but it's now in the numerator.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.777
Now let's do the other trig functions

00:04:09.777 --> 00:04:12.401
or at least the other core trig functions.

00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:14.399
We'll learn in the future that there's actually a ton of them

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:15.443
but they're all derived from these.

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:19.733
so let's think about what the sine of theta is. Once again
go to "soh cah toa".

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:25.474
The "soh" tells what to do with sine. Sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:29.200
Sine is equal to opposite over hypotenuse.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.372
Sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:04:31.372 --> 00:04:34.390
So for this angle what side is opposite?

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.430
We just go opposite it, what it opens into, it's opposite the seven

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.200
so the opposite side is the seven.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.468
This is, right here - that is the opposite side

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:47.800
and then the hypotenuse, it's opposite over hypotenuse.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.109
The hypotenuse is the square root of sixty-five.

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:52.966
Square root of sixty-five.

00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:55.133
and once again if we wanted to rationalize this,

00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:59.933
we could multiply times the square root of 65 over the square root of 65

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:04.298
and the the numerator, we will get seven square root of 65

00:05:04.298 --> 00:05:07.966
and in the denominator we will get just sixty-five again.

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:10.474
Now let's do tangent!

00:05:10.474 --> 00:05:12.796
Let us do tangent.

00:05:12.796 --> 00:05:14.793
So if i ask you the tangent

00:05:14.793 --> 00:05:17.394
of - the tangent of theta

00:05:17.394 --> 00:05:20.784
once again go back to "soh cah toa".

00:05:20.784 --> 00:05:23.106
The toa part tells us what to do with tangent

00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:24.800
it tells us...

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.053
it tells us that tangent

00:05:27.053 --> 00:05:29.867
is equal to opposite over adjacent

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:33.137
is equal to opposite over

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:35.867
opposite over adjacent

00:05:35.867 --> 00:05:38.709
So for this angle, what is opposite? We've already figured it out.

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:41.124
it's seven. It opens into the seven.

00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:42.533
It is opposite the seven.

00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:46.372
So it's seven over what side is adjacent.

00:05:46.372 --> 00:05:48.200
well this four is adjacent.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.295
This four is adjacent. So the adjacent side is four.

00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:54.330
so it's seven over four,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.133
and we're done.

00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:59.375
We figured out all of the trig ratios for theta. let's do another one.

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:00.416
Let's do another one.

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:02.719
i'll make it a little bit concrete 'cause right now we've been saying,

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:06.434
"oh, what's tangent of x, tangent of theta." let's make it a little bit more concrete.

00:06:06.434 --> 00:06:08.431
Let's say...

00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:10.799
let's say, let me draw another right triangle,

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:13.772
that's another right triangle here.

00:06:13.772 --> 00:06:17.533
Everything we're dealing with, these are going to be right triangles.

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:21.109
let's say the hypotenuse has length four,

00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:26.357
let's say that this side over here has length two,

00:06:26.357 --> 00:06:31.790
and let's say that this length over here is going to be two times the square root of three.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.462
We can verify that this works.

00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:36.467
If you have this side squared, so you have - let me write it down -

00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:38.803
two times the square root of three squared

00:06:38.803 --> 00:06:42.471
plus two squared, is equal to what?

00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:46.467
this is two. There's going to be four times three.

00:06:46.467 --> 00:06:49.763
four times three plus four,

00:06:49.763 --> 00:06:53.478
and this is going to be equal to twelve plus four is equal to sixteen

00:06:53.478 --> 00:06:57.800
and sixteen is indeed four squared. So this does equal four squared,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.790
it does equal four squared. It satisfies the pythagorean theorem

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.133
and if you remember some of your work from 30 60 90 triangles

00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:07.781
that you might have learned in geometry,

00:07:07.781 --> 00:07:11.450
you might recognize that this is a 30 60 90 triangle.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.133
This right here is our right angle,

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:15.867
- i should have drawn it from the get go to show that this is a right triangle -

00:07:15.867 --> 00:07:20.366
this angle right over here is our thirty degree angle

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:23.385
and then this angle up here, this angle up here is

00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:26.125
a sixty degree angle,

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:27.797
and it's a thirty sixteen ninety because

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:31.791
the side opposite the thirty degrees is half the hypotenuse

00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:36.800
and then the side opposite the 60 degrees is a squared of 3 times the other side

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.432
that's not the hypotenuse.

00:07:38.432 --> 00:07:40.159
So that said, we're not gonna ...

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:43.415
this isn't supposed to be a review of 30 60 90 triangles although i just did it.

00:07:43.415 --> 00:07:46.933
Let's actually find the trig ratios for the different angles.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:51.295
So if i were to ask you or if anyone were to ask you, what is...

00:07:51.295 --> 00:07:54.639
what is the sine of thirty degrees?

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:58.447
and remember 30 degrees is one of the angles in this triangle but it would apply

00:07:58.447 --> 00:08:01.698
whenever you have a 30 degree angle and you're dealing with the right triangle.

00:08:01.698 --> 00:08:05.135
We'll have broader definitions in the future but if you say sine of thirty degrees,

00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:09.035
hey, this angle right over here is thirty degrees so i can use this right triangle,

00:08:09.035 --> 00:08:12.133
and we just have to remember "soh cah toa"

00:08:12.133 --> 00:08:17.116
We rewrite it. soh, cah, toa.

00:08:17.116 --> 00:08:22.782
"sine tells us" (correction). soh tells us what to do with sine. sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:08:22.782 --> 00:08:26.358
sine of thirty degrees is the opposite side,

00:08:26.358 --> 00:08:30.723
that is the opposite side which is two over the hypotenuse.

00:08:30.723 --> 00:08:32.395
The hypotenuse here is four.

00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:35.646
it is two fourths which is the same thing as one-half.

00:08:35.646 --> 00:08:40.800
sine of thirty degrees you'll see is always going to be equal to one-half.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.144
now what is the cosine?

00:08:44.144 --> 00:08:46.867
What is the cosine of thirty degrees?

00:08:46.867 --> 00:08:50.135
Once again go back to "soh cah toa".

00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:52.643
The cah tells us what to do with cosine.

00:08:52.643 --> 00:08:56.033
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:08:56.033 --> 00:08:59.051
So for looking at the thirty degree angle it's the adjacent.

00:08:59.051 --> 00:09:01.791
This, right over here is adjacent. it's right next to it.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.467
it's not the hypotenuse. it's the adjacent over the hypotenuse.

00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:09.129
so it's two square roots of three

00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:13.633
adjacent over...over the hypotenuse, over four.

00:09:13.633 --> 00:09:16.977
or if we simplify that, we divide the numerator and the denominator by two

00:09:16.977 --> 00:09:20.646
it's the square root of three over two.

00:09:20.646 --> 00:09:22.782
Finally, let's do the tangent.

00:09:22.782 --> 00:09:27.800
The tangent of thirty degrees,

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.305
we go back to "soh cah toa".

00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:31.699
soh cah toa

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:34.800
toa tells us what to do with tangent. It's opposite over adjacent

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.804
you go to the 30 degree angle because that's what we care about, tangent of 30.

00:09:38.804 --> 00:09:42.101
tangent of thirty. Opposite is two,

00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:46.200
opposite is two and the adjacent is two square roots of three.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.045
It's right next to it. It's adjacent to it.

00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:49.439
adjacent means next to.

00:09:49.439 --> 00:09:52.039
so two square roots of three

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:54.454
so this is equal to... the twos cancel out

00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:56.776
one over the square root of three

00:09:56.776 --> 00:10:00.723
or we could multiply the numerator and the denominator by the square root of three.

00:10:00.723 --> 00:10:05.367
So we have square root of three over square root of three

00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:08.804
and so this is going to be equal to the numerator square root of three and then

00:10:08.804 --> 00:10:12.473
the denominator right over here is just going to be three.

00:10:12.473 --> 00:10:15.800
So that we've rationalized a square root of three over three.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.442
Fair enough.

00:10:17.442 --> 00:10:20.693
Now lets use the same triangle to figure out the trig ratios for the sixty degrees,

00:10:20.693 --> 00:10:22.457
since we've already drawn it.

00:10:22.457 --> 00:10:28.328
so what is... what is the sine of the sixty degrees?

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:30.166
and i think you're hopefully getting the hang of it now.

00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:34.253
Sine is opposite over adjacent. soh from the "soh cah toa".

00:10:34.253 --> 00:10:36.668
for the sixty degree angle what side is opposite?

00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:39.315
what opens out into the two square roots of three,

00:10:39.315 --> 00:10:42.566
so the opposite side is two square roots of three,

00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:45.306
and from the sixty degree angle the adj-oh sorry

00:10:45.306 --> 00:10:47.999
its the opposite over hypotenuse, don't want to confuse you.

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:50.507
so it is opposite over hypotenuse

00:10:50.507 --> 00:10:54.315
so it's two square roots of three over four. four is the hypotenuse.

00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:59.981
so it is equal to, this simplifies to square root of three over two.

00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:05.507
What is the cosine of sixty degrees? cosine of sixty degrees.

00:11:05.507 --> 00:11:10.244
so remember "soh cah toa". cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:11:10.244 --> 00:11:13.667
adjacent is the two sides, right next to the sixty degree angle.

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:17.907
So it's two over the hypotenuse which is four.

00:11:17.907 --> 00:11:20.972
So this is equal to one-half

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:24.176
and then finally, what is the tangent?

00:11:24.176 --> 00:11:27.984
what is the tangent of sixty degrees?

00:11:27.984 --> 00:11:32.349
Well tangent, "soh cah toa". Tangent is opposite over adjacent

00:11:32.349 --> 00:11:34.671
opposite the sixty degrees

00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:36.400
is two square roots of three

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.000
two square roots of three

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.919
and adjacent to that

00:11:39.919 --> 00:11:42.733
adjacent to that is two.

00:11:42.733 --> 00:11:44.800
Adjacent to sixty degrees is two.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.650
So its opposite over adjacent, two square roots of three over two

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.644
which is just equal to the square root of three.

00:11:52.644 --> 00:11:54.641
And I just wanted to -look how these are related-

00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:57.984
the sine of thirty degrees is the same as the cosine of sixty degrees.

00:11:57.984 --> 00:12:01.333
The cosine of 30 degrees is the same thing as the sine of 60 degrees

00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:03.966
and then these guys are the inverse of each other

00:12:03.966 --> 00:12:05.635
and i think if you think a little bit about this triangle

00:12:05.635 --> 00:12:07.105
it will start to make sense why.

00:12:07.105 --> 00:12:08.461
we'll keep extending
this and

00:12:08.461 --> 99:59:59.999
give you a lot more practice in the next few videos.
