00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.850
We're asked to write this right
here in word form, and

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.110
I'm not saying it out loud
because that would give the

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.720
answer away.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.370
We have 63.15 that we want
to write in word form.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.580
Well, the stuff to the left of
the decimal point is pretty

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.320
straightforward.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.550
Let me actually color code it.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.440
So we have 6, 3.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.220
Let me do it all in
different colors.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.410
And then we have a decimal, and
then we have a 1 and a 5.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.120
There's one common way of doing
this, but we'll talk

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.040
about the different ways you
could express this as a word.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.320
But we know how to write
this stuff to the left.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.470
This is pretty straightforward.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.950
This is just sixty-three.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.060
Let me write that down.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.850
So this is sixty-three.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.173
And instead of the decimal,
we'll write, and.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.290
Now there's two ways
to go here.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:13.110
We could say, and one tenth
and five hundredths, or we

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.240
could just say, look, this
is fifteen hundredths.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.540
One tenth is ten hundredths.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.160
So one tenth and five hundredths
is fifteen

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.180
hundredths.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.790
So maybe I can write it like
this: sixty-three and fifteen

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.040
hundredths.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.410
Just like that.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.830
Now, it might have been a little
bit more natural to

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.350
say, how come I don't say
one tenth and then five

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.680
hundredths?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.280
And you could, but that would
just make it a little bit

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.360
harder for someone's brain to
process it when you say it.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.620
So it could have been
sixty-three-- so let me copy

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.870
and paste that.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.490
It could be sixty-three and, and
then you would write, one

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:14.060
tenth for this digit right
there, and five hundredths.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.570
Sixty-three and one tenth and
five hundredths is hard for

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.010
most people's brains
to process.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.710
But if you say, fifteen
hundredths, people get what

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.780
you're saying.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.300
Not to beat a dead horse, but
this right here, this is 1/10

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.730
right here and then this
is 5/100, 5 over 100.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.050
But if you were to add these
two, If you were to add 1/10

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.120
plus 5/100 -- so
let's do that.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.770
If you were to add 1/10 plus
5/100, how would you do it?

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.060
You need a common denominator.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.740
100 is divisible by both 10 and
100, so multiply both the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.820
numerator and denominator
of this character by 10.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.130
You get 10 on the top and
100 on the bottom.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.990
1/10 is the same thing
as 10 over 100.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.930
10/100 plus 5/100 is equal to
15 over 100, so this piece

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.030
right here is equal to 15/100.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.420
And that's why we say
sixty-three and fifteen

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.670
hundredths.
