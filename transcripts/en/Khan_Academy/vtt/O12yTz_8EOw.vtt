00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.850
We now know what a
probability distribution is.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.960
It could be a discrete
probability distribution or a

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.080
continuous one, and we learned
that that's a probability

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.200
density function.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.890
Now let's study a couple
of the more common ones.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.810
So let's say I have a coin,
and it's a fair coin, and I'm

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.190
going to flip it five times.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.800
And I'm going to define
my random variable,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.272
X, I'll define it.

00:00:27.272 --> 00:00:29.390
I'll make it a capital X.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:39.540
It equals the number of
heads I get after 5 flips.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.640
Maybe I flip them all at once.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.395
Maybe I have 5 coins and I
flip them all at once and

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:43.270
I just count the heads.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.820
Or I could have one coin and I
could flip it five times and

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.520
see the number of heads.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.740
It actually doesn't matter.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.900
But let's say I have 1 coin and
I flip it five times, just

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.120
so we have no ambiguity.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.310
So this is my definition
of my random variable.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.186
As we know, a random variable,
it's a little different than a

00:00:57.186 --> 00:00:58.740
regular variable, it's
more of a function.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.740
It assigns a number with
an experiment and this

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.480
one's pretty easy.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.580
We just count the number of
heads we got after 5 flips and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.690
that's our random variable, X.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.930
Let's think a little bit of
what are the different

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.050
probabilities of getting
different numbers here?

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.820
So what is the probability
that X, big capital

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.670
X, is equal to 0?

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.880
So what's the probability that
you get no heads after 5 flips?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.020
Well, that's essentially the
same thing as the probability

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.690
of getting all tails.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.750
This is a bit of a
review of probability.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630
You have to get all tails.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.460
And what's the probably
of each of these tails?

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.275
Well, it's 1/2.

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:43.710
So it'd have to be 1/2
times 1/2 times 1/2

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.180
times 1/2 times 1/2.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.520
So it'd have to be 1/2
to the fifth power.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.750
1 to the fifth is 1 over
2 to the fifth is 32.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.920
Fair enough.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.680
Now what's the probability--
I'm going through a little

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.730
bit of a probability review.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.810
Just because I think it's
important just to get the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.240
intuition of where we're going
now and how you actually form a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.810
discrete probably distribution.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.430
Now what's the probability
that you get exactly 1 head?

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.170
Well, that could just
be the first head.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.290
It could be heads, then tails,
tails, tails, tails, tails.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.790
Or it could be the second head.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.510
It could be the probability of
tails, heads, tail, tails,

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.810
tails and so forth.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.350
This one head that you get, it
could be in any of the 5 spots.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.710
So what's the probability of
each of these situations?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.570
Well the probability that
you get a head is 1/2.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.220
Then the probability you
get tails is 1/2 times

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.870
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.250
So the probability of each of
these situations is 1/32.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.730
Just like the probability of
this particular situation.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.460
In fact, the probability of any
particular order of heads and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.760
tails is going to
be 1 out of 32.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.420
There's actually 32
possible scenarios.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.590
So the probability of
this is 1 out of 32.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.100
The probability of
this is 1 out of 32.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.600
And there's situations like
this because the heads could

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.420
be in any of the 5 spots.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.230
So the probability that we have
exactly one head is equal to 5

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.300
times 1/32, which
is equal to 5/32.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.880
Fair enough.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.330
Now it gets interesting.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.590
What is the probability--
I'll do each of these

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.620
in a different color.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.400
What is the probability that my
random variable is equal to 2?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.970
So I flip the coin five times,
what is the probability

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.960
that I get exactly 2 heads?

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.910
Now it becomes a little
bit interesting.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.700
So what are all the situations?

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.370
I could have heads, heads,
tails, tails, tails.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.350
I could have a head, tails,
heads, tails, tails.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.060
And if you think about it
there's these two heads and

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.720
they can go in a bunch of
different places, and it starts

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.750
to get a little bit confusing.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.950
You can't just think of it
in kind of the scenario

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.920
analysis like we did here.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.640
You can, but it becomes
a little bit confusing.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.700
You have to realize one thing.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.120
Each of the scenarios, there's
a 1 out of 32 probability.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.880
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2
times 1/2 times 1/2.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.240
So that's a 1 out of 32
probability-- each of those.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.310
And we have to think about, how
many of these scenarios satisfy

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.420
our condition-- 2 heads?

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.810
So essentially you could
imagine we have 5 flips

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.340
and we're going to choose
2 of them to be heads.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.850
So you could almost imagine if
you had all the flips sitting

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.440
around, and we had two chairs,
and we said, OK, whichever

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.240
flips sit in these chairs, they
get to be the heads chair.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.770
Or they get to be
the heads flips.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.450
And we don't care of
what order they sit in.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.800
I'm going some place with this,
just so you get hopefully,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.710
a little intuition.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.700
And you might want to watch
some of the probability videos

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.320
on this when I talk about the
binomial theorem and all that.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.680
Because I go into this in
a little bit more detail.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.990
But if you think about it that
way, the binomial coefficient

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.690
kind of starts to make sense.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.290
Because if you think about,
OK, I have 5 heads-- I

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.590
have five flips, sorry.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.010
Which flip is going to
be the first heads?

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.920
Well, there's 5 possibilities.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.970
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.020
There's 5 possibilities for
which of the positions or

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.650
which of the flips is going
to be the first head.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.100
Now how many possibilities are
there for the second head?

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.240
Well, the first flip that
we used, used up one

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.590
of the heads chairs.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.920
Or sorry, the first heads
chair, the first heads spot was

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.650
used up by one of the flips.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.140
Now there's only 4 flips left,
so there's only 1 out of 4

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.700
flips that the second
head could be in.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.760
And you saw that here.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.590
I picked the first one to be a
heads here and then we said,

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.850
OK, 1 of these 4 also
have to be a head.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.670
Or if I said, OK, this is the
first head, then either this

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.650
one, this one, this one, or
this one has to be heads.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.850
So there's only 4
possibilities.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.050
So all I'm saying is the first
time around you have 5

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.840
different possibilities for
where the first heads could be.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.540
And then the second
time around you have 4

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.280
different possibilities.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.200
You have to think about it.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.360
When we count it just like this
we're being dependent on order.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.650
But we don't care which
flip is in which heads.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.610
We're not saying that this is a
heads 1 or this is a heads 2.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.740
These are both heads.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.380
It doesn't matter.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.150
We could have this being
the head seat 1, this

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.370
could be head seat 2.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.600
Or, it could be the
other way around.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.450
This could be the second head
spot, and this could be

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.330
the first head spot.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.100
And I'm saying that just
because it's important to

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.450
realize the distribution of
permutation and a combination.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.170
We don't care about order.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.930
So there's actually two
different ways that

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.850
this can happen.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.730
So we divide it by 2.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.490
And as you'll see it's
actually 2 factorial

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.830
ways that it can happen.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.110
If this had 3 we would do 3
factorial, and I'll show

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.910
you how that can happen.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:01.470
And so this will be equal to--
5 times 4 is 20, divided by

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.160
2, which is equal to 10.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.090
So there's 10 different
combinations out of the 32

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.240
where you have exactly 2 heads.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.330
So 10 times 1 out of 32
equal to 10/32, which

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.820
is equal to what?

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:20.040
5/16.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.390
And actually, let me
write this in terms of

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.410
a binomial coefficient.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.620
This up here, that number right
there, if you think about it--

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.640
that's the same thing as
5 factorial over,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.410
what's 5 times 4?

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.310
5 factorial is 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.690
So if I just want 5 times 4
what I can do is I divide 5

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.550
factorial divided
by 3 factorial.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.890
This is equal to 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.700
divided by 3 times 2 times 1.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.870
And you're just left
with the 5 times 4.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.150
So this is the same
thing as that.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.220
And then, since we didn't
care about order, we

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.400
wanted the 2 here.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.290
And actually, it turns out
that it's 2 factorial.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.430
I'll show you that
in a little bit.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.920
It's two factorial times 1/32.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.510
This was the probability that
our random variable-- that

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.200
we have exactly 2 heads.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.870
Now what's the probability
that we have exactly 3 heads?

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.970
The probability that
x is equal to 3.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:23.080
So by the same logic, the
first head spot can be

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.170
taken by 1 of the 5 flips.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.580
Then the second head spot
can be taken by 1 of the

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.490
4 left remaining flips.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.170
And then the third head spot
could be taken by 1 of

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.670
the 3 remaining flips.

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:40.030
And then, how many different
ways can I arrange 3 flips?

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.410
In general, how many ways
can you arrange 3 things?

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.060
And it's 3 factorial.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.740
And you could work that out or
you might want to watch the

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.070
probability videos where I work
that a little bit better.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:54.400
But actually, If if you just
take the letters A, B, and C

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.380
there's 6 ways that you
can arrange these.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.040
You can view these
as the head spots.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.530
And we don't care about order,
so it could be ACB, CAB.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:10.290
It could be BAC, BCA, and
then what's the last one

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.110
that I haven't done?

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.310
It's CBA.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.980
There are 6 ways to arrange
3 distinct things.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.710
We're dividing by it because we
don't want to double count

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.010
these 6 different ways because
we're viewing them all

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:21.870
as the same thing.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.900
Not in this case, but in the
case of we don't care which

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.740
flip is sitting in
which head spot.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.860
So that's why I got
the 3 factorial.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.280
And this is the same thing.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.670
5 times 4 times 3-- this could
be written as 5 factorial

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.150
divided by 3 factorial.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.370
Then this is divided
by 3 factorial.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.070
This one is this one.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.340
And so this is equal to-- I
don't know-- 3 factorial is

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.460
equal to 3 times 2 times 1.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.910
The 3's cancel out.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.570
This becomes a 2.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.790
This becomes a 1.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.910
Once again, 5 times
2, so it's 10.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.570
Each situation has a 1 in
32 probability, so once

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.310
again it's equal to 5/16.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.030
And that's interesting.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.890
The probability that you get
3 heads is the same as the

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.500
probability you get 2 heads.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.440
And the reason that-- well,
there's a lot of reasons

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.060
why that's the case.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.200
But if you think about the
probability of getting 3 heads

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.580
is the same thing as the
probability of getting 2 tails.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.370
And the probability of getting
2 tails should be the same

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.390
thing as the probability
of getting 2 heads.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.650
And so it's nice that the
numbers work out that way.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.610
All right, so we're
almost there.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.660
What's the probability
that x is equal to 4?

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.170
Well, we could use the same
kind of formula now that

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.650
we were using before.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.370
You know, it could be 5
times 4 times 3 times 2.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.450
So that's 5 times 4 times 3
times 2-- all the way, how many

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.260
ways can you arrange 4 things?

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.370
It's 4 factorial.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.750
4 factorial is essentially
this thing right here.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:02.490
4 times 3 times 2 times-- this
is 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.330
So these cancel out, so it's 5
and then each of the scenarios

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.650
has a 1 in 32 chance.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.500
So it's equal to 5/32.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.710
And once again, notice, the
probability of getting 4 heads

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.290
is the same thing as the
probability of getting

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.670
exactly 1 head.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.250
And that makes sense because
4 heads is the same thing

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.580
as getting exactly 1 tail.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.985
And you say, oh, where's
that one tail going

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:25.630
to be showing up?

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.210
Oh, there's 5 different
spot for it.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.790
And each of the scenarios
has a 1 in 32 possibility.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.320
And then finally, what's
the probability that

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.180
x is equal to 5?

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.545
You get all 5 heads.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.040
You know, it's going
to be heads, heads,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.850
heads, heads, heads.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.440
Each of these have
a 1/2 probability.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.820
You multiply them,
you get 1 out of 32.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.880
Or another way to think about
it, if you think about it, the

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.660
32 different ways that you can
have heads and tails in these

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.920
experiments-- this is only
one of those circumstances.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.180
This was 5 of the
circumstances.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.410
This was 10 of the
circumstances.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.960
Anyway, we've done the work,
now we're ready to draw a

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.540
probability distribution.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.650
I'm running out of time.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.320
Actually, let me continue
that in the next video.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.270
And if you're in the mood,
maybe you draw it before

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.490
you watch the next video.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.010
See you soon.
