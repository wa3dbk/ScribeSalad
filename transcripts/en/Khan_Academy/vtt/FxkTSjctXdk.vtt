00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.040
Let's do a little review of what
the Fed funds rate was.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.090
And then we can move into
something that you've probably

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.180
heard in the same context, and
they're often confused, and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.430
that's the discount rate.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.310
And they are related and they
kind of do move together.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.020
They are pretty different in
their actual implementation.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.040
So the Federal funds rate--
this is a target rate.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.370
This is the target rate at
which the Federal reserve

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.940
wants banks to lend
to each other.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.500
So let's say that I have-- and
I won't draw the balance

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.400
sheets every time now-- let's
say I have have Bank One and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.470
this is Bank Number Two.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.630
And let's say this bank
over here has

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.910
a surplus of reserves.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.230
I was already using green, but
I'll do that in gold just so

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.570
we can reminisce about
the gold standard.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.560
So let's say it has a surplus of
reserves and Bank Two needs

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.870
them, right?

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.650
And let's say right now that
Bank One is willing to lend it

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:16.380
to Bank Two if Bank Two pays
Bank One a 6% overnight rate.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.310
And let's say that the
Federal reserve, they

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.120
say, you know what?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.000
That's above our target rate.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.860
We want banks to lend to each
other for a lower interest

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.730
rate, so we want to do open
market transactions or open

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.670
market operations to
lower this rate.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.080
And the mechanics that they do
it by-- let's draw the Fed's

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.330
balance sheet.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.800
I'll do them in magenta.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.245
That's half of it and then
this is the other half.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.610
So let's say that this is the
Fed's current assets-- and in

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.650
a couple of videos, I'll
actually show you what the

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.220
Fed's balance sheet looked like
before all this craziness

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.050
started and what it looks like
now, but that's the Federal

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.510
reserve's assets.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.530
This is their liabilities.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.740
And then their liabilities are
going to be a little bit

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.170
smaller then their assets and
they have a little equity.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.220
Their equity's a little
different

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.640
than traditional equity.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.890
There really isn't
a lot of upside.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.340
You just get a dividend
on it, but we won't

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.330
go to details there.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.400
But the mechanism that the Fed
uses to do these open market

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.110
operations is they essentially
print money.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.980
So what the Federal reserve will
do is, they will create

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.680
some notes or some
actual reserves.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.740
So these are Federal reserve
notes-- or as we know them,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.370
the dollar bills that are
sitting in your wallet or the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.660
things that could be converted
to dollar bills that are

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.540
sitting in your bank account,
the bits and bytes in some

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.120
computer database someplace.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.730
And they can't create
it out of thin air.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.930
They have to have an offsetting
liability and their

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.560
offsetting liability are
Federal reserve notes

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.810
outstanding.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.720
This is just saying, hey,
we issued this.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.310
If someone comes back to us,
we have this liability.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.620
And this is issued even though
these Federal reserve notes--

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.190
I'll circle it in yellow--
are issued by the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.610
Federal reserve bank.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.300
They're backed by the full faith
and credit of the U.S.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.880
government.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.210
We've talked a lot about what
that means, but needless to

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.550
say, we're just going
over the mechanics.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.110
So what they'll do is they'll
take these dollars now and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.240
they'll use these dollars to go
buy treasuries from people

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.010
out in the world.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.780
It could be me.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.320
It could be my grandfather.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.640
It could be even some of these
banks and so let's say that

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.280
there's-- right now somebody
is holding a treasury.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.180
I hold a T-bill.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.350
The Federal reserve will use
that money-- let's say I own a

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.420
ton of T-bills.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.380
I'm the richest man
in the country.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.340
I could even be China.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.240
China holds a lot of T-bills.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240
They buy the T-bill.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.720
So then this becomes-- this
asset is no longer Federal

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.460
reserve notes.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.710
It's now a T-bill.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.300
And then I'm no longer holding
a T-bill, right, because I

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.990
sold it to the Federal
reserve bank.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.760
I don't know I sold it to the
Federal reserve bank.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.790
I just sold it in the market.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.540
I don't know who bought it.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.070
It might have been
another guy.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.190
It might have been
another country.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.950
But it happened to be in this
case the Federal reserve bank.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.660
And now I'm holding reserves.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.950
I'm holding money
as we know it.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.700
I'm holding a Federal
reserve note.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.430
And what am I going to do with
that Federal reserve note?

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.910
I'm going to deposit
it in banks, right?

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.130
And so I'm going to take this
Federal reserve note.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.830
Let's say I have a couple
of bank accounts.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.220
Just for the sake of simplicity,
I deposit some of

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.430
it in this bank account and
let's say I deposit some of it

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.210
in this bank account,
just for simplicity.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.620
So what happens now?

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.940
Now this guy has more notes
to lend out and

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.680
this guy needs less.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.680
So demand has gone down.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.140
This guy needs less.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.890
So demand has gone down
from this guy.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.790
And supply has gone
up from this guy.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.000
We know that if you need
something less, but people

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.710
have more of it, the price of
buying it or borrowing it is

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.990
going to go down.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.290
So this guy has more of it and
this guy needs it less, all of

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.670
a sudden this guy's
not willing to pay

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.330
6% to borrow it.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.730
And this guy's actually more
desperate to offload some of

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.660
these reserves and get
some interest on it.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.110
So this guy's going to lower the
rate he'll charge and this

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.500
guy's going to lower the rate
he's willing to pay and maybe

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.490
it goes down to 5%.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.110
And the Federal reserve can
keep buying or selling

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.150
treasuries to adjust
what this happens.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.350
They could do the opposite.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.450
If they said, wow, rates are
a little bit too low.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.410
Let's say whatever happens,
rates are at 3% and the

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.050
Federal reserve doesn't like
that and wants to raise the

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.830
Federal funds rate, which is
the target rate that banks

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.740
lend to each other, then they
can do the opposite thing.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.500
They could take this
T-bill, right?

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.410
This was a T-bill.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.170
And they'll sell it, right?

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.240
So they'll take this T-bill and
they'll sell it to someone

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.470
else-- maybe this
guy right here.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.070
So this guy, he's got
a dollar bill.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.190
So his dollar bills are
going to be sitting at

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.700
one of these banks.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.240
Let's say his dollar bills are
sitting at one of-- he's got a

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.980
couple there and couple there.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.390
So when the Federal reserve
sells this T-bill to this guy,

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.490
this guy might do a wire
transfer to that party-- or a

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.450
check or it doesn't matter, but
either way you look at it,

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.680
these reserves disappear
and they go back

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.740
into the Federal reserve.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.150
When they go back into the
Federal reserve, they offset

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.410
this liability and then the
currency essentially

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.970
disappears, but the real result
is that all of a sudden

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.900
then demand would have gone up
because there'd be fewer

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.110
reserves in the system.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.170
Demand goes up.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.840
And then the supply would have
gone down because there's also

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.440
fewer reserves in the system.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.960
And now this guy, he's like,
wow, I have less to lend out.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.400
I need more interest in order
for me lend it out.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.580
And this guy says, wow, I'm more
desperate than ever to

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.710
borrow some reserves.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.330
I'm willing to pay more and so
the rates will go up to 4%.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.080
Now all of this works well
assuming a world where banks

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.240
are willing to lend to each
other at some rate.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.610
There's some rate at which this
guy says, I'm willing to

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.460
lend to this guy because I know
he's going to pay me the

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.700
next day and it's
just a matter of

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.850
just supply or demand.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.430
These tend to be overnight
loans.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.780
They tend to be very short term
loans so they tend to be

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.230
very, very safe, but what
happens in a world-- let me

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.280
draw the same two banks.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.720
I think I overdrew.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.600
So this is Bank Number One and
this is Bank Number Two-- and

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.800
Bank Number One had
more reserves.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.940
Bank Number Two has fewer.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.250
Bank Number Two needs
reserves.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.680
Let's say people are worried
about Bank Number Two.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.420
All of their depositors are
starting to get scared and

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.460
they're starting to pull their
reserves out, right?

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.320
And we all know that these
banks don't keep enough

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.160
reserves to fulfill all
of their deposits.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.310
Actually, let me draw Bank
Number Two's balance sheet.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.050
They have equity, hopefully.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.050
They'll have some deposits.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.300
Let's say all of these
are deposits.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.780
They have to keep some
reserves, right,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.280
so that's an asset.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.550
Depending on their reserve
requirements, but they'll have

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:35.179
some reserves in case people
want to take out their money

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.200
from their checking accounts--
and then the rest of these are

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.460
assets that they invested in
and the bank makes money by

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.820
making more money on these
assets than it has to pay out

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.790
in interest. It makes money
on that spread.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.020
Now what happens if this bank--
its condition starts to

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.800
get a little bit weak, people
start to get afraid, and the

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.160
deposits start to-- people go
to their ATM, start pulling

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.180
their money out, and if anything
maybe they'll start

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.470
depositing it into a safer bank
or just stuffing it under

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.070
their mattresses, right?

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.150
This bank says, all of a sudden
I have a liquidity

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.640
issue because, sure, maybe
that much people withdraw

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:04.950
their money.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.880
I have enough reserves to pay
that, but then if another guy

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.030
comes along, that's going to
deplete my reserves and then

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.870
when the next guy comes along,
I'm not going to have any

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.150
reserves left and it's going
to be a full all-out panic

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.490
when I-- I told this guy that I
could give him his money on

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.220
demand and all of a sudden, if
I can't give him on demand,

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.690
then we're going to have this
huge banking panic and then

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.300
everyone else is going to want
their deposits and then I'm

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.960
going to have this huge
liquidity crisis.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.110
In a normal situation like
that, I'd say, hey, Bank

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.680
Number One, I need some reserves
and just like I did

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.850
in the first half of this video,
this guy would lend the

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.740
reserves and then this guy would
give this guy interest.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.660
But what if this guy is scared
of Bank Number Two too?

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.000
He's like, wow, that guy's
in a tough situation.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.900
He's facing a liquidity
crisis.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.790
I don't even know what
his assets are worth.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.960
Maybe his assets are
actually shrinking.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.010
And that's been happening
lately.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.480
Maybe he made a bunch of
bad mortgage loans.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.110
I don't want to lend
to this guy.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.530
And this guy becomes a pariah
of the banking community.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.700
No-one wants to lend
to this guy.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.840
But at the same time, it's in
no-one's interest for there to

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.790
be a run on this bank.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.550
Because if this guy can't pay
one of his depositors-- and

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.590
this is kind of a prime weakness
of a fractional

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.450
reserve system.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.040
If there's just one weak link
in the banking system and

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.650
people lose confidence-- maybe
this guy was the only bad bank

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.330
out there and people start
taking all their money out.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.600
The first guy who can't get his
money back, he's going to

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.900
call up the press and say,
my God, the banks aren't

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.410
good for the money.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.660
Maybe there's a run on all the
banks because people don't

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.020
know which banks are good,
which ones are bad.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.850
So to prevent this, the Federal
reserve has something

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.180
called the discount window.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.900
So let me draw the Federal
reserve's balance sheet again.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.880
And the discount window is
essentially a lender of last

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.970
resort to the banks.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.630
So there's some type of
Federal funds rate.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.670
Let's say the Federal
funds rate is at 6%.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.240
In a normal environment,
this guy would lend

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.570
to get back at 6%.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.380
But let's say that's
broken and this

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.700
guy is really desperate.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:04.570
He can actually go to the
Federal reserve and borrow

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.650
directly from the
Federal reserve.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.830
So once again, these are the
assets of the Federal reserve.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.250
These are the liabilities.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.020
This is the equity of
the Federal reserve.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.270
And the Federal reserve in this
situation now, they'll

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.790
print notes-- so Federal reserve
notes or reserves,

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.810
either way-- and these are the
notes outstanding liability.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.910
And they will lend
it to this guy.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:36.480
They'll lend these notes to this
guy and in exchange, this

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.030
guy has to give some collateral

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.510
to the Federal reserve.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.330
So let's say he had some
other assets here

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.210
that are hard to sell.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.900
He didn't want to sell
them in a hurry.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.300
So he'll just keep
it as collateral

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.540
with the Federal reserve.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.000
And these are called repurchased
transactions.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.120
It's essentially just-- you're
collateralizing a loan-- and

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.910
I'll do a whole video on what a
repo transaction is, but the

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.150
big picture is, this
guy is desperate.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.000
No-one else is willing to lend
him money so the Federal funds

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.020
rate is now a non-issue.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.790
So he goes to the discount
window and borrows directly

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.750
from the Federal reserve as
a lender of last resort.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.640
And the rate at which he
borrows-- the interest that he

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.960
pays this guy, that is
the discount rate.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.950
So that's the rate that a bank
pays to the Federal reserve

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.950
when it can't borrow from
another bank overnight.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:27.770
And in general, the discount
rate tends to be higher than

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.490
the Federal funds rate.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:29.640
In fact, it always is, right?

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.230
Because if the discount rate
was less than the Federal

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.880
funds rate, then you'd always
have people using the discount

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.810
window all of the time instead
of borrowing from each other.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.030
But we'll see in future videos,
when times get tough,

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.760
this gets used a lot more.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.090
Historically the discount rate
was about a percent higher

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.930
than the Federal funds rate to
encourage people to lend to

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.320
each other or borrow from each
other, but in the recent past

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.380
that spread is gone down and
now all of the rates are

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.650
almost zero, but we'll go into
that in more detail, but it's

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.190
a key differential.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.280
When the Federal reserve talks
about setting rates, they're

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.740
usually talking about setting
the Federal funds rate and the

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.260
discount rate usually moves down
with it, but it's always

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.470
going to be a little
bit higher than the

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.680
Federal funds rate.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.950
This is for lending
of last resort.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.010
This is for everyday borrowing
between banks to make sure

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.910
that everyone has the reserves
they need or they don't have

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.640
too much and they can
get interest on it.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.890
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
