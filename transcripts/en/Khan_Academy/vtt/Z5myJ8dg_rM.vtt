00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:02.512
Let's learn a little bit about the wonderful

00:00:02.512 --> 00:00:06.209
world of logarithms.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.519
So we already know how to take exponents.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.871
If I were to say 2 to the fourth power, what does that mean?

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:18.846
Well that means 2 times 2 times 2 times 2.

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:24.349
2 multiplied or repeatedly multiplied 4 times, and so

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.499
this is going to be

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:27.630
2 times 2 is 4

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.887
times 2 is 8, times 2 is 16.

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:35.346
But what if we think about things in another way.

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:40.496
We know that we get to 16 when we raise 2 to some power

00:00:40.496 --> 00:00:42.908
but we want to know what that power is.

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:46.651
So for example, let's say that I start with 2, and I say

00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:52.832
I'm raising it to some power, what does that power have to be to get 16?

00:00:52.832 --> 00:01:00.369
Well we just figured that out. 'X' would have to be 4.

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.762
And this is what logarithms are fundamentally about, figuring out what power

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:08.514
you have to raise to, to get another number.

00:01:08.514 --> 00:01:12.288
Now the way that we would denote this with logarithm notation

00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:15.269
is we would say, log, base--

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:18.182
actually let me make it a little bit more colourful.

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:21.656
Log, base 2--

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:23.592
I'll do this 2 in blue...

00:01:23.592 --> 00:01:31.777
Log, base 2, of 16

00:01:31.777 --> 00:01:36.118
is equal to what, or is equal in this case since we have the 'x' there,

00:01:36.118 --> 00:01:39.975
is equal to 'x'?

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:45.063
This and this are completely equivalent statements.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:49.078
This is saying "hey well if I take 2 to some 'x' power I get 16'."

00:01:49.078 --> 00:01:57.388
This is saying, "what power do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16 and I'm going to set that to be equal to 'x'."

00:01:57.388 --> 00:01:59.927
And you'll say, "well you have to raise it to the fourth power and once again

00:01:59.927 --> 00:02:01.583
'x' is equal to 4.

00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:07.670
So with that out of the way let's try more examples of evaluating logarithmic expressions.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.051
Let's say you had...

00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:25.127
log, base 3, of 81. What would this evaluate to?

00:02:25.127 --> 00:02:31.319
Well this is a reminder, this evaluates to the power we have to raise 3 to, to get

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.053
to 81.

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:37.764
So if you want to, you can set this to be equal to an 'x', and you can

00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:48.779
restate this equation as, 3 to the 'x' power, is equal to 81.

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:52.287
Why is a logarithm useful? And you'll see that it has very interesting properties

00:02:52.287 --> 00:02:53.112
later on.

00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:57.797
But you didn't necessarily have to use algebra. To do it this way, to say that 'x' is the power

00:02:57.797 --> 00:03:02.151
you raise 3 to to get to 81, you had to use algebra here, while with just

00:03:02.151 --> 00:03:06.257
a straight up logarithmic expression, you didn't really have to use any algebra, we didn't have to

00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:09.248
say that it was equal to 'x', we could just say that this evaluates to

00:03:09.248 --> 00:03:12.614
the power I need to raise 3 to to get to 81.

00:03:12.614 --> 00:03:15.895
The power I need to raise 3 to to get to 81.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:19.398
Well what power do you have to raise 3 to to get to 81?

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:21.244
Well let's experiment a little bit,

00:03:21.244 --> 00:03:25.799
so 3 to the first power is just 3, 3 to the second power is 9,

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:34.383
3 to the third power is 27, 3 to the fourth power, 27 times 3 is equal to 81.

00:03:34.383 --> 00:03:36.967
3 to the fourth power is equal to 81.

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.388
'X' is equal to four.

00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:41.169
So we could say...

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:50.953
Log, base 3, of 81, is equal to--

00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:53.993
I'll do this in a different colour.

00:03:53.993 --> 00:03:57.453
Is equal to 4.

00:03:57.453 --> 00:04:00.730
Let's do several more of these examples and I really encourage you to give a shot

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.548
on your own and hopefully you'll get the hang of it.

00:04:04.548 --> 00:04:09.647
So let's try a larger number, let's say we want to take

00:04:09.647 --> 00:04:17.511
log, base 6, of 216. What will this evaluate to?

00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:22.768
Well we're asking ourselves, "what power do we have to raise 6 to, to get 216?"

00:04:22.768 --> 00:04:27.237
6 to the first power is 6, 6 to the second power is 36,

00:04:27.237 --> 00:04:31.411
36 times 6 is 216.

00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:34.330
This is equal to 216.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.451
So this is 6 to the third power is equal to 216.

00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.637
So if someone says "what power do I have to raise 6 to--

00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:41.851
this base here,

00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:44.328
to get to 216?"

00:04:44.328 --> 00:04:48.096
Well that's just going to be equal to 3.

00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:52.063
6 to the third power is equal to 216.

00:04:52.063 --> 00:04:56.891
Let's try another one. Let's say I had, I dunno,

00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:02.599
log, base 2, of 64.

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.056
So what does this evaluate to?

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:11.749
Well once again we're asking ourselves, "well this will evaluate to the exponent that I have to raise this

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:14.545
base 2, and you do this as a little subscript right here.

00:05:14.545 --> 00:05:18.748
The exponent that I have to raise 2 to, to get to 64."

00:05:18.748 --> 00:05:22.217
So 2 to the first power is 2, 2 to the second power is 4,

00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:27.369
8, 16, 32, 64.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:34.663
So this right over here is 2 to the sixth power, is equal to 64. So when you evaluate this expression

00:05:34.663 --> 00:05:38.518
you say "what power do I have to raise 2 to, to get to 64?"

00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:43.812
Well I have to raise to the sixth power.

00:05:43.812 --> 00:05:49.097
Let's do a slightly more straightforward one, or maybe this will be less

00:05:49.097 --> 00:05:51.349
straightforward depending on how you view it.

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:58.245
What is log, base 100, of 1?

00:05:58.245 --> 00:06:00.626
I'll let you think about that for a second.

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:05.101
100 is a subscript so it's, log, base 100, of 1.

00:06:05.101 --> 00:06:08.091
That's one way to think about it, I'll put parentheses around the 1.

00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:10.991
What does this evaluate to?

00:06:10.991 --> 00:06:15.044
Well this is asking ourselves, or we would evaluate this as,

00:06:15.044 --> 00:06:22.197
"what power do I have to raise 100 to, to get to 1?"

00:06:22.197 --> 00:06:24.241
So let me write this down as an equation.

00:06:24.241 --> 00:06:26.909
If I set this to be equal to 'x', this is literally saying

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:31.598
100, to what power, is equal to 1?

00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:34.424
Well anything that a 0 power is equal to 1.

00:06:34.424 --> 00:06:36.707
So in this case 'x' is equal to 0.

00:06:36.707 --> 00:06:44.114
So log, base 100, of 1, is going to be equal to 0.

00:06:44.114 --> 00:06:50.933
Log base anything of 1, is going to be equal to 0 because anything to the 0

00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:55.905
power and we're not talking about 0 here. Anything that is to the power of 0

00:06:55.905 --> 00:07:01.328
that is not 0, is going to be equal to 1.
