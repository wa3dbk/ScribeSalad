00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.510
Now that we have distance
explicitly as a function of

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.040
the angle that we're shooting
the object at, we can use a

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.550
little bit of calculus to figure
out the optimal angle,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.290
the angle that's going optimize
our distance.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.340
And since we only care about
angles from 0 degrees to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.990
really 90 degrees, let's
constrain ourselves.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.870
So we're going to optimize
things for

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.540
angles between 0 degrees.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.310
So theta is going to be greater
than or equal to 0 and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.490
less than or equal to 90.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.150
So let's see how we can do it.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.970
And just to get an idea of what
we're even conceptually

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.000
doing with the calculus,
remember when you take a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.460
derivative, you are finding
the slope of a line, an

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.760
instantaneous slope of a line.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.730
And if you were to graph this--
and I encourage you to

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.960
graph it on your own, maybe with
a graphing calculator--

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.850
it will look something like
this over the interval.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.560
It will look like this where
that is the distance as a

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.410
function of theta axis
and then this would

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.769
be our theta axis.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.810
And we care about angles between
0 and 90 degrees.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.670
So if you were to graph this
thing, so this is 0 degrees,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.620
this is maybe 90 degrees
right here.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.780
The graph of this function
will look like this.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.760
It'll look something
like this.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.510
It will look something
like that.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.900
And what we want to do is find
the angle, there's some angle

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.720
here that gives us the
optimal distance.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.020
So this is, right here, this
is the optimal distance.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.560
And what we want to do
is find that out.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.570
And when you look at the graph,
and you could do it on

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.640
a graphing calculator if you
like, what happens to the

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.520
instantaneous slope at that
optimal distance?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.580
Well it's flat.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.130
The slope there is 0.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.580
So what we need to do is take
the derivative of this

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.850
function and then just figure
out at what angle is the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.080
derivative or the instantaneous
slope of this

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.539
function equal to 0?

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.590
And then we're done We will know
this mystery angle, this

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.220
optimal angle, to shoot
the object at.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.020
So let's take the derivative.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.860
So the derivative, we'll just
use our derivative rules here.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.840
The derivative of-- I will call
it d prime I guess, or we

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.920
could say the derivative of the
distance with respect to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.470
theta is equal to-- we're
assuming that s and g are

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.360
constants, so we don't have to
worry about them right now.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.220
We could just put them out front
since we're assuming

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.170
they're constants.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.580
And then we can do the product
rule to take the derivative of

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.700
this part with respect
to theta.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.510
In the product rule, we take
the derivative of the first

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.150
function times the
second function.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.070
So the derivative of
cosine of theta is

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.820
negative sine of theta.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.010
And we're going to
multiply that

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.320
times the second function.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.290
So that's times the
sine of theta.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.880
And to that we're going to add
the first function, which is

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.580
cosine of theta times
the derivative

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.170
of the second function.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.250
The derivative of sine theta
is cosine of theta.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.610
I know it's a little
bit confusing.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.820
All we did is we took the
derivative of the first one

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.190
times the second one.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.770
And then we took the derivative
of the second one

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.440
times the first one.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.450
Let me make it even more
explicitly clear.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.290
We took the derivative of this
guy here, so this is the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.520
derivative with respect
to theta.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.530
And we took the derivative of
this guy over here with

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.720
respect to theta.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.960
We took the derivative
of cosine there and

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.190
multiplied it by sine.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.510
Took the derivative
of sine here and

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.860
multiplied it by cosine.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.290
Just the product rule.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.130
Now what does this give us?

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.500
We can simplify this
a good bit.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.440
So we could write the derivative
d prime is equal

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.170
to-- we could keep this constant
out there-- 2s

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.910
squared over g-- times-- now
negative sine of theta times

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.800
sine of theta, that's
just negative

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.790
sine squared of theta.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.110
And then, cosine theta times
cosine theta, that's just plus

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.440
cosine squared of theta.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.339
Now, what we just said is we
want to figure out the point,

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.170
the angle at which this
derivative or the

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.620
instantaneous slope is 0.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.430
So let's set this thing
equal to 0.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.450
So we just have to solve
for theta now.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.760
Now the first thing I do to
solve for theta is just divide

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.280
both sides by 2s
squared over g.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.900
If you divide the left-hand side
by that, it cancels out

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.350
with 2s squared over g.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.040
And if you divide 0 by that,
assuming this isn't 0, which

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.550
it shouldn't be, then
you'll still get 0.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.660
So this equation simplifies to--
I'll write it in blue--

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.540
negative sine squared of theta
plus cosine squared of theta

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.630
is equal to 0.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.520
Now, if we add sine squared of
theta of both sides of this

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.580
equation, let's add
sine squared of

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.660
theta to both sides.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.260
We are left with--
these cancel out.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.800
Cosine squared of theta
is equal to

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.270
sine squared of theta.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.430
Now, both of these are going
to be positive over the

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.470
interval, so we're going to just
take the positive square

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.260
root of both of them, or the
principal root of both sides

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.680
of this equation.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.990
So let's do that.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.300
So you take the principal
roots of both

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.740
sides of this equation.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.510
You could do it that way.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.590
Actually, a more interesting way
than doing it that way, is

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.830
to divide both sides of this
equation by cosine squared of

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.200
theta assuming that it's not
equal to 0 over this interval.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.990
So cosine squared of theta.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.330
You could also do it using the
positive square root, the

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.070
principal root, either
one will work.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.950
But this is interesting because
the left-hand side

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.110
cancels out to 1, and the 1 will
be equal to-- what's sine

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.270
squared over cosine
squared of theta?

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:17.090
Well that's the same thing as
sine of theta over cosine of

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:24.740
theta squared.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.300
You have a square divided
by another square.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.190
That's the same thing as the
numerator divided by the

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.500
denominator.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.820
That whole thing squared.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.590
And what's sine of theta divided
by cosine of theta?

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.270
Well that's just the
tangent of theta.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:45.670
So we have 1 is equal to the
tangent squared of theta.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.470
Or, we could take the positive
square root of both sides of

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.380
this equation.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.100
Tangent is positive over the
interval from 0 to 90 degrees,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.710
so that's cool to do.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.250
So if you take the positive
square root of both sides, you

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.800
get the positive square
root of 1 is 1.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.410
1 is equal to tangent
of theta.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.900
And then you take the inverse
tan of both sides or the arc

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.400
tan of both sides and you
get the arc tan of

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.510
1 is equal to theta.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.660
And this is just a very fancy
way of saying theta's the

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.270
angle that if you were take
its tangent, you get 1.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.780
And you could use a calculator
to solve that or you might

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.900
just know that by memory.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:36.390
This theta, the arc tangent
of 1 is 45 degrees.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.030
Or if you are dealing
in radians, it

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.750
is pi over 4 radians.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.910
Either one of those
is going to work.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.960
So our optimal angle when we
shoot this thing is going to

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.160
be at 45 degrees.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.280
Now, what is that optimal
distance going to be when we

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.370
shoot it off at 45 degrees?

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.380
Well, we can just go back
to our original formula.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.840
We just go back to our original

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.990
formula that we derived.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.500
If we're shooting it off at 45
degrees, what is the sine of

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.500
45 degrees?

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.330
The sine of 45 degrees is
equal to the square

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.030
root of 2 over 2.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.390
You could use a calculator for
that or maybe you know it from

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.500
the unit circle.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.410
The cosine of 45 degrees is also
square root of 2 over 2.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.700
And if you'd actually just taken
the principal roots at

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.300
this stage of the equation,
you'd have gotten that the

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.130
cosine of theta has to equal
sine of theta over this

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.940
interval, and that only
happens at 45 degrees.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.710
But given this.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.760
We can put this back into the
original expression right up

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.020
here, our original function.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.240
So the optimal distance that
we are going to travel, so

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.440
distance as a function-- the
distance we travel at 45

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:54.020
degrees is going to be equal
to 2s squared over g times

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.690
cosine of theta, which is
square root of 2 over 2.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.570
Cosine of 45 is square root of
2 over 2 time sine of theta,

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.590
which is square root
of 2 over 2.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.440
Well what's the square root of
2 times the square root of 2?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.880
Well that's just 2.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.770
Let me simplify this.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.240
So the square root of 2
times the square root

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.010
of 2, that is 2.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.330
This 2 cancels out
with that 2.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.600
And then, this 2 cancels
out with this 2.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.850
So then the optimal distance you
travel at 45 degrees, all

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:28.220
we're left with is the
s squared over g.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.030
Assuming no air resistance, kind
of an ideal circumstance.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.410
No matter what planet you're
on, how fast you do it, the

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.250
best angle is always 45 degrees
assuming no air

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:37.980
resistance.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.010
And if you do it on that best
angle, you're going to travel

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.080
s squared over g.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.880
Going back to the original
problem, if s is

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.150
10 meters per second.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.130
Let's say s was 10 meters
per second.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.270
And let's say we're dealing with
a world where let's say,

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.640
gravity is equal to 10 meters
per second squared, then

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:13.630
according to what we've derived,
your optimal distance

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:20.410
is going to be s squared-- so
it's going to be 100-- divided

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.050
by gravity.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.530
It's going to be 10.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.080
And if you square meters per
second, you're going to get

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.420
meters squared per second
squared divided by the

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.200
acceleration of gravity, meters
per second squared.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.550
Second squared's cancel out.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.290
You have a meter squared
divided by meters.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.080
Your optimal distance
would be 10 meters.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.530
Pretty neat.
