00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.550
What expression can be used to
show dividing 18 boxes into

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.540
two equals stacks?

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.550
Find the expression three times
using different ways to

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.730
write division.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.665
Find the value of
the expression.

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:15.170
So let's just do this
top part right here.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.780
We have 18 boxes, and we want to
divide them into two equals

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.720
stacks, so we want to
divide 18 by 2.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.600
And the way we would write this,
and we'll think a little

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.780
bit more about what this
means, we could write

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.520
this as 18 over 2.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.360
This means 18 divided by 2.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:43.730
We could write it as 18 divided
by 2, just like that,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:52.300
or we could write it
as 18 divided by 2.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.250
Now before we evaluate it, they
say find the value of the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.010
expression.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.300
Let's think about
what this means.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.500
We have 18 boxes and we
want to divide them

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.810
into two equal stacks.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.980
Let me draw 18 boxes.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:22.570
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12-- almost

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.340
there-- 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.110
So those are my 18 boxes, and I
divide them into two equals

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.840
stacks or two equal groups.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.860
So if I want to divide these
into two different groups that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.390
have the same number of boxes,
I could just eyeball it, and

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.230
say, well, let's make these
top ones one group.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.490
Let's make that one of the
groups, and let's making these

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.480
bottom ones another group.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.720
And these are equal groups.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.710
How many do we have
in each group?

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.010
Well, in the top one, we have
one, two, three, four, five,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.660
six, seven, eight, nine, and in
the bottom one we have one,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.900
two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.470
So we've split it into
two groups of nine.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.090
So 18 divided into two equal
groups is equal to 9, or 18

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.020
divided by 2 is equal to 9, or
2 goes into 18 nine times.
