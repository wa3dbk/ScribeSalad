00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.500
We're told that Jared is twice
the age of his brother, Peter.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.470
So Jared is twice the age
of his brother, Peter.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.370
Peter is 4 years old.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.760
And Jared is twice the
age of his brother, Peter.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.260
So Jared is twice
Peter's age of 4.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.550
And then they tell us, Talia's
age is 3 times Jared's age.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.432
How old are Talia and Jared?

00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:34.390
So Talia's age is 3
times Jared's age.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.560
So let's write this down.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.430
We have Peter is 4 years old.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.050
So Peter's age,
he's 4 years old.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.090
Jared is twice the age
of his brother, Peter.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.475
Let me do that in yellow.

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:54.225
That's not yellow.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.454
Jared is twice the
age of his brother.

00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:09.495
Twice is the same thing as 2
times the age of his brother.

00:01:09.495 --> 00:01:11.620
You could say Jared is
twice the age of his brother

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.320
or Jared is 2 times
the age of his brother.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.670
Well, his brother is 4.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.610
They told us that
right over there.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.485
So Jared is going to
be 2 times 4 years old.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.280
And if you know your
multiplication tables,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.770
you know that's the
same thing as 8.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.466
2 times 4 is 8.

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.910
4 times 2 is 8.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.710
Or you know this is the
same thing as Peter's age

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.380
twice, which is the
same thing as 4 plus 4.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.060
That would also get you 8.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.370
So Jared's age is equal to 8.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.030
And then, finally, they
say Talia's age-- so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.120
let me write Talia
right over here.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.060
Talia's age and they tell
it to us right over here.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.500
It's 3 times Jared's age.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.105
So Talia's age is 3
times Jared's age.

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:01.980
Well, we were able to
figure out Jared's age.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.800
It is 8.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.465
It is 3 times Jared's age.

00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:08.090
If you know your
multiplication tables,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.810
this should maybe
jump out at you.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.700
And your multiplication tables
really are one of those things

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.192
in mathematics that you should
really just know back and forth

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:18.150
just because it will make
the rest of your life

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.090
very, very, very simple.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.620
Or you could view 3 times 8
as literally 8 three times.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.810
So it's 8 plus 8 plus 8.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.250
8 plus 8 is 16, 16 plus 8 is 24.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.890
So 3 times 8 is 24.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.450
So Peter is 4, Jared
is 8, and Talia is 24.
