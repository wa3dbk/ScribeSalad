00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.320
So a few videos ago, I told
you that anything to the

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.260
zeroth power is equal to 1.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.420
So x to the zeroth power
is equal to 1.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.140
And I gave you one argument
why this is the case.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.910
I used the example of, if we
have 3 to the first power,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.250
that is equal to 3.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.870
3 to the second power
is equal to 9.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.940
3 to the third power
is equal to 27.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.480
So every time we decrease by a
power, we're dividing by 3.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.170
27 divided by 3 is 9.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.390
9 divided by 3 is 3.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.890
Then 3 divided by 3 is 1.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.930
And that should be what 3
to the zeroth power is.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.980
So that's one way to
think about it.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.640
The other way to think about
it is that we need this for

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.920
the exponent properties
to work.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.840
For example, I told you that a
to the b times a to the c is

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.180
equal to a to the b plus c.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.440
Now, what happens if c is 0?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.430
What happens if we have a to
the b times a to the 0?

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.210
Well, by this property, this
needs to be equal to a to the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.670
b plus 0, which is equal
to a to the b.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.850
So a to the b times a to the 0
must be equal to a to the b.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.290
If you divide both sides of this
times a-- let me rewrite

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.610
this-- a to the b times a to the
0, if we use this property

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.370
up here, must be equal to a to
the b, right? b plus 0 is b.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.460
If you divide both sides by a
to the b, what do you get?

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.020
On the left-hand side,
you're left with

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.450
just a to the 0, right?

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.900
These cancel out.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.210
a to the 0 is equal to 1.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.570
And you can use a similar
argument in pretty much all of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.400
the exponent properties, that we
need anything to the zeroth

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.385
power to be equal to 1.

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:58.080
And it also makes sense as we
divide by 3, each step as we

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.310
decrement our exponent.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.820
It keeps working.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.610
When you take 3 to the negative
1 power, we saw on

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.980
the last video that that's equal
to 1 over 3 to the first

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.259
power, or 1/3 .

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.360
So once again, from 3 to
the 0 to 1/3, you're

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.710
dividing by 3 again.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.660
So it really makes sense on
some level that 3 to the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.100
zeroth power is equal to 1.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.570
But that leaves a little
bit of a gap.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.930
What about 0 to the
zeroth power?

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.460
This is a very strange notion.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.700
0 multiplied by itself
0 times.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.890
And it depends what context
you're using.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.160
Sometimes people will say that
this is undefined, but many

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.270
more times, at least in my
experience, this'll be

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.525
defined to be 1.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.440
And the reason why-- even though
this is completely not

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.870
intuitive, and you could type
in 0 to the zeroth power in

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.920
Google, and it'll give you 1.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.660
Even though this is completely
not intuitive, the reason why

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.350
this is defined to be this way
is that makes a lot of

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.450
formulas work.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.130
One in particular, the binomial
formula works for

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.190
your binomial coefficients,
which I'm not going to go over

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.630
right here, when 0 to the zeroth
power is equal to 1.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.160
So that's an interesting thing
for you to think about, what

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.020
that might even mean.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.830
So let's talk about some of
the other properties.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.850
And then we can put them all
together with a couple of

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.250
example problems. I told you
in the last video what it

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.080
means to raise to a
negative power.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.290
a to the negative 1 power, or
maybe I should say a to the

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.560
negative b power is equal to
1 over a to the b power.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.570
So just to do that with a couple
of concrete examples, 3

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.620
to the negative 3 power is equal
to 1 over 3 to the third

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.530
power, which is equal to 1 over
3 times 3, times 3, which

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.590
is equal to 1 over 27.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:55.490
If I were to ask you what 1/3
to the negative 2 power is--

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.830
well, this is going to be equal
to 1 over 1/3 to the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.950
second power.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.130
You get rid of the negative
and you inverse it.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.350
So this is going to be
equal to 1 over--

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.090
what's 1/3 times 1/3?

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.470
1/9.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.090
Which is equal to-- this is 1
divided by 1/9 is the same

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.870
thing is 1 times 9, so
this is equal to 9.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.210
And this makes complete sense,
because 1/3, remember, 1/3 is

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.010
the same thing as 3 to the
negative 1 power, right?

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.930
3 to the negative 1 is equal
to 1 over 3 to the 1 power,

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.040
which is the same
thing is 1/3.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.980
So if we replace 1/3 with 3 to
the negative 1, this is 3 to

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.670
the negative 1 to the
negative 2 power.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.760
These two things are equivalent
statements.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.850
And if we use one of the
properties we learned in the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.410
first video, we can
take the product

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.480
of these two exponents.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.480
So this is equal to 3 to the
negative 1, times negative 2,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.000
which is just positive 2,
which is equal to 9.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.290
So it's really neat how all of
these exponent properties

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.840
really fit together in a nice,
neat puzzle, that they don't

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.890
contradict each other.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.330
And it doesn't matter which
property you use, you'll get

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.360
the right answer in the end,
as long as you don't do

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.060
something crazy.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.370
Now, the last thing I want to
define is the notion of a

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.970
fractional exponent.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.980
So if I have something to a
fractional power-- so let's

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.040
say I have a to the
1 over b power.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.380
I'm going to define this.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.150
This is going to be equal
to the bth root of a.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.690
So let me be very clear here.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.520
Let me make it with
some numbers here.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.250
If I said 4 to the 1/2 power
right there, this means this

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.920
is equivalent to the
square root of 4.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.180
Which is equal to, if we're
taking the principal root,

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.070
this is equal to 2.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.460
So if I were to take, let's be
clear, 8 to the 1/3 power,

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.020
this is taking the
cube root of 8.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.780
And this is, on some level,
one of the most sometimes

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.560
confusing things in exponents.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.740
Here I'm saying, what number
times itself 3 times

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.720
is equal to 8 ?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:23.540
So if I said that x is equal to
8 to the 1/3 power, this is

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.520
the exact same thing as
saying x to the third

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.320
power is equal to 8.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.930
And how do I know that these
are equivalent statements?

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.950
Well, I could take both
sides of this equation

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.930
to the third power.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.340
If I take the left-hand side
of the third power and the

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.520
right-hand side of the third
power, what do I get?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.710
On the left-hand side,
I get x to the third.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.715
On the right-hand side, I get 8
to the 1/3 times 3, which is

00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:52.130
just 3 over 3, which
is just 1.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:58.860
So if x is equal to 8 to
the 1/3, what is x?

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.960
Well, 2 times 2, times
2 is equal to 8.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.160
And there's no really easy way,
especially once you go to

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.540
the fourth root, or the fifth
root, and you have decimals of

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.260
calculating these.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.850
You probably need a calculator
most of the time to do these.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.560
But things like 8 to the 1/3, or
16 to the 1/4, or 27 to the

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.970
1/3 , they're not too
hard to calculate.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.250
So this right here, let
me be clear, is 2.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.700
Now, let's make it a little
bit more confusing.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:35.390
What is 27 to the negative
1/3 power?

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.120
Well, don't get too worried.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.230
We're just going to take
it step by step.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:44.800
When you take the negative
power, this is completely

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:52.560
equivalent to 1 over 27
to the 1/3 power.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.590
These two are equivalent.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.010
You get rid of the negative
and take 1

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.380
over the whole thing.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.170
And then what is 27
to the 1/3 power?

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.590
Well, what number times itself
3 times is equal to 27?

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.690
Well, that's equal to 3.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.330
So this is going to be
equal to 1 over 3.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.860
Not too bad.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.770
Now I'm going to take it even to
another level, make it even

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.280
more confusing, even
more daunting.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.980
Now, let me do something
interesting.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:32.289
What is 8 to the 2/3 power?

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.700
Now that seems a little
bit scary.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.770
And all you have to remember
is this is the same thing,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.490
using our exponent rules
really, as 8

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.870
squared to the 1/3 power.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.680
How do I know that?

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.560
Well, if I multiply these two
exponents, this is 2/3.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.690
So 8 to the 2/3 is the same
thing is 8 squared, and then

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.250
the third root of that.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.450
But you could view
it the other way.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:04.200
This should also be equal to
8 to the 1/3 power squared.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.540
Because either way, when I
multiply these exponents, I

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.760
get 8 to the 2/3.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.850
Let's verify for ourselves
that we really do

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.310
get the same value.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.840
So 8 squared is 64.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.090
And we're going to take
that to the 1/3 power.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.410
Down here, we have
8 to the 1/3.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.590
We already figured
out what that is.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.650
That's 2, because 2 to
the third power is 8.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.050
So this is 2 squared.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.950
Now, what is 64 to the 1/3?

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.620
What times itself 3 times
is equal to 64?

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.830
Well, 4 times 4, times 4 is
equal to 64, or 4 to the third

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:46.230
is equal to 64, which means
that 4 is equal

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.360
to 64 to the 1/3.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.710
So this is equal to 4.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.400
And, lucky for us, 2 squared
is also equal to 4.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.730
So it doesn't matter which
way you do it.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.760
You could take the square and
then the third root, or you

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.200
could take the third root
and then square it.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.740
You're going to get the
exact same answer.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.830
Now, everything I've
been doing has

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.920
been with actual numbers.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.020
Let me do a couple of problems
that just bring everything

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.662
we've done together
using variables.

00:10:14.662 --> 00:10:18.180
So let's say we wanted to do a
few expressions and we want to

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.220
make sure there are no negative

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.980
exponents in the answer.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:28.140
So let's add x to the negative
3 over x to the negative 7.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.410
There's a bunch of ways
we could view this.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.460
We could view this as equal to
x to the negative 3, times 1

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.390
over x to the negative 7.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.150
And what is 1 over x
to the negative 7?

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:49.890
This is the same thing as x to
the seventh power, right?

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.570
If you have 1 over something,
you can get rid of the 1 over,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.370
and put a negative in front
of the exponent.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.630
But if you're putting a
negative in front of a

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.020
negative 7, you're going
to get x to a seventh.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.550
So this thing can simplify to
x to the negative 3, times x

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.540
to the seventh power.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.480
And then we can add the
exponents, and that is x to

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.870
the fourth power.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.150
Now, another way, a completely
legitimate way we could have

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.300
done this, is we could have just
subtracted the exponents.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.520
We could have said, well, gee,
this is the same base.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.660
This is going to be x to the
negative 3, minus negative

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.390
seventh power.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.390
Well, negative 3 minus negative
7, that's a negative

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:33.920
3 plus 7 which is equal to
x to the fourth power.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.600
And then one final way-- I mean,
actually, there's more

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.275
than one final way we could
have done this.

00:11:38.275 --> 00:11:41.280
We could have said x to the
negative 3 over x to the

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.140
negative 7-- sorry, not negative
x-- over x to the

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.370
negative 7.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.220
Well, x to the negative 3 is the
same thing as 1 over x to

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.710
the third-- that's that term
right there-- times 1 over x

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.330
to the negative 7, so this would
have been equal to 1

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.350
over x to the third times
x to the negative 7.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.470
You could add the exponents,
so that's equal to 1 over 3

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.350
minus 7 is x to the
negative 4.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.480
And then this-- if we just get
rid of the inverse, we take

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.890
the inverse of it, we can put
a negative in front of this

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.480
negative, making it a positive--
this is going to be

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.510
equal to x to the 4.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.960
So no matter how we did it, as
long as we're consistent with

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.150
the rules, we got
x to the fourth.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.770
Let's do one more slightly
hairy one.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.710
And then I think we'll
be done for now.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:43.690
Let's say we have 3x squared
times y to the 3/2 power.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:51.250
And we're going to divide it by
x times y to the 1/2 power.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:56.130
Well, once again, this is the
same thing as 3 times the x

00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:03.070
terms right here, so 3 times x
squared over x, times y to the

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.690
3/2 over y to the 1/2.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.260
Well, this is going to be equal
to 3 times-- what's x

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.920
squared over x?

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.910
Or x squared over x to
the first power?

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:24.080
That's going to be equal
to x to the 2 minus 1.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:31.520
And then this is going to be
times y to the 3/2 minus 1/2.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.790
So what does the whole
thing become?

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.990
It becomes 3 times x.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:41.520
2 minus 1 is just 1-- I can just
write x there-- times 3/2

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.980
minus 1/2 is 2/2.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.670
So that's y to the 2/2.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.570
2/2, or 2 2ths-- that's just
the same thing is y.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.040
so this is equal to 3xy.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.580
Anyway, I encourage you
to do many, many

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.800
more examples of that.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.880
But, you'll see that just using
the rules that we've

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.350
been exposed to in the last
few videos, you can pretty

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.760
much simplify any exponent
expression.
