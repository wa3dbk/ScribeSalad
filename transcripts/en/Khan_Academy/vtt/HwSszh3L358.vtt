00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.590
Use the commutative law of
addition-- let me underline

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.970
that-- the commutative law
of addition to write the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.510
expression 5 plus 8 plus 5
in a different way and

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.470
then find the sum.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.550
Now, this commutative law of
addition sounds like a very

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.790
fancy thing, but all it means
is if you're just adding a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.680
bunch of numbers, it doesn't
matter what order you add the

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.500
numbers in.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.090
So we could add it as
5 plus 8 plus 5.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.990
We could order it as
5 plus 5 plus 8.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.140
We could order it
8 plus 5 plus 5.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.750
These are all going to add up
to the same things, and it

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.235
makes sense.

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:43.750
If I have 5 of something and
then I add 8 more and then I

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.250
add 5 more, I'm going to get
the same thing as if I had

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.280
took 5 of something, then added
the 5, then added the 8.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.270
You could try all
of these out.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.770
You'll get the same thing.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.420
Now, they say in a different
way, and then find the sum.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.480
The easiest one to find the sum
of-- actually, let's do

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.950
all of them.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.110
But the easiest one, just
because a lot of people

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.660
immediately know that 5 plus 5
is 10, is to maybe start with

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.150
the 5 plus 5.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.980
So if you have 5 plus
5, that's 10, plus

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.690
8 is equal to 18.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.370
Now, let's verify that these two
are the same exact thing.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.040
Up here, 5 plus 8 is 13.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.840
13 plus 5 is also 18.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.520
That is also 18.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.550
If we go down here,
8 plus 5 is 13.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.720
13 plus 5 is also equal to 18.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.900
So no matter how you do it and
no matter what order you do it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.420
in-- and that's the commutative
law of addition.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.790
It sounds very fancy, but it
just means that order doesn't

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.370
matter if you're adding
a bunch of things.
