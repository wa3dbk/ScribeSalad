00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.810
Use the quadratic formula to
solve the equation, 0 is equal

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.500
to negative 7q squared
plus 2q plus 9.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.230
Now, the quadratic formula, it
applies to any quadratic

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.750
equation of the form--
we could put the 0 on

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.600
the left hand side.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.160
0 is equal to ax squared
plus bx plus c.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.170
And we generally deal with x's,
in this problem we're

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.230
dealing with q's.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.980
But the quadratic formula says,
look, if you have a

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.150
quadratic equation of this form,
that the solutions of

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.610
this equation are going to be
x is going to be equal to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.330
negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared minus

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.150
4ac-- all of that over 2a.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.000
And this is actually two
solutions here, because

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.350
there's one solution where you
take the positive square root

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.910
and there's another solution
where you take

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.030
the negative root.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.680
So it gives you both
roots of this.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.030
So if we look at the quadratic
equation that we need to solve

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.250
here, we can just
pattern match.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.980
We're dealing with q's, not
x's, but this is the same

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.850
general idea.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.420
It could be x's if you like.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.550
And if we look at it, negative
7 corresponds to a.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.600
That is our a.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.320
It's the coefficient on the
second degree term.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.290
2 corresponds to b.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.250
It is the coefficient on
the first degree term.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.880
And then 9 corresponds to c.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.250
It's the constant.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.440
So, let's just apply the
quadratic formula.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.510
The quadratic formula will tell
us that the solutions--

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.600
the q's that satisfy this
equation-- q will be equal to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.440
negative b.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.390
b is 2.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:53.840
Plus or minus the square root
of b squared, of 2 squared,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:08.220
minus 4 times a times negative
7 times c, which is 9.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.639
And all of that over 2a.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:16.020
All of that over 2 times
a, which is once

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.400
again negative 7.

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:22.760
And then we just have
to evaluate this.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.190
So this is going to be equal
to negative 2 plus or minus

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.160
the square root of-- let's see,
2 squared is 4-- and then

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.962
if we just take this part right
here, if we just take

00:02:37.962 --> 00:02:42.470
the negative 4 times negative
7 times 9, this negative and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.890
that negative is going
to cancel out.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.960
So it's just going to become
a positive number.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.220
And 4 times 7 times 9.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.720
4 times 9 is 36.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.270
36 times 7.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.710
Let's do it up here.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.060
36 times 7.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.780
7 times 6 is 42.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.350
7 times 3, or 3 times 7 is 21.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.500
Plus 4 is 25.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.420
252.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.290
So this becomes 4 plus 252.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.430
Remember, you have a
negative 7 and you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.830
have a minus out front.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.020
Those cancel out, that's why
we have a positive 252 for

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.950
that part right there.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.220
And then our denominator,
2 times negative

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.800
7 is negative 14.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.050
Now what does this equal?

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.460
Well, we have this is equal to
negative 2 plus or minus the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.080
square root of-- what's
4 plus 252?

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.410
It's just 256.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.860
All of that over negative 14.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.600
And what's 256?

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.580
What's the square root of 256?

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.360
It's 16.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.420
You can try it out
for yourself.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.810
This is 16 times 16.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.160
So the square root
of 256 is 16.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.400
So we can rewrite this whole
thing as being equal to

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.500
negative 2 plus 16
over negative 14.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.790
Or negative 2 minus-- right?

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.180
This is plus 16 over
negative 14.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.490
Or minus 16 over negative 14.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.740
If you think of it as plus or
minus, that plus is that plus

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.720
right there.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.510
And if you have that minus,
that minus is

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.250
that minus right there.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.910
Now we just have to evaluate
these two numbers.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.010
Negative 2 plus 16 is 14 divided
by negative 14 is

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.170
negative 1.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.470
So q could be equal
to negative 1.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.430
Or negative 2 minus 16 is
negative 18 divided by

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.320
negative 14 is equal
to 18 over 14.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.500
The negatives cancel out, which
is equal to 9 over 7.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.190
So q could be equal to negative
1, or it could be

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.500
equal to 9 over 7.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.100
And you could try these out,
substitute these q's back into

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.460
this original equation, and
verify for yourself that they

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.350
satisfy it.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.900
We could even do it with
the first one.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.750
So if you take q is equal
to negative 1.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.795
Negative 7 times negative 1
squared-- negative 1 squared

00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:17.210
is just 1-- so this would be
negative 7 times 1, right?

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.920
That's negative 1 squared.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.260
Negative 1 times 2 is
minus 2 plus 9.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.150
So it's negative 7 minus 2,
which is negative 9, plus 9,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.960
does indeed equal 0.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.180
So this checks out.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.780
And I'll leave it up to you
to verify that 9 over

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.150
7 also works out.
