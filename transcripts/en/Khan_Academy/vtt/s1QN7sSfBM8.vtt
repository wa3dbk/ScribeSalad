00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.500
Let's do a couple of word
problems. This tells us that

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.770
Nadia's at home and Peter is
at school, which is 6 miles

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.660
away from home.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.820
So let me draw a little
diagram here.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.230
So Nadia is there.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.950
Peter is over there, and
they're 6 miles apart.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.470
So this is the distance between
home and school.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.115
That is 6 miles.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.440
They start traveling to each
other at the same time.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.360
So they both leave at the
same time, traveling

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.680
towards each other.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.890
Nadia is walking at 3 and
1/2 miles per hour.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:44.460
So she's travelling at
3 and 1/2 miles per

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.990
hour in that direction.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.150
And Peter is skateboarding
at 6 miles per

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.060
hour in that direction.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.160
So Peter is going in that
direction at 6 miles per hour.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.410
When will they meet and
how far from home is

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.980
their meeting place?

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.200
So let's say that their meeting
place is right-- I

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.390
don't know.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.120
It's going to be closer to
home, because this guy is

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.000
going faster.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.630
Peter is going faster.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.020
So let's say, let x be
equal to the distance

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.270
from home they meet.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.120
So this distance right here
is going to be x.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.750
And then what's this distance
going to be?

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.300
Well, if that's x, and this
whole thing is 6 miles, then

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.460
this distance right there is
going to be 6 minus x.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.760
So Nadia will travel x
miles and Peter will

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.400
travel 6 minus x miles.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.340
And they're going to travel
the same amount of time.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.730
Remember, they both leave at
time 0, and after time t, they

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.050
will both meet right there.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.050
So they're both going to take
the same amount of time.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.180
So Nadia's equation, if we just
remember that distance is

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.510
equal to rate times time, we
could use that for both of

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.950
them, in Nadia's case, the
distance she travels is x.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.280
x is going to be equal to her
rate, which is 3.5 miles per

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.410
hour, times t, which is the
time that she travels.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.660
And then Peter's equation is
going to be his distance.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.880
Well, he travels 6 minus x
miles, so it's 6 minus x is

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.190
going to be equal to his rate,
which is 6 miles per hour

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.600
times the time he travels.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.960
Well, he also travels
t hours, so times t.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.660
So we have two equations
and two unknowns, so we

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.420
can solve for them.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.840
We've already solved
for x here.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.660
So let's substitute this
for x right there.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.510
So we can rewrite this equation
as 6 minus, but

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.390
instead of an x, we can put
3.5t, 6 minus 3.5t, because we

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.160
know that x is equal to
3.5t, is equal to 6t.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.270
And then let's see, if we add
3.5t to both sides of this

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:17.130
equation, we get 6 is equal to
3.5t plus 6t is 9.5t, or if we

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:27.880
divide both sides by 9.5, you
get t is equal to 6 over 9.5

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.110
hours, which is a bit
of a bizarre number.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.520
But 9.5, we can rewrite that.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.670
That is the same thing as 6
over-- see, 9.5, that's the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.020
same thing as 19/2, right?

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.530
19/2, you divide that and
you would get 9.5.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.620
So this is equal to
6 times 2 over 19.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.860
So this is equal to
12/19 of an hour.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.290
That's how long it'll
take them to meet.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.210
And then if you ask the question
how far from home

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.170
will they meet?

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.310
If you want to figure out the
x value, x is going to be

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.390
equal to 3.5-- actually, instead
of writing 3.5, I can

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.779
write 3.5 as 7/2; that's the
same thing as 3.5-- times our

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.672
time, times 12/19.

00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:25.740
So you divide the numerator and
the denominator by 2, and

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:33.360
we get 7 times 6 is
42 over 19 miles.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.230
And this right here,
that is in hours.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.110
So in 12/19 of an hour-- it's
a weird fraction-- they will

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.560
meet exactly 42/19
miles from home.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.580
So it's a little over
2 miles from home.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.150
Next problem.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.760
Peter bought several notebooks
at Staples for $2.25.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.650
And he bought a few
more notebooks at

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.650
Rite Aid for $2 each.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.900
He spent the same amount of
money in both places and he

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.620
bought 17 notebooks in total.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.530
How many notebooks did
he buy in each store?

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.320
So let's define some
variables.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:22.120
Let's let S equal number
bought at Staples.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.990
And then we could say that R is
equal to the number bought

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.910
at Rite Aid.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.870
So what do we know?

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.630
So he bought a total
of 17 notebooks.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.800
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.550
He bought a total
of 17 notebooks.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.330
So that tells us that S
plus R is equal to 17.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.600
And we also know that he spent
the same amount of money in

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.320
both places.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.110
So how much did he spend
at Rite Aid?

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.990
Let me do this in orange.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.190
Spent the same amount of
money in both places.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.210
So at Staples, how much
did he spend?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:21.940
He bought S notebooks for $2.25
each, so 2.25S, that's

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.345
how much he spent at Staples.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.030
That's going to be equal
to the amount he

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.930
spent at Rite Aid.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.340
He spent $2 per notebook
at Rite Aid.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.310
So $2 times the number of
notebooks from Rite Aid, so

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.680
this is spent at Rite Aid.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.890
So once again, two equations
with two unknowns.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.710
We can do a little bit of
substitution maybe.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.900
So what's the best way
to substitute here?

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.870
Well, let's divide both
sides of this

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.070
equation by 2 right here.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.350
So you have-- I'm going to
rewrite 2.2-- well, I'll just

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.950
do it like this.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.590
So you have R.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.570
If you divide both sides of this
by 2, you have 2.25 over

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.360
2S is equal to R, right?

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.750
I just divided both sides
of this by 2.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:27.080
So if you take this value and
you substitute it in for R

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:34.540
right there, this equation
becomes S plus-- instead of an

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:44.930
R we have 2.25 over
2S is equal to 17.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.610
And let's just simplify.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.200
So this is 1-- we could view
this as 2 over 2S, right?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.200
The coefficient there
is just 1.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.310
So we can view this as we have
a common denominator.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:02.550
This is the same thing is 4.25
over 2S is equal to 17.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.710
I'm avoiding doing any
hard math just yet.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.280
Let me multiply both sides
by the inverse.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.390
2/4.25.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.490
It's a little bizarre to have
an expression with both a

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.045
fraction and a decimal,
but it's not illegal.

00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:21.680
Let's multiply both
times 2/4.25.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.720
These cancel out, and so you get
S is equal to 17 times 2

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.360
is 34 over 4.25.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.850
And actually, I can
eyeball that.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:40.169
That looks like that should
be equal to 8, right?

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:48.300
4.25 is 4 and 1/4, which is the
same thing as 17/4 over 4.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.530
So this is the same thing as
34 over 17/4, which is the

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.750
same thing as 34 times 4/17.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.690
Put a 1 there, divide by 17, you
get a 2, divide by 17, you

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.210
get a 1, 2 times 4 is 8.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.530
So he bought 8 notebooks at
Staples, this is 8, and then

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:15.940
at Rite Aid, he bought-- well,
8 plus R is equal to 17.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.820
Subtract 8 from both sides.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.920
He must have bought 9 notebooks
at Rite Aid.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.540
Let's do one more.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.400
This one is especially
fun-looking.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.980
Peter is outside, looking
at the pigs and

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.430
chickens in the yard.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.310
Nadia is indoors and cannot
see the animals.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.590
Peter gives her a puzzle.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:40.200
He tells her that he counts 13
heads and 36 feet and asks her

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.540
how many pigs and how many
chickens are in the yard.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.520
So let's once again define
our variables.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.160
P is equal to the
number of pigs.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.510
And let C is equal to the
number of chickens.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.550
So the number of heads will
essentially be the number of

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.660
pigs and chickens, assuming
they each have one head.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.920
So the number of pigs plus the
number of chickens will be

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.190
equal to the number of heads,
so that is right here.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.490
That is 13 heads.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.160
And then 4 times the number
of pigs, right?

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.460
Each pig has 4 legs, so 4 times
the number of pigs plus

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.410
2 times the number of chickens,
assuming we're

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.130
dealing with two-legged
chickens, is going to be equal

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:30.100
to the number of feet,
is equal to 36.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.400
So once again, we have two
equations with two unknowns.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.750
Instead of solving it with
substitution, I'm going to do

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.230
it by adding and subtracting
the two equations.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.990
So what we can do, this
equation, we can

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.740
multiply it times 2.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.240
And when I say multiply it times
2, we have to multiply

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.720
the entire equation times 2.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.970
And so it's still true.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.590
So we multiply the entire
equation times 2.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:11:00.150
This becomes 2P plus
2C is equal to 26.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.250
And now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to subtract this

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.790
equation from that equation,
which you can do.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.660
Because that is equal to that,
that is equal to that, and so

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.270
we're not doing anything that
violates the laws of algebra.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.720
So if you subtract the bottom
equation from the top

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.840
equation, or I could just put
a negative sign everywhere

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.760
here, just so you know
we're subtracting,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.650
4P minus 2P is 2P.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.530
2C minus 2C is 0.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.440
That's why I did this, so that
these would cancel out.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.750
And then 36 minus 26
is equal to 10.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.670
So 2P is equal to 10.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.830
Divide both sides by 2.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.910
We have 5 pigs.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:42.440
And then 5 plus the number of
chickens is equal to 13, so we

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.630
must have-- subtract 5 from
both sides-- 8 chickens.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.420
Now if this confuses you, you
might want to try it with

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.750
substitution, but I have many
videos on solving systems of

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.430
equations where I go a little
bit slower and explain a

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.710
little bit more of
the logic of it.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.280
So whatever floats your boat.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.500
But either way, Nadia should
hopefully guess or hopefully

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.150
solve for 5 pigs
and 8 chickens.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.160
And it should work out, right?

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.280
You have 13 animals.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.620
You have 13 heads.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:15.480
And if you multiply 5 times 4,
that's 20 pig feet plus 16

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.190
chicken feet.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.400
20 plus 16 is 36 total feet.
