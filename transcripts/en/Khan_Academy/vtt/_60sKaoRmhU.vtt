00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.760
If we're just dealing with two
dimensions, and we want to find

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.460
the area under a curve, we have
good tools in our toolkit

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.050
already to do it, and I'll
just remind us of our tools.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.430
so let's say, that's the
x-axis, that's the y-axis, let

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.450
me draw some arbitrary function
right here, and that's

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.130
my function f of x.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.210
And let's say we want to find
the area between x is equal to

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.810
a, so that's x equal to
a, and x is equal to b.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.140
We saw this many, many,
many videos ago.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.010
The way you can think about it,
is you take super small widths

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.610
of x, or super small
changes in x.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.350
We could call them delta x's,
but because they're so small,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.650
we're going to call them a dx.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.300
Super, infinitesimally
small changes in x.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.780
And then you multiply them
times the value of f

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.300
of x at that point.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.710
So you multiply it times the
height at that point, which

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.730
is the value of f of x.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.210
So you get f of x times each of
these infinitesimally small

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.930
bases, that'll give you the
area of this infinitesimally

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.500
narrow rectangle right there.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.220
And since each of these guys
are infinitely small, you're

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.370
going to have an infinite
number of these rectangles

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.050
in order to fill the space.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.480
You're going to have
an infinite number

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.880
of these, right?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.250
And so the tool we use was
the definite integral.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.970
The definite integral is a sum,
is an infinite sum of these

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.000
infinitely small areas,
or these infinitely

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.910
small rectangles.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.790
And the notations that we
use, they would go from a b.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.690
And we've done many videos
on how do you evaluate

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.230
these things.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.010
I just want to remind
you, conceptually,

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.210
what this is saying.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.000
This is conceptually saying,
let's take a small change in x,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.620
multiply it times the height at
that point, and you're going to

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.740
have an infinite number of
these, because these x's are

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.110
super small, they're infinitely
small, so you're going to have

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.330
an infinite number of those.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.880
So take an infinite sum of all
of those, from x is equal

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.630
to a to x is equal to b.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.150
And that's just our standard
definite integral.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.230
Now what I want to do in this
video is extend this, broaden

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.320
this a little bit, to solve, I
guess it maybe could say a

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.240
harder or a broader
class of problems.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.380
Let's say that we are, let's
go to three dimensions now.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.970
And I'll just draw
the x-y plane first.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.820
Maybe I'll keep this, just to
kind of make the analogy clear.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.450
I'm going to kind of
flatten this, so we

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.460
have some perspective.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.490
So let's say that this right
here is the y-axis, kind of

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.750
going behind the screen.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.410
You can imagine if I
just pushed on this

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.600
and knocked it down.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.480
So that's the y-axis, and that
is my x-axis right there.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.630
And let's say I some
path in the x-y plane.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.460
And in order to really define a
path in the x-y plane, I'll

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.560
have to parameterize both
the x and y variables.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.120
So let's say that x is equal
to, let me switch colors.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.350
I'm using that orange too much.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.050
Let's say that x is is equal to
some function of some parameter

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.450
t, and let's say y is equal to
some other function of that

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.320
same parameter t, and let's say
we're going to start, we're

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.090
going to have t go from, t is
going to be greater than or

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.840
equal to a, and then less
than or equal to b.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.880
Now this will define a path in
the x-y plane, and if this

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.890
seems confusing, you might want
to review the videos on

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.430
parametric equations.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.060
But essentially, when t is
equal to a, you're going to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.320
have x is equal to, so t is
equal to a, you're going to

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.630
have x is equal to g of a,
and you're going to have

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.166
y is equal to h of a.

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.580
So you're going to have this
point right here, so maybe it

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.760
might be, I don't know, I'll
just draw a random point here.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.970
When t is equal to a,
you're going to plot the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.590
coordinate point g of a.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.270
That's going to be
our x-coordinate.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.030
This is g of a, right here.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.320
And then our y-coordinate
is going to be h of a.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.520
Right?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.930
You just put t is equal to a
in each of these equations,

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.430
and then you get a
value for x and y.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.450
So this coordinate right
here would be h of a.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.940
And then, you would keep
incrementing t larger and

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.190
larger, until you get to b, but
you're going to get a series of

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.190
points that are going to
look something like that.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.410
That right there is a curve, or
it's a path, in the x-y plane.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.430
And you know, you're saying,
how does that relate

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.430
to that right now?

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.250
What are we doing?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.000
Well, let me just write a c
here, for saying, that's our

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.750
curve, our that's our path.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.090
Now, let's say I have another
function that associates every

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.010
point in the x-y plane
with some value.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.480
So let's say I have some
function, f of x y.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.800
What it does is associate
every point on the x-y

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.170
plane with some value.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.890
So let me plot f of x y.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.360
Let me make a
vertical axis here.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.460
We could do a different color.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.090
Call it the f of x y axis,
maybe we could even call it

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.010
the z-axis, if you want to.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.080
But some vertical
axis right there.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.050
And for every point, so if you
give me an x and a y, and put

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.860
into my f of x y function, it's
going to give you some point.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.160
So I can just draw some
type of a surface that

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.375
f of x y represents.

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:14.920
And this'll all become a lot
more concrete when I do

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.440
some concrete examples.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.950
So let's say that f of x y
looks something like this.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.890
I'm going to try my
best to draw it.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.440
I'll do a different color.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.090
Let's say f of x y.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.730
Some surface.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.795
I'll draw part of it.

00:05:26.795 --> 00:05:29.230
It's some surface that
looks, let's say it looks

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.220
something like that.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.680
That is f of x y.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.310
And remember, all this is, is
you give me an x, you give me a

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.800
y, you pop it into f of x y,
it's going to give me some

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.060
third value that we're going to
plot in this vertical

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.780
axis right here.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.760
I mean, example, f of x y?

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.110
It could be, I'm not saying
this is a particular case,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.650
it could be x plus y.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.300
It could be f of x y.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.200
These are just examples.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.750
It could be x times y.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.350
If x is 1, y is 2, f of
x y will be 1 times 2.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.110
But let's say when you plot,
for every point on the x-y

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.570
plane, when you plot f of x y
you get this surface up

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.600
here, and we want to do
something interesting.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.130
We want to figure out, not the
area under this curve, this

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.230
was very simple when we
did it the first time.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.640
I want to find the area if you
imagine a curtain, or a fence,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.570
that goes along this curve.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.750
You can imagine this being a
very straight linear path,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.640
going just along the
x-axis from a to b.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.330
Now we have this kind of crazy,
curvy path that's going

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.070
along the x-y plane.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.030
And you can imagine if you drew
a wall, or curtain, or a fence

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.750
that went straight up from this
to my f of x y, let me do my

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.100
best effort to draw that.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.790
Let me draw it.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.550
So it's going to go up to
there, and maybe this point

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.140
corresponds to there.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.480
And when you draw that curtain
up, it's going to intersect

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.720
it something like that.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.940
Let's say it looks
something like that.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.550
So this point right here
corresponds to that

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.080
point right there.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.630
So if you imagine, you have a
curtain, f of x y is the roof,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.620
and this is a, what I've drawn
here, this curve, this kind of

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.600
shows you the bottom of a wall.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.660
This is some kind
of crazy wall.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.250
And let me say, this point it
corresponds to, well, actually,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.205
let me draw it little
bit different.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.270
This point will correspond to
some point up here, so when you

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.800
trace where it intersects, it
will look something maybe

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.520
like that, I don't know.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.410
Something like that.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.220
And I'm trying my best to
help you visualize this.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.836
So maybe I'll shade this in
to make it a little solid,

00:07:34.836 --> 00:07:36.830
let's say f of x y is
little transparent.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.500
You can see.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.360
But you have this
curvy-looking wall here.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.880
And the whole point of this
video is, how can we figure out

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.890
the area of this curvy-looking
wall, that's essentially the

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.475
wall or the fence that happens
if you go from this curve

00:07:52.475 --> 00:07:56.166
and jump up, and hit the
ceiling at this f of x y?

00:07:56.166 --> 00:07:58.770
So let's think a little bit
about how we can do it.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.470
Well, if we just use the
analogy of what we did

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.860
previously, we could
say, well look.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.120
Let's make a little change
in distance of our curve.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.890
Let's call that ds.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.740
That's a little change
in distance of my

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.060
curve, right there.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.200
And if I multiply that change
in distance of the curve times

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:29.270
f of x y at that point, I'm
going to get the area of that

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.860
little rectangle right there.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.190
Right?

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.550
So if I take the ds, my change
in my, you can imagine the arc

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:38.390
length of this curve at that
point, so let me write, you

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:51.330
know, ds is equal to super
small change in arc length of

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.880
our path, or of our curve.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.200
That's our ds.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.340
So you can imagine, the area of
that little rectangle right

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:02.640
there, along my curvy wall, is
going to be ds, I'll make it a

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.000
capital S, ds times the
height at that point.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.760
Well, that's f of x y.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.290
And then if I take the sum,
because these are infinitely

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.980
narrow, these ds's have
infinitely small width, if I

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.860
were take the infinite sum of
all of those guys, from t is

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:28.130
equal to a to t is equal to b,
right, from t is equal to a, I

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.610
keep taking the sum of those
rectangles, to t is equal

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.110
to b, right there, that
will give me my area.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.370
I'm just using the exact same
logic as I did up there.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.660
I'm not being very
mathematically rigorous, but I

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.690
want to give you the intuition
of what we're doing.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.190
We're really just bending the
base of this thing to get a

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.360
curvy wall instead of a
straight, direct wall

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.270
like we had up here.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.330
But you're saying, Sal, this is
all abstract, and how can I

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.800
even calculate something like
this, this makes no sense to

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.220
me, I have an s here, I have
an x and a y, I have a t,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.520
what can I do with this?

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.850
And let's see if we can
make some headway.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.440
And I promise you, when we do
it with a tangible problem,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.420
the end product of this video
is going to be a little

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.410
bit hairy to look at.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.030
But when we do it with an
actual problem, it'll actually,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.310
I think, be very concrete, and
you'll see it's not too

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.060
hard to deal with.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.790
But let's see if we can get
all of this in terms of t.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.390
So first of all, let's
focus just on this ds.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.070
So let me re-pick
up the x-y axis.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.910
So if I were to reflip the
x-y, let me switch colors,

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.320
this is just getting
a little monotonous.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.805
So if I were to reflip the x-y
axis like that, actually, let

00:10:33.805 --> 00:10:35.010
me do that with that same
green, so you know we're

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.000
dealing with the same x-y axis.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.340
So that's my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.550
And so this path right here, if
I were to just draw it straight

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.045
up like this, it would
look something like this.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.320
Right?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.040
That's my path, my arc.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.930
You know, this is when t is
equal to a, so this is t is

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.090
equal to a, this is
t is equal to b.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.905
Same thing, I just kind
of picked it back up so

00:11:01.905 --> 00:11:03.110
you can visualize it.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.040
And we say that we have some
change in arc length, let's

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.880
say, let me switch colors.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.210
Let's say that this
one right here.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.470
Let's say that's some small
change in arc length, and

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.640
we're calling that ds.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.200
Now, is there some way to
relate ds to infinitely

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.710
small changes in x or y?

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.730
Well, if we think about it, if
we really-- and this is all a

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.930
little bit hand-wavy, I'm not
being mathematically rigorous,

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.900
but I think it'll give you the
correct intuition-- if you

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.160
imagine this is, you can figure
out the length of ds if you

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.810
know the length of these
super small changes in x and

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.800
super small changes in y.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.950
So if this distance right here
is ds, infinitesimally small

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.640
change in x, this distance
right here is dy,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.090
infinitesimally small
change in y, right?

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.210
Then we could figure out ds
from the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:57.660
You can say that ds is going to
be, it's the hypotenuse of this

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:04.310
triang.e It's equal to the
square root of dx squared

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:09.920
plus dy squared.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.090
So that seems to make things a
little bit, you know, we can

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.830
get rid of the ds
all of a sudden.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.740
So let's rewrite this little
expression here, using this

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.850
sense of what ds, is really
the square root of dx

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.160
squared plus dy squared.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.060
And I'm not being very
rigorous, and actually it's

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.360
very hard to be rigorous with
differentials, but intuitively

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.030
I think it makes
a lot of sense.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.200
So we can say that this
integral, the area of this

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.080
curvy curtain, is going to be
the integral from t is equal to

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:44.390
a to t is equal to b of f of x
y, instead of writing ds, we

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:50.980
can write this, times the
square root of dx squared

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.860
plus dy squared.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.290
Now we at least got rid of this
big capital S, but we still

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.010
haven't solved the problem of,
how do you solve something, you

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.090
know, an integral, a definite
integral that looks like this?

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.290
We have it in terms of t
here, but we only have it in

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.410
terms of x's and y's here.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.490
So we need to get
everything in terms of t.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.710
Well, we know x and y are both
functions of t, so we can

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.530
actually rewrite it like this.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:18.220
We can rewrite it as from t is
equal to a, to t is equal to b.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.800
And f of x y, we can write it,
f is a function of x, which is

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.630
a function of t, and f is also
a function of y, which is

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.510
also a function of t.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.760
So you give me a t, I'll be
able to give you an x or y, and

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.630
once you give me an x or y,
I can figure out what f is.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.320
So we have that, and then we
have this part right here.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.100
I'll do it in orange.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.380
Square root of dx squared
plus dy squared.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.000
But we still don't have
things in terms of t.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.360
We need a dt someplace
here in order be able to

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.460
evaluate this integral.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.020
And we'll see that in the
next video, when I do

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.890
a concrete problem.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.560
But I really want to give you a
sense for the end product, the

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.570
formula we're going to get
at the end product of this

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.070
video, where it comes from.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.710
So one thing we can do, is if
we allow ourselves to

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.180
algebraically manipulate
differentials, what we can do

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:13.120
is let us multiply
and divide by dt.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.510
So one way to think about it,
you could rewrite, so let me

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.130
just do this orange
part right here.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.360
Let's do a little
side right here.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.860
So if you take this orange
part, and write it in pink, and

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:29.460
you have dx squared, and then
you have plus dy squared, and

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.040
let's say you just multiply
it times dt over dt, right?

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.880
That's a small change in t,
divided by a small change in t.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.500
That's 1, so of course you
can multiply it by that.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.640
If we're to bring in this part
inside of the square root sign,

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.170
right, so let me rewrite this.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:51.210
This is the same thing as 1
over dt times the square root

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:57.130
of dx squared plus dy squared,
and then times that dt.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:57.420
Right?

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.670
I just wanted to write it
this way to show you I'm

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.040
just multiplying by 1.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.740
And here, I'm just taking this
dt, writing it there, and

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.190
leaving this over here.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.130
And now if I wanted to bring
this into the square root sign,

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.510
this is the same thing, this is
equal to, and I'll do it very

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.790
slowly, just to make sure, I'll
allow you to believe that I'm

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.650
not doing anything shady
with the algebra.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.760
This is the same thing as the
square root of 1 over dt

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.520
squared, let me make the
radical a little bit bigger,

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.980
times dx squared plus
dy squared, and all of

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.410
that times dt, right?

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.250
I didn't do anything, you could
just take the square root of

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.080
this and you'd get 1 over dt.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.680
And if I just distribute this,
this is equal to the square

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:46.770
root, and we have our dt at the
end, of dx squared, or we could

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:55.700
even write, dx over dt squared,
plus dy over dt squared.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.590
Right? dx squared over dt
squared is just dx over dt

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.840
squared, same thing
with the y's.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.100
And now all of a sudden,
this starts to look

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.880
pretty interesting.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.130
Let's substitute this
expression with this one.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.700
We said that these
are equivalent.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.000
And I'll switch colors,
just for the sake of it.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.470
So we have the integral.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.250
From t is equal to a.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.810
Let me get our drawing back, if
I-- from t is equal to a to t

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:26.050
is equal to b of f of x of t
times, or f of x of t and f of,

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:29.810
or and y of t, they're both
functions of t, and now instead

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.520
of this expression, we can
write the square root of, well,

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.490
what's dx, what's the change in
x with respect to, whatever

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:40.150
this parameter is?

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.700
What is dx dt?

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:55.950
dx dt is the same thing
as g prime of t.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.660
Right? x is a function of t.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.130
The function I wrote
is g prime of t.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:06.400
And then dy dt is same
thing as h prime of t.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.740
We could say that, you
know, this function of t.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.690
So I just wanted to
make that clear.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.760
We know these two functions,
so we can just take their

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.970
derivatives with respect to t.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.680
But I'm just going to
leave it in that form.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.550
So the square root, and we take
the derivative of x with

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:26.030
respect to t squared, plus the
derivative of y with respect to

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.320
t squared, and all
of that times dt.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.780
And this might look like some
strange and convoluted formula,

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.130
but this is actually something
that we know how to deal with.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:39.340
We've now simplified this
strange, you know, this

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.650
arc-length problem, or this
line integral, right?

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.760
That's essentially
what we're doing.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.760
We're taking an integral over
a curve, or over a line,

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.530
as opposed to just an
interval on the x-axis.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.690
We've taken the strange line
integral, that's in terms of

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.730
the arc length of the line, and
x's and y's, and we've put

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.170
everything in terms of t.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.290
And I'm going to show you that
in the next video, right?

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.200
Everything is going to be
expressed in terms of t,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.350
so this just turns into a
simple, definite integral.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.030
So hopefully that didn't
confuse you too much.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.080
I think you're going to see in
the next video that this, right

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.010
here, is actually a
very straightforward

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.850
thing to implement.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.250
And just to remind you where
it all came from, I think I

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.470
got the parentheses right.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.860
This right here was just a
change in our arc length.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.390
That whole thing right
there was just a

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.330
change in arc length.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:26.370
And this is just the height of
our function at that point.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.820
And we're just summing it,
doing an infinite sum of

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.370
infinitely small lengths.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.050
So this was a change in our
arc length times the height.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.640
This is going to have an
infinitely narrow width, and

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.120
they're going to take an
infinite number of these

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.300
rectangles to get the area of
this entire fence, or

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.430
this entire curtain.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.210
And that's what this definite
integral will give us,

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.270
and we'll actually apply
it in the next video.
