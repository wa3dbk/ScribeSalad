00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.300
We're on problem 49.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.980
Let me copy and paste
it into the window.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.080
I've copied it and now
let me paste it.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.110
There you go, problem 49.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.915
Let me pick a good highlighter
color, magenta is good.

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:22.190
A student showed the following
steps in his solution to the

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.810
equation below, but his answer
was not correct.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.070
Then at the bottom they say, in
which step did he make his

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.910
first error?

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.410
So let's see, log base 5 of 2x
squared, minus 3x, plus 1,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.180
minus log base 5 of x, minus 1,
plus log base 5 of 125 is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.830
equal to 6.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.570
Fair enough.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.180
All right, now it looks like
in this first step, he kept

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.910
this the same.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.640
You can't mess up there.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.490
Then he said log base
5 of 125 is 3.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.110
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.900
5 to the third power
is equal to 125.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.300
So that is right as well.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.630
Let's see, here it looks like he
took the 2x squared, minus

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.640
3x plus 1, and he factored
them into 2x minus

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.430
1 and x minus 1.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.520
Let's see if that's right.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.980
2x times 2x is 2x squared.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.540
2x times minus 1 is minus 2x.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.406
Minus 1 times x is minus 3x.

00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:21.870
And you have a minus 1 times a
minus 1, you get a plus 1.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.080
So you get 2x squared,
minus x, minus 2x, so

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.310
minus 3x, plus 1.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.470
So this is right.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.680
So so far so good.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.390
What does he do next?

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.880
All right, in the next
step he keeps this

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.070
first term the same.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.680
2x minus 1, x minus 1.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.140
Fair enough.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.490
He keeps this term the same.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.720
He just subtracts 3
from both sides.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.550
He subtracts 3 from both sides
and this becomes 0 and then

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.770
this becomes 3.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.030
Fair enough.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.690
What does he do in
the next step?

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.940
This is interesting.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.720
He essentially said, if I am
subtracting 2 logarithms with

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.280
the same base, that's
the equivalent of

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.479
dividing the two things.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.010
So he kind of did a
quick step here.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.170
So his logic here is that log--
I don't even have to

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.190
write the base 5-- but log of
2x, minus 1, times x minus 1,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.490
minus log of base 5, times x
minus 1, that that would be

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:40.450
equal log of 2x minus 1, times
x minus 1, all of that

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.780
over x minus 1.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.840
That seems fair enough.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.660
So that should cancel out.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.460
Oh, but that's where he
made his mistake.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.190
What you end up with left over
when you cancel out the 2x

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.330
minus 1's, isn't one
of the minus 1's.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.500
You're left with log
of 2x minus 1.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.750
This x minus 1 and this
x minus 1 cancel out.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.710
He should be left
with just the 2x

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.900
minus 1 in the logarithm.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.190
But instead, somehow he got
rid of the 2x minus 1 and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.340
ended up with just an
x minus 1 here.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.115
So step 3 is where he made
his first mistake.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.010
I don't know.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.910
He somehow intuitively knew that
you could divide x minus

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.390
1 into this, because of log of
A minus log of B is equal to

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.960
log of A over B.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.900
But I don't know, he simplified
wrong or something.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.930
Who knows?

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.180
Next problem.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.850
All right, let me copy and
paste this one too.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.430
I'm starting to like this notion
of copying and pasting.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.790
I don't have to rewrite
the problem.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.660
And I can mark it up and do all
sorts of things with it.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.690
All right, a certain radioactive
element decays

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.000
over time, according to the
equation y is equal to A times

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.870
1/2 to the t divided
by 300th power.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.600
Where A equals the number of
grams present initially, t

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.829
equals time in years.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.980
If 1,000 grams were present
initially, how many grams will

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.740
remain after 900 years?

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.220
So we get y is equal to--
1,000 grams were present

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.920
initially, so that's A.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.640
So 1,000 times 1/2 to the-- and
they say, what is time?

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.340
How many grams will remain
after 900 years?

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.120
t is time in years.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.420
So 1/2 to the 900
divided by 300.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.120
I just substituted
A and t into the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.300
equations they gave us.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.340
1,000 is A, and 900 is t.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.780
So let's just simplify
this thing.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.920
So we get this is equal to
1,000 times 1/2 to the--

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.490
what's 900 divided by 300?

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.740
It's just 3.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.740
So that equals 1,000.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.090
What's 1/2 to the third power?

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.261
It's 1/8.

00:05:15.261 --> 00:05:18.000
It's 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.590
So we get 1,000 divided
by 8, which is 125.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.990
125 grams are left
in 900 years.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.360
That is choice C.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.360
Next problem.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.030
All right, let me see
if I have to copy

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.590
and paste this one.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.520
Yeah, sure, they have a
chart, even better.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.700
I've copied it, and
there we go.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.410
Look at that.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.620
All right.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.920
Bacteria in a culture are
growing exponentially with

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.420
time as shown in the
table below.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.090
Which of the following equations
expresses the number

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.090
of bacteria y present
at any time t.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.510
OK, so growing exponentially
tells us that if I say, the

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.910
amount of bacteria after any
days, so let's say y would be

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.050
the amount of bacteria,
exponential form tends to be

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.530
you'd have your initial amount--
like A in that

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.770
previous example-- times some
number that is kind of the

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.960
exponent factor, I guess
you could call it.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.240
The last one it was 1/2.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.580
When you do continuous compound
interest, it'll be e.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.570
It'll be how fast something is
either growing or decaying.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.720
I don't know, that'll be x.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.310
I'm just making up a letter.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.760
It's usually x to some power t
that's usually a function of

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.740
time, some constant
times time.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.230
This is the general form
of any kind of

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.190
exponential growth or decay.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.800
You might see different letters
than that, but that's

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.730
the general idea.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.310
So anyway, if we look at all of
these choices, well, if you

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.800
just look at the thing,
you're seeing it's

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.840
doubling every day.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.520
The amount of bacteria is
doubling every day.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.680
So that tells us that's going
to be some power of 2.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.460
So y is going to be-- the amount
of bacteria after any

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.980
day is going to be equal
to some initial amount.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.760
Actually, we could just
think about it, right?

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.680
We have some initial amount
times 2 to some constant times

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.450
the day's power.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.640
But I think if we just
take 2 to the day's

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.920
power-- let's see.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.520
At 0 days you have
a 100 bacteria.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.950
So y is equal to 100-- I think
this gets you there; and

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.970
instead of writing days,
let's write time--

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.110
times 2 to the time.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.370
Sometimes there's a constant
here, but this is

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.560
straightforward enough.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.650
When t is equal to 0, this 2
to the t becomes 1, and you

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.010
have 100 here.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.750
When t is 1, then
this becomes 2.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.920
2 times 100 is 200.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.390
You could say this is
t and this is y.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.080
When t is 0, y is 100.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.120
When t is 1, y is 200.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.210
When t is 2, y is 400.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:13.210
So it is choice B.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.550
Probably the easiest way is
just to look at these.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.560
And say, wow, there's only
one-- well, two of these

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.460
choices, well, three of
them have kind of

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.335
an exponential form.

00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:23.310
We're just like, oh, well, this
doesn't take into account

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.710
the initial condition.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.530
At day 0 I have 100 bacteria.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.790
This one, I don't know, it
says at day 0, I have 200

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:30.720
bacteria, which is just wrong.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.660
I have 100.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.630
You take t equals 0, and
you're left with what

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.179
you have at day 0.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.520
So depending on how you
look at it, you

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.820
get to B either way.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.919
Next question.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.539
I'm running out of space.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.130
Oh, there you go.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.830
All right, next question.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.700
They write, I'll write
the whole thing here.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.160
If the equation y to the 2x
is graphed, which of the

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.920
following values of x would
produce a point

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.730
closest to the x-axis?

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.880
So if you think about it, let's
just think about how

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.590
that graph would even look.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.610
Let me draw it here actually.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.390
I'll draw it in a
darker color.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.230
I can do it right on
top of the white.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.810
Let's just get an intuition.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.380
What's 2 to the 0?

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.140
2 to the 0 is 1, right?

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.060
Its y-intercept would
be 1 at x equals 0.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.995
2 squared, then 2
to the 2 power.

00:09:37.995 --> 00:09:41.565
And you were looking at
4, we'll go there.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:53.500
Sorry, let's say if this is 1,
this would be 2, 2 to the

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.990
first power.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.920
Then 2 to the second
power would be 4.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.970
Then 2 to the third
power would be 8.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.440
Actually, 4 would be like.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.700
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.250
We don't have to worry.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.310
It's going to go
up really fast.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.100
Now what happens as you go
into the negative powers?

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.180
So 2 to the negative
1 power is 1/2.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.240
You're going to get
right there.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.740
2 to the negative 2 is 1/4.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.090
So you're just going to get
smaller and it's just going to

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.930
asymptote to 0.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:27.320
So that's what the graph
is going to look like.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.230
I didn't even have to worry
about negatives, because there

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.480
are no negative numbers here.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.390
So really, the smallest of these
are going to produce a

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.750
point closest to the x-axis.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.090
The smallest of these
values, you want to

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.100
get as small as possible.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.490
Let's see, 3/4 is
bigger than 1/4.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.540
So that's not right.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.720
5/3 is bigger than 1/4.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.380
8/3 is bigger than 1/4.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.740
So the answer is 1/4, A.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.780
2 to the 1/4 power is going to
be a little bit more than 1.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.850
It's going to be something
like that.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.310
Anyway, next question.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:04.370
Oh, I'm all out of time.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.210
See you in the next video.
