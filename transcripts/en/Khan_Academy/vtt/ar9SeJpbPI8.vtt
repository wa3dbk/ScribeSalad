00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Voiceover] So let's
start thinking about partial

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.129
derivatives of vector fields.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:06.927
So a vector field is a function.

00:00:06.927 --> 00:00:09.626
I'll just do a two
dimensional example here.

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:12.208
It's gonna be something that
has a two dimensional input.

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:14.691
And then the output has the
same number of dimensions.

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:16.048
That's the important part.

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.801
And each of these components in the output

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:21.016
is gonna depend somehow
on the input variables.

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:22.791
So the example I have in mind

00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:25.273
will be X times Y as that first component,

00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:29.440
and then Y squared minus X
squared as that second component.

00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:32.985
And you can compute the partial derivative

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:34.513
of a guy like this, right?

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:36.417
You'll take the partial
derivative with respect to

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:37.281
one of the input variables.

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:38.313
I'll choose X.

00:00:38.313 --> 00:00:39.739
It's always a nice one to start with.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.822
Partial derivative with respect to X.

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:45.337
And if we were to actually compute it,

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:48.607
in this case, it's another,
it's a function of X and Y.

00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:51.106
What you do is you take
the partial derivative

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:52.363
component wise.

00:00:52.363 --> 00:00:54.095
So you to each component in the first one.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.016
You say, okay.

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:55.978
X looks like a variable.

00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:57.635
Y looks like a constant.

00:00:57.635 --> 00:00:59.746
The derivative will just be that constant.

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:01.984
And then the partial derivative
of the second component.

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:03.663
That Y squared looks like a constant.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:06.266
Derivative of negative X
squared with respect to X.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.516
Negative two X.

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:09.994
So analytically,

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:11.435
if you know how to take
a partial derivative,

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:12.865
you already know how to
take a partial derivative

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:15.472
of vector valued functions
and hence vector fields,

00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:17.931
but the fun part, the important part here.

00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:20.354
How do you actually interpret this?

00:01:20.354 --> 00:01:21.468
And this has everything to do

00:01:21.468 --> 00:01:23.370
with visualizing it in some way.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.762
So the vector field, the reason
we call it a vector field,

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:29.894
is you kind of take the whole X Y plane

00:01:29.894 --> 00:01:32.007
and you're gonna fill it with vectors.

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:33.938
And concretely, what I mean by that,

00:01:33.938 --> 00:01:35.022
you'll take a given input.

00:01:35.022 --> 00:01:37.954
What's an input you wanna look at?

00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:39.927
I'll say, maybe one, two.

00:01:39.927 --> 00:01:41.016
Yeah, let's do that.

00:01:41.016 --> 00:01:42.516
Let's do one, two.

00:01:43.473 --> 00:01:45.870
Which would mean you
kinda go X equals one.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.399
And then Y equals two

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.429
This input point.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:49.726
Then we want to associate that

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:51.781
with the output vector in some way.

00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:54.477
And so, let's just compute
what it should equal.

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:57.532
So when we plug in X equals
one, and Y equals two,

00:01:57.532 --> 00:01:59.365
X times Y becomes two.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.279
Y squared minus X squared

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:03.734
becomes two squared minus one squared,

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:05.988
so four minus one is three.

00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:08.842
So we have this vector two,
three that we want to associate

00:02:08.842 --> 00:02:10.212
with that input point.

00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:11.965
And vector fields, you
just attach the two points.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.139
I'm gonna take the vector two, three

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.522
and attach it to this guy.

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:18.591
So we should have an X component of two

00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:21.258
and then a Y component of three.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.318
So it's going to end up
looking something like,

00:02:24.318 --> 00:02:26.563
let's see, so Y component of three,

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:28.230
something like this.

00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:31.595
So that'll be the vector and
we attach it to that point.

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:34.021
And in principal, you do this
to all the different points.

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:37.015
And if you did, what you'd get
would be something like this.

00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:38.212
And remember when we represent these,

00:02:38.212 --> 00:02:40.773
especially with computers,
it tends to lie,

00:02:40.773 --> 00:02:43.475
where each represented
vector is much, much shorter

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:45.247
than it should be in reality,

00:02:45.247 --> 00:02:47.624
but you want to squish
them all onto the same page

00:02:47.624 --> 00:02:49.237
so they don't over run each other.

00:02:49.237 --> 00:02:51.421
And here, color is
supposed to give a general,

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.419
vague sense of relative length.

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.462
So ones that are blue should
thought of as much shorter

00:02:55.462 --> 00:02:56.868
than the ones that are yellow,

00:02:56.868 --> 00:02:58.598
but that doesn't really
give a specific thought

00:02:58.598 --> 00:03:01.207
for how long they should be.

00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:02.355
But, for partial derivatives,

00:03:02.355 --> 00:03:04.766
we actually care a lot
about the specifics.

00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:06.685
And if you think back to

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:08.515
how we interpret partial derivatives

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:10.022
in a lot of other contexts,

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:13.030
what want to do is imagine
this partial X here

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.699
as a slight nudge in
the X direction, right.

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:17.427
So this was our original input,

00:03:17.427 --> 00:03:19.876
so you might imagine just
nudging it a little bit,

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:22.509
and the size of that nudge, as a number,

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:24.460
would be your partial X.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.299
So then the question is,

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.774
what's the resulting change to the output?

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.103
And because the output is a vector,

00:03:30.103 --> 00:03:32.754
the change to the output is
also going to be a vector.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.607
So what we want is to say

00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:35.970
there's going to be some other vector

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.592
attached to this point, right?

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:38.560
It's going to look very similar.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.946
Maybe it looks like,

00:03:39.946 --> 00:03:43.408
maybe it looks something like this.

00:03:43.408 --> 00:03:45.731
So something similar, but
maybe a little bit different.

00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.616
And you want to take that
difference in vector form.

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:50.998
And I'll describe what I mean
by that in just a moment,

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:53.309
and then divide by the size
of that original nudge.

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.763
So to be much more specific
about what I mean here,

00:03:56.763 --> 00:03:58.292
if you're comparing two different vectors

00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:00.207
and they're rooted in two different spots,

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:01.255
I think a good way to start

00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:03.023
is to just move them to a new space

00:04:03.023 --> 00:04:04.803
where they're rooted in the same spot.

00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:05.834
So in this case,

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:08.513
I'm gonna kinda just draw
a separate space over here.

00:04:08.513 --> 00:04:10.274
And be thinking of this as a place

00:04:10.274 --> 00:04:11.555
for these vectors to live.

00:04:11.555 --> 00:04:13.574
And I'm gonna them both on this plane,

00:04:13.574 --> 00:04:15.600
but I'm gonna root them
each in the origin.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.990
So this first one that
has components two, three,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.457
now let's give it a name, right.

00:04:19.457 --> 00:04:21.638
Let's call this guy V one, okay.

00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:22.878
So that'll be V one.

00:04:22.878 --> 00:04:24.912
And then the nudged
output, the second one,

00:04:24.912 --> 00:04:26.245
I'll call V two.

00:04:31.014 --> 00:04:32.784
And let's say V two is also in this space,

00:04:32.784 --> 00:04:34.526
and I might exaggerate the difference,

00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:36.784
just so we can see it here.

00:04:36.784 --> 00:04:38.905
Let's say it was different in some way.

00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:40.367
In reality, if it's a small nudge,

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.386
it'll be different in
only a very small way.

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:45.014
But let's say these were our two vectors.

00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:47.694
The difference between these guys

00:04:47.694 --> 00:04:51.066
is going to be a vector
that connects the tips.

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:54.066
And I'm gonna call that guy Partial V.

00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:56.240
And the way you can be thinking about this

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.439
is to say that V one, V
one, that original guy,

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:04.735
plus, that tiny nudge, the
difference between them

00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:05.652
is equal to

00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:08.217
the two,

00:05:08.217 --> 00:05:10.032
you know, the nudged output.

00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:11.197
And in terms of tip to tail with vectors,

00:05:11.197 --> 00:05:12.261
you've seen that.

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:14.719
Kind of the green vector
plus that blue vector

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.165
is the same as that pink vector

00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:19.417
that connects the tail of the original one

00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:21.263
to the tip of the new one.

00:05:21.263 --> 00:05:23.824
So when we're thinking
of a partial derivative,

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:24.741
you're basically saying,

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.301
"Hey, what happens if
we take this, the nudge,

00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:29.302
the size of the nudge of the output,

00:05:29.302 --> 00:05:32.343
and then we divide it by
the nudge of the input?"

00:05:32.343 --> 00:05:34.415
So let's thinking of that
original nudge as being,

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:38.456
I don't know, of a size of one
half, like zero point five.

00:05:38.456 --> 00:05:41.631
As the change in the X direction.

00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:43.637
Then that would mean, when
you go over here and say

00:05:43.637 --> 00:05:44.644
what's that DV?

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:48.121
That changing vector V divided by the X,

00:05:48.121 --> 00:05:50.249
you'd be dividing it by zero point five,

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.993
and in principle, you'd be thinking of,

00:05:51.993 --> 00:05:54.603
that would mean that your
kind of scaling this by two.

00:05:54.603 --> 00:05:58.399
As if to say, this
little DV is one half of

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.383
some other vector.

00:05:59.383 --> 00:06:01.951
And that other vector is what
the partial derivative is.

00:06:01.951 --> 00:06:04.263
So this other vector
here, the full blue guy,

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:08.233
would be DV, you know,
scaled down or scaled up,

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:09.387
however you want to think about it,

00:06:09.387 --> 00:06:10.703
by that partial X.

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.015
And that's what makes it such the,

00:06:12.015 --> 00:06:13.818
you know, in principle if this partial X

00:06:13.818 --> 00:06:16.055
change was really small, like one 100th

00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:17.830
and the output nudge
was also really small,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.087
it's like one 100th,

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:20.676
or you know something on that order,

00:06:20.676 --> 00:06:22.508
it wouldn't be specifically that.

00:06:22.508 --> 00:06:24.227
Then the DVDX, that change,

00:06:24.227 --> 00:06:27.003
would still be a normal sized vector.

00:06:27.003 --> 00:06:28.389
And the direction that it points

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:29.731
is still kind of an indication

00:06:29.731 --> 00:06:31.782
of the direction that this
green vector should change

00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:34.384
as you're scooting over.

00:06:34.384 --> 00:06:37.355
So just be concrete and
actually compute this guy,

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.639
let's say we were to take
this partial derivative

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.542
partial V with respect to X

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:43.931
and evaluate it at that point one, two

00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:46.739
that we're just dealing with, one, two.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:49.215
What that would mean, Y is equal to two,

00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:51.052
so that first component is two

00:06:51.052 --> 00:06:52.366
and then X is equal to one,

00:06:52.366 --> 00:06:54.255
so that next should be negative two.

00:06:54.255 --> 00:06:57.621
And then we can see just
how wrong my drawing was

00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:58.454
to start here.

00:06:58.454 --> 00:07:00.532
I was just kind of guessing
what the pink vector would be,

00:07:00.532 --> 00:07:01.365
but I guess it changes

00:07:01.365 --> 00:07:03.118
in the direction of two, negative two.

00:07:03.118 --> 00:07:06.762
So that should be something,
here I'll erase the,

00:07:06.762 --> 00:07:10.679
what turns out to be,
the wrong direction here.

00:07:11.743 --> 00:07:13.410
Get rid of this guy.

00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:18.564
And I guess the change would
be in the direction kind of two

00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:20.052
as the X component,

00:07:20.052 --> 00:07:22.883
and then negative two,
that's a negative two,

00:07:22.883 --> 00:07:24.126
as the Y component.

00:07:24.126 --> 00:07:27.211
So the derivative vector should
look something like this.

00:07:27.211 --> 00:07:29.772
Which means all corresponding
little DV nudges,

00:07:29.772 --> 00:07:32.373
will be slight changes,

00:07:32.373 --> 00:07:33.787
will be slight changes on that.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.757
So these will be your, your DVs.

00:07:35.757 --> 00:07:38.078
Something in that direction.

00:07:38.078 --> 00:07:41.828
And what that means in
our vector field then,

00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.752
as you move in the X direction

00:07:45.752 --> 00:07:48.758
and consider the various
vectors attached to each point,

00:07:48.758 --> 00:07:51.411
as you kind of passing
through the point one, two,

00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:53.222
the way that the vectors are changing,

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:55.373
should be somehow down and to the right.

00:07:55.373 --> 00:07:57.030
The tip should move down and to the right.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.413
So if this starts highly
up and to the right,

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:01.184
then it should be getting kind of shorter,

00:08:01.184 --> 00:08:02.706
but then longer to the right.

00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:03.853
So then the V two,

00:08:03.853 --> 00:08:06.382
if I were to have drawn
it more accurately here,

00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:08.824
you know, what they nudged
output should look like,

00:08:08.824 --> 00:08:11.602
it would really be
something that kind of like

00:08:11.602 --> 00:08:12.535
I don't know, like this,

00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:15.693
where it's getting shorter
in the Y direction,

00:08:15.693 --> 00:08:17.829
but then longer in X direction,

00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:20.886
as per that blue nudging arrow.

00:08:20.886 --> 00:08:23.334
And then in the next video I'll kind of go

00:08:23.334 --> 00:08:25.286
through more examples of
how you might think of this.

00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:27.913
How you think of it in terms
of what each component means.

00:08:27.913 --> 00:08:30.489
Which becomes very
important for later topics,

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:32.278
like divergence and curl.

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:33.643
And I'll see you next video.
