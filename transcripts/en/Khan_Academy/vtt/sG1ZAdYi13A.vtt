00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.730
I have this reaction here
where if I had a mole of

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.970
methane, and I react that with
two moles of oxygen, I'll

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.045
produce a mole of carbon
dioxide and

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:09.680
two moles of water.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.380
And what we want to answer in
this video is whether this

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.760
reaction is spontaneous.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.290
And we learned in the last
video that to answer that

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.810
question, we have to turn to
Gibbs free energy, or the

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.620
change in Gibbs free energy.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.320
And the change in Gibbs free
energy is equal to the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.300
enthalpy change for the reaction
minus the temperature

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.820
at which it is occurring, times
the change in entropy.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.840
And if this is less than
zero, then it's

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.240
a spontaneous reaction.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.860
So I gave us a little
bit of a head start.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.070
I just calculated the change in
enthalpy for this reaction,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.530
and that's right here.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.460
And we know how to do that.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.230
We've done that several
videos ago.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.900
You could just look up the heats
of formation of each of

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.880
these products.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.950
For water you'll multiply
it by 2, since you

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.180
have 2 moles of it.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.510
And so you have the heats of
formation of all the products,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.500
and then you subtract
out the heats of

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.780
formation of all the reactants.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.270
And of course the heat of
formation of O2 is O, so this

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.040
won't even show up in it, and
you'll get minus 890.3

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.590
kilojoules.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.090
Well, this tells us that this
is an exothermic reaction.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.490
That this side of the equation
has less energy in it-- you

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.450
could kind of think of it
that way-- is that side.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.450
So some energy must have
been released.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.400
We could even put here, you
know, plus e for energy.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.980
Let me write, plus some energy
is going to be released.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.750
So that's why it's exothermic.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.010
But our question is, is
this spontaneous?

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.100
So to figure out if it's
spontaneous, we also have to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.140
figure out our delta s.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.690
And to help figure out the
delta s I, ahead of time,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.090
looked up the standard
molar entropies for

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.130
each of these molecules.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.460
So for example, the standard--
I'll write it here in a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.710
different color.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.980
The standard-- you put a little
naught symbol there--

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.389
the standard molar entropy-- so
when we say standard, it's

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.039
at 298 degrees Kelvin.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.730
Actually, I shouldn't
say degrees Kelvin.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.680
It's at 298 Kelvin You don't
use the word degrees,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.440
necessarily, when you
talk about Kelvin.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.020
So it's at 298 Kelvin, which is
25 degrees Celsius, so it's

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.880
at room temperature.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.690
So that's why it's considered
standard temperature.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.700
So the standard entropy of
methane at room temperature is

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.980
equal to this number
right here.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.880
186 joules per Kelvin mole.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.320
So if I have 1 mole of methane,
I have 186 joules per

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.930
Kelvin of entropy.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.050
If I have 2 moles, I
multiply that by 2.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.780
If I have 3 moles, I
multiply that by 3.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.870
So the total change in entropy
of this reaction is the total

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.950
standard entropies of the
products minus the total

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.610
standard entropies
of the reactants.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.450
Just like what we did
with enthalpy.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:11.650
So that's going to be equal to
213.6 plus-- I have 2 moles of

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.190
water here.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.810
So it's plus 2 times-- let's
just write 70 there.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.090
69.9, almost 70.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.720
Plus 2 times 70, and then I
want to subtract out the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.920
entropy of the reactants, or
this side of the reaction.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:42.900
So the entropy of 1 mole of CH4
is 186 plus 2 times 205.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.430
So just eyeballing it already,
this number is close to this

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.220
number, but this number is much
larger than this number.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.620
Liquid water has a much
lower-- this is

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.650
liquid water's entropy.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.970
It has a much lower entropy
than oxygen gas.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.730
And that makes sense.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.150
Because liquid formed, there's
a lot fewer states.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.630
It all falls to the bottom of
the container, as opposed to

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.680
kind of taking the shape of
the room and expanding.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.600
So a gas is naturally going
to have much higher

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.230
entropy than a liquid.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.830
So just eyeballing it, we can
already see that our products

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.930
are going to have a lower
entropy than our reactants.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.400
So this is probably going
to be a negative number.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.430
But let's confirm that.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:30.610
So I have 200, 213.6 plus--
well, plus 140, right?

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.270
2 times 70.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.540
Plus 140 is equal to 353.6.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.930
So this is 353.6.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.580
And then from that, I'm going to
subtract out-- so 186 plus

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.790
2 times 205 is equal to 596.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.900
So minus 596, and what
is that equal to?

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:06.780
So we put the minus 596, and
then plus the 353.6, and we

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.910
have minus 242.4.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.220
So this is equal to minus 242.4
joules per Kelvin is our

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.820
delta s minus.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.800
So we lose that much entropy.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.020
And those units might not make
sense to you right now, and

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.780
actually you know these are
but of arbitrary units.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.750
But you can just say, hey, this
is getting more ordered.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.710
And it makes sense, because
we have a ton of gas.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.080
We have 3 separate molecules,
1 here and 2

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.230
molecules of oxygen.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.840
And then we go to 3 molecules
again, but the

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.310
water is now liquid.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.770
So it makes sense to me
that we lose entropy.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.330
There's fewer states
that the liquid,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.790
especially, can take on.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.650
But let's figure out whether
this reaction is spontaneous.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.440
So our delta g is equal
to our delta h.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.140
We're releasing energy,
so it's minus 890.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.510
I'll just get rid
of the decimals.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.490
We don't have to be
that precise.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.350
Minus our temperature.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.220
We're assuming that we're at
room temperature, or 298

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.340
degrees Kelvin.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.400
That's 28-- I should just
say, 298 Kelvin.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.590
I should get in the habit
of not saying

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.960
degrees when I say Kelvin.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.750
Which is 25 degrees Celsius,
times our change in entropy.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.050
Now, this is going
to be a minus.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.760
Now you might say, OK, minus
242, you might want to put

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.530
that there.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.280
But you have to be very,
very, very careful.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.160
This right here is
in kilojoules.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.190
This right here is in joules.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.540
So if we want to write
everything in kilojoules,

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.660
since we already wrote that
down, let's write this in

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.370
kilojoules.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.620
So it's 0.242 kilojoules
per Kelvin.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.790
And so now our Gibbs free energy
right here is going to

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.880
be minus 890 kilojoules minus
290-- so the minus and the

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.760
minus, you get a plus.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.770
And that makes sense, that the
entropy term is going to make

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.480
our Gibbs free energy
more positive.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.480
Which, as we know, since we want
to get this thing below

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.980
0, this is going to fight
the spontaneity.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.840
But let's see if it can
overwhelm the actual enthalpy,

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.470
the exothermic nature of it.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.480
And it seems like it will,
because you multiply a

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.010
fraction times this,
it's going to be a

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.090
smaller number than that.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.560
But let's just figure it out.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.830
So divided by 1, 2, 3.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:37.170
That's our change in entropy
times 298, that's our

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.410
temperature, is minus 72.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.710
So this term becomes-- and then
we put a minus there-- so

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.360
it's plus 72.2.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.300
So this is the entropy term
at standard temperature.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.370
It turns into that.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.970
And this is our enthalpy term.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.900
So we can already see that the
enthalpy is a much more

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.320
negative number than our
positive term from our

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.480
temperature times our
change in entropy.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.530
So this term is going
to win out.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.330
Even though we lose entropy in
this reaction, it releases so

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.840
much energy that's going
to be spontaneous.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.340
This is definitely less than
0, so this is going to be a

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.360
spontaneous reaction.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.520
As you can see, these Gibbs free
energy problems, they're

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.630
really not too difficult.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.900
You just really need to
find these values.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.230
And to find these values, it'll
either be given, the

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.670
delta h, but we know how to
solve for the delta h.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.720
You just look up the heats
of formations of all the

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.210
products, subtract out the
reactants, and of course you

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.110
wait by the coefficients.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.490
And then, to figure out the
change in entropy, you do the

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:40.909
same thing.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.020
You have to look up the standard
molar entropies of

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.840
the products' weight by the
coefficients, subtract out the

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.110
reactants, and then just
substitute in here, and then

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.850
you essentially have the
Gibbs free energy.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.640
And in this case,
it was negative.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.570
Now, you could imagine a
situation where we're at a

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.720
much higher temperature.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.890
Like the surface of the sun or
something, where all of a

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:06.380
sudden, instead of a 298 here,
if you had like a 2,000 or a

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.140
4,000 there.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.700
Then all of a sudden, things
become interesting.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.710
If you could imagine, if
you had a 40,000 Kelvin

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.530
temperature here, then all of a
sudden the entropy term, the

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.150
loss of entropy, is going
to matter a lot more.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.480
And so this term, this positive
term, is going to

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.870
outweigh this, and maybe it
wouldn't be spontaneous at a

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.960
very, very, very, very
high temperature.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.160
Another way to think about it.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.560
A reaction that generates heat
that lets out heat-- the heat

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.090
being released doesn't matter so
much when there's already a

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.980
lot of heat or kinetic energy
in the environment.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.920
If the temperature was high
enough, this reaction would

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.050
not be spontaneous, because
maybe then the entropy term

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.980
would win out.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.130
But anyway, I just wanted to do
this calculation for you to

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.360
show you that there's nothing
too abstract here.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.950
You can look up everything on
the web, and then figure out

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.320
if something is going
to be spontaneous.
