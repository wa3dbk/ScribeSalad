00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.930
So we started doing some
free-throw percentage

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.060
problems in the last
video, so let's continue.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.290
So the first time I said if
I had an 80% free-throw

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.000
percentage, what are my
chances of getting three

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.290
free throws in a row?

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.640
And I said, well,
it's 51.2% chance.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.020
Let's do another scenario, and
let's just assume that my

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.080
free-throw percentage
stays at 80%.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:29.050
And let's say that-- I don't
know-- let's say my team

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.320
is two points behind.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.519
I'm making this up on the fly,
so we're two points behind.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.360
No, let's say we're
one point behind.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.310
And I'm up at the free-throw
line, and I want to say, what

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.520
is the chance-- and let's say
I have three free throws.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.440
Someone fouled me when I
was shooting a 3-pointer.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.960
So we're one point behind,
there's one second left, and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.820
right when I was going to take
the winning free throw-- or

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.680
not the winning free throw.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.500
The winning 3-point
shot, someone fouls me.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.245
So I get three free throws.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.110
And once again, I have an
80% free-throw percentage.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.690
My actual percentage
is probably something

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.390
more like 20%.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.660
But anyway, I have
three free throws.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.980
So my question is, what are
our chances of winning?

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.730
What is the probability
of my team winning?

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.580
Not tying, winning.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.760
So in order to win--
well, actually let's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.950
do the tying first.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.320
So what's the
probability of tying?

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.840
How do you spell-- tying, OK.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.190
What's the probability
of a tie?

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.740
Well, the probability of a tie
is going to be equal to the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:17.600
probability of me getting
at least one free throw.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.870
You might say OK, that's the
probably of getting exactly 1

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.940
times the probability of
getting 2 out of 3 plus

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.360
the probability of
getting 3 out of 3.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.280
But like we saw in-- I think it
was either the last video or

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.820
the video before-- that is
identical equal to the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.590
probability or, let's see, 1
minus the probability of not

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.080
getting any free throws.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.950
The probability of getting at
least one is essentially the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.220
probability of me not
missing all three.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.600
Hopefully that
makes some sense.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.500
So let me erase all this stuff
that I did up on top, and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.440
we can to figure out the
answer to this problem.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.910
Let me erase all of
this, erase all that.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.630
Erase that.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.180
Let me erase this.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.160
We know I have an 80%
probability of making

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.230
any one shot.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.930
So if we go back to the
problem-- so this is my

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.740
free throw percentage.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.940
So what is the probability of
me not making any shots, not

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.850
making any of my free throws?

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.830
Well, my probability of not
making one free throw is 20%.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.920
20% chance of not making any
free throws, or not making

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.210
any-- say I take a shot, I have
a 20% of no basket, or not

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.290
making the free throw.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.310
So if I'm taking three shots,
the shot of I miss all three

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:11.000
is going to be equal to
20% times 20% times 20%.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.420
And that equals what?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.550
This 0.2 times 0.2
is 0.04 times 0.2.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.530
And then let's see.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.960
What's 0.04 times 0.2?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.790
Let's see, that'll be an 8
and I have 1, 2, 3 numbers

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.620
by the decimal place.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.870
It's 1, 2, 3.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.930
So 0.008.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.340
So I have a 0.008 chance of
missing all of the free throws.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.140
Or another way you could view
this is, is this is equal to--

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.940
a percentage is just this times
100 so there's 0.8% chance of

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.280
missing all of the free throws.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.120
Or another way of viewing this
is I have-- so what's my chance

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.420
of making at least one?

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.450
Well, it's going to
be 1 minus this.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.850
So what's 1 minus
0.-- this is a 0.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.370
0.008.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.320
Well it's 99.2%.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.470
Yeah, that's 99.2%.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.350
Or you could also
view it as 0.992.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.180
You take 1 minus this, you
get 0.992, which is the

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.720
same thing as 99.2% chance.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.620
So I have a 99.2% chance of
at least tying the game.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.230
So it's pretty high if you have
someone at the free-throw line

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.535
with a 80% free-throw
percentage and they

00:05:33.535 --> 00:05:34.300
have three shots.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.560
Now, what if I only
had two shots?

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.280
Let's say I got fouled when
I was thinking a 2-pointer

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.720
and I only have two shots.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.180
Well, in that case, in order to
tie the game I have to get at

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.120
least one, but I only
have two shots.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.830
So it would be 1 minus
the chances of me

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.660
missing both shots.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.090
What's the chances of
missing two shots?

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.000
Well, the chance of missing
two shots in a row-- it's 4%.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.430
20% times 20%.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:06.240
It's a 4% chance of missing
two shots, two in a row.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.400
So my probability of getting at
least one, assuming that I am

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.300
taking two shots, is going
to be 1 minus this.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:21.410
I have a 96% probability of at
least one shot if I take two.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.950
So that's also pretty high.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.170
And of course, what's
my probability if I

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.730
only have one shot?

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.560
Well, it's 80%.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.260
So hopefully that gives you a
little bit of framework next

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.580
time you watch basketball game
and you can pause your TiVo and

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.340
figure out the probability
when the person is making

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.470
that last clutch shot.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.950
And it could be an interesting
experiment for you.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.380
And actually, I was thinking,
an interesting scientific

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.280
experiment, or maybe a
high-school science project,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.980
people have a free-throw
percentage and that kind of

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.550
implies that every time someone
takes a free throw that those

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.090
are mutually exclusive events,
that they're independent of

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.630
the previous time like
we said with coins.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.140
But an interesting idea, you
know in basketball people

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.510
always say, he's hot now
or he has a streak.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.020
And so there is this notion and
I know I felt it, that there

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.950
are times that you're
probability increases or

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.370
decreases, and it tends to be
maybe dependent on whether you

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.020
made or missed your
previous shot.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.170
So one thing you might want
to-- this is, I think, a

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.430
legitimate science project-- is
to either get the data from

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.120
real NBA players and see if
they really are mutually

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.510
exclusive events.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.820
If the probability of making
the next shot or the next free

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.680
throw really is independent of
whether they made or missed

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.500
the previous one. or whether
it actually is dependent.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.320
Or if you don't have all the
data from the NBA or wherever,

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.250
although I suspect you could
find it, you could try it with

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.680
yourself and your friends.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.735
Or maybe since you want to
be unbiased, you'll do

00:07:43.735 --> 00:07:44.340
it with your friend.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.670
You'll see if the probability
of them making the next free

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.920
throw really is independent of
whether they made the last one.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.250
Actually, I think that could be
quite good and you can get

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.190
quite involved in the analysis.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.440
So let me finish this up
with another scenario.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.170
We talked about free throws, we
talked about flipping a coin,

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.050
and now I'll talk about dice
because that is really another

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.100
area where-- well, it's one
interesting and you'll probably

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.930
see some problems
on probability.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.430
So, in general, when you're
playing games involving dice

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.170
it's always interesting to say,
what's the probability if I

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.470
have two six-sided dice, what's
my probability of getting--

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.040
I don't know-- a
particular number.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.050
Let's say, what's the
probability of getting a 7?

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.210
So to think about that you have
to say, well, what has to

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.410
happen for the dice
for me to get a 7?

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.020
And I think here it
might be interesting to

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.680
draw a bit of a grid.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.660
So let's say that's my grid.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.340
Let me split it up into six.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:50.990
So let's see, that's splitting
it up into one, into two.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.785
Each of these maybe split
it up into three, so

00:08:52.785 --> 00:08:54.555
it would be like that.

00:08:54.555 --> 00:08:58.830
It won't be perfect, but close.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.335
Like that.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.160
Like that.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.840
And like that.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.150
And let me split it-- you'll
see what I'm doing in a second.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.990
Actually, I didn't
want to do that.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.560
That's good enough.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.420
Do this, this.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.560
I'm trying to make a 6-by-6.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.080
OK, and the reason why I'm
doing this is because let's

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.350
make this top axis, this
horizontal-- each of the

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.800
situations I can get on the
first dice, although I'm going

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.670
to roll them simultaneously,
although it doesn't matter if I

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.440
roll them simultaneously or one
after the other, or I roll one

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.890
dice one after the other.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:46.690
So this first dice I could get
1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.310
So this is dice one-- D1.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.820
And on the second dice,
I could get a 1, a 2,

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.410
a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.800
And this is dice two.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.170
And I'm running out of
time, so I will see

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.910
you in the next video.
