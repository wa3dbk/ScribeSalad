00:00:01.014 --> 00:00:04.350
Now that we've explored Stokes' Theorem a little bit, I want to talk about

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.448
the situations in wich we can use it. You'll see that this is pretty general

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:12.538
theorem. But we do have to thing about what type of surfaces

00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:16.602
and what type of boundary are those surfaces we are actually dealing with

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:19.834
and the case of Stokes', we need

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:23.017
surfaces that are piecewise...

00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:25.593
piecewise-smooth

00:00:26.608 --> 00:00:31.372
piecewise-smooth surfaces so this surface right over here

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:34.644
it is actually smooth not just even piecewise-smooth.

00:00:34.644 --> 00:00:39.856
Sounds like a very fancy term but all the smooth part means

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:42.332
that you have just continuous derivatives

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:45.334
and since we are talking about surfaces we're going to have continuous

00:00:45.334 --> 00:00:48.549
partial derivatives regardless of which direction you pick.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.510
So this is continuous derivatives,

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:56.114
and another way to think about that conceptually is if you pick a direction

00:00:56.114 --> 00:00:59.347
on the surface if you say that we go in that direction, the slope in that

00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:04.853
direction changes gradually, doesn't jump around. If you pick this direction right over here,

00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:08.957
the slope is changing gradually. So we have a continuous

00:01:08.957 --> 00:01:12.029
derivative. And you're like "what does the 'piecewise' means?"

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:14.779
Well, the piecewise actually allow us to use Stokes' Theorem with more surfaces.

00:01:14.872 --> 00:01:19.966
Because if you have a surface that looks like... Let's say a surface that looks like

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:24.219
this. Let's say looks like a cup. So this is the opening of the top of the cup

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.787
let's say that has no opening on top so we can see the backside of the cup

00:01:27.818 --> 00:01:31.319
and this is the side of the cup and this right over here is the bottom

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.665
of the cup and if it was transparent we could actually see through it. So

00:01:34.665 --> 00:01:38.892
surfaces like this is not entirely smooth because it has

00:01:38.892 --> 00:01:41.644
edges. There are points right over here. So this edge

00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:46.114
right over here... If we pick this... let's say if we pick this direction to go and if we go

00:01:46.114 --> 00:01:50.907
this direction along the bottom, then right we get to the edge, all of the sudden the slope changes dramatically

00:01:50.907 --> 00:01:54.808
jumps. So the slope is not continuous at that edge. The slope jumps

00:01:54.808 --> 00:01:58.995
and we start going straight up. And so this entire

00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:02.760
surface is not smooth. But the piecewise actually give us

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.296
an out. This tell us that it's okay as long as we can break

00:02:06.296 --> 00:02:09.655
the surfaces up into pieces that are smooth. And so

00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:13.780
this cup we can break it up but we were doing this wen tackling surfaces integrals

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.411
we can break it up into the bottom part, which is a smooth

00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:22.997
surface, it has continuous derivative, and the sides

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:24.788
which kind of wraps around is also

00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:29.292
is also a smooth surface

00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:32.610
so most things you'll encounter in a traditional calculus course

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.788
actually do, especially surfaces, do fit piecewise-smooth. And the thing is

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:41.079
though actually very hard to visualize. I imagine this all outer pointy

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.877
fractely looking things where it's hard to break it up into pieces that are

00:02:44.877 --> 00:02:49.127
actually smooth. That's for surface part but we also

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:53.138
have to care about the boundary, in order to apply Stokes' Theorem. And that is that

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:57.296
right over there. The boundary needs to be a simple,

00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:02.892
which means that doesn't cross itself, a simple closed

00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:04.843
piecewise-smooth boundary. So once

00:03:04.843 --> 00:03:08.461
again: simple and closed that just means so this is not a

00:03:08.461 --> 00:03:12.824
simple boundary. If it is really crossing itself or intersecting itself, although you can break it up

00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:16.629
into to tow simple boundaries. But something like this is a simple

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.596
boundary. So that is a simple boundary right over there. It also have to be closed

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:25.996
wich really means that just loops in on itself. You just have something like that. It actually has to

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:31.111
close and actually has to loops in on itself. In order to use Stokes' Theorem and once again

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:34.421
it has to be piecewise-smooth but now we are talking about a path or a

00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:39.039
line or curve like this and a piecewise-smooth just means that you can break it up

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.477
into sections were derivatives are continuous. The way I've drawm

00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:44.878
this one, this one and this one, the slope is changing gradually. So over there

00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:50.183
the slope is like that. It is changing gradually as we go around

00:03:50.183 --> 00:03:53.798
this path. Something that is not smooth, a path that is not

00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:56.176
smooth might look something like this.

00:03:56.176 --> 00:04:01.566
Might look something like that. And the places that this aren't smooth are

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:06.171
at the edges: not smooth there, not smooth there and not smooth there.

00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:09.634
But we have to be simple-closed and this is simple and closed. And it's not

00:04:09.634 --> 00:04:12.496
smooth but it is piecewise-smooth. We can break it up into

00:04:12.496 --> 00:04:17.445
this section of the path. Which is that line right over there is smooth,

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:21.532
that line over there is smooth, that line is smooth, and that line is

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:24.506
smooth. And we've done that when evaluating in line integrals. We broke it up into

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:28.174
smooth segments that we can then use to actually compute line

00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:33.328
integral. So if you find... if you have a boundary where the...

00:04:33.328 --> 00:04:36.861
if you have a surface that is piecewise-smooth and its

00:04:36.861 --> 00:04:40.732
boundary is a simple-closed piecewise-smooth

00:04:40.732 --> 99:59:59.999
boundary, you're good to go.
