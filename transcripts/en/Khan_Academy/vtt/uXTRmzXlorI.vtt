00:00:01.277 --> 00:00:11.382
Evaluate 0 plus y plus -7 when y is equal to -3 and y is equal to 0 and y is equal to 7.

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:17.647
So let's take the first situation where y is equal to -3...

00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:31.805
Then this expression right here would be... 0 plus -3 (because that's our "y" now) plus -7.

00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:36.647
Now 0 plus or minus anything won't change its value

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:39.375
So you can really just ignore the 0 here.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:50.994
This is going to be the same thing, this is going to be the exact same thing, as -3 plus -7.

00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:55.631
-3 plus -7

00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:58.827
Now we could draw a number line here, just to help us visualize it

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:02.084
But even if we didn't have the number line, we could say "Look, we're already 3 below zero...

00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:06.873
We're going to go another 7 to the left... another 7 more negative."

00:01:06.873 --> 00:01:11.007
So we're 3 away from zero, we're going to go 7 more away from zero

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:13.749
So we're going to be 10 to the left of zero, or -10.

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:15.389
Or another way to think of it...

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:18.726
Lemme draw the number line there (always better to have the visual).

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:21.270
So we're starting (this is zero)

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.239
We're starting at -3, and to that we're adding -7

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:29.675
So we're starting at -3, the absolute value is -3[sic]

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:33.460
is our starting point. To that we're adding another negative 7

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.226
We're going to move another 7 to the left.

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:40.447
So we're adding (let me draw this)... we're adding a negative 7 right over here

00:01:40.447 --> 00:01:43.081
We're adding a negative 7 right over here

00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:45.672
So what's the length of this over here?

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:50.397
The absolute value of -7 is equal to 7... that's the length of this arrow.

00:01:50.397 --> 00:01:53.461
But we're moving it to the left. The abolsute value of this

00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:59.699
arrow right here (the absolute value of negative 3) is 3.

00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:03.809
So we're already 3 to the left, now we're moving 7 more to left

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:06.804
So now we're going to be 10 to the left.

00:02:06.804 --> 00:02:09.730
We are going to be 10 to left.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.470
10 to the left.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.625
This is literally, this is equal to the absolute value of -7...

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:20.759
Let me do it in the order that we wrote it in the problem...

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:26.402
So this is equal to the absolute value of -3 (you'd want to use the same colors)

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:37.547
The absolute value of -3 plus the absolute value of -7.

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:44.328
But we're to the left of zero (we've been moving to the left) so it's the &lt;i&gt;negative&lt;/i&gt; of that

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:46.951
which is -10

00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.620
So if your signs are the same, you can just take the absolute value of them

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.490
say "ok, that's how far we're going to move, total. and we're that far from zero to the left"

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.956
So the answer here is -10

00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:01.348
That was when y is -3.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:04.250
Let's think about when y is equal to 0.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:14.003
When y is equal to 0, this expression up here becomes 0 plus 0 (our y here is going to be zero)...

00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:16.278
(We'll do it in that same blue color.)

00:03:16.278 --> 00:03:22.524
.... plus 0 plus -7.

00:03:22.524 --> 00:03:26.031
Now, if you add 0 to anything it's not going to change the value.

00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:30.690
So this thing over here, this is pretty straight-forward, these don't matter

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.649
It's just going to be equal to -7

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:37.044
Now let's do the last one (when y is equal to 7)

00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:49.645
It's going to be 0 plus (our y is equal to 7) so 0 plus 7 and then we have plus -7

00:03:49.645 --> 00:03:51.642
Now there's a couple of ways to do this...

00:03:51.642 --> 00:03:57.215
You could literally just say "now adding a negative number is equivalent to subtracting the number".

00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:01.905
You could say this is equivalent to 0 plus 7 minus 7

00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:05.180
Plus -7 is the same thing as subtracting a 7

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.288
The zero doesn't matter, so this is equal to 7 minus 7... which is equal to zero!

00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:12.169
Another way to think about it...

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.325
Let's draw a number line

00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:18.368
So let's say that this is zero

00:04:18.368 --> 00:04:27.378
We're starting off at 7. We're 7 to the right of zero.

00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:32.564
And to that we're adding a -7.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:36.550
So we're going to move 7 to the left of where we were.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.619
7 to the left of 7 which was 7 to the right of 0!

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:43.365
This gets us back to 0.

00:04:43.400 --> 99:59:59.999
So the answer is... zero.
