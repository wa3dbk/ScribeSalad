00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.460
We are asked which of these
lines are perpendicular.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.160
And it has to be perpendicular
to one of the other lines, you

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.680
can't be just perpendicular
by yourself.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.970
And perpendicular line, just
so you have a visualization

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.190
for what for perpendicular lines
look like, two lines are

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.930
perpendicular if they intersect
at right angles.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.630
So if this is one line right
there, a perpendicular line

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.850
will look like this.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.640
A perpendicular line will
intersect it, but it won't

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.110
just be any intersection,
it will

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.710
intersect at right angles.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.730
So these two lines are
perpendicular.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.570
Now, if two lines are
perpendicular, if the slope of

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.330
this orange line is m-- so let's
say its equation is y is

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.440
equal to mx plus, let's say
it's b 1, so it's some

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.000
y-intercept-- then the equation
of this yellow line,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.360
its slope is going to be the
negative inverse of this guy.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.690
This guy right here is going to
be y is equal to negative 1

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.950
over mx plus some other
y-intercept.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.230
Or another way to think about
it is if two lines are

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.550
perpendicular, the product of
their slopes is going to be

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.760
negative 1.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.440
And so you could write that
there. m times negative 1 over

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.570
m, that's going to be-- these
two guys are going to cancel

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.380
out-- that's going to be
equal to negative 1.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.200
So let's figure out the slopes
of each of these lines and

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.090
figure out if any of them are
the negative inverse of any of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.060
the other ones.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.660
So line A, the slope is pretty
easy to figure out, it's

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.850
already in slope-intercept
form, its slope is 3.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.070
So line A has a slope of 3.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.970
Line B, it's in standard form,
not too hard to put it in

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.920
slope-intercept form, so
let's try to do it.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.950
So let's do line B over here.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.640
Line B, we have x plus 3y
is equal to negative 21.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.630
Let's subtract x from both sides
so that it ends up on

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.500
the right-hand side.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.000
So we end up with 3y is equal
to negative x minus 21.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.070
And now let's divide both sides
of this equation by 3

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.850
and we get y is equal to
negative 1/3 x minus 7.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.050
So this character's slope
is negative 1/3.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.660
So here m is equal
to negative 1/3.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.080
So we already see they
are the negative

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.910
inverse of each other.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.970
You take the inverse of 3, it's
1/3, and then it's the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.820
negative of that.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.870
Or you take the inverse of
negative 1/3, it's negative 3,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.730
and then this is the
negative of that.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.820
So these two lines are
definitely perpendicular.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.320
Let's see the third
line over here.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.160
So line C is 3x plus
y is equal to 10.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.960
If we subtract 3x from both
sides, we get y is equal to

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.850
negative 3x plus 10.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.480
So our slope in this
case is negative 3.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.020
Now this guy's the negative of
that guy, this guy's slope is

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.560
a negative, but not the negative
inverse, so it's not

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.600
perpendicular.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.370
And this guy is the inverse of
that guy but not the negative

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.280
inverse, so this guy is not
perpendicular to either of the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.390
other two, but line
A and line B are

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.170
perpendicular to each other.
