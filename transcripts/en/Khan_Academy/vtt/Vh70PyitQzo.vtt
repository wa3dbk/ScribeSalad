00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.700
We've talked a lot about convex lenses,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.680
so I thought I would do a quick video on concave lenses,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.440
although there aren't as many combinations

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.000
of what a concave lens can do.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.930
So just remember,

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.050
concave has the word 'cave' in it

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.410
so I always imagine that it's kind of caving inwards

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.940
caving inwards

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.770
It's a little bit of an exaggerated drawing

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.590
but you get the general idea

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.990
this is a concave lens right over here

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.440
and let me draw its principal axis

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.480
so this is its principal axis

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.060
shouldn't curve at the beginning

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.240
just redraw it, so that's its principal axis

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.710
and let me draw the two focal points

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.400
let me draw one over here on the left side

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.810
and then an equal distance focal distance on the right side

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.370
and I'm assuming that the two surfaces are both concave

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.850
and they are symmetric over here

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.630
Just an assumption I'm making

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.440
Now lets think about what's gonna happen

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.000
if I put an object some place

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.060
on the left side of this concave lens

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.960
So I can put it, let me just stick it anywhere

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.400
So let me just stick it right over there

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.980
So, if I do and like always,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.500
we will do our two rays but with a concave lens,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.030
I'm only gonna do two rays

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.000
one that is parallel to the principal axis

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.020
and then I'm gonna do one that does not get diffracted

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020
so it goes right through the center of the lens

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.040
and let's think about what happens.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.460
So, if we go parallel, to the principal axis,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.380
this will get diffracted away, since it's coming in parallel

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.370
and it will get diffracted outwards

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.960
so that it looks like it's coming from this focus.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.370
So it will get diffracted in a way

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.070
so it looks like its coming from that focus

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.000
So its getting diverged outwards

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Let me draw another point or another ray, I should say

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.030
I will do that in yellow

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.260
and this will just gonna straight

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.690
through the centre of the lens and not get diffracted

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.000
So its just gonna go straight through the lens

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.780
and not get diffracted

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.170
So what will the image be here?

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.880
Well clearly, these two rays don't converge

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.490
so we won't have a real image

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.740
but they do both look like they are diverging from someplace

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.960
and they look like they are diverging from right over there

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.700
so look to an observer out here

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.790
if their eyeball is right over there

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.390
I could draw their nose, just make it clear where the eye is

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.670
If they look at from this side,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.100
they are going to see a virtual image of the image right over here

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.050
Just like that

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.010
So you're actually gonna see is a virtual image of the object

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.130
that is not inverted and it's gonna be smaller

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.250
its gonna look like it's closer to the lens than it really is

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.160
Anyway, that's all it really is to know,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.400
obviously there's a lot you can know about anything.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.580
but that's the general gist about the concave lenses
