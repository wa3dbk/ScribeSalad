00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.830
Find the difference.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.290
Express the answer as a
simplified rational

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.890
expression, and state
the domain.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.930
We have two rational
expressions, and we're

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.710
subtracting one from
the other.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.910
Just like when we first learned
to subtract fractions,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.200
or add fractions, we have to
find a common denominator.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.080
The best way to find a common
denominator, if were just

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.330
dealing with regular numbers, or
with algebraic expressions,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.780
is to factor them out, and
make sure that our common

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.515
denominator has all of the
factors in it-- that'll ensure

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:30.970
that it's divisible by the
two denominators here.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.759
This guy right here is
completely factored-- he's

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.250
just a plus 2.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.610
This one over here, let's see if
we can factor it: a squared

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.440
plus 4a plus 4.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.070
Well, you see the pattern that
4 is 2 squared, 4 is 2 times

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.890
2, so a squared plus 4a plus 4
is a plus 2 times a plus 2, or

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.790
a plus 2 squared.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.870
We could say it's a plus 2 times
a plus 2-- that's what a

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.560
squared plus 4a plus 4 is.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.990
This is obviously divisible
by itself-- everything is

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.280
divisible by itself, except, I
guess, for 0, is divisible by

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.040
itself, and it's also divisible
by a plus 2, so this

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.210
is the least common multiple of
this expression, and that

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.480
expression, and it could be
a good common denominator.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.070
Let's set that up.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.530
This will be the same thing as
being equal to this first term

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.480
right here, a minus 2 over
a plus 2, but we want the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.935
denominator now to be a plus 2
times a plus 2-- we wanted it

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:31.620
to be a plus 2 squared.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.530
So, let's multiply this
numerator and denominator by a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.510
plus 2, so its denominator is
the same thing as this.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.450
Let's multiply both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.750
by a plus 2.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.445
We're going to assume that a
is not equal to negative 2,

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:48.270
that would have made this
undefined, and it would have

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.970
also made this undefined.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.950
Throughout this whole thing,
we're going to assume that a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.800
cannot be equal to negative 2.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.360
The domain is all real numbers,
a can be any real

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.120
number except for negative 2.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.780
So, the first term is that--
extend the line a little bit--

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.390
and then the second term doesn't
change, because its

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.340
denominator is already the
common denominator.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.230
Minus a minus 3 over-- and we
could write it either as a

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.660
plus 2 times a plus 2, or
as this thing over here.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.040
Let's write it in the factored
form, because it'll make it

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.820
easier to simplify later on:
a plus 2 times a plus 2.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.400
And now, before we-- let's set
this up like this-- now,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.890
before we add the numerators,
it'll probably be a good idea

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.410
to multiply this out right
there, but let me write the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.050
denominator, we know what
that is: it is a plus 2

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.240
times a plus 2.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.890
Now this numerator: if we have
a minus 2 times a plus 2,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.000
we've seen that pattern
before.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.540
We can multiply it out if you
like, but we've seen it enough

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960
hopefully to recognize that this
is going to be a squared

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.370
minus 2 squared.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.880
This is going to be
a squared minus 4.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.250
You can multiply it out, and the
middle terms cancel out--

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.850
the negative 2 times a cancels
out the a times 2, and you're

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.230
just left with a squared minus
4-- that's that over there.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.330
And then you have this: you have
minus a minus 3, so let's

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.440
be very careful here-- you're
subtracting a minus 3, so you

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.630
want to distribute the negative
sign, or multiply

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.860
both of these terms
times negative 1.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.760
So you could put a minus a here,
and then negative 3 is

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.530
plus 3, so what does
this simplify to?

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:33.050
You have a squared minus a
plus-- let's see, negative 4

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:42.220
plus 3 is negative 1, all
of that over a plus 2

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.080
times a plus 2.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.285
We could write that as
a plus 2 squared.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.230
Now, we might want to factor
this numerator out more, to

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.760
just make sure it doesn't
contain a common factor with

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.450
the denominator.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.200
The denominator is just 2a
plus 2 is multiplied by

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.040
themselves.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.230
And you can see from inspection
a plus 2 will not

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.600
be a factor in this top
expression-- if it was, this

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.490
number right here would be
divisible by 2, it's not

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.260
divisible by 2.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.780
So, a plus 2 is not one of the
factors here, so there's not

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.910
going to be any more
simplification, even if we

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.019
were able to factor this thing,
and the numerator out.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:20.250
So

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.010
we're done.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.720
We have simplified the rational
expression, and the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.960
domain is for all a's, except
for a cannot, or, all a's

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.950
given that a does not equal
negative 2-- all a's except

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.330
for negative 2.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.210
And we are done.
