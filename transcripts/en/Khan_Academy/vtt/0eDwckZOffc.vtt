00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.040
Let's do a couple of examples
dealing with angles between

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.800
parallel lines and
transversals.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.430
So let's say that these two
lines are a parallel, so I can

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.680
a label them as being parallel.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.120
That tells us that they will
never intersect; that they're

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.830
sitting in the same plane.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.690
And let's say I have a
transversal right here, which

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.810
is just a line that will
intersect both of those

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.930
parallel lines, and I were to
tell you that this angle right

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:39.110
there is 60 degrees and then I
were to ask you what is this

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.790
angle right over there?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.790
You might say, oh, that's
very difficult; that's

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.540
on a different line.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.160
But you just have to remember,
and the one thing I always

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.480
remember, is that corresponding
angles are always equivalent.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.020
And so if you look at this
angle up here on this top line

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.110
where the transversal
intersects the top line, what

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.130
is the corresponding angle to
where the transversal

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.140
intersects this bottom line?

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.810
Well this is kind of the bottom
right angle; you could see

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.870
that there's one, two,
three, four angles.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.800
So this is on the bottom
and kind of to the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.320
right a little bit.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.880
Or maybe you could kind of view
it as the southeast angle

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.560
if we're thinking in
directions that way.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.930
And so the corresponding
angle is right over here.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.300
And they're going
to be equivalent.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.910
So this right here
is 60 degrees.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.950
Now if this angle is 60
degrees, what is the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.570
question mark angle?

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.910
Well the question mark angle--
let's call it x --the question

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.780
mark angle plus the 60 degree
angle, they go halfway

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.690
around the circle.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.290
They are supplementary; They
will add up to 180 degrees.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.460
So we could write x plus
60 degrees is equal

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.300
to 180 degrees.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.760
And if you subtract 60 from
both sides of this equation you

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.515
get x is equal to 120 degrees.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.030
And you could keep going.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.080
You could actually figure out
every angle formed between

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.140
the transversals and
the parallel lines.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.390
If this is 120 degrees,
then the angle opposite to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.270
it is also 120 degrees.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.580
If this angle is 60 degrees,
then this one right here

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.600
is also 60 degrees.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.190
If this is 60, then its
opposite angle is 60 degrees.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.380
And then you could either say
that, hey, this has to be

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.800
supplementary to either this
60 degree or this 60 degree.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.030
Or you could say that this
angle corresponds to this 120

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.350
degrees, so it is also 120, and
make the same exact argument.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.790
This angle is the same
as this angle, so it

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.950
is also 120 degrees.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.460
Let's do another one.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.660
Let's say I have two lines.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.790
So that's one line.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.270
Let me do that in purple and
let me do the other line in a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.660
different shade of purple.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.590
Let me darken that other
one a little bit more.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.030
So you have that purple
line and the other one

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.860
that's another line.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.660
That's blue or
something like that.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.200
And then I have a line that
intersects both of them; we

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.305
draw that a little
bit straighter.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:25.080
And let's say that this angle
right here is 50 degrees.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.730
And let's say that I were also
to tell you that this angle

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.230
right here is 120 degrees.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.450
Now the question I want to
ask here is, are these

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.220
two lines parallel?

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.230
Is this magenta line and
this blue line parallel?

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.420
So the way to think about is
what would have happened

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.960
if they were parallel?

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.840
If they were parallel, then
this and this would be

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.070
corresponding angles, and so
then this would be 50 degrees.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.530
This would have to
be 50 degrees.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.390
We don't know, so maybe I
should put a little asterisk

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.490
there to say, we're not sure
whether that's 50 degrees.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.090
Maybe put a question mark.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.810
This would be 50 degrees if
they were parallel, but this

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.020
and this would have to be
supplementary; they would have

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.790
to add up to 180 degrees.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.900
Actually, regardless of whether
the lines are parallel, if I

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.380
just take any line and I have
something intersecting, if this

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.890
angle is 50 and whatever this
angle would be, they would have

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.230
to add up to 180 degrees.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.200
But we see right here that this
will not add up to 180 degrees.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.000
50 plus 120 adds up to 170.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.910
So these lines aren't parallel.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.760
Another way you could have
thought about it-- I guess this

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.800
would have maybe been a more
exact way to think about it

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.490
--is if this is 120 degrees,
this angle right here has to be

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.420
supplementary to that; it
has to add up to 180.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.290
So this angle-- do it in this
screen --this angle right

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.940
here has to be 60 degrees.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.010
Now this angle corresponds
to that angle, but

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.930
they're not equal.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.530
The corresponding angles
are not equal, so these

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:13.810
lines are not parallel.
