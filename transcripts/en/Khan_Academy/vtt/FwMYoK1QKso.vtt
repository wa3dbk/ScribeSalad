00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.060
We're asked to compare
156.378 to 156.348.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.550
So I assume that they're asking
us which of these is greater.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.430
And so let's rewrite
these numbers.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:23.960
156.378, and we want to
compare that to 156.348.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.650
And it might already
be obvious to you

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.733
which of these is greater.

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.710
But I'll work through
it step-by-step, just

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.330
in case it's not.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.629
So let's first go to
the hundreds place.

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.420
And you could view this
as, to some degree,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.760
the most significant
place, because this

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.690
is where they have the largest--
the 1 in the hundreds place

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.019
represents a lot more than
a 1 in the tens place or a 1

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:43.810
in the six's place.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.010
A 1 in the hundreds
place represents 100.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.730
It's this many hundreds.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.570
But we have the same number of
hundreds in both situations.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.140
We have 1 hundred and
we have 1 hundred.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.740
Let's go to the tens place.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.040
We have 5 tens
here, which is 50.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.610
And we have 50 right over here.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.380
So, so far they're
equal, so far,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.670
if you just look at the
hundreds and the tens place.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.880
Let's go the ones place.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240
We have a 6 here in
the ones place, 6 ones,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.720
which is really just 6.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.140
And you also have 6 ones.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.460
So, so far, they're equal again.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.850
Let's go to the tenths
place-- 3 tenths, 3 tenths.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.280
Let's go to the
hundredths place.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.090
So we're going into
smaller and smaller places.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.400
So then you have
the 7 hundredths.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.100
And now we have 4
hundredths here.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.399
So this has less hundredths
than this does over here.

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.690
And if we go to the thousandths
place, these are equal.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.773
But it doesn't matter,
even if these were unequal.

00:01:35.773 --> 00:01:39.110
It doesn't matter, even if this
one was larger than this one,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.150
because in the more
significant place,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.770
this number was larger
than this number.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.120
So 7 is greater than 4.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.550
We have 7 hundredths here.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.080
We have 4 hundredths here.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.860
So we get this number is greater
than this number down here.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:02.950
Or 156.378 is
greater than 156.348.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.167
And in particular, it's because
of the hundredths place.
