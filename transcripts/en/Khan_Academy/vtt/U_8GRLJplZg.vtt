00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.040
Welcome back.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.460
So where we left off in the
last video, I'd shown you

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.020
this thing called the
geometric series.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.810
And, you know, we could
have some base a.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.620
It could be any number.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.800
It could be 1/2,
it could be 10.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.870
But that's just--
but some number.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.770
And we keep taking it to
increasing exponents, and we

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.740
sum them up, and this is
called a geometric series.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.810
And so I want to figure out the
sum of a geometric series of,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.940
you know, when I have some base
a, and I go up to some

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.440
number a to the n.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.520
What-- is this a to
the-- why did I write

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.690
a to n minus 2 there?

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.390
That should be a to the big N.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.510
My brain must have been
malfunctioning in

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.930
the previous video.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.520
That always happens when I
start running out of time.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.740
But anyway.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.490
Let's go back to this.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.170
So I defined s as
this geometric sum.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.160
Now I'm going to
define another sum.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.170
And that sum I'm going
to define as a times s.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.970
And that equals-- well, that's
just going to be a times

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.110
this exact sum, right?

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.540
And that's the same
a as this a, right?

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.400
That a is the same as this a.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.620
So what's a times
this whole thing?

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.350
Well, it's the a times a
to the zero is-- let me

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.370
write it down for you.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.610
So this'll be a because I just
distribute the a, right? a

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.460
times a to the zero, plus a
times a to the 1, plus a times

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.880
a squared, plus all the way a
times a to the n minus one,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.260
plus a times a to the n.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
I just took an a and I
distributed it along

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.540
this whole sum.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.200
But what is this equal to?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.810
Well, this is equal to
a times a to the zero.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.220
That's a one-- a to the first
power-- plus a squared, plus a

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.420
cubed, plus a to the n, right?

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.770
Because you just add the
exponents, a to the n.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.600
Plus a to the n plus 1.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.800
So this is as.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.450
And we saw before that s
is just our original sum.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.950
That is just a to the zero,
plus a to the 1, plus a

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.380
squared, plus up, up, up, up.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.120
All the way to plus
a to the n, right?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.680
So let me ask you a question.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.980
What happens if I
subtract this from that?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.120
What happens?

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.840
If I say, as minus s.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.980
Well, I subtracted this from
here, on the left hand side.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.032
What happens on the
right hand side?

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:50.120
Well, all of these
become negative, right?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.770
Let me do it in a bold color.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.240
This becomes-- because I'm
subtracting-- negative,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.740
negative, these are
all negatives.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.250
Negative.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.480
Negative.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.270
Well, a to the first,
minus a to the first.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.735
That crosses out. a squared
minus a squared crosses

00:03:02.735 --> 00:03:04.530
out. a to the third,
it'll all cross out.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.970
All the way up to a
to the n, right?

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.920
So what are we left with?

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.920
We're just left with minus
a to the zero, right?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.600
We're just left with that term.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.400
And we're just left
with that term.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.225
Plus a to the n plus 1.

00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:20.800
And of course, what's
a to the zero?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.240
That's just 1.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:32.240
So we have a times s
minus s is equal to a to

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.110
the n plus 1 minus 1.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.850
And now let's
distribute the s out.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.180
So we get s times a minus
1 is equal to a to the n

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.950
plus 1 minus 1, right?

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.500
And then what do we get?

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.600
Well, we can just divide
both sides by a minus 1.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.820
Let me erase some of
this stuff on top.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.700
I think I can safely erase
all of this, really.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.870
Well, I don't want
to erase that much.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.240
I want to erase this stuff.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.360
That's good enough.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.890
OK.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:24.150
So I have just-- dividing both
sides of this equation by a

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.520
minus 1, I get s is equal to a
to the n plus 1 minus

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.560
1 over a minus 1.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.280
So where did that get us?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.270
We defined the geometric
series as equal to the sum.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.700
From k is equal to 0,
to n of a to the k.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.170
And now we've just derived
a formula for what that

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.770
sum ends up being.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.990
Equals a to the n plus 1
minus 1 over a minus 1.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.600
And why is this useful?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.940
We now know, if I were to say,
well, what is-- let me clean

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.490
up all of this, as well.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.400
Let me clean up all of
this and we can-- OK.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.260
So if I said, you figure out
the sum of, I don't know, the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.277
powers of 3 up to 3 to the, I
don't know, 3 to

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:29.550
the tenth power.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.760
So, you know, 3.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.170
So 3 to the zero, plus 3 to the
one, plus 3 squared, plus all

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.280
the way to 3 to the tenth.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.800
So this is the same thing as
the sum of k equals zero

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.660
to 10, of 3 to the k.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.520
Right?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.080
So this formula we just figured
out, a is 3 and n is 10.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.620
So this sum is just going to be
equal to 3 to the eleventh

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.480
power minus 1 over 3 minus 1.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.140
Which equals-- well, I
don't know what 3 to

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.420
the eleventh power is.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.350
Minus 1 over 2.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.130
So that's kind of useful.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.050
That is a number.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.460
Although you'd have to memorize
your exponent tables to the

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.550
eleventh power to do that.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.880
But I think you get the idea.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.710
This is especially useful if we
were dealing with-- well, if

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.000
the base was a power of ten,
it would be very, very easy.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.260
But what I actually want to do
now is I want to take this and

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.510
say, well, what happens
if n goes to infinity?

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.270
Let me show you.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.440
So what happens?

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.350
So there's two types of series
that we can take-- that's

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.750
not what I wanted to do.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.250
There are two types of series
that we can take that we

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.450
can find the sums of.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.220
There's finite series,
and infinite series.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.310
And in order for an infinite
series to come up to a sum

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.950
that's not infinity, they
need to-- what we say--

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.150
they need to converge.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.870
And if you think about what has
to happen for them to converge,

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.520
every next digit has to
essentially get smaller and

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.260
smaller and smaller, as
we go towards infinity.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.910
So let's say that
a is a fraction.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.700
a is 1/2.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.870
So how does a geometric series
look like if we have 1/2 there?

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.650
So let's say that we're taking
the geometric series from k

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.910
is equal to 0 to infinity.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.160
So this is neat.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.890
We're going to take an infinite
sum, an infinite number of

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.380
terms, and let's see if we can
actually get an actual number.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.950
You know, we take an infinite
thing, add it up, and it

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.200
actually adds up to
a finite thing.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.990
This has always amazed me.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.130
And the base now is
going to be 1/2.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.410
It's 1/2 and it's going to
be 1/2 to the k power.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:45.770
So this is going to be what?

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.220
1/2 to the zero, plus 1/2,
plus-- what's 1/2 squared?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.860
Plus 1/4, plus 1/8, plus 1/16.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.680
So as you see, each term is
getting a lot, lot smaller.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.900
It's getting half of
the previous term.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.800
Well, let's say, what happens
if this wasn't infinity?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.880
What happens if this was n?

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.480
Well, then we'd get plus 1
over 2 to the n, right?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.140
1/2 to the n is the same
thing as 1 over 2 to the n.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.080
And if we look at the formula
we figured out, we would say,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:26.340
well, that is just equal to
1/2 to the n plus 1, minus

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:32.960
1, over 1/2 minus one.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.850
And that would be our answer.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.550
We'd have to know what n is.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.280
But now we want to know what
happens if we go to infinity.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.140
So this is essentially
a limit problem.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.740
What happens-- what's the
limit, as n goes to infinity,

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:52.980
of 1/2 to the n plus one
minus 1 over 1/2 minus 1?

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.330
Well, all of these are constant
terms, so nothing happens.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.140
So what happens as this term,
right here, goes to infinity?

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.220
What's 1/2 to the
infinity power?

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.000
Well, that's zero.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.590
That's an unbelievably
small number.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.790
Take 1/2 to arbitrarily large
exponents, this just goes to 0.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.270
And so what are we left with?

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:16.060
We're just left with this
equals minus 1 over 1/2 minus

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.275
1, or we could multiply the top
and the bottom by negative 1.

00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:22.212
And we get 1 over 1 minus 1/2.

00:09:22.212 --> 00:09:27.320
Which equals 1 over 1/2,
which is equal to 2.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.810
I find that amazing.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:34.090
If I add 0 plus 1/2 plus 1/4
plus 1/8 plus 1/16 and I never

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.410
stop-- I go to infinity-- and
not infinity, but I go to 1

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.330
over essentially 2 to the
infinity-- I end up with

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.080
this neat and clean number.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.530
2.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.350
And this might be a little
project for you, to actually

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.070
draw it out into like maybe a
pie and see what happens as

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.310
you keep adding smaller and
smaller pieces to the pie.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.550
But it never ceases to amaze
me, that I added an infinite

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.520
number of terms, right?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.390
This was infinity.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.530
And I got a finite number.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.930
I got a finite number.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.630
Anyway, we ran out of time.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.132
See you soon.
