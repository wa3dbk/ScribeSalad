00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.370
A suspension bridge has two
towers that rise 500 feet

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.390
above the road and are connected
by cables that hang

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.410
in the shape of a parabola that
can be represented by y

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:19.990
is equal to 1/8,960 times x
minus 2,100 squared plus 8,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.200
where x and y are measured in
feet and x is the distance

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.450
from the left tower in the
direction of the right tower.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.980
What is the distance between
the two towers?

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.330
Let's draw ourselves
a diagram.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.130
If we draw the leftmost
tower-- I'm

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.640
going to do it in orange.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.960
So we have the left
tower right here.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.510
That tower is at x
is equal to 0.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.490
We'll call that x is equal to 0,
or maybe just call that the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.480
0 point right there.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.940
Then x is just measuring the
distance from that leftmost

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.600
tower to the rightmost tower, so
the rightmost tower in the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.060
direction of the right tower.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.145
This right here, maybe
the right tower

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:05.099
is right over here.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.680
They're both 500 feet high.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.510
The right tower is right over
there, and we don't

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.240
know where it is.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.930
That's we have to figure out.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.880
We have to figure out the
distance between the two, but

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.650
we just need to know that x is
measuring this distance.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.810
It's measuring the distance
from the left tower in the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.050
direction of the right tower, so
it's just traditional, just

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.540
like our coordinate plane.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.020
That is what x is measuring.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.560
If you say x is equal to a
million feet, you're going to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.190
get something way beyond
that second tower.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.910
If you say x is one foot, you're
going to get something

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.840
in the direction of the second
tower from the left tower.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.840
So that's x, and then y, we can
assume is the height of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.680
the towers, or is just the
height in general that we're

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.830
dealing with.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.860
This is the y-axis, so we're
just dealing in the first

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.470
quadrant of the coordinate
plane, and that is y.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.220
They're telling us that this
parabola, the shape of the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.350
parabola, can be represented--
or even better, they're saying

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.320
that the cable that connects
these two is in

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.420
the shape of a parabola.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.690
Let me draw that parabola
right there.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.550
They're the same height, so
the parabola will look

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.800
something like this.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.840
What we can do to figure out,
or one possible technique--

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.530
let me draw a better
parabola there.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.290
That's even worse.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.200
That's about as good
as I can do.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.320
One technique for finding the
distance between the two is if

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.040
we could figure out the
minimum point of this

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.920
parabola, which is also going
to be the vertex of that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.970
parabola, that's going
to be halfway

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.940
between the two towers.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.090
If we can figure out this
x-coordinate, we can say

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.450
that's going to be halfway
between the two towers and

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.170
then just multiply by two.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.960
Let's see if we can figure out
this minimum point, because

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.450
the parabola is symmetric around
it, and these are both

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.830
at the same height.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.530
Let's see if we can figure
out that minimum point.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.920
Let me rewrite this equation: We
have y is equal to 1/8,960

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.070
times x minus 2,100
squared plus 8.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.280
How do we find the minimum
point here?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.460
This whole expression that's
squared, this whole expression

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.180
is always going to be positive,
or it's actually

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.770
always going to be
non-negative.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.010
It could be equal to 0, and so
this whole thing is always

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.920
going to be greater than
or equal to 0.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.520
This whole thing I'm squaring
off in orange is always going

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.440
to be greater than
or equal to 0.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.540
So what is the lowest value
that y can take on?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.200
The lowest valued that y can
take on will happen when this

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.930
expression is equal to 0, and
this expression equals 0 only

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.670
when x minus 2,100 squared
is equal to 0.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.820
That's only going to be equal
to 0 when x minus 2,100 is

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.290
equal to 0, so x-- let me write
it this way-- equals 0,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.650
and I'm just talking about
this orange part-- when x

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.650
minus 2,100 is equal to 0, or
if you add 2,100 to both

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.890
sides, or x is equal to 2,100.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.180
When x is equal to 2,100, just
out of curiosity, what is y?

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.350
If x is 2,100, this thing is 0
times 0, and y is just going

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.900
to be equal to that 8 there.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.460
So this coordinate right here
is the coordinate x is equal

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.630
to 2,100, y is equal to 8, and
it's going to be halfway

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.070
between our two towers.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.630
If this is at 2,100, how
far is this tower away?

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.350
Well, it's going to
be twice 2,100.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.920
It's going to be 4,200,
and everything we're

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.720
dealing with is feet.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.630
It's going to be 4,200 feet away
from that first tower.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.160
So the distance between the
two towers is 4,200 feet.
