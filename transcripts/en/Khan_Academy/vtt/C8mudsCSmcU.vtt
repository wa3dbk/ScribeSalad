00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.030
Welcome to the video on
the introduction to

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.020
differential equations.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.200
What's a differential?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.700
Well, we've been doing things
like if I said that y is

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.900
equal to, I don't know, 3x.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.497
If we took the derivative of
both sides of this equation and

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:18.720
we said -- one of the notations
we used is we said dy

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.620
over dx is equal to 3.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.830
We took the derivative
of both sides of that.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.460
But this you could almost
use differential notation.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.640
dy is a differential and
dx is a differential.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.730
What does a differential mean?

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.170
A differential just means an
infinitely small change in y,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.140
in this case, so that's a
differential in y, or an

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.330
infinitely small change in x.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.570
So a differential it's like a
difference -- when we learned

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.340
slope, we said slope is change
in y over change in x.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.950
Or you could say the difference
in y over difference in x.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.100
But once we started taking the
slope of curves we had to make

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.130
this difference and this
difference approach 0.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.800
That's what a differential
essentially is.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.900
A differential is a really,
really, really, really

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.810
infinitely small difference.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.910
So what is a
differential equation?

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.680
Well it's an equation that
involves differentials.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.460
So, for example, this is
a differential equation.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.070
This will be the first
example that we solve.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.790
dy over dx is equal
to x squared plus 1.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.520
So how do we solve this
differential equation?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.750
Well, there's a couple of
ways you could say it.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.030
You say oh, well this is the
same thing as f prime of x.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.860
You know, y to the function
of x and you just take the

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.530
antiderivative of both sides.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.700
But let's solve this properly
as a differential equation.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.330
So you can actually manipulate
these differentials the same

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.780
way that you would manipulate
numbers for the most part.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.030
And so what could we do here?

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.840
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by dx.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.510
So you get, for a very small
change in y, dy, you get x

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.550
squared plus 1 times a very
small change in the x.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.500
Or another way to say it is for
a very small change in x, if

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.330
you want to figure out how much
does y change, you multiply

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.760
times x squared plus 1 wherever
you are on the curve.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.190
So what does that do for us?

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.240
Well let's take the
antiderivative of both

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.810
sides or let's take the
integral of both sides.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.890
And if you watched all of the
videos on integration and the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.590
definite integral and area and
a curve, you realize that an

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.950
integral is essentially a sum,
it's kind of an infinite

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.400
sum of a bunch of these
infinitely small dy's.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.020
So if you take the sum of
all of the changes in dy's,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.070
you're left with a y on
this side of this equation.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.620
You might want to re-watch
all the videos that we

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.010
did on integration.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.760
Then what is this?

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.670
This is essentially just
-- this is the indefinite

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.230
integral of x squared plus 1.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.020
So it's the
antiderivative of that.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.510
And what's the antiderivative
of x squared plus 1?

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.500
Well it's x to the
third over 3.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.690
We're just taking the
derivative backwards.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.690
And once again, watch the
videos on the antiderivative.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.030
There's I think eight
or nine of them.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.120
Plus x and then plus c.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.890
And where does the c come from?

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.760
Well we know that when we
take the derivative of a

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.590
constant it goes to 0.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.540
So when you take the
antiderivative, we're like

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.140
well, there could have
been a constant there.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.290
And that's where that
plus c comes from.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.530
So this is the general solution
to this differential equation.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.770
And that's something
interesting.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.910
So with traditional equations,
the solution tended to

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.680
be a number, right?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.920
If I just told you y is
equal to 2y minus 1.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.820
Then you would get minus y
is equal to minus 1, you'd

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.380
get y is equal to 1.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.390
So this is a traditional
equation and your solution

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.360
was just a value -- you
solved for the variable.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.370
Differential equations
are something different.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.690
The solution is
actually a function.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.470
You're saying what
function satisfies this

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.380
differential equation.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.910
So that's something
to keep in mind.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.670
Right now we're doing very
basic differential equations,

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.490
but that's something to keep in
mind the whole time you learn

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.210
differential equations.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.520
I think I'll eventually do
a play list on essentially

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.600
an introductory course on
differential equations that

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.000
you would take at college.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.880
And that applies even when
you start doing partial

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.090
differential equations,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.730
The solution to a differential
equation is not a number,

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.660
it is a function.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.490
So anyway, this was the
general solution to this

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.490
differential equation.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.370
And if you want the particular
solution, people normally give

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.120
you initial conditions or they
give you points on the function

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.740
and then you can
substitute back.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.150
In this problem they said that
dy dx equals x squared plus 1.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.230
And they said that -- let me
switch colors -- they said that

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.980
y is equal to 1 at x is equal
to 1, or y is equal to 1

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.690
when x is equal to 1.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.380
So we can use this information
now to solve for c.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.080
How do you do that?

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.060
Well it says y is equal to 1.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.440
So 1 is equal to when x is
equal to 1, is equal to 1/3,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:18.170
right, 1 over 3, 1 to the third
power over 3, plus 1 plus c.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.130
And let's see what I can do.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.200
Subtract one from both
sides -- this comes 0.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.910
Subtract 1/3 from both
sides and you get c is

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.420
equal to minus 1/3.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.860
So using these conditions, a
point where this function

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.560
crosses through, we can now
give you the particular

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.960
solution to this
differential equation.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:48.010
And that is y is equal to x to
the third over 3 plus x minus

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.280
1/3, and then we just
solve for the c.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.670
And if you don't believe me,
take this expression and

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.760
substitute it here and you will
see that it equals, if you were

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.310
to take the derivative of y
with respect to x, you would

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.670
see that it equals
x squared plus 1.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.550
Let's do another one.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.420
So it tells us -- so this is a
little bit more interesting --

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:24.160
it says dy dx is equal to
x over y, and it has

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.830
the same conditions.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.980
It says y equals
1 at x equals 1.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.640
Or when x equals 1, y equals 1.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.790
So let's find the function
that satisfies this equation.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.130
This one's interesting because
we have an x and a y on

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.380
the right hand side
of the equation.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.910
So this kind of looks like
something we got after we

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.680
did some type of implicit
differentiation.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.480
But let's see where we go.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.840
So let's do the same thing.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.280
Let's multiply both sides of
this equation by dx until you

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.380
get dy is equal to x over y dx.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.290
And let's get this y over
onto the dy side, because

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.280
it will be easy to take
the antiderivative then.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:11.990
So we get y dy is
equal to x dx.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.796
Now we can take the integral of
both sides of this equation, or

00:07:15.796 --> 00:07:18.070
take the antiderivative on this
side with respect to y on

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.960
the side with respect to x.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.790
I don't know why I
did it in brown.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.650
So what's the
antiderivative here?

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:34.500
Well, it is y squared over 2.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.060
And I could say plus
c, some constant.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.180
Let me do that.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.750
There could be a constant here.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.410
I'll call it c1.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.410
We don't know what
that constant is.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:57.590
And that equals x squared
over 2 plus c2, right?

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.720
Or some other constant.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.630
Maybe it's the same
number, I don't know.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.350
But we don't know what
either of these are.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.010
I could re-write it as --
let's see, what could I do?

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.820
Let me take the x
out of that side.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:18.450
So I could have y squared over
2 minus x squared over 2 is

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.700
equal to -- and let me subtract
this from that side so I get

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.070
the constants all on the right
hand side of the equation.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.840
c2 minus c1.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.960
I just took a c1, put it on the
right hand side, took the x

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.530
squared over 2, put it on the
left hand side, that's

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.430
why it's negative.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.500
And we didn't know.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.990
We said this could be
any constant and this

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.760
could be any constant.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.200
So the difference between two
arbitrary constants could just

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.610
be a third arbitrary constant.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.720
So I'll just
re-write that as c.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.620
So the general solution to this
differential equation is y

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:56.080
squared over 2 minus x squared
over 2 is equal to c.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.810
Actually let's do something
else just to clean it up a

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.090
little bit, because once again
this could be any constant.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.870
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 2 and

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:08.740
you get y squared minus
x squared equal to 2c.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.280
Well now this is still any
constant number, so we could

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.460
still write this as a c.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.070
So we have y squared minus
x squared is equal to c.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.570
Now let's use our initial
conditions to see what c is.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:29.110
So when y is 1, so 1 squared
minus when x is 1, 1 squared is

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:34.770
equal to c, this is 1 minus 1,
so it's 0, right?

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.590
c is equal to 0.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.570
So what is the particular
solution to this

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:40.350
differential equation?

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.480
I'll do it in green.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:48.350
It is y squared minus x
squared is equal to 0.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.270
Or we could add x squared
to both sides of that.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:55.510
We could also write it as y
squared is equal to x squared.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.870
Now you might be tempted to
take the square root of both

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.490
sides of this and say
that y is equal to x.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.370
The reason why this would not
be accurate is because here x

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:14.290
could be minus 2 and y could
be plus 2 or vice versa.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.560
So this would satisfy this
equation, but it would not

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.710
satisfy this equation.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.380
So be careful when you
take that square root.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.180
You have to worry about
the plus or minus.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.020
Let's do one more.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:36.210
So this one says the derivative
of y with respect to x is equal

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:42.130
to -- OK, so this is even a
little bit more interesting.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:47.775
This is equal to the
square root of x over y.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.890
And it says that y is equal
to 4 when is equal to 1.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.220
Yup, I think I'm
reading that right.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.670
We could do this one
very similarly.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.960
So let's just do the same step.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.660
So multiply both sides of
the equation times dx.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.940
So you get dy is equal to --
and just to skip a step, I'm

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.630
going to re-write square root
of x over y is the square root

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.210
of x over the square root
of y, and I multiply both

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.180
sides of that times dx.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.010
Now let's multiply both
sides of this equation

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.800
by the square root of y.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.530
And I'm just going to re-write
it as y to the 1/2 power.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.310
That's the same thing as
the square root of y.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.730
dy is equal to x to
the 1/2 power dx.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.400
I just multiplied that
there and re-wrote

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.310
it as y to the 1/2.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:45.320
So what is the antiderivative
of y to the 1/2 power?

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:54.780
Well it's just this plus 1, so
it's y the 3/2 power, and then

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.960
times the inverse of this.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.940
So times 2/3.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.320
Or you could have said
divided by this, either way.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.610
And if you're not sure about
this, because sometimes it is

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.560
confusing with the fractions
and whatever else,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.670
take the derivative.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.540
3/2 times 2/3 is 1, and then
you subtract this 1 from

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.220
the exponent and you
get y to the 1/2.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.140
So that works.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.540
And of course, we kind of go
through the same drill, plus c1

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.710
is equal to -- it's going to be
the same thing on this side

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:29.460
-- 2/3 x to the 3/2 plus
c2, and what can we do?

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.890
Well let's take the x to the
left hand side of this

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:42.990
equation, so we get 2/3 y to
the 3/2 minus 2/3 x to the 3/2

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:49.190
is equal to c2 minus c1, which
we can just re-write as c.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.820
And let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 3/2, so

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.440
these two will become 1.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:03.980
So you get y to 3/2 minus x to
the 3/2 is equal to -- well

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.970
what's 3/2 times
some constant c.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.800
But we didn't even know what
it was, we haven't solved for

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800
it, so we can still write c.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.060
I hope that doesn't
confuse you.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.100
3/2 c, we didn't
know what it was.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.480
We could call this c3
and now this is c4.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.440
It's a different constant, but
we still have to solve for it.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.790
And now let's use our
initial conditions.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:24.725
So the initial conditions tell
us that 4 -- and they don't

00:13:24.725 --> 00:13:25.640
have to be initial conditions.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.140
You can kind of say conditions
or points where we know that

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.830
the particular solution to this
differential equation

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.370
are satisfied.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:45.670
So 4 to the 3/2 minus 1 to
the 3/2 is equal to c.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.830
What's 4 to the 3/2?

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.620
So 4 to the 1/2 is 2, and then
that to the 3 power, that's 8.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.130
Then 1 to any power, but
especially in this case, 1 to

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.440
the square root of 1 is 1.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.440
Then to the third power is 1.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.890
So 8 minus 1 is equal to c.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.640
And so c is equal to 7.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.630
So the particular solution of
this differential equation I

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:19.966
will do in a different color,
and it is y to the 3/2 minus

00:14:19.966 --> 00:14:24.620
x to the 3/2 is equal to 7.
