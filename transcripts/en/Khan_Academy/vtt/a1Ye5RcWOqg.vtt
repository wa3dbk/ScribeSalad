00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.880
Let's say there's an election
coming up and I want to figure

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.000
out if there's a meaningful
difference between the

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.430
proportion of men and the
proportion of women that are

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.990
going to vote for a candidate.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.160
So let's look at the population
distributions here.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.820
So we have the men, some
proportion are going to vote

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.240
for the candidate.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.025
We'll call that P1.

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:22.460
So this is the proportion that
will vote for the candidate.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.630
And the rest of the men will
not vote for the candidate.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.030
So 1 minus P1 will not vote
for the candidate.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.760
And then for the women,
you're going to

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.360
see something similar.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.920
So this is the women
right over here.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.670
And some proportion will
vote for the candidate.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.040
We don't know if it's the same
as P1, we don't know if it's

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.300
same as the men, so
we'll call it P2.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.850
And then the rest of
the women will not

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.120
vote for the candidate.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.440
1 minus P2.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.370
So the not voting are zeroes,
the ones that

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.250
are voting are ones.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.660
And these are both Bernoulli
distributions and we know,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.060
just because this'll be useful
later on, that the means of

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.360
this distribution are the same
as the proportion that will

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.069
vote for it.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:10.320
So the mean of the men, or the
proportion of the men that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.860
will vote, so we'll call that
mean one, is equal to P1.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.470
I should do everything
in yellow.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.740
So the mean of this distribution
is P1.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.410
The variance of this
distribution, we'll call that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.590
variance one, is just these two
proportions multiplied by

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.030
each other.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.110
So it's P1 times 1 minus P1.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.220
And we saw this many many videos
ago when we learned

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.180
about Bernoulli distributions.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.430
And we're going to see
the exact same

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.130
thing with the women.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.890
The mean of this Bernoulli
distribution

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.460
is going to be P2.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.040
And then the variance of this
Bernoulli distribution is

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.750
going to be these two
proportions multiplied.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.530
So P2 times 1 minus P2.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.370
Now, what I want to do, and
I think I said this at the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.190
beginning of the video, is I
want to figure out if there's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.820
a meaningful difference between
the way that the men

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.470
will vote and the
women will vote.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.750
I want to figure out, let
me write this, is this

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.500
meaningful?

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.640
So is there a meaningful
difference here?

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.760
And what we're going to do in
this video is try to come up

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.660
with a 95% confidence interval
for this parameter.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.840
This difference of parameters
is still a parameter.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.590
We don't know what the true
difference of these two

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.830
population parameters are.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.750
Or these two population
proportions.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.890
But we're going to try to come
up with a 95% confidence

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.930
interval for that difference.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.070
And the way we do that, we go
out and we find 1,000 men

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.720
likely to vote.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.790
And 1,000 women likely
to vote.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.980
So let's write this down.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.880
So we get 1,000 men.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.340
When we survey the 1,000 men,
let's say 642 say that they

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.990
will vote for the candidate.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.060
So they are ones.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.840
And then the remainder, 358,
I'll just say the remainder.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.540
So the rest are zeros.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.610
That we do the same
thing with women.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.160
We survey 1,000 women who
are likely to vote.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.320
But we survey them randomly.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.500
And let's say 591 say
that they will

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.740
vote for the candidate.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.120
And the rest say that
they will not

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.140
vote for the candidate.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.130
So just here based on our sample
proportions, or our

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.650
sample means, it looks like
there is a difference.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.915
But we still have to come up
with our confidence interval.

00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:51.730
And let's just make sure we
understand what we just did.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.280
So we could figure out a sample
proportion over here

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.530
for the men.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.290
Which is really just the sample
mean of this sample

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.200
right over here.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.600
We have 642 ones, the
rest are zero.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.620
So we have 642 in
the numerator.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.970
We have 1,000 samples.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.840
642 divided by 1,000 is 0.642.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.340
So you could view this is a
sample mean or as a sample

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.380
proportion.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.370
If you do the same thing for
the women, the sample

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.570
proportion is going
to be 0.591.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.070
Or you could even just view this
as the sample mean of the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.550
sample of 1,000 women.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.210
Where the ones voting for it
are one, the rest are zero.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.720
And just to visualize it
properly, let me draw the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.975
sampling distribution for
the sample proportions.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.910
We have a large sample size.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.950
And especially because the
proportions that we're dealing

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.610
with aren't close to one or
zero, and we have a large

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.990
sample size, the sampling
distribution will be

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.240
approximately normal.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.240
Let me write this.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.930
So it's going to have
some mean over here.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.710
So the mean of the sampling
distribution of the sample

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.360
proportion.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.730
And we've seen in
multiple times.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.800
It's going to be the same
thing as the mean of the

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.870
population.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.440
And the mean of the population
is actually the true

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.950
population proportion.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.960
So this is going to
be equal to P1.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.710
This is something that we
don't to know about.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.460
And then the variance of this,
and we've seen this several

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.360
times already, the variance of
this distribution, I have to

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.660
put a one here, we're dealing
with the men.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.480
The variance of this
distribution by the central

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.930
limit theorem is going to
be the variance of this

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.870
distribution up here, which is
P1 times 1 minus P1 over our

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.800
sample size, over 1,000.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.906
And we can do the exact same
thing for the women.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.570
So this is the sampling
distribution.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:15.750
This is for P2 bar, or this
sample mean over here.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.130
Let me put a one over here.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.540
Remember, this is
all for the men.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.870
And then this over here
is all for the women.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.510
Can't forget those
twos over there.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.190
And so this distribution is
going to have some mean.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.720
Let me draw it right
over here.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.130
So mu sub P2 with
a bar over it.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.910
So the mean of the sampling
distribution for this sample

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.590
proportion, for the women, which
is going to be the same

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.680
thing as the mean of the
population, which we already

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.930
saw is going to be
equal to P2.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.770
And then the variance for this
distribution, for this

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.920
sampling and distribution over
here, is going to be this

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.450
variance over here divided
by our sample size.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.410
So P2 times 1 minus P2.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.330
All of that over n.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.970
Now, our whole goal is to
get a 95% confidence

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.140
interval for that.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.310
And so what we're going to do is
we're going to think about

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.260
the sampling distribution, not
for this, and not the sampling

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.190
distribution for this.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.980
But we're going to think about
the sampling distribution for

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.460
the difference of this sample
proportion and this sample

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.950
proportion.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.860
We've seen it already.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.620
We're talking about proportions,
but it's really

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.460
the same exact ideas that we
did when we just compared

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.660
sample means generally.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.910
So let's look at that.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.190
Let's look at this
distribution.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.260
And just to be clear, when we
got this sample mean here,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.590
this sample proportion,
we just sampled it.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.060
You could view it as taking
a sample from this

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.030
distribution over here.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.610
When we got this sample
proportion, it was like taking

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.340
a sample from this over here.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.390
We took 1,000 samples from this,
when we took their mean.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.780
Where it's equivalent to taking
a sample from the

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.300
sampling distribution.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.270
Now, this distribution over
here is going to be the

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.270
distribution of all of the
differences of the sampling

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.730
proportions, or of the
sample proportions.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.350
So it will look like this.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.790
It will have some mean value.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.470
I should do this in
a different color.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.210
I'll do it in green.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.460
Yellow and blue make green.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:36.039
So I'll call this the sampling
distribution of this

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:41.120
statistic, of P1 minus P2.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.990
And so it has some
mean over here.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.000
The sample of P1 minus the
sample mean, or the sample

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.790
proportion, of P2.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.200
And we know, from things that
we've done in the last several

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.290
videos, that this is going to
be the exact same thing as

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.890
this mean minus this mean.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.100
Which is the exact same
thing as P1 minus P2.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.400
So this is going to be
equal to P1 minus P2.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:26.430
And the variance of this
distribution, P1 minus P2,

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.520
just like this, is going to be
the sum of the variances of

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.060
these two distributions.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.210
So it's going to be this thing
over here, I'll just copy and

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:40.940
paste it, plus this variance
over here.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.520
There's no radical sign, because
we're not taking the

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.390
standard deviation.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.190
We're focused on the
variance right now.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.110
So plus this thing
right over here.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.165
So let me copy and
let me paste it.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.925
So that's going to
be the variance.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.100
And if you want the standard
deviation, you can literally

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.060
just get rid of this.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.530
You're taking the square
root of both sides.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.040
So you take the square root of
the variance, you get the

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.180
standard deviation, that's why
I got rid of that to the

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.875
second power.

00:10:12.875 --> 00:10:16.440
And you want to take a square
root of the right-hand side

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.720
just like that.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.900
Now, all I did right now was
just to kind of conceptually

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.000
set things up in our brain.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.350
What we now need to do
is actually tackle

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.380
the confidence interval.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.860
We actually need to come up with
a 95% confidence interval

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.750
for P1 minus P2.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:36.360
Or a 95% confidence interval for
this mean right over here.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.830
And because I'm trying to make
my best effort not to make

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:43.370
videos too long, I'll do part
two in the next video, where

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.250
we actually solve the
confidence interval.
