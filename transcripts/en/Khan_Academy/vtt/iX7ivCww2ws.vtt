00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.590
So far, when we were dealing
with radicals we've only been

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.370
using the square root.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.190
We've seen that if I write a
radical sign like this and put

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.180
a 9 under it, this means the
principal square root of 9,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.690
which is positive 3.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.880
Or you could view it as the
positive square root of 9.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.840
Now, what's implicit when we
write it like this is that I'm

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.360
taking the square root.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.670
So I could have also written
it like this.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.640
I could have also written the
radical sign like this and

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.040
written this index 2 here, which
means the square root,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.570
the principal square
root of 9.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.680
Find me something that
if I square that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.130
something, I get 9.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.330
And the radical sign doesn't
just have to

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.750
apply to a square root.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.210
You can change the index here
and then take an arbitrary

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.660
root of a number.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.390
So for example, if I were to
ask you, what-- You could

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.040
imagine this is called the cube
root, or you could call

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.780
it the third root of 27.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.980
What is this?

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.120
Well, this is some number that
if I take it to the third

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.910
power, I'd get 27.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.420
Well, the only number that if
you take it to the third

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.540
power, you get 27
is equal to 3.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.420
3 times 3 times 3
is equal to 27.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.040
9 times 3, 27.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.720
So likewise, let me
just do one more.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.760
So if I have 16-- I'll do
it in a different color.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.780
If I have 16 and I want to take
the fourth root of 16,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.840
what number times itself
4 times is equal to 16?

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.030
And if it doesn't pop out at
you immediately, you can

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.920
actually just do a prime
factorization of 16

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.250
to figure it out.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.440
Let's see.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.830
16 is 2 times 8.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.120
8 is 2 times 4.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.340
4 is 2 times 2.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.010
So this is equal to the fourth
root of 2 times 2

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.910
times 2 times 2.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.510
You have these four 2's here.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.450
Well, I have four 2's being
multiplied, so the fourth root

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.039
of this must be equal to 2.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.750
And you could also view this
as kind of the fourth

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.750
principal root because if these
were all negative 2's,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.100
it would also work.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.360
Just like you have multiple
square roots, you have

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.540
multiple fourth roots.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.020
But the radical sign implies
the principal root.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.530
Now, with that said, we've
simplified traditional square

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.510
roots before.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.940
Now we should hopefully be able
to simplify radicals with

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.155
higher power roots.

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:39.980
So let's try a couple.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.790
Let's say I want to simplify
this expression.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.140
The fifth root of 96.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.860
So like I said before, let's
just factor this right here.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.080
So 96 is 2 times 48.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.000
Which is 2 times 24.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.640
Which is 2 times 12.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.160
Which is 2 times 6.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.970
Which is 2 times 3.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.790
So this is equal to the fifth
root of 2 times 2 times 2

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.040
times 2 times 2.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.310
Times 3.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.520
Or another way you could view
it, is you could view it to a

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.540
fractional power.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.540
You could view it to
a fractional power.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.720
We've talked about
that already.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.980
This is the same thing as 2
times 2 times 2 times 2 times

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.780
2 times 3 to the 1/5 power.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.330
Let me make this clear.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.270
Having an nth root of some
number is equivalent to taking

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.560
that number to the 1/n power.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.510
These are equivalent statements
right here.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.640
So if you're taking this to
the 1/5 power, this is the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.220
same thing as taking 2 times
2 times 2 times 2

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.640
times 2 to the 1/5.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.150
Times 3 to the 1/5.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.760
Now I have something
that's multiplied.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.630
I have 2 multiplied
by itself 5 times.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.280
And I'm taking that
to the 1/5.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.180
Well, the 1/5 power of this
is going to be 2.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.570
Or the fifth root of this
is just going to be 2.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.220
So this is going to
be a 2 right here.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.899
And this is going to be
3 to the 1/5 power.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:26.860
2 times 3 to the 1/5, which is
this simplified about as much

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.750
as you can simplify it.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.790
But if we want to keep in
radical form, we could write

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:39.020
it as 2 times the fifth
root 3 just like that.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.270
Let's try another one.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.480
Let me put some variables
in there.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.850
Let's say we wanted to simplify
the sixth root of 64

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.570
times x to the eighth.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.420
So let's do 64 first.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.230
64 is equal to 2 times 32,
which is 2 times 16.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.980
Which is 2 times 8.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.610
Which is 2 times 4.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.860
Which is 2 times 2.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.730
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.900
So it's essentially 2
to the sixth power.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.880
So this is equivalent to the
sixth root of 2 to the sixth--

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.530
that's what 64 is --times
x to the eighth power.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.500
Now, the sixth root of 2 to
the sixth, that's pretty

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.140
straightforward.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.290
So this part right here is just
going to be equal to 2.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:47.460
That's going to be 2 times
the sixth root of x

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.710
to the eighth power.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.300
And how can we simplify this?

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.310
Well, x to the eighth power,
that's the same thing as x to

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.860
the sixth power times
x squared.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.630
You have the same base, you
would add the exponents.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.050
This is the same thing
as x to the eighth.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.960
So this is going to be equal to
2 times the sixth root of x

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.940
to the sixth times x squared.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.500
And the sixth root, this part
right here, the sixth root of

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.770
x to the sixth, that's just x.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.270
So this is going to be equal to
2 times x times the sixth

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.900
root of x squared.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.810
Now, we can simplify this
even more if you

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.570
really think about.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.990
Remember, this expression right
here, this is the exact

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.130
same thing as x squared
to the 1/6 power.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.100
And if you remember your
exponent properties, when you

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.620
raise something to an exponent,
and then raise that

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.800
to an exponent, that's
equivalent to x to

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.490
the 2 times 1/6 power.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.720
Or-- let me write this --2 times
1/6 power, which is the

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.010
same thing-- Let me not forget
to write my 2x there.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.080
So I have a 2x there
and a 2x there.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.300
And this is the same thing as
2x-- it's the same 2x there

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.810
--times x to the 2/6.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.220
Or, if we want to write that in
most simple form or lowest

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.710
common form, you get 2x times
x to the-- What do you have

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.870
here? x to the 1/3.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.320
So if you want to write it in
radical form, you could write

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.180
this is equal to 2 times 2x
times the third root of x.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.720
Or, the other way to think about
it, you could just say--

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.650
So we could just go from
this point right here.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:47.580
We could write this.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.190
We could ignore this,
what we did before.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.120
And we could say, this is the
same thing as 2 times x to the

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.090
eighth to the 1/6 power.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.650
x to the eighth to
the 1/6 power.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.570
So this is equal to 2
times x to the-- 8

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.710
times 1/6 --8/6 power.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.360
Now we can reduce
that fraction.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.780
That's going to be 2 times
x to the 4/3 power.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.610
And this and this are completely
equivalent.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.660
Why is that?

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.530
Because we have 2 times x or 2
times x to the first power

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.320
times x to the 1/3 power.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.470
You add 1 to 1/3, you get 4/3.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.350
So hopefully you found this
little tutorial on higher

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.585
power radicals interesting.

00:08:32.585 --> 00:08:35.570
And I think it is useful to kind
of see it in prime factor

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.640
form and realize, oh, if I'm
taking the sixth root, I have

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.330
to find a prime factor that
shows up at least six times.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.210
And then I could figure out
that's 2 to the sixth.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.600
Anyway, hopefully you found
this mildly useful.
