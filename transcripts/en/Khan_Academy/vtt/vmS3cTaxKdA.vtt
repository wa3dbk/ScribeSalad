00:00:00.278 --> 00:00:02.444
What we're going to do in this video

00:00:02.444 --> 00:00:04.292
is generalize what we did in the last video.

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:06.074
And, essentially, end up with the formula

00:00:06.074 --> 00:00:08.213
for rotating something around the X-axis like this using,

00:00:08.213 --> 00:00:11.565
what we call, the "disk method".

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:16.165
And the point is to show you where that formula inside a calculus textbook actually comes from.

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:18.879
But it just comes from the same exact principles we did in the last video!

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:26.086
It's not advised to memorize the formula; I highly recommend against that because you really need to know what's going on.

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:29.082
It's really better to do it in first principles where you find

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:31.613
the volume of each of these disks.

00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:34.901
But let's just generalize what we saw in the last video.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.612
So instead of saying that "y = x^2",

00:00:37.612 --> 00:00:43.281
let's just say that this is the graph, the function that's right over here.

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:46.715
Let's just generalize it and call it "y=f(x)".

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:48.814
And instead of saying x is going from 0 to 2

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:57.445
let's say that we're going between a and b, so these are just two endpoints along the X-axis.

00:00:57.445 --> 00:00:59.762
So how would we find the volume of this?

00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:04.629
Well, just like the last video, we still take a disk just like this.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.662
But what is the height of the disk?

00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:09.626
The height of the disk is not just x^2 since we've generalized it.

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:12.597
So the height is simply going to be whatever the height of the function is at that point.

00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:16.808
So the height of the disk is going to be f(x)!

00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:24.532
The area of the space of this disk is going to be πR^2.

00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:29.440
So our radius is f(x), and we're just going to square it.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.591
That's the area, that's the area of this face right over here.

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:34.391
What is the volume of the disk?

00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:39.875
We're just going to multiply that by our depth, which going to be dx.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:43.795
And we want to take the sum of all of these disks from a to b,

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:50.127
and we're going to take the sum of them, and we're going to take the limit as the "dx"s get smaller and smaller.

00:01:50.127 --> 00:01:51.911
And we have an infinite number of these disks.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:58.290
Thus, we are going to the integral of this from a to b!

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:06.367
And this right here is the formula that you will see often in a calculus textbook for using the disk method as you're rotating around the X-axis.

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:12.834
So I just wanted to show you that it comes out of the common sense of finding the volume of this disk.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:18.002
The f(x) right over here is just the radius of the disk, so this part over here is really just πR^2;

00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:24.510
we multiply it [area of the circle] times the depth; then we take the sum from a to b of all of the disks.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.510
And essentially since this is integral is the limit of all the disks getting narrower and narrower. And thus, we have an infinite number of these disks.
