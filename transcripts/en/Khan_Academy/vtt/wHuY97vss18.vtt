00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.340
Let's say I have two
transformations.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.350
I have the transformation S,
which is a function or a

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.100
transformation from Rn to
Rm, and I also have the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.000
transformation T,
which is also a

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.210
transformation from Rn to Rm.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.120
I'm going to define right now
what it means to add the two

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.010
transformations.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.330
So this is a definition.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.930
Let me write it as
a definition.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.320
I'm going to define the
addition of our two

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.260
transformations.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.470
So if I add our two
transformations, the addition

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.430
of two transformations operating
on some vector x,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.340
this is a definition.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.400
I'm going to say this is the
same thing as the first

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.880
transformation operating on the
vector x plus the second

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.880
transformation operating
on the vector x.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.190
And obviously, this is going
to end up being a vector in

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.810
Rm, so this whole thing is going
to be a vector in Rm.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.300
By definition, this S plus T
transformation is still a

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.910
transformation because it
takes an input from Rn.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:22.380
It's still a transformation
from Rn to Rm.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.760
Now let me make another
definition.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.730
Let me define -- I'll
do it in green.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.430
Maybe I'll do it in purple.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.270
I'm going to define a scalar
multiple of a transformation.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.010
So I'm going to define, let's
say c, where c is just any

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.010
real number.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.870
c times the transformation S of
some vector x, I'm going to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.050
say that this is equal to c
times the transformation of x.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.290
And so similarly, the
transformation of x obviously

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.050
is going to be in Rm.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.240
So if you multiply any vector
in Rm times some scalar,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.550
you're still going to have
another vector in Rm.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.850
So luckily for us, this
definition of a scalar

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.010
multiple-- so if I have this
new transformation called c

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:23.590
times S, this is still a
mapping from Rn to Rm.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.690
This is still a vector
in Rm and this is

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.220
still a vector in Rn.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.050
Fair enough.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.700
Now, let's see what happens if
we look at their corresponding

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.910
matrices for these
transformation.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.400
We've seen in a previous video
that any linear transformation

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.900
can be represented as a
matrix vector product.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.310
So let's say that S of a vector
x is equivalent to the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.870
matrix A times that vector x.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.460
And let's say that T of x is
equal to the matrix B times

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.320
the vector x.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.560
And, of course, since both of
these guys are mappings from

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.100
Rn to Rm, both of these
matrices are

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.470
going to be m by n.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.810
Both of these are
m by n matrices.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.150
Now, let's just go back to these
definitions that I just

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.980
constructed.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.505
What is S of T of x?

00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:22.230
That can then be written as--
so let me write it this way.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.390
I'll do it in that same color.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.980
So you have S-- I was going
to do it in red.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.950
Maybe I'll do it right here.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.720
You have S plus T-- that's
a capital T.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.060
S plus T of x-- I'm just
re-writing this up here -- is

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.020
equal to S of x plus T of x, or
the transformation T of x,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.070
which we now know is equal
to these two things.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.950
So this is equal to this
term right there.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.350
The transformation S of
x is equal to Ax.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.160
That's that one right there.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.930
And then the transformation
T of x is equal to B, the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.710
matrix B times x.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.170
Now, what are these things?

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.130
Let me write our two matrices in
a form that you're probably

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.060
familiar with right now.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.340
Let's say the matrix A is just a
bunch of column vectors: a1,

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.750
a2, all the way to an.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.110
And similarly, the matrix
B is just a

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.830
bunch of column vectors.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:39.260
The matrix B is b1, b2,
all the way to bn.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.490
These are each column vectors
with m components, one for

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.050
each of the rows, and there's n
of these because there are n

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.170
columns in each of
these vectors.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.540
So when you multiply this
guy times-- let me

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.410
make it very clear.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.590
If I multiply an x, the vector
x is going to look like this.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.960
The vector x is going
to be x1, x2, all

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.230
the way down to xn.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.600
And we've shown this multiple,
multiple times.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.580
It's a very handy way
of thinking about

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.790
matrix vector products.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.500
But we know that this product
right here can be written be

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.450
as each of these scalar terms
in x times its corresponding

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.530
column vector in A.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.420
I've done this, and it's
probably the fifth video that

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.960
I'm doing this.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:32.070
So this can be written as x1, x1
times a1 plus x2 times a2,

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.880
all the way to xn times
an is equal to this.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.090
That's what ax can be rewritten
as, as kind of a

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.440
weighted combination of these
column vectors where the

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.380
weights are each of the values
of our vector x.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.140
And I have to add
this guy to bx.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.520
So bx, by the same argument, so
plus is just going to be--

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.590
let me do it in the blue.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:03.130
It's going to be x1 times b1
plus x2 times b2, all the way

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.650
to xn times bn.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.460
Now, what is this equal to?

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.920
Well, we know that scalar
multiplication times vector

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.270
exhibits the distributive
property, so we can just add

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.760
these two guys right here
and factor out the x1.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.590
And what do we get?

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.050
We get this is equal to-- this
whole expression right here,

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.420
let me draw a line here, because
I'm not saying this

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.470
matrix is equal to that.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.760
I'm saying that this is equal to
this, is equal to this term

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:43.380
plus this term, which is equal
to x1 times a1 plus b1, plus

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.070
x2 times a2-- I'm just adding
these two terms up-- x2 times

00:06:49.070 --> 00:07:01.650
a2 plus b2, all the way to
plus xn times an plus bn.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.870
So what is this thing
equal to?

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.480
Well, this is equal to some new
matrix, and let's define

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.420
this new matrix.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.010
This is equal to some new
matrix-- I'll make it pretty

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:20.820
big right here-- times
our vector x .

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.950
I'll do the vector x in green.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:29.380
Vector x we know is x1, x2,
all the way down to xn.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.060
But what is the new matrix
going to be?

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.440
Well, this product is going to
be each of these scalar terms

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.073
times the column vectors
of this matrix.

00:07:39.073 --> 00:07:42.210
So these guys right here are
the columns of my matrix.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.020
This thing is equivalent to a
matrix where the first column

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.470
right here is a1 plus b1.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.050
We're essentially adding
the column vectors

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.190
of those two guys.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.910
The second column right here--
let me draw a little line

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.430
right there to show you that
these are different

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.880
expressions.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.480
The second one would be a2 plus
b2, and then we'll just

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.240
have a bunch of them, and
then the last one will

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.120
just be an plus bn.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.200
So what happens is that, by
definition, when I added these

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.860
two transformations,
I just used their

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.850
corresponding matrices.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.050
And I said you know what?

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.710
The addition of these two
transformations created a new

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:24.410
transformation that is
essentially some matrix times

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:30.300
my vector, and that matrix ended
up being the sum of the

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.010
corresponding column vectors
of our two original

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.590
transformation matrices,
right?

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.700
This new matrix that I got, and
I haven't defined matrix

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.120
addition yet, but we got
here just by thinking

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.789
about vector addition.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.930
This matrix is constructed by
adding the corresponding

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:52.010
vectors of the matrices
A and B.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.300
Now, why did I go through
all of this trouble?

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.470
Well, I can make a new
definition here that'll make

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.230
everything fit together well.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:09.350
I'm going to define this matrix
right here as A plus B.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.410
So my new matrix definition,
if I have two matrices that

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.020
have the same dimensions, and
they have to have the same

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:21.350
dimensions, I'm defining A plus
B to be equal to some new

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.870
matrix where you add up their
corresponding columns.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.870
So a1 plus b1, just like what
I did here, I don't have to

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:33.000
rewrite it, all the way up to an
plus bn is the last column.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.360
And you've seen this before in
your algebra II class, but I

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.620
wanted here to do it, because
this shows you the

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.570
motivation for it.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.340
Because now we can say
that the sum of two

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:50.530
transformations, So S plus T of
x, which is equal to S of

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:56.080
x-- this is a vector-- S of x
plus T of x, which we know is

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:04.530
equal to A times x plus B times
x, we can now say is

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.770
equal to, because it's equal to
some new matrix, which we

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.090
can now call A plus
B times x, right?

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.990
I just showed this part is from
the definition of our

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.680
transformations into some of
our transformation that I

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.140
defined earlier in this video.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.110
And then when we just worked
this out and kind of expressed

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.230
these products as products of or
as weighted combinations of

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.680
the column vectors
of these guys, we

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.020
got to this new matrix.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.630
And I defined this new
matrix as A plus B.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.430
And I did that because it has
this neat property now because

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.270
now the sum of two linear
transformations operating on x

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.350
is equivalent to, when you think
of it is a matrix vector

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.250
product, as the sum of
their two matrices.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.180
Now, let's do the same thing
with scalar multiplication.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:11:02.170
We know that c times our
transformation of x by

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.410
definition I'm saying is c times
the transformation of x.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.700
So c times whatever vector
this is in Rm.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:15.210
And so we know that S of x can
be rewritten as Ax, so this is

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.290
c times A times x.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.050
And we know that Ax can be
rewritten as this is equal to

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:28.230
c times x1 times the first
column vector in a, so a1 plus

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:35.650
x2 times a2,xn all the way
to plus xn times an.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:36.300
Now, what is this?

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.990
This is just scalar
multiplication.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.070
We can just distribute this c.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.670
and then what do we get?

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.630
We get x, and multiplication
is associative.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.950
c is a scalar, x1 is a scalar,
so we can switch them around

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:50.390
if we want.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.920
We know that scalar
multiplication is

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:59.180
distributive, so we can write
this as x1 times ca1 plus x2

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:04.150
times ca2, all the way
to xn times can.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.680
Now, what is this equal to?

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.950
This is equal to some
new matrix times x.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.450
This is equal to some new
matrix-- let me make that

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:23.586
here-- times x1, x2,
all the way to xn.

00:12:23.586 --> 00:12:25.060
And what is that new matrix?

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.470
What are the columns
of the new matrix?

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.360
Well, the columns are
now that, that,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.340
all the way to that.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:38.090
So the columns of this new
matrix are ca1, ca2, all the

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.130
way to can.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.700
Now, why would I go through
this exercise?

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.670
Well, wouldn't it be nice,
I already said that by

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:55.900
definition a scalar multiple of
a transformation is equal

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.830
to the scalar times a
transformation of any vector

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.480
that you input into it.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.060
And, of course, that is
equal to c times Ax.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.330
Now, wouldn't it be nice if I
could define this thing as

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:15.190
some new matrix times
a vector x, right?

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.670
Because this should also be
a linear transformation.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.490
And this new matrix I'm
going to define.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.710
This is a definition again.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:30.780
I'm going to define this new
matrix as being c times A.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.340
So now we have this definition
that c times A, if I take any

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:39.590
scalar times any matrix A, it's
just equal to c times

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.280
each of the column vectors.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.462
And we know what happens when
you take a scalar times each

00:13:43.462 --> 00:13:44.420
of the-- just let
me write this.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:49.810
This is equal to c times a1, c
times a2-- I'm just rewriting

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.920
what I just wrote there-- all
the way to c times an.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.340
But what is this in effect?

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.780
We know that when you multiply c
times a vector, you multiply

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.490
the scalar times each of
the vector's elements.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.220
So this is the equivalent of
multiplying c times every

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.720
entry up in this matrix
right here.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.650
And with this video, you know,
you're probably saying, hey,

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.510
Sal, I already knew how to-- in
algebra II in tenth grade

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.870
or ninth grade, I already was
exposed to multiplying a

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.240
scalar times a matrix or adding
two matrices with the

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:19.940
same dimensions.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.910
Why did you go through all of
this trouble of the defining

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.530
the sum of transformations
and the sum of matrices?

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.000
And I went through the trouble
because I wanted you to

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.670
understand that there's
nothing-- I mean, it is

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.390
natural, but there's nothing
about the universe that said

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.970
matrices had to be
defined this way.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.990
Matrix addition, or matrix
scalar multiplication, or the

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.460
addition of two transformations.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:47.560
I wanted you to see the
mathematical world has

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.300
constructed it in this way
because it seems to have nice

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.040
properties that are useful.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.270
And that's what I've
done in this video.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.180
In the next video, I'll
do a couple of scalar

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.780
multiplications and matrix
additions just to make sure

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:02.350
that you remember what you had
learned in your ninth or tenth

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.810
grade algebra class, but you'll
find that the actual

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.770
operations are almost
trivially simple.
