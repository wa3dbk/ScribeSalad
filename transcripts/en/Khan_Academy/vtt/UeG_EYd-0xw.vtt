00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.520
Rewrite the expression
below applying

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.180
the commutative and associative
properties of addition.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.170
And then show that
both expressions

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.080
yield the same result.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.349
So one, we could just evaluate
the expression the way

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:14.890
it's written.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.348
And then we can
kind of mess around

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:19.100
with it using the commutative
and associative properties

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.480
of addition.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.860
So let's first add 17.5 plus 3.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.450
So that's going to give us 20.5.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.760
So this is going to be 20.5.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.440
And then to that, we're
going to add negative 7.5.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.070
Now, adding negative 7.5
is the exact same thing

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.620
as subtracting 7.5.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.340
So this is going to be equal
to-- the 0.5's cancel out.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.350
And then 20 minus 7 is 13.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.660
So that's our first way
of getting the answer.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.000
And we kind of adhered
to the parentheses.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.260
Now let's use the
commutative property.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.910
The commutative
property tells us

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.200
that the order doesn't matter.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.100
We can commute these
numbers around.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.480
They can move, commute.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.060
It's like you're going to work.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.190
They can move around.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.684
So let's just move
the numbers around.

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:11.100
Let's make it--
actually, we could

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.610
do all sorts of crazy things.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.110
We could just change
the order here.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:26.250
We could make this negative
7.5 plus 17.5 plus 3.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.582
We could keep the
parentheses, just like that.

00:01:28.582 --> 00:01:30.290
So we would have
essentially just changed

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.710
the order of this
expression right over here.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.450
But let's use both
the commutative

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.940
and the associative properties.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.260
So now we've commuted
everything around.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.000
And now we can
re-associate everything.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.999
So instead of putting the
parentheses like that,

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:45.419
we could put the
parentheses like that.

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:47.460
So that's what the
associative property tells us.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.830
So let me write this down.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.720
So associative
property of addition

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.680
tells us that a plus b plus
c-- we do a plus b first--

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.300
is the same thing as a plus b
plus c, where you do b plus c

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.080
first.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:20.480
The commutative
property tells us

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.090
that a plus b is
equal to b plus a,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.276
that you can move
these guys around.

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:27.400
So let's evaluate this one.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.560
We actually got here
using both the commutative

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.620
and the associative property.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.330
So we get negative
7.5 plus 17.5.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.330
This is the exact same
thing as 17.5 minus 7.5.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.750
It might be easier for
you to realize, OK,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.944
I'm adding two numbers
of different signs,

00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:51.360
so what I could do is take the
difference between the two.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.150
And since the larger
number is positive,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.230
I have a larger number.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.610
Or you could just view
this as 17.5 minus 7.5.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.590
So 17.5 minus 7.5--
the 0.5's cancel out.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.630
17 minus 7 is 10.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.330
So this part right
here becomes 10.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.300
And then we still
have the plus 3 there.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.280
And that, once again, is
going to be equal to 13.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.450
And we could keep
commuting this around

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.750
and keep re-associating it.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.930
No matter how we do it,
we are going to get 13.
