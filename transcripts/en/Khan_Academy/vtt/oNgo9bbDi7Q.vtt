00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:05.165
You'll hear the terms , Balanced Forces and Unbalanced Forces a lot when you're dealing with Physics

00:00:05.165 --> 00:00:10.870
and what I wanna do in this video is give you a bunch of scenarios and have you think about whether the forces in these scenarios

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.955
are balanced or unbalanced.

00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:16.343
So let's start with the scenario where we have the ground.

00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:20.803
And then sitting on the ground we have a rock.

00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:26.614
Now the force of gravity is going to be pulling the rock downwards towards the center of the earth

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:30.053
and it's going to be pulling it, as essentially the weight of the rock,

00:00:30.053 --> 00:00:36.519
it's going to be pulling it downwards , let's say with a force of 5 N downwards.

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.883
But then the rock is being supported by the ground,

00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:42.219
the ground is keeping it from being plummeted downward.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.336
So the ground is providing an upwards force or normal force in this situation.

00:00:48.336 --> 00:00:51.285
The ground is providing a normal force, I'll do it in green.

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:55.657
The ground is providing a normal force in this situation .

00:00:56.543 --> 00:01:00.818
So these forces have the same magnitudes but they're going in opposite directions.

00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:03.040
So that is the first scenario.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.841
Now let's think about another scenario.

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:06.690
So I'll draw the rock again.

00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:16.952
We'll assume it's the same rock.
The force of gravity is still downwards.

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:21.259
5 N downwards.

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.563
And there's still a normal force , the ground supporting the rock of 5 N upwards.

00:01:26.563 --> 00:01:31.047
5 N upwards.

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:36.822
And now there's some character who's trying to push the rock.

00:01:36.822 --> 00:01:50.258
So we have some character here and he's trying to push the rock and he's applying a force of 2 N to the right.

00:01:50.258 --> 00:01:55.838
But then there's a force of friction between the rock and the ground that is going 2...

00:01:55.838 --> 00:01:58.475
I'll do friction in orange

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:00.623
2 N to the left

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.353
So that right over there is the force of friction. It's going against that guy's pushing.

00:02:10.353 --> 00:02:14.246
Now let's do another scenario. Once again a very similar scenario.

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:21.856
Let's draw another scenario where I have a rock now. Maybe the same rock.

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:26.255
And here I have a 5 N force downwards.

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:29.459
Force of gravity, like the rest of the scenarios.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:37.339
And I have the normal force. The rock is being supported by the ground 5 N upwards.

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:42.124
And this guy over here has been able to push a little bit harder.

00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:47.362
He's pushing a little bit harder. He really put his back into it.

00:02:47.362 --> 00:02:52.479
And now he's pushing with a force of 3 N to the right

00:02:52.479 --> 00:03:03.909
and the force of friction is still 2 N to the left. So that right over there is the force of friction.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.689
Now let's do a couple of more scenarios.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:15.048
Now let's imagine that this is the ground . And I have the rock. The rock is not resting on the ground.

00:03:15.048 --> 00:03:18.475
So the only force I have acting on the rock right now

00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:21.612
is the force of gravity, acting downward.

00:03:21.612 --> 00:03:24.197
We're assuming we're not going to think too much about--

00:03:24.197 --> 00:03:25.928
Actually let's think about it a little bit, let's also

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:29.809
put, so let's put it...so I have the force of gravity.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:34.710
That's 5 N down. But I have some air resistance here. You can view it as the

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.582
force of friction of the air, and let's say that is 1 N up.

00:03:42.197 --> 00:03:48.299
This is the force of friction or you can call it air resistance.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.144
As if this thing bumps into all of the air particles as it

00:03:52.144 --> 00:03:54.974
is falling to the ground.

00:03:54.974 --> 00:03:58.891
The last scenario I'll draw with the rock again as that seems to be the

00:03:58.891 --> 00:04:01.028
theme of the video.

00:04:01.028 --> 00:04:03.074
The last scenario, that's the ground.

00:04:03.074 --> 00:04:09.228
The rock is resting on the ground.

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:11.796
The rock is resting on the ground.

00:04:11.796 --> 00:04:19.569
So I have the force of gravity, 5 N downwards.

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:26.271
The rock is being supported by the ground, 5 N upwards.

00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:34.000
And now this guy is pushing really hard.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.087
So now he's applying 4 N

00:04:40.087 --> 00:04:41.739
in that direction.

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:47.398
You have 2 N from the force of friction, I won't that draw just yet; and you also have

00:04:47.398 --> 00:04:51.093
another character right over here, who is trying to keep this guy from pushing the

00:04:51.093 --> 00:04:57.000
rock. So he's pushing in the other direction at 1 N.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.803
So you have 2 N of the force of friction. You have this guy pushing 1 N against

00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:12.688
this guy's motion to the left, so between this guy and the force of friction, you have 3 N going left.

00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:19.773
So now I'll let you think about which of these have an unbalanced force in them, or another way to think about it,

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:24.304
which of these have a Net Force going on?

00:05:24.304 --> 00:05:30.176
So let's look at the first scenario, we have a 5 N force of gravity acting towards the centre of the earth.

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:33.802
5 N normal force of the ground supporting the rock.

00:05:33.802 --> 00:05:37.185
These have the same magnitude in the exact opposite directions

00:05:37.185 --> 00:05:41.603
so they cancel out. These forces completely balance each other out.

00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:48.274
There is zero net force going on, there are no forces the way I've drawn it, going on in the horizontal direction.

00:05:48.274 --> 00:05:51.453
So you have zero net force, these right here are balanced.

00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:54.589
We would not consider this one of the scenarios we see an

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:56.210
unbalanced force.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.367
Let's go to scenario 2.

00:05:57.367 --> 00:06:01.192
Once again, 5 N up and 5 N down, they are balancing each other.

00:06:01.192 --> 00:06:06.244
Then in the horizontal direction, this guy is pushing of 2 N to the right

00:06:06.244 --> 00:06:10.994
is being completely balanced by the force of friction of 2 N to the left.

00:06:10.994 --> 00:06:15.808
Because they're balanced there is no net force and this rock isn't going to accelerate.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:22.744
So once again these are all balanced forces or there's no net force going on right over here.

00:06:22.744 --> 00:06:25.888
In scenario 3. Once again, in the vertical direction.

00:06:25.888 --> 00:06:30.940
The force of gravity is being balanced by the normal force of the ground.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.408
Keeping the rock from plummeting or accelerating towards the centre of the earth.

00:06:34.408 --> 00:06:37.857
And you do have two forces that are counteracting on the horizontal direction.

00:06:37.857 --> 00:06:43.188
This guy's pushing harder with 3 N, but the force of friction is now 2 N to the left.

00:06:43.188 --> 00:06:47.872
So you do have a net force to the right. 3 N to the right, 2 N to the left.

00:06:47.872 --> 00:06:56.898
You have a net force of 1 N to the right.

00:06:56.898 --> 00:06:59.140
Or you see it's right based on how I drew the vector.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.911
So you do have a net force or in another way of thinking about it, that this is

00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:10.372
a scenario where you have unbalanced forces, in particular, in the right left direction.

00:07:10.372 --> 00:07:13.119
Now let's look at scenario 4.

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:17.401
We only have forces acting in this vertical direction.

00:07:17.401 --> 00:07:20.463
You have the force of gravity 5 N downwards.

00:07:20.463 --> 00:07:25.277
You have a counteracting force, the force of air resistance, I N upward.

00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:27.332
But they don't completely balance out.

00:07:27.332 --> 00:07:33.729
There is still a net force of 4 N downwards.

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:37.583
Therefore this is an unbalanced situation.

00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:38.969
And finally in the last scenario.

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:43.936
We're sitting on the ground in the vertical direction, normal force counteracting the force of gravity.

00:07:43.936 --> 00:07:45.111
Those are balanced.

00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:46.534
But in the horizontal direction.

00:07:46.534 --> 00:07:50.870
To the right we have more force, 4 N, than what we have going to the left.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.244
3 N is the guy on the right plus the force of friction.

00:07:53.244 --> 00:07:57.719
So in this situation there is a net force in the rightward direction.

00:07:57.719 --> 00:08:02.722
A 1 N force to the right or 1 N net force.

00:08:02.722 --> 00:08:09.995
This is a scenario where we have unbalanced forces.
