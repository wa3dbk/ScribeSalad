00:00:00.324 --> 00:00:01.740
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.380
talk about the difference
between vectors and scalars.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.259
And they might sound like
very complicated ideas,

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.050
but we'll see over the
course of the videos

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.874
that they're actually
very simple ideas.

00:00:15.874 --> 00:00:18.040
So first I'll give you a
little bit of a definition.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.250
And then I'll give you
a bunch of examples,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.780
and I think the examples
will make things super clear.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.030
Hopefully, they'll make
things super clear.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.040
A vector is something
that has a magnitude,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.270
or you could kind of
view that as a size,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.290
and it has a direction.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.065
So "and" it has a direction.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.380
A scalar only has a
magnitude, or size.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.550
And if that doesn't
make sense to you,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.070
it will hopefully
make sense to you

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.910
in a second when I
show you an example.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.830
For example.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.160
Let's say that I have,
let's say that that's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.020
the ground-- let me do
the ground in a more

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.640
appropriate ground-like color.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.970
So this is green
right over here.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.440
And let's say that
I have a brick here.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.940
I have a brick on the ground.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.670
And I pick up that
brick, and I move it over

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.370
to this place right over here.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.390
So I move the brick
right over there.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.610
And then I take a ruler
out, and I say, wow,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.305
I've moved the brick 5 meters.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.190
So my question to you, is
my measurement of 5 meters,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.520
is it a vector or a scalar?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.150
Well, if I just
tell you 5 meters,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.580
you just know the
size of the movement.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.480
You just know the
magnitude of the movement.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.050
So if someone were
to just say 5 meters,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.670
this is a scalar quantity.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.400
And when we're referring
to moving something,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.380
or how much something has, I
guess, changed its position,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.980
and I don't give
you the direction,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.790
we're talking about distance.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.889
And I'm assuming you've
heard the word distance.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.900
How far of a distance
has something traveled?

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.890
So this is distance.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.490
So we could say that this
block, or this brick,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.380
because of my picking
it up and moving it,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.589
has moved a distance
of 5 meters.

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:22.380
But if I didn't show
you this picture here,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.754
and someone just
told you that it

00:02:23.754 --> 00:02:25.830
moved a distance
of 5 meters, you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.830
wouldn't know if it moved
to the right 5 meters,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.955
you wouldn't know if it
moved to the left 5 meters,

00:02:29.955 --> 00:02:31.600
if it moved up or
down or in or out,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.808
or-- You don't know what
direction it moved 5 meters.

00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:36.210
You just know it moved 5 meters.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.070
If you want to
specify that, so, we

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.490
could say that this
brick right over here,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:49.285
that it moved 5
meters to the left.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.140
Now we have specified a
magnitude, right over there.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.990
So that is a magnitude.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.360
And we have specified a
direction, to the left.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.590
So you now explicitly know that
they went 5 meters to the-- oh,

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.140
sorry.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.830
It should be 5
meters to the right.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.150
Let me change that.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.990
So, 5 meters to the right
is what it got moved.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.250
It started here and went
5 meters to the right.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.740
So once again, the
magnitude is 5 meters,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.520
and the direction
is to the right.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.670
So what I've just
described to you right here

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.580
is a vector quantity.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.770
So this, all of this
business right over here,

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.941
this is a vector.

00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:40.940
And when you talk about
the movement, the change

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.030
in position, and you give its
direction, the vector version

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.960
of distance, I guess you could
call it, is displacement.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.223
So this right here
is displacement.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.640
So the correct thing
to say, you would

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.950
say that this brick
has been displaced

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.420
5 meters to the
right, or it has been

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.990
moved a distance of 5 meters.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.820
Distance is a scalar
quantity-- I didn't tell you

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.430
what direction we moved it in.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.870
Displacement is a
vector quantity.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.430
We told you that
it is to the right.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.390
Now let's explore this if
we talk about the actual,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.740
well, we'll talk about the
speed or velocity of something.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.290
So let's say that this
5 meters was traveled

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.684
and let's say that
the change in time--

00:04:33.684 --> 00:04:35.350
let me just, because
you're probably not

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.599
familiar with what that means.

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.390
So let's say that the
change in time right here,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.920
when I moved this
block 5 meters,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.100
let's say that it
was, I don't know,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.420
let's say that the change
in time was 2 seconds.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.190
So maybe right when the
block started moving, maybe

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.400
on my stopwatch it said 0.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.340
And then on my stopwatch
when it stopped moving,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.210
it said, or when it
got to this position,

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.168
I should say-- when it
left from this position,

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:04.580
my stopwatch said 0.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.000
When it got to this position
my stopwatch said 2 seconds.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.800
So the change in time, or the
duration we're dealing with,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.446
is 2 seconds.

00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:14.070
And this is, for all
we know, time only

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.550
goes in the positive direction.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.159
So you could assume
that it's, you

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.200
could pick that as a vector
or a scalar quantity,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.740
I guess, because there's
only one direction for time,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.320
as far as we know, or
at least in what we're

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.070
going to deal with for
the simple physics.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.000
So what is a measure of
how fast this thing moved?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.320
So, how fast did
this thing move?

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.430
So we could say it moved
5 meters in 2 seconds.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.460
Let me write this down.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.310
So it moved 5 meters
per 2 seconds.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.820
Or we could write this as
5/2 of a meter per second.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.180
Or 5 divided by 2 is what?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.230
5 divided by 2 is 2.5
meters per second.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.430
This right here is just
the 5 divided by 2,

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.910
let me make that clear.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.230
That right there is just
the 5 divided by the 2.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.300
So my question to you.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.450
This 2.5 meters per
second tells you

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.550
how far it traveled in a
certain amount of time.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.782
Is this a vector or
a scalar quantity?

00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:33.240
It is telling you
how fast it went,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.250
but is it giving you just
a size of how fast it went?

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.090
Or is it also giving
you direction?

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.730
Well, I don't see
any direction here.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.700
So this is a scalar quantity.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.470
And the scalar quantity for
how fast something is going

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.920
is speed.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.100
So we could say that
the speed of the brick

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.162
is 2.5 meters per second.

00:06:56.162 --> 00:06:57.620
Now, if we do the
same calculation,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.290
and we say it went
5 meters-- I'll just

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:13.500
write m for meters-- to the
right in 2 seconds, then

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.660
what do we get?

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.860
We get 2.5, once again, 2.5
meters per second-- I'll

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:26.005
just abbreviate them as meters
per second-- to the right.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.220
So is this a vector
or a scalar quantity?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.840
I'm telling you the magnitude
of the speed, that's right here.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.170
This is the magnitude,
2.5 meters per second.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.760
And I'm also telling you
the direction, to the right.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.910
So this is a vector quantity.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.650
This is a vector quantity.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.000
And when you specify both
the speed and the direction,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.080
so the 2.5 meters per second
is a scalar, and the direction,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.970
you are talking about velocity.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.510
You are talking about velocity.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.140
So an easy way to
think about it,

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.300
if you're thinking
about change in position

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.750
and you specify the direction
of the change in position,

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.660
you're talking
about displacement.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.620
If you're not talking
about the direction,

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.370
you want the scalar version,
you're talking about distance.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.920
If you're talking about how
fast something is going,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.420
and you give the direction
that it's going in,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.170
you're talking about velocity.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.077
If you don't give the direction
you are talking about speed.

00:08:26.077 --> 00:08:27.660
Hopefully that helps
you a little bit.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.670
In the next video,
we're going start

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.336
working with these a
little bit to start

00:08:30.336 --> 00:08:33.809
solving some basic questions
about how fast something

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.460
is going, or how
far it might travel,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.760
or how long it might
take it to get someplace.
