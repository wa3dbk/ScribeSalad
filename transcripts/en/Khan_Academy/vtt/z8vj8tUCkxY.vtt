00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:03.140
Lets see if we can give ourselves a little bit

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.460
of practice converting between radians and degrees

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.974
and degrees and radians.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.944
And just as a review lets just remind ourselves the relationship

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:14.125
and I always do this before I have to convert between the two.

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:19.620
If I do one revolution of a circle how many radians is that going to be?

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.727
Well we know one revolution of a circle is (2)(pi) radians

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:32.522
and how many degrees is that if I do one revolution around a circle?

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:34.975
Well we know that is 360 degrees.....

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:40.224
I can either write it with the little degree symbol like that or I can write it just like that.

00:00:40.224 --> 00:00:43.013
And this is really enough information for us to think about

00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:45.040
how to convert between radians and degrees

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.623
if we want to simplify this a little bit we can divide both sides

00:00:47.623 --> 00:00:49.061
by 2.

00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:55.826
And you can have (pi) radians are equal to 180 degrees

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:57.277
or another way to think about it

00:00:57.277 --> 00:01:02.094
going halfway around a circle in radians is (pi) radians.

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:06.438
The arc that subtends that angle is (pi) radiusssses

00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:09.645
and that's also 180 degrees.

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:14.804
And if you wanna really think about, well how many degrees are there per radian

00:01:14.804 --> 00:01:18.095
you can divide both sides of this by (pi).

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:20.373
So if you divide both sides of this by (pi),

00:01:20.373 --> 00:01:24.041
you would get one radian

00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:26.179
it would have to go from plural to singular

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.789
one radian is equal to 180/pi degrees.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.155
So all I did is I divided both sides by (pi)

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:37.929
and if you wanted to figure out how many radians

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.405
are there per degree you can divide both sides by 180.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:45.277
So you would get pi/180 radians

00:01:45.277 --> 00:01:51.676
is equal to 1 degree.

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:55.029
So this is....now I think we are ready to start converting.

00:01:55.029 --> 00:02:02.242
So lets convert 30 degrees....to radians.

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:04.460
So lets think about it.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.039
I'm going to write it out and actually this might remind you of unit analysis

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.359
that you might do when you first did unit conversion

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.793
but it also works out here.

00:02:12.793 --> 00:02:14.298
So if I were to write 30 degrees

00:02:14.298 --> 00:02:16.415
and this is how my brain likes to work with it

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:19.206
I like to write out the word degrees.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:22.211
Well I wanna convert to radians so I really want to figure out

00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:25.191
how many radians are there per degree?

00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:35.539
So let me write this down. I wanna figure out how many radians do we have per degree?

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.930
And I haven't filled out how many that is

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.809
but we see the units will cancel out

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.441
if we have degrees times radians/degree

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:45.706
the degrees will cancel out and I'll be just left with radians.

00:02:45.706 --> 00:02:49.475
If I multiply the number of degrees I have times the number of radians per degree

00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:51.160
we're gonna get radians.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.007
And hopefully that makes intuitive sense as well.

00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:54.495
And here we just have to think about

00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:59.288
well if I have...think of it this way, if I have

00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:04.237
pi radians how many degrees is that?

00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:08.909
Well that's 180 degrees, comes straight out of this right over here

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.755
pi radians for every 180 degrees or pi/180 radians/degree.

00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:20.464
This is going to get us to...we're going to get 30 times pi/180

00:03:20.464 --> 00:03:26.188
30 times pi/180

00:03:26.188 --> 00:03:27.646
which will simplify to

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:29.830
30/180 is 1/6

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.161
so this is equal to pi/6

00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:35.626
let me write the units out

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:43.727
this is 30 radians which is equal to pi/6 radians.

00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:45.411
Now lets go the other way

00:03:45.411 --> 00:03:53.697
lets think about if we have pi/3 radians

00:03:53.697 --> 00:03:55.758
and I wanna convert that to degrees.

00:03:55.758 --> 00:03:58.831
So what am I going to get if I convert that to degrees?

00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:00.591
Well here we're gonna want to figure out

00:04:00.591 --> 00:04:05.174
how many degrees are there per radian?

00:04:05.174 --> 00:04:07.313
One way to think about it is

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:10.642
think about the pi and the 180

00:04:10.642 --> 00:04:15.043
for every 180 degrees you have pi radians.

00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:17.195
180 degrees/pi radians

00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:18.944
these are essentially the equivalent thing

00:04:18.944 --> 00:04:21.027
essentially you're just multiplying this quantity by 1

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:22.876
but you're changing the units

00:04:22.876 --> 00:04:26.465
the radians cancel out and then the pi's cancel out

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:29.706
and you're left with 180/3 degrees

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:34.577
180/3 is 60 and we can either write out the word degrees or you can write degrees

00:04:34.577 --> 00:04:36.379
just like that.

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.856
Now lets think about 45 degrees.

00:04:39.856 --> 00:04:44.464
So what about 45 degrees?

00:04:44.464 --> 00:04:49.061
And I'll write it like that just so you can figure it out with that notation as well.

00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:53.464
How many radians will this be equal to?

00:04:53.464 --> 00:04:59.186
Well once again we're gonna want to think about how many radians do we have per degree?

00:04:59.186 --> 00:05:01.994
So we're going to multiply this times

00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:06.765
well we know we have pi radians

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:12.756
for every 180 degrees

00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:14.965
or we can even write it this way

00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:18.710
pi radians for every 180 degrees.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.044
And here this might be a little less intuitive

00:05:21.044 --> 00:05:23.289
the degrees cancel out and that's why I usually like to

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.542
write out the word

00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:28.430
and you're left with 45 pi/180 radians.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.797
Actually let me write this with the words written out

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.715
for me that's more intuitive when I'm thinking about it

00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:35.863
in terms of using the notation.

00:05:35.863 --> 00:05:51.577
So 45 degrees times, we have pi radians for every 180 degrees.

00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:54.072
So we are left with when you multiply

00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:59.207
45 times pi over 180

00:05:59.207 --> 00:06:01.695
the degrees have canceled out and you're just left with

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.510
radians.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.278
Which is equal to what?

00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:09.798
45 is half of 90 which is half of 180 so this is 1/4

00:06:09.798 --> 00:06:15.489
this is equal to pi over 4 radians.

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:19.675
Lets do 1 more over here.

00:06:19.675 --> 00:06:28.197
So lets say that we had negative pi/2 radians.

00:06:28.197 --> 00:06:32.676
What's that going to be in degrees?

00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:34.280
Well once again we have to figure out

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.427
how many degrees

00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:37.243
are each of these radians.

00:06:37.243 --> 00:06:41.691
We know that there 180 degrees

00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:46.448
for every pi radians

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:47.762
so we're gonna get

00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:49.182
the radians cancel out

00:06:49.182 --> 00:06:50.911
the pi's cancel out

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:51.561
and so you have

00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.333
-180/2

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:58.257
this is -90 degrees

00:06:58.257 --> 00:07:02.660
or we can write it as -90 degrees.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.315
Anyway hopefully you found that helpful

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:06.513
and I'll do a couple more example problems here

00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:07.831
because the more example for this

00:07:07.831 --> 00:07:08.868
the better and hopefully it will become

00:07:08.868 --> 00:07:12.000
a little bit intuitive
