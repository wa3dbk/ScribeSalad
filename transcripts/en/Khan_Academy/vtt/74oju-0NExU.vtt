00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.940
We're on problem 39.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.060
And it says which ordered pairs
the vertex of f of x is

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.280
equal to x squared
plus 6x plus 5?

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.660
Now, finding vertexes of
parabolas, there's a formula,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.830
and negative b over 2a, but you
might forget that when you

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.280
turn 30 years old.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.515
The whole goal of this isn't
just to pass an algebra exam.

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:25.400
It's to learn algebra.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.190
Then when you learn calculus,
you'll learn actually a much

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.160
easier way to figure out minimum
and maximum points.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.330
But there's actually an
intuitive way of doing it in

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.440
algebra as well.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.530
What we have to do is just
write this in that form.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.510
If we could write this function
in the form like

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.060
this, f of x is equal to A,
times x plus or minus

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.550
something, I don't know,
b, squared, plus C.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.440
Then we know the vertex happens
when x is equal to b.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.530
Because if you look at this form
of a parabola-- and you

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.490
can write any of these in this
form-- then you say OK, this

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.380
term right here is always
going to be positive.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.320
So the minimum point of this
parabola is when this term is

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.560
equal to 0.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.090
Then the minimum point of this
term happens when x is equal

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.030
to b, when this term
is equal to 0.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.720
So the vertex becomes
xb comma C.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.400
So let's do that with this.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.530
You could memorize it.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.200
It ends up being minus
b over 2A.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.110
But let's just actually solve
it, because I want you to have

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.440
the intuition.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.370
f of x is equal to x squared
plus 6x, plus 5.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.800
I wrote a gap there for a
reason, because we're

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.430
essentially going to
complete a square.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.210
We want to turn this x squared
plus 6x, plus something, into

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.890
a perfect square.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.020
Hopefully you have
some practice

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.860
completing the square.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.130
What number is 1/2 of 6?

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.000
Because when we square it, if
we do x plus a squared, that

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.320
equals what? x squared plus
2ax plus a squared.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.390
So if we map that to that,
x squared is x squared.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.050
2ax is equal to 6.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.140
So a would be equal to 3.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.240
And if a is equal to 3, a
squared would be equal to 9.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.650
You can't just add a 9 to one
side of the equation.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.770
You either have to do it to both
sides, or you have to do

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.940
something to offset that.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.920
So if we added a 9 here, let's
just subtract a 9 as well.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.500
So then we get x squared plus
6x, plus 9, plus 5, minus 9.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.150
So this right here, this part of
it, that's equal to x plus

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.530
3, squared.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.150
And then this part, 5
minus 9, minus 4.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.350
There, we got it into our
format that we needed.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.190
So when does this function
achieve a minimum point?

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.620
Well, it achieves a minimum
point when this part is equal

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.700
to 0, or when x is
equal to minus 3.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.120
When x is equal to minus
3, this is 0.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.690
So f of x is going to
be equal to minus 4.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.820
So that's the vertex,
and that's choice A.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.400
You could have done
minus b over 2A.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.010
You'd get minus 12 over
2-- no minus 6 over 2,

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.620
which is minus 3.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.700
That's something you
could memorize.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.670
But it's better, I think,
to have the intuition.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.650
Problem 40.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:36.630
The graph of x over 2, squared,
minus y over 2,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.020
squared equals 1
is a hyperbola.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.670
That makes sense.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.050
This is y over 3. x over 2,
squared, minus y over 3,

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.770
squared is equal to 1.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.530
If this is a plus, we would
have an ellipse.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.250
Fair enough.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.590
Which set of equations
represents the asymptotes of

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.140
the hyperbola's graph?

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.250
Once again, there's some
equations that people memorize

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.310
and formulas people memorize,
but you can actually have an

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.670
intuition on this.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.570
So let's think about what
happens as x approaches

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.990
positive or negative infinity.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.640
Because that's what we care
about as an asymptote, right?

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.290
What does the graph approach
when we get to really, really

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.720
large values of x, and
it turns out, really

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.430
large values of y?

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.640
So let's just rearrange
this a little bit.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.425
Let's put y on the other side.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.470
Let's square this.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.160
So this is x squared over 4.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.590
Let me keep it actually
in that format.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.110
Let's keep that as x over 2,
squared is equal to 1, plus y

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.360
over 3, squared.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.700
Let's subtract 1 from
both sides.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.550
So you get x over 2, squared,
minus 1 is equal

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.800
to y over 3, squared.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.740
And now, let's multiply both
sides by 3 squared.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.230
Let's multiply both
sides by 9.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.450
Let's do that.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.350
Actually, to simplify this,
let me rewrite this.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.440
I wanted to keep in that form.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.790
That's the same thing as x
squared over 4, minus 1, is

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.950
equal to y squared over 9.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.370
Multiply both sides by 9.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.140
I'm going to switch the sides
so we get y here.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.700
So you get y squared is
equal to 9 over 4 x

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.600
squared, minus 9.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.850
All right, and that's about as
far as we can get just with

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.210
straight up algebra.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.330
When we think about asymptotes,
those are points

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.590
that the graphs will never reach
but it'll get close to.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.580
So we have to think about what
happens with x gets really

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.020
large and correspondingly
y gets really large.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.350
Well, as x gets really large, so
as x approaches infinity--

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.120
and you'll learn this is
precalculus and calculus,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.120
these are limits, but it's
really a very intuitive

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.050
concept-- as x gets really
large, this minus 9 doesn't

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.000
matter much.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.150
This term starts
to dominate it.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.600
These terms matter a lot
more than this minus 9.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.580
So as x approaches infinity, y
squared is approximately equal

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.730
to 9/4 x squared.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.800
Now we could take the square
root of both sides of this.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.850
So you get y is approximately
equal to plus or minus 3/2 x.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.420
Those are the actual asymptotes,
y equals 3/2 x and

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.670
y is equal to minus 3/2 x.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.480
That's actually choice A.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.400
I won't go into the actual
instruction of how you would

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.160
think about graphing.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.870
Actually, why not?

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.730
Why don't we just do that.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:28.940
We know what the
asymptotes are.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.730
Let's actually think about
how you would graph this.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.000
So if you were to draw the--
it's all about learning, not

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.100
just about assessing-- that's
the x- and y-axis.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.010
And they tell us their
asymptotes, 3/2 x

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.550
and minus 3/2 x.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.350
So 3/2 x, the slope
of 3/2 is 1.5.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.265
So it's a slope that will look
something like-- let me get

00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:58.220
the line tool out-- so x might
look like, so plus 3/2 x would

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.760
look something like that.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.800
Minus 3/2 x would be something
like that.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:12.520
Now we have to figure out does
this hyperbola go from there

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.780
and there, or does it go
from here and here?

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:21.950
There were just say, OK, when y
is equal to 0 we get x over

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.200
2 is equal to plus or minus 1.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.325
You actually get x
would be there.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.970
So you know that this thing
has x-intercepts.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.740
You can set y is equal to 0.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.250
You can't set x is equal to 0.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.410
If you get x is equal to 0, then
you get minus y squared

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.300
is equal to something.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.530
You get y squared is equal
to negative 1.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.090
You get some imaginary
solution.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.370
So you know that it
has x-intercepts.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.160
You know that these are
the asymptotes.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.750
So if you want to draw the
graph, it would look

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.970
something like that.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.350
I know that's not a great
drawing, but hopefully it

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.000
serves the purpose.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.710
Anyway, the choice was A.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.880
And hopefully you learned a
little bit about asymptotes.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.310
Next problem, 41.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.540
Which of the following
represents a hyperbola?

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.940
Let me copy those.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.210
No, which of the following
represents a parabola, they

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.460
want to know.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:23.990
That's too small.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.250
I don't think you
can see that.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.600
I'll get a bigger
version of it.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.975
All right, that's the
bigger version.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.260
There you go.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.870
Which of these represents
a parabola?

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.710
Well, we could just
go one by one.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.980
This is a circle.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.230
That's a circle.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.230
Then you could graph
if you like.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.790
This is an ellipse, where you
just kind of weight the y's

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.840
and the x squareds.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.470
This is an ellipse.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:55.250
If this was a negative, this
would be a hyperbola, ellipse.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.320
This one is a hyperbola
because you have

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.570
this negative here.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.780
This one might not look like
a traditional parabola,

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.950
but it really is.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.660
Because if I were to divide both
sides of this by 4p, I'd

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:12.070
get x is equal to 1 over
4p times y squared.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.690
So it's a sideways parabola.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:15.860
It looks something like this.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.440
If that's the x- and y-axis,
the graph will look

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.680
something like this.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.210
It's going to be a sideways
parabola.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.040
But it's a parabola
nonetheless.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.395
So the choice is C.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.020
We have time for at least
one more, problem 42.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:38.202
They give the following
equation.

00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:39.560
Let me paste it here.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.960
All right, and they say what
is the standard form of the

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.040
equation of the conic
section above?

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.530
And essentially they want us
to complete the square with

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.590
the x's and the y's so we get
that x minus something

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:58.300
squared, over some m plus or
minus y, minus something

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.050
squared, over some constant.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.260
So let's do that.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:07.140
So let's group the x and the y
terms. So you get 4x squared,

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.670
minus 16x, plus something.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.460
That's how we're going to
complete the square.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.350
Then you get plus minus
5y squared.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.470
Let me just minus, and I'll
do plus 5y squared.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:28.630
We have a minus here, so
it becomes plus 30y.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:36.680
And then out here you have
a minus 9 is equal to 0.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.380
Just to simplify it, let's
factor a 4 out of this part.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:49.260
So you get 4 times x squared,
minus 4x, plus something,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:55.340
minus-- let's factor a 5 out--
5, times y squared, plus 6y,

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.550
probably plus something-- and
let's add the 9 to both

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.030
sides-- is equal to 9.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.670
All right, so let's
think about it.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.920
If we wanted to complete the
square here, what do we put

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.300
here to make this a
perfect square?

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.740
If this was a plus 4,
then this would

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.120
be x minus 2 squared.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.890
So we're adding a 4 here.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.000
But we're really adding
a 4 times a 4.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.140
We're really adding a 16
if you think about it.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.740
If I were to redistribute
this, I just added 16.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.150
So if I add 16 to one side of
the equation, I have to add 16

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.260
to the other side
of the equation.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.970
So I'll add 16 there.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.890
To make this a perfect square,
let's see, 1/2 of 6 is 3, so 3

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.490
squared is 9.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.290
But I'm really adding
a 5 times a 9.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.420
I could redistribute the 5.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.470
I really added a 45.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.000
Oh, no, no, no.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.610
I added a minus 5 times 9.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.610
I caught myself.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.220
I added a minus 5 times 9.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.210
So I'm really subtracting
45 from that side.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.530
So I have to subtract
45 from that side.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:56.900
And so this simplifies to 4
times x minus 2 squared--

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.110
right, that's x minus two
squared-- minus 5 times-- this

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:08.440
is y plus 3 squared-- is equal
to-- let's see, 9 plus 16 is

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:14.600
25, 25 minus 45.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.670
Let's see, have I made
a mistake someplace?

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.890
25 minus 45, no, that's right.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:26.000
25 minus 45 is minus 20.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.440
And now we can divide both sides
by minus 20, if I did

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.750
this correctly.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.930
We'll divide both sides
by minus 20.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.310
So you get x minus 2 squared.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.920
What's 4 divided by minus 20?

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.800
It's minus 1/5.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.840
Let me just do that.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:55.000
So 4 over minus 20, minus 5,
times y plus 3 squared, over

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.910
minus 20 is equal to 1.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.410
So this is equal to, let's see
this becomes a positive, and

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.060
this one becomes a negative.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.140
So let's put this one first. So
5 over 20 is the same thing

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:11.900
as y plus 3 squared, over
4-- right, that's this

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.490
one-- plus, no, sorry.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.190
We have a minus.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:21.430
Minus-- and this becomes 1/5--
x minus 2 squared, over 5.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.830
That is equal to 1.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.240
We haven't made a careless
mistake.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.100
That is choice B.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.040
See you in the the next video.
