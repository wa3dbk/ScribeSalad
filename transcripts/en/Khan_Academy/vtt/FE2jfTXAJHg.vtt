00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.220
We've already learned that
cellular respiration can be

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.820
broken down into roughly
three phases.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.760
The first is glycolysis, which
literally means the breaking

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.010
down of glucose.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.540
And then this can occur with
or without oxygen.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.590
If we don't have oxygen, then
we go over to fermentation.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.800
We'll talk about that
in the future.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.320
Go over to fermentation
and in humans it

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.750
produces lactic acid.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.150
In other types of organisms
it might

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.200
produce alcohol or ethanol.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.675
But if we have oxygen-- and for
the most part we're going

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:48.690
to assume that we can proceed
forward with oxygen-- if there

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.610
is oxygen, then we could
proceed forward

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.190
to the Krebs cycle.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.750
Sometimes called the citric acid
cycle because it deals

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.390
with citric acid.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.390
The same thing that's in
orange juice or lemons.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.630
And then from there
we proceed to the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.310
electron transport chain.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.750
And we learned in the first
overview video of cellular

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.610
respiration that this is where
the bulk of the ATP is

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.500
actually produced.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.920
Although it uses raw materials
that came out of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.360
these phases up here.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.460
Now what I want to do in this
video is just focus on

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.710
glycolysis.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.080
And this is kind of-- it's
sometimes a challenging task

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.830
because you can really get
stuck in the weeds.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.550
And I'll show you the weeds
in a little bit,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.480
and the actual mechanism.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.750
And it can be very daunting.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.160
But what I want to do is
simplify it for you so you can

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.420
have the big take-aways.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.550
And then we can appreciate, and
then maybe when we look at

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.770
the weeds of glycolysis we
can make a little bit

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.940
more sense of it.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.230
So glycolysis, or really
cellular respiration, it

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.480
starts off with glucose.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.130
And glucose, we know
its formula.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.660
It's C6H12O6.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.850
And I could draw its whole
structure; it would take a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.300
little time.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.270
But I'm just going to focus
on the carbon backbone.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.010
So it is a ring, or
can be a ring.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.700
But I'm just going to draw it
as six carbons in a row.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.950
Now there's two kind of
important phases of glycolysis

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.820
that are good to know.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.420
One, I call the investment
phase.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.000
And the investment phase
actually uses two ATPs.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.270
So you know, the whole purpose
of cellular respiration is to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.650
generate ATPs, but right from
the get-go I actually have to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.360
use two ATPs.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.980
But I use two ATPs and then I'm
essentially going to break

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:50.710
up the glucose into two 3-carbon
compounds right here

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.730
that actually also have a
phosphate group on them.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.690
The phosphate groups are
coming from those ATPs.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.910
They also have a phosphate
group on them and this is

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.520
often called-- well, there's
a lot of names for it.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.910
Sometimes it's called PGAL.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.040
You really don't have
to know this.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.360
Or phosphoglyceraldehyde, really
challenging my spelling

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.420
skills right here.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.420
That's not that important
to know.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.950
All you have to know
is in this first

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.840
phase you use two ATPs.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.350
That's why I call it the
investment phase.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:29.020
If we use a business analogy,
investment phase.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.510
And then each of these two PGAL
molecules can then go

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.350
into the payoff phase.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.480
So in the payoff phase,
each of these

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.280
PGALs turn into pyruvate.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.310
Which is another 3-carbon,
but it's reconfigured.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.670
But the process of it going to
pyruvate-- and let me write

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.130
pyruvate in blue, because this
is something that, at least

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.620
it's good to know the word.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.290
And I'll show you the structure
in a second.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.100
Pyruvate.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.730
Sometimes it's called
pyruvic acid.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.560
Same thing.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.890
And that's essentially the end
product of glycolysis.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.200
So you start off with glucose
in the investment phase.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.480
You end up in this
phosphoglyceraldehyde, which

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.540
essentially you broke up your
glucose and you put a

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.070
phosphate on either end of it.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.310
And then those each
independently go through the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.490
payoff phase.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.029
So you end up with two molecules
of pyruvate for

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.220
every molecule of glucose
you started off with.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.860
Now you're saying, hey, Sal,
there was a payoff phase, what

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.310
was our payoff?

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.710
Well our payoff, we got, for
each-- let me write this down

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.280
as a payoff phase.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.530
This is our payoff phase.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.150
And I apologize for the
white background.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.300
I did it because, the mechanism
I'm showing you, I

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.800
copy-and-pasted it from
Wikipedia, and they had a

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.390
white background so I just ran
with the white background for

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.950
this video.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.910
But I, personally at least, like
the black background a

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.040
lot better.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.750
But this is the payoff
phase right here.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.990
And so when we go from the
phosphoglyceraldehyde to the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.080
pyruvate or the pyruvic acid,
we produce two things.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.420
Or I guess we could say we
produce three things.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.860
We produce, each of
these PGALs to

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.450
pyruvates produce two ATPs.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.880
So I'm going to produce two
ATPs there, I'm going to

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.490
produce two ATPs there.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.410
And then they each
produce an NADH.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.820
And I'll do it in
a darker color.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.070
NADH.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.910
And of course they're not
producing the whole molecule

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.800
in a vacuum.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.450
Essentially what they're doing
is they're starting with the

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.640
raw material of an NAD plus-- so
they start off with an NAD

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.260
plus-- and they essentially
reduce

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.150
it by adding a hydrogen.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.170
Remember, we learned a couple
of videos ago that you could

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.830
view reduction as a
gain in hydrogen.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.110
So the NAD gets reduced
to NADH.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.110
And then later on, these NADHs
are used in electron transport

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.470
chain to actually
produce ATPs.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.090
So the big take-away here, if
I were to write the reaction

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.390
that we get for glycolysis,
is that you

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.640
start off with a glucose.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.520
And you need some NAD plus.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.870
And actually, for every mole
of glucose, you're going to

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.540
need two NAD plusses.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.990
You're going to need two ATPs.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.860
So I'm just writing all the
ingredients that we need to

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.350
start off with.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.750
And then you're going to need--
well, let me say, these

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.290
guys are going to be ADPs before
we turn them to ATPs.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.550
So I'll write plus four ADPs.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.150
And then, after performing
glycolysis-- and

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.840
let me write it here.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.055
Let me write also-- sorry
that was ADPs.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.970
Let me just rewrite that
part right there.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.540
Four ADPs.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.390
And then you maybe need
two phosphate groups.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.820
Because we're going to need
four phosphate groups.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.540
Plus four-- I'll just call
them, sometimes they're

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.310
written like that.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.440
But maybe I'll write
it like this.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.740
Four phosphate groups.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.790
And then once you perform
glycolysis, you have two

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:37.680
pyruvates, you have two NADHs.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.190
The NAD has been reduced.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.010
It gained a hydrogen.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:45.850
RIG.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:46.590
OIL RIG.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.850
Reduction is gain an electron.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.200
But in the biological
sense, we think of

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.110
it gaining the hydrogen.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.320
Because hydrogen is very
non-electronegative, so you're

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.260
hogging its electrons.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.020
You've gained its electrons.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.810
So two NADHs and then plus these
two ATPs get used in the

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.720
investment phase.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.390
That's why I kind of wrote
them a little separately.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.860
So these two get used.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.865
So then you're left
with two ADPs.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.630
And then these guys,
essentially,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.750
get turned into ATPs.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.090
So plus four ATPs.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.570
I guess we didn't need four.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.890
We only needed a net of
two phosphate groups.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.570
Because two jump off of here.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.710
And then we need a total
of two more to get

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.560
four jumping on there.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.270
But the big picture is, you
start with a glucose, you end

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.020
up with two pyruvates.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.090
You use up two ATPs.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.909
You get four ATPs.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.559
So you have a net of
two ATPs formed.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.490
Let me write that very big.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.840
Net, what you get out of
glycolysis, is two ATPs.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.290
You get two NADHs that can
each later be used in the

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.600
electron transport chain
to produce three ATPs.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.150
You get two NADHs and you get
two pyruvates, which are going

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.930
to be re-engineered into
acetyl-CoAs that are going to

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.950
be the raw materials for
the Krebs cycle.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:10.690
But these are the outputs
of glycolysis.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.070
So now that we have that big
picture, let's actually look

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.800
at the mechanism.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.730
Because this is a little
bit more daunting

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:16.440
when you see it here.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.970
But we'll see the same themes
that I just talked about.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.000
We're starting with a
glucose right there.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.270
It is a six chain.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.060
It's in a circle, in a ring.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.280
One, two, three, four,
five, six carbons.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.110
I could write it like that,
just to make a huge

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.226
oversimplification.

00:09:34.226 --> 00:09:36.020
It goes through a few steps.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.460
I use an ATP here.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.430
So let me do that in a color.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.310
Let me do it in orange whenever
I use an ATP.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.870
I use one ATP there.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.050
I use one ATP there.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.500
And just like I told you,
they have a slightly

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.370
different name for it.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.880
But this is the

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.040
phosphoglyceraldehyde right here.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.480
They call it glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.850
It's the exact same molecule.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.130
But as you can see, just when I
drew it very roughly before,

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.020
you've got one, two three
carbons there.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.630
And it also has a phosphate
group on it.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.600
The phosphate group's actually
attached to the oxygen.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.160
But for just for simplification
I draw the

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.560
phosphate group just
like that.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.750
And I showed that right here.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.440
This was the

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.535
phosphoglyceraldehyde right here.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.700
This is the actual structure
up here.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.630
But I think sometimes when you
look at the structure it's

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.680
easy to miss the big picture.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.480
And there are two of these.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.600
They kind of say that you can
go back and forth with this,

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.190
with this other kind
of isomer of this.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.740
But the important thing is that
you have two of these

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.950
compounds that are now
3-carbon compounds.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.520
Glucose has been split.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.650
And now we're ready to enter
the payoff phase.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.050
Remember you have two of these
compounds right here.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.610
That's why, when they drew this
mechanism, they wrote

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.310
times two right there.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.650
Because the glucose has
been split into

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.090
two of these molecules.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.810
So each of the molecules
are now going to

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.000
do this right here.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.430
And for each of the
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates,

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.600
or PGALs, or
phosphoglyceraldehyde, we can

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.920
look at the mechanism and say,
OK look here, there's going to

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.270
be an ADP turning into
an ATP there.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.090
So this is plus one ATP.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.410
And then we see it again
happening here

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.710
on our way to pyruvate.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.100
On our way to pyruvate right,
there then we have another

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.330
plus one ATP.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.640
So for each of the PGALs, or
the phosphoglyceraldehydes

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.290
that were produced, we're
producing two ATPs in the

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.200
payoff phase.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.410
Now there were two of these.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.040
So total for one glucose, we're
going to produce four

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.340
ATPs in the payoff phase.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.420
So in the payoff phase,
four ATPs.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.230
In the investment phase
we used one, two ATPs.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.080
So total net ATPs directly
generated from

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.070
glycolysis is two ATPs.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.440
Four, gross produced.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.100
But we had to invest two in
the investment phase.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.090
And then the NADs and the NADHs,
we see right here.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.760
For each phosphoglyceraldehyde,
or

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.700
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates or
PGALs or whatever you want to

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.540
call them, at this stage right
here you see that we are

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.800
reducing NAD plus to NADH.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.935
So this happens once for each
of these compounds.

00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:16.500
And obviously there
are two of these.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.330
Glucose got split into
two of these guys.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.900
So two NADHs are going
to be produced.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.080
And later these are going to
be used in the electron

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:30.900
transport chain to actually
each produce three ATPs.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.870
And then finally, when
everything is said and done,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.250
we're left with the pyruvates.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.715
And it's nice, at least that
they made it nice and big.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:39.550
We can take a look at what
a pyruvate looks like.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.600
And just as promised, we can
look at all the oxygen bonds

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.140
and all that.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.635
But it's a 3-carbon structure.

00:12:45.635 --> 00:12:47.780
It has a 3-carbon backbone.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.340
So the end result is that the
carbon, that the glucose got

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.280
split in half.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.220
It got oxidized.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.960
Some of the hydrogens got
stripped off of it.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.190
As you can see there's only
three hydrogens here.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.810
We started off with 12
hydrogens in glucose.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.750
And now it has its carbons
bonding more

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.830
strongly with oxygen.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.110
So it's essentially having its
electrons stolen by the

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.160
oxygens, or hogged
by the oxygens.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.430
So carbon has gotten oxidized
in this process.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.130
There's going to be more
oxidation left to do.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:20.470
And in the process we were able
to generate two net ATPs

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:26.930
and two NADHs that can later
be used to produce ATPs.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.570
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
