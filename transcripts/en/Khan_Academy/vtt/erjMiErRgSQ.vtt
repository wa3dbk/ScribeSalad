00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.300
In the last video we hopefully
learned the intuition behind

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.450
the ideal gas equation, that
pressure times volume is equal

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.540
to the number of molecules we
have times some constant times

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.620
the temperature.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.740
And that's all nice and it
hopefully it makes sense to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.100
you how all of these
fit together.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.350
That pressure should be inverse
to volume and that's

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.570
why you're multiplying both
sides by each other.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.720
You could take volume
and put it on

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.520
this side of the equation.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.440
Or that pressure should be
proportional to the number of

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.060
particles and the temperature.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.280
But now let's apply it and
actually do some problems.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.720
Because just knowing this
isn't good enough.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:48.036
So let's say that I have a two
liter container, or let's say

00:00:48.036 --> 00:01:03.170
a two liter balloon, containing
hydrogen gas.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.250
And that's hydrogen as
a diatomic molecule.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.570
So each molecule has two
hydrogens in it.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:19.090
And let's say I'm measuring
it at 30 degrees Celsius.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.480
My brain is really
malfunctioning.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.530
And let's say that the pressure
on the outside of the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.560
balloon, we've measured
at two atmospheres.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.550
So my question to you
is how many moles of

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.800
hydrogen do we have?

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.020
So let's apply our ideal
gas equation.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.440
And since we're dealing with
liters and atmospheres, we

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.570
have to make sure
we use the right

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.820
proportionality constant.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.780
So our pressure is given
in atmospheres.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.330
Let me write down all
the units, actually.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:24.460
So we have 2 atmospheres times
our volume is 2 liters, is

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.020
equal to n.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.230
n is the number of particles
we care about, and we care

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.870
about it in moles, but let's
just write n there for now.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.100
Is equal to n times R.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.220
I'll do R in a second.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.870
Times T.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.700
Now you might be tempted to just
put 30 degrees in there.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.220
But in all of these problems--
in fact in general, whenever

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.040
you're doing any of these gas
problems or thermodynamics

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.160
problems, or any time you're
doing math with temperature--

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.900
you should always convert
into Kelvin.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.140
And just as a bit of review as
to what Kelvin is, it's just a

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.030
different scale.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.220
So for example, the lowest
possible temperature that that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.380
can be achieved in the universe,
when you think about

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.620
it in Celsius, let me draw a
little temperature scale here.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.120
So if that's the temperature
scale.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.070
I'll draw two, one for Celsius
and one for Kelvin.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.250
So the lowest possible
temperature that can be

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.970
achieved in the universe, and
when we say the lowest

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.850
possible temperature that means
that the average kinetic

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.480
energy of the molecules
or the atoms are zero.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.980
They're just not moving.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.690
They're just stationary.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:49.900
So in Celsius, it's minus
273.15 degrees Celsius.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.910
So zero might be some
place over here.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.730
Zero, that's where
water freezes.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.620
And then 100 degrees, that's
where water boils.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.560
And you can immediately see,
the whole Celsius scale was

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.530
made based on the freezing
point and the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.230
boiling point of water.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.420
So look at this and you say, if
I have something that's 5

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.870
degrees and I have another thing
that's 10 degrees, when

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.079
you look at the Celsius scale,
you're like, oh, maybe the 10

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.089
degree thing it has twice
as much energy as

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.899
the 5 degree thing.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.370
It has twice the temperature.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.380
But when you look at it from the
absolute distance to zero.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.880
Let me see if I can draw this.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.970
So the 10 degree is all the way
over here and the 5 degree

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.050
is almost as far.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.630
So the 10 degrees Celsius is
only a slight increment over 5

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.090
degrees Celsius, if you were
to divide the two.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.830
It's not twice as hot.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.660
And that's why they came up
with the Kelvin scale.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.795
Because in the Kelvin scale,
absolute zero is defined as 0.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.520
So this right here is
zero degrees Kelvin.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.510
And so zero degrees Kelvin
is absolute zero.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.100
So what is zero degrees
Celsius?

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.870
And the increments
are the same.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.350
One degree change in
Celsius is one

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.590
degree change in Kelvin.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.500
So at least they keep it,
it's just a shift.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.620
So this is going to be plus
273 degrees Kelvin.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.670
And then 5 degrees would be plus
278; ' 10 degrees would

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.260
be plus 283 Kelvin.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.790
And then you see that 5 and 10
degrees really aren't that

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.900
different from each other.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.510
But in general, if you want to
convert from Celsius to Kelvin

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.350
you just add 273 degrees.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.590
So 30 degrees Celsius is what?

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.740
Well, this 5 and 10 I drew
too close to 100.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.400
But let's say it's
sitting here.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.850
It would be 303 degrees
Kelvin.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.630
All right, so now for our
temperature, that's what we

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.250
were worried about.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.990
We wanted to put in the
temperature there.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.820
So now we can put in our
303 degrees Kelvin.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.240
Now we have to figure out what
constant to use here.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.480
And I've written a couple
of down here.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.950
Remember, we're dealing with
atmospheres and liters.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.080
So I wrote down a couple of
versions of R right here.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.530
Let's see we're dealing with
atmospheres and liters.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.960
And in the denominator we're
always dealing with mole and

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.060
Kelvin no matter what.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.280
So those are always
going to be there.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.640
So we should use this
proportionality constant.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.620
R is equal to 0.082 liter
atmospheres per mole Kelvin.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.210
Let me write that down.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.870
So let me rewrite our whole
equation actually.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:41.420
So I have 2 atmospheres times 2
liters is equal to n times,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:51.290
I have a bad memory, 0.082 liter
atmospheres per mole

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:57.750
Kelvin, times 303
degrees Kelvin.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.350
So let's see what we can do.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.940
Let's see if all of the
units work out.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.520
So we can always, when you do
dimensional analysis, you can

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.340
treat units like numbers.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.770
So if you divide both sides of
this equation by atmospheres,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.720
the atmospheres cancel out.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.260
Divide both sides of this
equation by liters, liters

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.230
cancel out.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.400
You have a Kelvin in the
numerator, Kelvin in the

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.200
denominator, that cancels out.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.200
And so we have 2 times
2 is equal to n

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.910
times 0.082 times 303.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.740
And then we have just a per mole
and a 1 over the mole.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.030
So to solve for n, or the number
of moles, what we do is

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.570
we divide both sides of this
equation by all of this stuff.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:53.720
So we get 2 times 2 is 4.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:01.260
4 divided by 0.082
divided by 303.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.110
I'm just taking this and putting
it on the left-hand

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.870
side, dividing both
sides by it.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.665
And when you divide by a per
mole, if you put a 1 over a

00:08:07.665 --> 00:08:08.890
mole here, that's the
same thing as

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.140
multiplying by a mole.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.340
So it's good, the units
all worked out.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.460
We're getting n in
terms of moles.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.890
And so we just have to get the
calculator out and figure out

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.100
how many moles we're
dealing with.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:28.590
So we have 4 divided
by 0.082 divided by

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:33.080
303 is equal to 0.16.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.960
If we wanted to go more
digits, .161,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.500
but we'll just round.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:45.430
So this is equal to
0.16 moles of H2.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:51.010
I am telling you actually here,
the exact number of

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.280
hydrogen molecules.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.840
But if you wanted a number,
you'd just multiply this times

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.810
6.02 times 10 to the 23 and then
you would have a number

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.930
in kind of the traditional
sense.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.990
And of course, if you wanted
to know what is the mass of

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:10.600
the hydrogen you have. You'd
say, OK well one mole of H2

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.850
has a mass of what?

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.550
The mass of one hydrogen is
one atomic mass unit.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.250
The mass of two hydrogen when
it's in its molecular form, is

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.580
two atomic mass units.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.650
So a mole of it is going
to be 2 grams.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.270
So in this case, we
have 0.16 moles.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.490
So if we wanted to convert that
to grams, this in the

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:41.310
case of these hydrogen gas
molecules would be 0.32 grams.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.100
And I just multiplied it by 2
because each mole is 2 grams.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.510
Anyway, I hope you found
that useful.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.070
I'm going to do a bunch more
of these problems.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.420
Because I think the math is
pretty straightforward here.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.320
The thing that always makes it
daunting, I think, is the

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.610
units and making sure you're
using the right units.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.990
What is they are using meters
cubed instead of liters, or

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.040
kilopascals instead
of atmospheres.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.420
So I'll try to do a bunch of
examples where we use all the

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.820
different units and you're able
to pick our constants

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.070
appropriately.
