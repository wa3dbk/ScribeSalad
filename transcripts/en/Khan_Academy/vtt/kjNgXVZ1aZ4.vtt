00:00:00.798 --> 00:00:02.015
- [Voiceover] So, where we left off,

00:00:02.015 --> 00:00:04.581
we were looking at this,
this parametric function

00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:06.933
for a three dimensional
curve, and what it draws,

00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:10.451
I showed you, was a helix
in three dimensional space.

00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:12.378
And, we're trying to find it's curvature,

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.572
which...the way you think about that,

00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:15.977
you have a circle...

00:00:15.977 --> 00:00:17.800
You're thinking of the
circle that most closely

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.681
hugs that curve, or you could imagine

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.734
you're flying a spaceship
and all your instruments

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:25.080
lock up when you're turning,
and you're wondering

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.774
what circle in space
you're going to trace out,

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:29.932
and you're looking for one
divided by the radius of that.

00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:32.417
Or if you prefer my,
you know, kindergartner

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:34.576
drawing skills, you could
just look at the helix

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.917
over here while we work it through.

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:39.584
And, the part where we left off,

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:42.150
we had this tangent vector function.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.830
This unit tangent vector
function for our curve.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.989
So at every given value, T, whatever point

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.032
that corresponds to on the curve,

00:00:50.032 --> 00:00:52.772
this function is going
to give us the vector

00:00:52.772 --> 00:00:55.872
that is of unit length
and tangent to the curve.

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:58.287
And the ultimate goal,
for curvature, is to find

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:02.664
the derivative of that
unit tangent vector,

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:04.952
with respect to arclength.

00:01:04.952 --> 00:01:07.227
And specifically we want it's magnitude.

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:09.804
And what that typically
requires, and I talked

00:01:09.804 --> 00:01:11.604
about this in the videos on the formula,

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.553
is you take it's derivative, with respect

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:16.410
to the parameter, T, because

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.966
that's the thing you can actually do,

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.671
and that might not correspond
to unit length, right?

00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:22.668
If you nudge the parameter,
T, that might not

00:01:22.668 --> 00:01:26.070
nudge you a corresponding
length on the curve.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.344
But you correct that by
dividing out, by the derivative

00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:33.872
of the parameterization
function, with respect to T.

00:01:33.872 --> 00:01:35.670
And that's actually arclength,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.837
this magnitude of the derivative
of the parameterization

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.328
with respect to T.

00:01:42.328 --> 00:01:44.023
Boy, is that a hard word.

00:01:44.023 --> 00:01:46.786
So, with our given
function, let's go ahead

00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:48.121
and start doing that.

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.060
And I think first, given
that we have this kind of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.103
fractions and fractions
form, I'm just going

00:01:52.103 --> 00:01:55.307
to start by writing it a
little bit more simply.

00:01:55.307 --> 00:01:57.026
So our unit tangent vector function,

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:59.661
that first component,
where we're dividing by

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.041
the square root of 26 divided by five,

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.038
instead I'm just going to write that as

00:02:04.038 --> 00:02:07.075
negative five times the sine of t.

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:10.337
So, I'm just kind of moving
that five up into the numerator,

00:02:10.337 --> 00:02:13.855
divided by the root of 26,
and I'll do the same thing

00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:17.755
for cosine, where we move that
five up into the numerator.

00:02:17.755 --> 00:02:21.755
Cosine of t, divided by
the root of 26, and then

00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:26.754
the last part, one fifth
divided by square root

00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:30.097
of 26 fifths, gives us just one divided

00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:31.847
by square root of 26.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:38.236
Alright, so the first step in
using our curvature formula

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:41.255
is going to be to take the
derivative of this guy, right?

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:44.888
We need the derivative of
the tangent vector function.

00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:46.595
So, we go ahead and start doing that.

00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:50.762
We see that d big T, d little
t, so tangent vector function

00:02:51.727 --> 00:02:54.188
parameter, is equal to, and
we just take the derivative

00:02:54.188 --> 00:02:56.011
of each component.

00:02:56.011 --> 00:03:00.178
So, negative five sine goes
to negative five cosine.

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:07.389
And we divide out by the
constant, square root of 26.

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.593
Similarly, five cosine
goes to negative five sine,

00:03:10.593 --> 00:03:14.831
since the derivative of
cosine is negative sine.

00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:18.788
Negative five sine divided
by 26, or square root of 26.

00:03:18.788 --> 00:03:21.474
And the last component is just a constant,

00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:25.026
so derivative is nothing, it's zero.

00:03:25.026 --> 00:03:27.282
Next step, we're going
to take the magnitude

00:03:27.282 --> 00:03:28.833
of that vector that we just found.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.969
So we're trying to find the
magnitude of the derivative

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.210
of the tangent vector function.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.928
So we say alright.

00:03:34.928 --> 00:03:37.028
Magnitude of what we just found,

00:03:37.028 --> 00:03:39.695
d big T, d little t, involves...

00:03:41.732 --> 00:03:45.331
so this magnitude will
be the square root of,

00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:47.815
make the little tic there,
square root of the sum

00:03:47.815 --> 00:03:49.208
of the squares of these guys.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:53.794
So the square of that first
component is going to be 25,

00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:56.394
multiply by cosine squared,

00:03:56.394 --> 00:03:58.218
cosine squared of t,

00:03:58.218 --> 00:04:01.097
all divided by 26, right, because the

00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:04.264
square of the square root of 26 is 26.

00:04:05.137 --> 00:04:08.970
And then we add to that
25 times sine squared,

00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:14.694
sine squared of t, also divided by 26.

00:04:18.087 --> 00:04:21.350
And from that, we can factor out,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.933
factor out 25 over 26,
inside that radical,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.424
because both terms involve
multiplying by 25 and

00:04:29.424 --> 00:04:32.106
dividing by 26, and what
we're left with is a

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:34.381
nice, and friendly cosine/sine pair.

00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:36.901
The reason we love
things involving circles.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:37.923
This always happens.

00:04:37.923 --> 00:04:39.385
Nice cancellation.

00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:42.133
This just becomes one, so what we're left

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:45.300
with on the whole, is root 25 over 26.

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:49.064
Pretty nice.

00:04:49.064 --> 00:04:51.038
Root 25 over 26.

00:04:51.038 --> 00:04:53.221
So for a curvature equation, we go up

00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:55.183
and we can start plugging that in.

00:04:55.183 --> 00:04:58.193
So we just found that
numerator, and found that it was

00:04:58.193 --> 00:05:01.276
the square root of 25, divided by 26.

00:05:03.885 --> 00:05:06.395
The entire thing, 25 over 26.

00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:09.354
And we already found the magnitude

00:05:09.354 --> 00:05:10.688
of the derivative itself.

00:05:10.688 --> 00:05:12.407
That's one of the things we needed to do

00:05:12.407 --> 00:05:13.533
to find the tangent vector.

00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:16.950
That's where this 26 over five came from.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.314
I deleted it from where we
did last video to make room,

00:05:20.314 --> 00:05:22.089
but if you look at the
last video, you can see

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:25.468
where we got the square
root of 26 divided by five.

00:05:25.468 --> 00:05:28.208
And I'll actually write
that as square root of

00:05:28.208 --> 00:05:32.125
26 divided by 25, just
that's how we originally

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:37.113
found it, I'm just putting the
five back under the radical.

00:05:37.113 --> 00:05:39.225
And it's tempting, if you
aren't looking too closely,

00:05:39.225 --> 00:05:41.095
to think these guys cancel
out, but it's actually

00:05:41.095 --> 00:05:42.766
they're the opposite of each other, right?

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:46.134
One is 25 over 26 the other is 26 over 25.

00:05:46.134 --> 00:05:48.549
So if we put everything
under the radical there

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:51.706
it's going to say equals the square root.

00:05:51.706 --> 00:05:55.873
And we're going to have 25
over 26, divided by 26 over 25

00:05:58.812 --> 00:06:02.527
and when we flip that bottom and multiply,

00:06:02.527 --> 00:06:06.527
what we get is 25 squared
divided by 26 squared.

00:06:10.248 --> 00:06:14.056
And the root of that whole
thing, just gives us 25

00:06:14.056 --> 00:06:16.973
over 26, and that is our curvature.

00:06:18.386 --> 00:06:20.232
That right there, is the answer.

00:06:20.232 --> 00:06:21.567
That is the curvature.

00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:23.007
So it's a little bit greater than one.

00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:24.156
No, no, sorry.

00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:25.679
So, it's a little bit less than one,

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:27.233
which means that you're
curving a little bit less

00:06:27.233 --> 00:06:30.716
than you would if it was
a circle with radius one.

00:06:30.716 --> 00:06:33.154
Which kind of makes sense if
we look at the image here,

00:06:33.154 --> 00:06:36.149
because if the helix were
completely flattened out, right,

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.333
if you imagine squishing
this down onto the xy plane,

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:41.107
you'd just be going around
a circle with radius one.

00:06:41.107 --> 00:06:42.874
But by kind of pulling that spring and

00:06:42.874 --> 00:06:44.973
pulling it so that there's a z component,

00:06:44.973 --> 00:06:47.074
you're making it a
little bit more straight.

00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:49.187
So, the curvature should
go down a little bit,

00:06:49.187 --> 00:06:51.057
because it's becoming a
little bit more straight.

00:06:51.057 --> 00:06:52.810
The radius of curvature will go up.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.771
So that's the curvature of a helix,

00:06:55.771 --> 00:06:58.174
and that's a pretty good
example of how you can find

00:06:58.174 --> 00:07:00.391
the curvature by walking through directly,

00:07:00.391 --> 00:07:03.050
the idea of finding dt/ds.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.174
And you know, getting
that unit tangent vector.

00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:07.276
Getting the little unit arclength.

00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:10.933
And in the next example, I
think I'll go through one

00:07:10.933 --> 00:07:12.755
where you just use the formula.

00:07:12.755 --> 00:07:14.648
Where it's something a
little bit more complicated

00:07:14.648 --> 00:07:17.214
than thinking about this and
you turn to the formula itself.

00:07:17.214 --> 00:07:18.366
And I'll see you then.
