00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.920
Let's do another problem
with repeated roots.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.375
So let's say our differential
equation is the second

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:15.620
derivative of y minus the first
derivative plus 0.25--

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.800
that's what's written here--
0.25y is equal to 0.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.100
And they've actually given us
some initial conditions.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:32.750
They said that y of 0 is equal
to 2, and y prime of 0 is

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.550
equal to 1/3.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.130
So like we've done in every
one of these constant

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.360
coefficient linear second order
homogeneous differential

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.820
equations, let's get the
characteristic equation.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:54.360
So that's r squared minus r
plus 0.25-- or we can even

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.726
call it plus 1/4.

00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:59.020
So let's see, when I just
inspected this, it always

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.310
confuses me when I
have fractions.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.740
So it becomes very
hard to factor.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.750
So let's just do the
quadratic formula.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.770
So the roots of this are
going to be r is

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.410
equal to negative b.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.930
Well, b is negative 1.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.580
So negative b is
going to be 1.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.780
Plus or minus the square
root of b squared.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.860
b is negative 1.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.530
So that squared is 1.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.920
Minus 4 times a, which
is 1, times c.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.970
Well, 4 times 1 times
0.25, that's 1.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.470
Ah-ha.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.570
So notice that when you have a
repeated root, this under the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.430
square root becomes 0.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.970
And that makes sense, because
it's this plus or minus in the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.360
quadratic formula that gives you
two roots, whether they be

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.210
real or complex.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.100
But if the square root is 0,
you're adding plus or minus 0

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.520
and you're only left
with one root.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.060
Anyway, we're not done yet.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.830
What's the denominator of
a quadratic equation?

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.470
2a.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.860
So a is 1, so over 2.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.080
So our one repeated root is 1
plus or minus 0 over 2, or it

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.230
equals 1/2.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.110
And like we learned in the last
video, you might just

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.150
say, oh well, maybe the solution
is just y is equal to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.460
ce to the 1/2 x.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.450
But like we pointed out last
time, you have two initial

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.230
conditions.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.060
And this solution is not general
enough for two initial

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.740
conditions.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.630
And then last time, we said,
OK, if this isn't general

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.610
enough, maybe some solution that
was some function of x

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.990
times e to the 1/2 x, maybe that
would be our solution.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.980
And we said, it turns
out it is.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.140
And so that more general
solution that we found, that

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.030
we figured out that v of x
is actually equal to some

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.290
constant plus x times
some other constant.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:56.170
So our more general solution is
y is equal to c1 times e to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.460
the 1/2 x soon. plus c2
times xe to the 1/2 x.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.380
I forgot the x here.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.530
Let me draw a line here so
you don't get confused.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.920
Anyway, that's the reasoning.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.050
That's how we came up
with this thing.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.300
And it is good to know.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.200
Because later on when you want
to know more theory of

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.840
differential equations-- and
that's really the whole point

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.450
about learning this if your
whole goal isn't just to pass

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.090
an exam-- it's good to know.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.210
But when you're actually solving
these you could just

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.540
kind of know the template.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.200
If I have a repeated root, well
I just put that repeated

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.390
root twice, and one of them gets
an x in front of it, and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.700
they have two constants.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.570
Anyway, this is our general
solution and now we can use

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.490
our initial conditions to
solve for c1 and c2.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.950
So let's just figure out the
derivative of this first. So

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.150
it becomes easy to substitute
in for c2.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:04:01.410
So y prime is equal to 1/2 c1
e to the 1/2 x, plus-- now

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.102
this becomes a little bit more
complicated, we're going to

00:04:03.102 --> 00:04:08.520
have to use the product rule
here-- so plus c2 times--

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.320
derivative of x is 1-- times
e to the 1/2 x, that's the

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.140
product rule.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.959
Plus the derivative of e
to the 1/2 x times x.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:26.620
So that's 1/2 xe to the 1/2 x.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.930
Or we can write-- I don't want
to lose this stuff up here--

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:38.940
we can write that it equals--
let's see, I have 1/2-- so I

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.210
have c2 times e to the 1/2
x and I have 1/2 times c1

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.050
e to the 1/2 x.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.360
So I could say, it's equal
to e to the 1/2 x

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.370
times c1 over 2.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.340
That's that.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.190
Plus c2.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:01.945
That takes care of these two
terms. Plus c2 over 2

00:05:01.945 --> 00:05:06.250
xe to the 1/2 x.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.370
And now let's use our
initial conditions.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.030
And let me actually clear up
some space, because I think

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.340
it's nice to have our initial
conditions up here where we

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.400
can see them.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.800
So let me delete all
this stuff here.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.910
That, hopefully, makes
sense to you by now.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.670
You know the characteristic
equation.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.860
We figured out the general
solu-- I don't want to erase

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.740
our initial conditions-- we
figured out the general

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.040
solution was this.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.030
I'll keep our general
solution there.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.640
And so, now we just substitute
our initial conditions into

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.950
our general solution and the
derivative of the general

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.510
solution, and hopefully we can
get meaningful answers.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.010
So substituting into our general
solution, y of 0 is

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.680
equal to 2.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.940
So y is equal to 2 when
x is equal to 0.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.386
So c1-- when x is equal
to 0, all the e terms

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:56.370
you become 1, right?

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.440
This one will become 1.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.890
And then notice, we have
an xe to the 0.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.390
So now this x is 0.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.880
So this whole term is going
to be equal to 0.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.890
So we're done. c1
is equal to 2.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.430
That was pretty straightforward.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.500
This x actually made
it a lot easier.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.290
So c1 is equal to 2.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.750
And now we can use
the derivative.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.710
So let's see, this is the
first derivative.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.530
And I'll substitute c1
in there so we can

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.420
just solve for c2.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:30.280
So our first derivative is y
prime is equal to-- let's see

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:40.790
c1-- 1/2 plus c2-- so it's--
well I'll write this first--

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.100
it's equal to 2 over 2.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:56.006
So it's 1 plus c2 times e to the
1/2 x plus c2 over 2 times

00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:58.950
xe to the 1/2 x.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.370
There was an x here.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.600
So when x is equal to 0, y
prime is equal to 1/3.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.810
So 1/3 is equal to-- well, x is
equal to 0, this'll be 1--

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.440
so it's equal to 1 plus c2.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.610
And then this term, when x is
equal to 0, this whole thing

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.300
becomes 0, right?

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.400
Because this x just cancels
out the whole thing.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.310
You multiply by 0 you get 0.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.950
So then we get 1/3 is equal to 1
plus c2, or that c2 is equal

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.830
to 1/3 of minus 1 is
equal to minus 2/3.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.010
And now we have our particular
solution.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.980
Let me write it down and
put a box around it.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.380
So this is our general
solution.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.680
Our particular solution, given
these initial conditions for

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.890
this repeated root problem, is
y is equal to c1-- we figured

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:52.640
that out to be 2 fairly
quickly-- 2e to the 1/2 x plus

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.640
c2. c2 is minus 2/3.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:01.940
So minus 2/3 xe to the 1/2 x.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.300
And we are done.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.580
There is our particular
solution.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.940
So once again, kind of
the proof of how

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.160
do you get to this.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.420
Why is there this x in there?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.384
And it wasn't a proof, it was
really more of just to show

00:08:12.384 --> 00:08:14.240
you the intuition of where
that came from.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.350
And it did introduce you to a
method called, reduction of

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.200
order, to figure out what that
function v was, which ended up

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.280
just being c1 plus c2 times x.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.800
But all that can be pretty
complicated.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.790
But you see that once you know
the pattern, or once you know

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.970
that this is going to be the
general solution, they're

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.870
pretty easy to solve.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.400
Characteristic equation.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.080
Get your general solution.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.340
Figure out the derivative
of the general solution.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.690
And then substitute your initial
conditions to solve

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.470
for your constants.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.799
And you're done.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.840
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.240
And actually, we're going to
start solving non-homogeneous

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.630
differential equations.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.880
