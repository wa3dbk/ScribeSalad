00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.820
We just finished, hopefully,
getting intuition for why my

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.130
initial pressure times my
initial volume divided by my

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.290
initial temperature is going
to equal-- if I change the

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.540
volume, the pressure, the
temperature, or some

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.820
combination of all of them,
it's going to equal my new

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.780
pressure times my new volume
divided by my new temperature.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.540
And once again, just remember
all of this-- pressure times

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.750
volume is proportional to the
amount of kinetic energy in

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.660
the system, and temperature is
proportional to the amount of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.500
kinetic energy per molecule.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.490
If we don't change the number of
molecules, the amount-- and

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.010
since by the conservation of
energy, the amount of kinetic

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.270
energy isn't going to change
unless we do some work, or get

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.120
some potential energy-- these
quantities and this

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.240
relationship won't change.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.730
Watch the last video, and
hopefully you'll get some

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.830
intuition-- if it's still
confusing, I'll make another

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.040
video for you guys.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.230
Before I apply this equation--
this is going to get you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.860
pretty far in thermodynamics
just knowing this, and even

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.700
more just having the intuition
of what it means.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.630
I want to clarify something
about temperature-- there's a

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.280
lot of different ways to
measure temperature.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.720
We know that in Fahrenheit,
what's freezing of water?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.590
It's 32 degrees Fahrenheit
that's freezing, but that's

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.080
also 0 degrees Celsius--
actually, that's how the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.170
Celsius scale was determined.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.470
They said, where does water
freeze, and then where does

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.580
water boil?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.970
100 degrees for Celsius
is boiling, and that's

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.190
how they rated it.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.130
You could be colder than the
freezing of water, and you'd

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.120
have to go negative in that
situation-- Fahrenheit, I'm

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.520
actually not sure.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.380
I need to look that up in
Wikipedia, or that might be

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.150
something for you to do, and
tell me how it came out.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.610
I think the boiling of water in
Fahrenheit is 212 degrees,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.710
so it's a little arbitrary.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.790
I think Fahrenheit might be
somehow related to human body

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.910
temperature, but I'm
just guessing.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.660
You can have different scales
in this situation, and they

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.230
were all kind of
a bit arbitrary

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.690
when they were designed.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.520
They were just to have some type
of relative to scale--

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.460
you could say when things are
boiling, they're definitely

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.370
hotter because they have a
higher temperature then when

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.620
things are freezing.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.790
You can't divide 100 by zero,
but if something is 1 degree,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.990
is it necessarily the case that
something that is 100

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.160
degrees Celsius is a hundred
times hotter, or has a hundred

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.280
times the kinetic energy?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.040
Actually, what we'll see is that
no, it's actually not the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.540
case-- you don't have 100 times
the kinetic energy, so

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.440
this is a bit of an
arbitrary scale.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.690
The actual interval is
arbitrary-- you could pick the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.900
1 degree as being one hundredth
of the distance

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.160
between zero and 100, but where
you start-- at least in

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.540
the Celsius scale-- is
a bit arbitrary.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.690
They picked the freezing
of water.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.340
Later on, people figured out
that there is an absolute

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.390
point to start at.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.430
And that absolute point to start
at is the temperature at

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.230
which a molecule or an atom has

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.150
absolutely no kinetic energy.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.910
Because we said temperature is
equal to the average kinetic

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.310
energy of the system, or the
total kinetic energy of the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.870
system divided by the
number of molecules.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.840
Or we could also
say the average

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.390
kinetic energy per molecule.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.940
The only way to really say that
the temperature is zero--

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.230
and this is proportional,
because the temperature scales

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.370
are still a little bit
arbitrary-- the only way to

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.120
get to a temperature of zero
should be when the kinetic

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.070
energy of each and every
molecule is zero, or the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.635
average kinetic energy.

00:03:47.635 --> 00:03:51.220
So they're not moving, they're
not vibrating, they're not

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.220
even blinking-- these molecules
are stationary.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.645
The point at which that occurs
is called absolute zero.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.330
That actually occurs-- absolute
zero, which is also

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:16.149
called zero Kelvin, and that is
the same thing as minus 273

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.579
degrees Celsius.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.570
Nowhere in the universe, at
least that I'm aware of, it is

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.020
it colder than minus 273 degrees
Celsius-- at that

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.810
temperature, nothing moves,
even at the atomic scale.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.940
I'm talking that the electrons
collapse into the nucleus--

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.230
everything is completely
stationary at zero Kelvin.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.250
It's a theoretical absolute
limit-- maybe we'll do a bunch

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.390
of videos on how you can get
close to that, but in

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.900
laboratory environments or maybe
in deep space, it gets

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.270
really, really close to this.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.400
I'm pretty sure nowhere in the
universe do we have absolutely

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.280
zero Kelvin, or at least in any
place where we actually

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.560
have particles, but I might be
wrong there-- that's a little

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.910
bit out of the scope of what
we're talking about.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.840
The true way to measure
temperature is in Kelvin.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.460
When you're measuring in Kelvin,
if I say-- I have

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.360
something that is 1 kelvin
versus something that is 5

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.560
kelvin, since we nailed down the
bottom at a point at which

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.530
really do not have kinetic
energy, I can make the

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.410
statement that this has five
times the energy of something

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.600
that's at 5 Kelvin
versus 1 Kelvin.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.300
That whole long explanation
about Kelvin, that was to just

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.140
to make the point that whenever
we use this formula,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.440
or really any formula in
thermodynamics that involves

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.160
temperature, we should convert
to Kelvin, unless we're just

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.300
doing change in temperature.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.550
Then you could you could
probably keep it Celsius, but

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.910
when you're doing
proportionality, or you're

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.400
using it for multiplying or
dividing by temperature, you

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.500
have to use Kelvin.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.360
Hopefully, I made a little
bit clear of why that is.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.610
Let's do an example.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.690
You'd be surprised how
far this takes you.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.880
Really, the main trick is
just to remember to

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.890
convert things to Kelvin.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.780
That's the number one reason why
people miss questions on

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.610
thermodynamics exams-- is that
they didn't convert to Kelvin.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.680
This problem is very typical of
most of what you'll see--

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.150
this is from the Barron's AP
physics B on page 226.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.320
It says a confined gas is a
temperature of 27 degrees, so

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.520
its initial temperature
is 27 degrees Celsius.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:51.640
It has a pressure of 1,000
pascals, or newtons per meter

00:06:51.640 --> 00:07:01.270
squared, and the volume
is 30 meters.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.650
I think in one of the early
videos, I think I said newtons

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.080
per meter cubed, but it's
newtons per meter squared-- I

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.470
just want to make sure I
didn't confuse people

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.420
previously, so that's
the initial volume.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.760
It says the volume is decreased,
so then we go to

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.650
this date, where my new
volume is going to

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.270
be 20 meters cubed.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.610
The new temperature is
increased, and so the new

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.380
temperature is now 50
degrees Celsius.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.555
They want to know what
is the new pressure?

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.500
Before we just substitute into
the equation, and solve for

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.890
the new pressure, remember--
if they gave it to you in

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.390
Celsius, convert to Kelvin.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.460
If they gave it to you in
Fahrenheit, which they seldom

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.310
do, then convert into Celsius,
and then convert to Kelvin.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.200
We already know that zero
Kelvin is equal

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.450
to minus 273 Celsius.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:06.720
Or another way you could say it
is x Kelvin is equal to--

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.200
essentially, whatever degree you
get in Celsius, you just

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.370
add 273 to it.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.560
Does that make sense?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.440
Think of it this way: if
you're at zero degrees

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:28.480
Celsius, you're already 273
degrees above zero Kelvin.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.720
Think about that, and hopefully
that makes sense--

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.650
maybe you want to draw a number
line just to make sure.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.100
Whatever Celsius degree you
have, just add 273 to it, and

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.350
you'll get Kelvin.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.340
Add 273 to 27 degrees Celsius,
and that's 300 Kelvin, and

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.510
then 50 degrees Celsius
is-- add 273 to it.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:01.170
So 50 plus 273 is 323,
so now we can

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.330
substitute into this formula.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:12.560
P1, 1,000 pascals times V1 times
30 divided by the first

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.630
temperature-- remember
to do it in Kelvin--

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.260
300, is equal to P2.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.450
We don't know what that is.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:29.970
P2 times V2 times 20 divided by
our new temperature, 323.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.770
We can simplify this: we could
take two 0's off of here, take

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.450
two 0's off of here, then you
could take a 3 out of here,

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.620
and then take a 3 out of here,
and we're left with 100.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:50.050
This is equal to 100-- that was
30,000 divided by 300, and

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.500
so that's 100 on the
left-hand side.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:10:01.590
So we have 100 is equal to
P times 20 over 323.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.390
I'm running out of time.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:13.060
If I were to solve for it, 323
times 100 divided by 20

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:18.890
equals-- so my new pressure
is 1,615 pascals.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.780
I just solved this equation,
and the hard part was

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.050
converting to Kelvin.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.810
See you in the next video.
