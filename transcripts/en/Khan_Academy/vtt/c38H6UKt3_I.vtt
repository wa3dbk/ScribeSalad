00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.170
Let's say I've got a rope.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.580
That's my rope.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.220
And what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to take the left end

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.910
of the rope, and I'm going
to jerk it up,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.070
and then back down.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.190
And we're going to talk about
what happens or what possibly

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.460
gets formed.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.140
So if I take it up over here,
it's going to, obviously, take

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.300
the string to the right
of it up with it.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.170
And the string is going to
look something like this.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.030
It's going to look something
like that.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.060
Now I'm going to immediately
jerk it back down.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.470
And as it passes, let's see what
the rope will look like

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.160
when the left-hand point is at
its original position again.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.690
So the left-hand point-- I've
pulled it back down.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.800
But in the last time period,
this part of the rope had some

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.320
type of an upward velocity.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.940
You could imagine that way.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.340
And even after that point, even
though this left-hand

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.720
point starts getting pulled
down, this point right here

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.080
still has some upward
momentum.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.430
So it's still going to keep
moving up, maybe at a slower

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.710
pace because it's starting
to be tugged down by

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.550
the rope on its left.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.130
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.099
And it's going to bring the
rope to its right with it.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.032
So the rope will look
something like this.

00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:10.480
The rope might look something
like that.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.600
And then I'm going to take this
guy-- this was just an

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.160
intermediate position on the
way to being pulled all the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.410
way down here.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.560
So what's the rope going
to look like now?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.160
Well.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.820
This guy, he had some momentum
that got him there.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.490
But then all of that velocity
will essentially go to zero

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.850
because he's being tugged
by the rope to the left.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.580
And now, he's going to
switch directions.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.820
And he will have gotten
here, at that point.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.770
The point on the line that was
here-- on the purple period of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.780
time-- it had some
upward momentum.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.000
So it's just going to keep
going, on maybe a slower pace.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.400
It'll be there and it will bring
the rest of the rope to

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.290
the right of it with it.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.650
So now my rope is going to
look something like this.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.410
And then finally, where I'm
going to jerk the rope back to

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.710
its original position-- so this
left-hand point is going

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.180
to be there.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.580
This guy, in the previous
time period,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.060
was moving down rapidly.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.840
So he might get there ready to
switch directions again.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.780
This guy will start
moving down.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.080
This guy, right here, he had
some upward momentum.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.590
So he's going to be up
in this position now.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.390
And he's going to be ready
to switch directions.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.540
So finally, when I've done this
whole cycle, when I've

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.610
moved up, down and back there
again, my rope might look

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.650
exactly like this.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.940
And I could let go
of the rope.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.210
I could just leave this little
left point right there.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.230
And this the lump is going to
propagate along the rope.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.760
Because in the next moment
of time, what's it

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.080
going to look like?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.590
This guy is going to be pulled
up by this left-hand point.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.550
So he'll go back to his
resting position.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.770
This guy's being pulled down
right here by the part of the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.050
rope to the left of him, so he's
going to be pulled down.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.730
This guy's being pulled down.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.550
But this guy had some upward
momentum in the time period

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.530
before, so he will
have moved up.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.860
And so, the very next time
period, my rope is going to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.110
look something like this.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.600
And this disturbance in the
rope, if I do nothing else,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.480
and if I don't lose energy to
heat and friction and all

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.610
that, it'll just continue
moving down the rope.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.890
If I look at the rope at some
future period in time, maybe

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.410
not that far down, the rope will
look something like this.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.590
And if I were to keep watching
it, I'll see this disturbance.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.090
I keep using the word
disturbance, because there's

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.010
really no better word
to use for it.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.110
I'll see this disturbance or
perturbation, or whatever you

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.950
want to call it, moving
along the rope.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.700
When we think about what a wave
is, we essentially-- I

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.620
kind of jumped the gun-- I
keep calling this is a

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.890
disturbance, because I didn't
want to use the word, wave. I

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.940
want to say, well what
really is a wave?

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.890
And a wave really is just this
disturbance that's propagating

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.190
down the rope.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.978
So this is a good time to
actually define a wave. A

00:04:02.978 --> 00:04:05.820
wave. Because once I define it,
I can start calling this a

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.450
wave, as opposed to
a disturbance

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.320
propagating down the rope.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.630
So a wave is a disturbance
propagating through space.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.755
And you might see other
definitions of a wave. One of

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:32.020
the most typical ones is
energy or a disturbance

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.010
propagating energy
through a medium.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.420
And when they say medium,
it's what is

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.380
the wave going through?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.810
So in this example, the rope
would be our medium.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.560
But the reason why I don't want
to use that definition of

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.210
a wave is because in future
videos, we'll learn about

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.920
electromagnetic waves and those
don't propagate through

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.680
any medium.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.440
They propagate through
a vacuum.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.380
So to keep things as general as
possible, we'll just call

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.050
it a disturbance that propagates
through space.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.835
And it usually transfers
energy.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.590
What do I mean by transferring
energy?

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.660
On this left hand part
of the rope, I gave a

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.540
little energy the rope.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.420
I moved it up, down, and
then back again.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.420
And then after I did that, that
up, down, back again is

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.780
happening successively
to every point to the

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.750
right on the rope.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.570
So if I waited long enough, at
this point on the rope right

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.810
here, it's going to move up,
down, and then back again.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.040
Exactly what I did over here
is going to happen to this

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.730
point on the rope.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.740
And then later on, it's going to
happen to some other future

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.620
point on the rope.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.720
So that energy that I originally
put on the

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.390
left-hand side of the
rope is being

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.830
transferred down the rope.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.890
If I had some type of object
here sitting on the rope,

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.440
maybe when the wave-- when the
disturbance- passes by it,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.710
this thing could get flipped
into the air; it might get

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.800
pushed into the air,
and go into a

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.530
higher potential energy.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.410
So this disturbance
is transferring

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.320
energy in this case.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.440
Now, what I've drawn here isn't
the only type of wave

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.620
you can have. I mean my
definition is fairly general.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.660
But the definition is more
general than just what I've

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.270
drawn here.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:28.770
For example, you could have a
sound wave. If you just look

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.110
at all of the molecules of the
air, they have some density

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.850
that looks something
like that.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.620
And now let's say I had some
type of a membrane-- maybe

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.480
it's a speaker--
that jolts this

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.680
left-hand side of the air.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.820
So it just pushes-- so let me
see if I can draw this.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.560
Let's say I had some type of
surface here that just really

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.440
quickly jolts-- that just moves
it in that direction,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.590
and then just comes back.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.630
So similar to what I did
here, I go up and down.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.320
But instead of doing that, it
just pushes the air and then

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.010
pushes back.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.440
So what's going to happen?

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.220
Right after it pushes it, the
air molecules that it pushes

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.940
up against are going
to jam together.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.120
They're going to
get compressed.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.330
Right here, all these air
molecules that were right on

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.490
the surface, they're going to
get pushed next to all these

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.550
air molecules that
are right there.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.760
And then when it pushes back,
or when the membrane goes

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.280
back, you're going to have
fewer air molecules here,

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.050
because you're going to have
a low density here.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.030
And then these guys, that are
all scrunched up together,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.800
they're going to want to get
away from each other.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.750
They might even run
into each other.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.520
And so these guys are going to
run into those guys, who are

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.950
going to run into
the next guys.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.060
And so on and so forth.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.680
And after these guys bump into
those guys, those guys are

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.170
going to go back to
where they were.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.750
So essentially, you're going
to have this disturbance

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.950
that's going to be a set of
molecules compressing, or

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.620
bumping into, its neighboring
molecules.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.360
So if you look at this at some
future period in time, all of

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.040
a sudden, this area
might look normal.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.330
Let me clear it and draw it
just the way it I started.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.835
So this area might
look normal.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.690
But that compression of the
particles might have reached

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.940
right over here.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.930
And not only that, we saw that
right after the compression,

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.960
you usually have this area
of low pressure.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.450
So if I were to really draw this
wave, and actually, if

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.210
this membrane were to keep doing
it over, and over, and

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.340
over again-- so it kept going
forward and back, forward and

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.520
back, or right and left, right
and left-- what you would have

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.650
is a series of compressions.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.630
The air would just have a
series of compressions.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.120
So that's one compression.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.780
You'd have another compression
right there.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.250
Another compression
right there.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.700
And then, in between
the compressions

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.780
the air is less dense.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.550
The air is less dense
like this.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.790
And what we've essentially just
generated is a sound wave

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.570
travelling through air.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:02.060
So this right here is a sound
wave. And this type of wave,

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.500
where the direction of the
disturbance is the same, or

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.570
along the same axis as the
direction in which the wave is

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.150
travelling-- the wave is
travelling in that direction--

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.570
this is call a longitudinal
wave. So sound waves sound

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.410
through air, they're
longitudinal waves.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.090
Sometimes called a compression
wave. Same thing.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.720
Compression wave. Because it's
caused by compression.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.110
Our example of the string, this
is called a transverse

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:44.100
wave. Because the disturbance,
the movement of the medium, is

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.040
going in a direction transverse
to-- or at an axis

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.250
that's transverse to-- the
direction of our movement.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.660
We're moving in that direction,
to the right.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.190
Actually, our wave is moving to
the right, but the actual

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.310
medium is moving up and down.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.670
Our medium is moving
up and down.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.500
That's why this is called
transverse.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.160
While here the medium is moving
left and right while

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.980
the wave moves to the right.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.310
So it's along the same axis.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.710
So we're dealing with the
compressional or longitudinal.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.980
Now in this first example,
I just did one cycle.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.280
I just jerked up, down,
and back again.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.510
And I created this
one disturbance.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.205
And we can call this, when you
just do it once, you can view

00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:24.455
this as a wave pulse.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.710
If I kept doing that-- if I
just went up, down, back

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.470
again, up, down, back again,
and I kept doing it

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.760
periodically, over and over
again, then I would generate a

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.080
periodic wave. And my
string would look

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.330
something like this.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:50.200
Well actually, it would look
something that right there,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.930
where that's the disturbance
generated from our first time

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.600
that we moved this left-hand
part of our string.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.840
So this right here is
a periodic wave.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.790
In the next video, we're going
to talk about a lot of the

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.800
properties of a periodic wave.
How the wavelength, and its

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.330
frequency, and its period relate
to its velocity, and

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.100
all of that.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.870
But I'll leave that alone
in this video.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.910
But I just wanted you to
appreciate what I think is a

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.420
concept that we use
in everyday life.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.290
So it's a wave, it's a sound
wave, and all that.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.610
But it's a fairly abstract
notion where we talk about a

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.590
wave, we're really just pointing
to a disturbance

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.980
that's moving, usually along
a medium, at least when we

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.720
visualize it, but not always.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.210
But we're just pointing
to this disturbance.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.000
And this disturbance could take
many forms. It could be a

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.940
transverse disturbance if we're
dealing with a string.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.370
It could be a disturbance in
terms of the density of air

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.440
molecules in terms of a sound
wave. And there is a relation.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.120
So if you wanted to just plot
the density here by position--

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.920
if I were to mathematically
represent this compression

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.300
wave right here-- let's say that
this line represents just

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.380
resting before the sound
wave hits, that's

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.700
just your normal density.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.510
If we were to plot the
density it might look

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.410
something like this.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.870
Over here, we have very
high density.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.240
Over here, we have
very low density.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.610
Over here, we have very
high density.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.930
And if you were to plot it, it
would look a lot like that

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:21.090
transverse wave that I did with
the rope at the beginning

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:21.950
of this video.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.760
And that's why they're even
grouped together.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.460
Because mathematically, even
though a compression wave

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.180
looks very different, or
you might visualize or

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.340
conceptualize it very different
than a transverse

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.190
wave, mathematically, they're
essentially the same thing.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.610
You have this quantity.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.170
In this case, it's the density
of the air varying over time.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.400
In this case, it's the height,
or the position, or how much

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.860
your displacement from your
resting position-- that's the

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.530
quantity varying through time,
that disruption is travelling

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.700
over the course of the medium.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.600
That's why we call both
of these things waves.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.560
Anyway, I'll let you go here.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.500
And in the next video, we'll
talk a little bit more of the

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.700
properties of periodic waves.
