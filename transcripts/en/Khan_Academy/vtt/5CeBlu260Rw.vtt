00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.870
Which of the
following names can be

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.680
used to describe the
geometric shape below?

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.516
So the first name in
question is a quadrilateral.

00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:11.570
And a quadrilateral is
literally any closed shape

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.550
that has four sides.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.870
And this is definitely a closed
shape that has four sides.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.670
So it is definitely
a quadrilateral.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.940
Next, we have to think about
whether it is a parallelogram.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.060
A parallelogram
is a quadrilateral

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.570
that has two pairs of parallel
sides, where in each pair

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.180
they're opposite sides.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.390
And in this case, if you
look at this side over here,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.770
it forms a 90-degree
angle with this line.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.460
And this side over here
also forms a 90-degree angle

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.040
with this line over here.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.452
So these two sides are parallel.

00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:47.410
And then you could make
the exact same argument

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.830
for the other two sides.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.970
This line up here forms a
90-degree angle with this side.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.260
And so does this side.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.940
It forms a 90-degree angle
with this line right over here.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.590
They form the same
angle with this line.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.500
They're parallel.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.300
So this side is parallel to
that side right over there.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.260
So this is definitely
also a parallelogram.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.800
Next, we ask about a trapezoid.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.750
Now, trapezoid is interesting.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.580
Sometimes a trapezoid is defined
as any quadrilateral having

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.720
at least one pair
of parallel sides.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.520
Sometimes it's defined
as having only one

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.060
pair of parallel sides.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.000
So let me write this down.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.710
Trapezoid, there's
a debate here.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.970
It's not completely settled.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:42.870
Some people say at least
one pair of parallel sides.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.410
That's one definition,
one possible definition.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:55.955
The other one is at exactly
one pair of parallel sides.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.740
How we answer this question
depends on which definition

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.410
for trapezoid we pick.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.480
Now, the one that
people most refer to

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.620
is actually this
one right over here,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.070
exactly one pair
of parallel sides.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.040
So when you think
of a trapezoid,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.030
they think of something like
this, where this side over here

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.110
is parallel to
that side over here

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.340
and those two are not parallel.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.620
But sometimes you'll also
see this at least one

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.610
pair of parallel sides.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.345
And so this would
include parallelograms.

00:02:31.345 --> 00:02:32.970
It would be inclusive
of parallelograms

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.820
because parallelograms have
two pairs of parallel sides.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.300
But I'm going to go with this
definition right over here,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.720
exactly one pair
of parallel sides.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.270
This has two pairs
of parallel sides

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.080
so I will not call
it a trapezoid.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.260
But it's always important to
clarify what people are talking

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.080
about because some
people might say

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.610
a trapezoid is at least
one pair of parallel sides.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.570
And if we used that
definition, then we

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.930
would call it a trapezoid.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.900
So it really depends on the
definition that you're using.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.910
Now, let's go on to rhombus.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.020
So a rhombus is a quadrilateral
where four of the sides

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.123
are congruent.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.000
So a rhombus will
look like this.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.700
All four sides have
the same length.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.010
They're not necessarily at
right angles to each other.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.180
This figure over here,
we have two pairs

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.880
of a size that are
the same length,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.590
but there's no
information that tells us

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.370
that this side is
equal to that side

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.410
or that this side is
equal to that side.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.840
So we can't make the claim that
this is necessarily a rhombus.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.921
We don't know for sure.

00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:41.420
If someone told us that this
length is equal to that length,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.030
then things change.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.780
But for the sake
of this one, we're

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.465
not going to go with a rhombus.

00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:51.070
A rectangle is essentially
a parallelogram

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.780
that has four right angles.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.320
And we already established
this is a parallelogram,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.950
and it also has four right
angles-- one, two, three, four.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.597
So this is a rectangle.

00:04:01.597 --> 00:04:03.180
Another way to think
about a rectangle

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.140
is opposite sides
have the same length,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.890
and you have four right angles.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.870
So this is definitely
a rectangle.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.070
A square, a couple of way
you can think about a square.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.969
You could view a square as a
rhombus with four right angles

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:18.560
.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.540
So if were to straighten it out
a little bit, it's a rhombus

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.050
so all the four
sides are the same.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.610
And you have four right angles.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.320
That's one way to
think about a square.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.940
Or you could view
it as a rectangle

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.140
where all four
sides are congruent.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.360
But in either case, you have
to have all four sides be

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.260
congruent in order
to be a square.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.720
And we already established we
ruled out this being a rhombus,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.290
that all four sides here are
not necessarily congruent.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.910
You have two pairs
of congruent sides,

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.240
but we don't know whether
this side and this side

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.400
are congruent.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.600
So we cannot call this a square.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.660
So it's not a square,
not a rhombus,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.130
not a trapezoid by the
definition we picked,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.790
which is the less
inclusive version where

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.980
you say exactly one
pair of parallel sides.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.000
It is a quadrilateral.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.350
It is a parallelogram.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.257
It is a rectangle.
