00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.260
Let's say that I'm a pension
fund, and I have money to lend

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.040
to other people.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.290
And I want to lend it to other
people, because that way I can

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.360
get interest on it instead of
it just kind of sitting and

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.240
doing nothing.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.230
And if I lend it to someone
other than the government,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.580
I'll get better interest. So
let's say that there's-- so

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.850
let me draw me, I'm
the pension fund.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.330
Maybe I'll drawn
me in magenta.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.570
So that's me, pension fund.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.680
And let's say that there's
some corporation,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.170
let's say it's GM.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.925
They make cars.

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:35.450
I think you've heard of them.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.180
Some corporation, GM.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.530
Let's just call it
Corporation A.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.770
They need to borrow money, maybe
to buy a factory or to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.920
do something else, we're not
going to get involved in what

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.990
they need the money for.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.180
And I'd like to lend
them the money.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.980
But there's an issue here.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.750
I am a pension fund.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.310
I manage the retirement fund
for the teachers of

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.180
California, or for the
auto workers of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.160
Michigan, or whatever.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.080
And part of my charter says
that I can only invest in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.870
very, very, very safe
instruments.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.580
So I'm not allowed to go gamble
people's money, because

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.230
this is people's retirement.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.530
So I can't do very fancy
things with it.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.130
I can only invest in things
that are rated AAA,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.930
or let's say AA.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.500
I'm just kind of making
this up on the fly.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.090
So AAA would be like
the highest

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.330
rated securities, right?

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.020
These are things that have a
very low chance of default.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.720
But Corporation A is only rated,
I don't know, let's say

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.785
it's rated BB.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:40.720
And actually, this is a good
time to think about well who

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.610
is doing all these ratings.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.170
And you might think, oh, it
surely is a government entity,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.360
because only the government
would be objective enough give

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.080
all of these corporations
frankly objective ratings.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.970
But unfortunately, it's not.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.280
They're private entities,
that are actually

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.090
paid to rate things.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.620
And I think I touched on it in
the video on collateralized

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.740
debt obligations.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.970
But their incentives are
a little bit strange.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.009
Let's say I have Moody's.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.970
Moody's is one of the ratings
agencies, and they rate

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.620
Corporation A as BB.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.830
So they've said, these guys,
they're pretty good, but

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.690
they're not the U.S. government
or something.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.960
There's a chance that they can
go under, for whatever

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.020
reasons, or they're sensitive
to the economy as a whole.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.510
And I say, man, I would love
to lend these guys money.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.330
I would love to lend
these guys the $1

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.230
billion that they need.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.120
And these guys are willing to
pay me 8% interest. But I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.980
can't do it, me as
a pension fund, I

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.210
cannot lend them money.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.550
Because I'm only allowed
to lend money to A or

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.210
above types of bonds.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.730
Or I can only buy A or above
type of instruments.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.240
So what do I do?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.220
This guy needs money.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.540
I have money to give him, but
his corporate credit rating,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.810
that was given by Moody's, just
isn't high enough for me

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.370
to lend him the money.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.430
And this is where credit
default swaps come in.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.720
In an ideal world, I would give
Corporation A, I would

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.630
give them $1 billion.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.270
And then maybe they would
annually give me, let me make

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.110
up a number, 10% per year.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.900
And then this might have a term
for 10 years, and then

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.360
after 10 years, they'll pay me
the $1 billon back and then

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.290
I'll be happy.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.340
But as I said multiple times,
I can't do it, because they

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.650
are BB rated.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.770
And my charter says I can only
invest in A rated bonds.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.720
So I go to another entity.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.720
And let's call this
entity AIG.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.850
And these entities are
essentially insurance

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.690
companies on debt.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.430
And I'm calling this
one AIG because AIG

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.820
actually did do this.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.510
But it could be anything.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.630
A lot of banks did this,
a lot of insurance

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.730
companies did this.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.130
There are some companies that
just specialize in writing

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.100
collateralized-- sorry, in
writing credit default swaps.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.360
What does AIG do for me?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.270
Well first of all, it's
important to note that Moody's

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.990
has given AIG, I don't know,
let's give it a AA rating.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.459
I don't know what their
actual rating was.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.120
They said, you know what, they
are almost risk-free.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.030
They're almost like the
U.S. government.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.130
Moody's has looked at their
books, or supposedly, or

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.800
hopefully has looked at their
books, and says, oh you know,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.650
if you loan them money,
they're good for it.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.580
So they have a very,
very high rating.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.730
Although, once again, you have
to worry about the incentive.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.250
Because who paid Moody's to
give them that rating?

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.690
And whenever you're getting
paid to give a rating, you

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.970
have to wonder about what your
incentives are, in terms of

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.440
how you rate things.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.610
But anyway that's a discussion
for another video.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.950
But what AIG says is, you
know what pension fund?

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.605
I know you want to lend
Corporation A money, and

00:04:56.605 --> 00:04:58.760
Corporation A wants to borrow
money from you, but you have

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.730
this problem because
they're BB rated.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.200
So what we're going to
do is we're going

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.430
to insure this bond.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.650
We're going to insure this loan
that you're giving to

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.570
Corporate B.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.830
What we want in return for that
is an insurance premium.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.280
We want you to pay us
a little bit of this

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.350
interest every year.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.240
If you pay us a little bit of
this interest every year, we

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.900
will insure this payment.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.020
So you get 10% a year, and
you give us 1% a year.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.810
So you give us 1% a year.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.290
And this is also 1%-- just
to learn a little bit of

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.500
financial jargon-- this is also
someone would say 100

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.810
basis points.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.290
One basis point is
1/100th of 1%.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.950
So 1% of the same thing
as 100 basis points.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.870
2% is the same thing as
200 basis points.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.080
So you pay me 100 basis points
of the 10% per year, and in

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:15.690
exchange, I will give you
insurance on A's debt.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.670
And in fact, it might have not
even been structured this way.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.080
It might have been structured
so that Corporation A right

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.740
here, before even issuing the
bonds, they include this

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.050
insurance with the bond.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.210
So instead of giving 10%, they
cut out 1% to insure it.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.800
And then these essentially
become AA bonds.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.530
And why is that?

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.710
Well, they're BB, but you're
being insured by

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.740
someone who is AA.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.690
So all of the sudden, these
bonds, because they're being

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.130
insured by this entity that
is AA, which Moody's has

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.310
determined is AA, these bonds
are now good enough for my

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.300
pension fund to hold.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.650
Because I said, you know what
even if corporation A goes

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.730
under, I have this AA
guy insuring it.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.650
And so I'm fine.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.970
So this is the equivalent
of holding AA bonds.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.850
And what's my effective
interest rate?

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.560
I'm getting 9% per
year, right?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.080
I'm getting 10% per year from
Corporation B, and then I have

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.430
to pay 1% to AIG.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.910
And if Corporation B goes under
tomorrow, AIG is going

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.330
to give me my $1 billion back.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.000
And you might say, Sal,
this sounds like

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.880
a pretty good situation.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.220
And this is where it starts
to get a little bit shady.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.420
Because AIG, they're not just
insuring my debt or my loan

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.480
that I gave to corporation A.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.480
And think about it, AIG didn't
have to do anything.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.810
AIG didn't have to put
up any collateral.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.420
AIG didn't say, you know what,
out of all of our assets, here

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:53.640
is $1 billion that we're going
to set aside, just in case

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.210
Corporation A doesn't pay.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:55.800
Right?

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.400
You would think that if you
wanted to be guaranteed that

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.530
this money was going to come to
you, this AIG corporation

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.680
would have to set
aside the money.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.650
But they didn't have
to do that.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.470
They just have to say, hey,
Moody's has said we're AA,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.580
we're good for debt.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.170
We're good for insurance.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.850
So you just pay us 1% a year
and trust us, or trust

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.620
Moody's, that we really are
good for the money.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.610
They never had to set
aside the money.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.660
You're just going on a leap
of faith that, if and when

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.570
Corporation A defaults,
AIG is going to be

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.890
good for the money.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.760
Now this is where it
gets interesting.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.560
Let me erase Moody's from the
screen-- actually, maybe I'll

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.470
go down here.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.520
AIG didn't just insure
my debt.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.909
Let's say that there is
Corporation C's debt.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.700
Let's say that they're B-- I
don't know, all these ratings

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.120
have different terminology.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.130
They're B+ rated.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:50.490
Right?

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.680
And let's say there's $10
billion of debt that they

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.730
borrow from some other party.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.560
And in return, they give 11%.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.100
And this is Pension Fund B.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.660
And this pension fund had
the same problem.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:16.040
They can only buy A-rated
or above bonds.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.230
AIG also insures their
debt that they gave

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.810
to Corporation C.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.170
Maybe they'll pay them--
Corporation C is maybe a

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:27.840
little bit riskier, so out of
the 11% I have to pay maybe

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.690
150 basis points.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.810
Or 1 and 1/2%, that's the
same thing as 1%.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:40.140
And in exchange, they
insure C's debt.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.580
Now something very interesting
can happen here.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.310
AIG all of the sudden
has an excellent

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.760
business model, right?

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.480
Because they were able to get
this AA rating from Moody's,

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.695
they can just keep insuring
other people's debt, and they

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:57.590
don't have to put any
money aside, right?

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.720
They don't have to give their
assets to anyone else.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.020
And they just get these
income streams, right?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.400
From my pension fund
they're getting 1%

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.530
per year of $1 billion.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.370
From this pension fund, they're
getting 1 and 1/2%,

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.010
150 basis points, per year.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.910
And they can do this, frankly,
as much as they want.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.700
They could do this
a thousand times.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.280
And as long as Moody's doesn't
get suspicious.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.280
As long as Moody's doesn't
start saying, hey, wait a

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.420
second, AIG, you only have $100
billion in assets, but

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.710
you have insured $1 trillion
of other people's debt.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.220
Something shady going on, I'm
going to lower your rating.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.620
As long as that doesn't happen,
this AIG corporation

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.560
can just keep insuring
more and more debt.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.450
And frankly, as long as none
of that debt goes bad, they

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.220
just get this excellent income
stream, and their CEO will get

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.010
excellent bonuses.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.110
I think you start to see where
you're having a single point

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.790
of failure and a house of cards,
and I'll continue that

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.500
in the next video.
