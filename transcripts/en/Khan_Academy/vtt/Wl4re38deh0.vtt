00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:06.432
The whole point of this video is really just to look at, what in my mind is one of the coolest pictures

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:09.683
ever taken by anything, and this was actually taken by the Hubble telescope

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:18.228
and what they did is, they pointed the telescope at this area of our night sky

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:21.200
and obviously the Hubble telescope, it's out in orbit, so it doesn't have to worry about

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.222
all the interference from our actual atmosphere, so it gets a nice good look at things,

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:30.766
but it's right over here, relative to the moon, and obviously the moon is moving around,

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.692
but on that day, it was here, relative to the moon

00:00:33.692 --> 00:00:37.361
and they picked this location. They picked this location right over here

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:40.751
because there weren't that many nearby stars there so

00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:45.767
it really allowed the telescope, because if there were nearby stars that light would've kind of outshone

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:51.432
things that are behind it further away maybe perhaps galaxies. So just keep in mind everything you're

00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:56.356
going to see is in this little patch of the night sky, and I think the main point for showing the moon

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:59.791
here. Obviously the moon is moving around so I'm not going to tell you which exact patch of sky this

00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:05.364
is. But to really give you an idea of how small of a patch of sky that really is. You really could've

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:09.451
done this with any patch of sky, but in other patches of sky there wouldve been nearby stars that would've

00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:13.445
blocked things, but the galaxies are there, beyond that. The clusters of galaxies, and the super clusters

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:18.414
of galaxies. So with that said out of the way, just remember everything we're talking about in this video

00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:24.776
is in this little patch of sky right over here. The whole point of this, once again like all of these

00:01:24.776 --> 00:01:32.133
videos is really to kind of just blow your mind. So this right here is what the Hubble telescope saw in that

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:37.467
patch. Everything, everything that I'm showing you right here. I just want to be clear, some of these

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:45.117
things are nearby stars, but most of these things are galaxies. That's a galaxy. That is a galaxy. That

00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:51.467
is a galaxy. That's a galaxy, and that's a galaxy. The reason I want to draw you this, obviously in the

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:56.773
last video I showed you our local group, I showed you the Virgo super cluster, I showed you the kind of

00:01:56.773 --> 00:02:02.764
clusters of clusters and I even showed you the depiction of the observable universe. But what is amazing

00:02:02.764 --> 00:02:08.290
about this, is this is an actual picture. This is actually an image of a galaxy. Hey there is another

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.375
galaxy. Oh look there's another galaxy up here. That you can keep doing that forever and this is just

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:18.089
in that little patch of sky, and this is obviously not all of the galaxies of the universe. These are

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:22.687
just the ones that we could see. There ones that might be even further, or there definitely are ones

00:02:22.687 --> 00:02:27.702
that are further back and their light is just even more. We could probably even focus on a patch of sky

00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:33.786
like that and see that many galaxies again. You can kind of keep, keep zooming in, but I just this thing,

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:39.080
and I encourage you I mean there's so many unbelievable images you can look up. They're all on NASA's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.333
website, a lot of these are on Wikipedia. But these images are just unbelievable. You can see a galaxy,

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:52.455
another galaxy, another galaxy, another galaxy. I suspect some of this stuff might actually be clusters

00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:59.374
of galaxies. Galaxy, another galaxy. And remember I'm just circling these galaxies, just left and right,

00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:04.761
and you kind of lose sight of what each galaxy actually is. These galaxies have hundred of billions

00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:13.956
of stars. That even from you know one pixel on these galaxies is unimaginable distance. Something that

00:03:13.956 --> 00:03:19.133
we could never, based with current technology, or even current science, we could ever hope to traverse

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:25.798
in the lifetime of humanity. Not, much left in a lifetime of one individual. So these are just

00:03:25.798 --> 00:03:31.133
enormous things, and they're just an infinite number of them. So I just wanted to highlight this with

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:42.099
you, and really just look at it. Its kind of breathtaking. Another galaxy right over there. I'm not going

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.418
to keep doing it the whole day. I feel kind of bad for drawing on it, it kind of ruins the picture. But

00:03:46.418 --> 00:03:52.780
look at that, that's a nice looking galaxy right there. You got a bunch right over here. It really is

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:03.368
just, you know. This video its probably the least dense with actual instruction, but hopefully the

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:08.755
most dense with inspiration. Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that. Let me just finish looking at the entire

00:04:08.755 --> 99:59:59.999
picture. I mean it just keeps going ,and going we can keep looking at it.
