00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.240
Simplify 16x plus 14 minus
this entire quantity 3x

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.680
squared plus x minus 9.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.910
So let me just rewrite it and
I'll get rid of some of the

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.906
parentheses if we can.

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:13.360
So we have this 16x
right here.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.170
16x plus 14.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.110
we don't have to have those
parentheses, it doesn't change

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.630
the order of operations.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.080
And then we can subtract
from that.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.150
Well, we can just distribute
this negative sign.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.020
So instead of having a positive
3x squared, if we

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.390
multiply it times
this negative 1,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.240
it is minus 3x squared.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.530
That's that term right
over there.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.860
And then you have this
x over here.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.490
It's a positive x, but it's
being multiplied by this

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.510
negative 1 out here.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.900
So it is minus x.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.600
And then finally, you have this
negative 9 out here, but

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.290
it's being multiplied by a
negative 1 out in front of the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.530
parentheses, so a
negative times a

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.040
negative is a positive.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.750
So plus 9.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.930
And so now we can just combine
terms that have the same

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.460
degree of x in them.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.180
And I'll start with the
highest degree term.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.580
The highest degree
term right here.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.510
And the degree just
means x raised

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.030
to the highest exponent.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.670
The highest degree term here
is negative 3x squared.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.600
It's the second degree term.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.930
x is being raised to
the second power.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.650
So I'll just write here,
negative 3x squared.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.130
It's the only when we have.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.550
Then we have the x terms.
We have 16x minus x.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.200
So if you have 16 of something
and you subtract 1 away from

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.180
it, you're going to have 15x.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.090
So plus 15x.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.000
And then finally, you have your
constant terms. 14 and

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.200
then you have plus 9.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.870
So 14 plus 9 is 23.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.480
Plus 23.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.200
And we are all done.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.380
We've simplified
the polynomial.
