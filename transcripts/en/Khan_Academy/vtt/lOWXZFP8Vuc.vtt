00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.480
We have three lines and we have
to figure out which of

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.210
the three are parallel.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.250
So line A-- and it can't be
parallel on its own, it has to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.510
be parallel to another
of the three lines.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.740
So the equation for line
A is y is equal

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.080
to 3/4 x minus four.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:29.940
Line B is 4y minus 20 is
equal to negative 3x.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:38.580
And then line C is negative
3x plus 4y is equal to 40.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.090
So to figure out if any of these
lines are parallel to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.450
any of the other lines,
we just have to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.210
compare their slopes.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.420
If any two of these lines have
the same slope and they're

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.110
different lines, they have
different y-intercepts, then

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.910
they're going to be parallel.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.970
Now line A, it's very easy
to figure out its slope.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.980
It's already in slope-intercept
form.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.910
This is mx plus b, the slope
is 3/4 and the y-intercept,

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880
which isn't as relevant when
you're figuring out parallel

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.190
lines, is negative 4.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.180
So let's see what the other
character's slopes are.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.180
This isn't in any kind
of standard form.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.100
It's not a standard form,
slope-intercept, or

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.380
point-slope form, but let's
see what the slope

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.300
of this line is.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.900
So to get it into
slope-intercept form, which is

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.050
really the easiest one to pick
out the slope from, let's add

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.535
20 to both sides of
this equation.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.240
The left-hand side, those cancel
out, that was the whole

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.650
point, you get 4y is equal
to negative 3x plus 20.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.670
And now we can divide
everything by 4.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:53.520
We are left with y is equal
to negative 3/4 x plus 5.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.130
So in this case, y-intercept
is 5, but most importantly,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.330
the slope is negative 3/4, so
it's different than this guy.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.090
This is negative 3/4, this is
positive 3/4, so these two

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.360
guys definitely aren't
parallel.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.310
Let's move on of this guy
in standard form.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.250
So let's get the x term
on the other side.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.730
So let's add 3x to both sides
of this equation.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.130
Left-hand side, these
cancel out.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.800
We're just left with 4y is equal
to 3x plus 40, or 40

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.620
plus 3x, either way.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.820
Now we can divide both sides
by 4 you have to divide

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.980
every term by 4.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.450
The left-hand side, you're
left with y.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.720
The right-hand side, you
have 3/4 x plus 10.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.600
So here, our slope is 3/4 and
our y-intercept, if we care

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.240
about it, is 10.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.590
So this line and this line have
the exact same slope,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.560
3/4, and they're different
lines because their

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.280
y-intercept is different.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.480
So we know that A and C are
parallel lines and B is not

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.220
parallel to either one
of the other two.
