00:00:00.631 --> 00:00:04.771
so now we have a very very very interesting problem

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:08.628
on the left hand side of the scale I have two different types of unknown masses

00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:15.665
one of these X masses and we know that they have the same identical mass, we call that identical each of them having a mass of X

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:23.627
But then we have this other blue thing and that has a mass of Y, which isn't necessarily going to be the same as the mass of X.

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:33.661
We have two of these X's and a Y.It seems like the total mass or it definitely is the case, their total mass balance it out to these 8 kg right over here.

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:41.037
Each of these is 1kg block and balances them out. So the first question I'm going to ask you is, can you express this Mathematically?

00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:45.826
Can you express what we're seeing here, the fact that this total mass balances out with this total mass.

00:00:45.826 --> 00:00:49.231
Can you express that mathematically?

00:00:51.247 --> 00:00:54.476
Well let's just think about our total mass on this side.

00:00:54.815 --> 00:01:00.867
We have two masses of mass X so those two are gonna total at 2X, and then you have a mass of Y.

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:07.967
So then you're gonna have another Y. So the total mass on the left hand side. Alright let me re-write a little bit closer to the center.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:13.981
So,it doesn't get too spread out. On the left hand side, I got 2X plus a mass of Y. That's the total mass.

00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:24.783
The total mass on the left hand side is 2X plus Y, the total mass on the right hand side is just 8. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. It is equal to 8

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:30.750
And since we see that the scale is balance, this total mass must be equal to this total mass.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.421
So, we can write an equal sign there.

00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:45.625
Now my question to you is there anything we can do just based on the information that we have here to solve for either the mass X or for the mass Y.

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:48.313
Is there anything that we can do.

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:54.580
Well the simple answer is just with this information here, there's actually very little.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.245
You might say that "Oh well, let me take the Y from both sides" You might take this Y block up.

00:01:58.245 --> 00:02:03.491
But if you take this Y block up you have to take away Y from this side and you don't know what Y is.

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:09.756
And if you think about it algebraically you might get rid of the Y here. Subtracting Y and you're gonna subtract Y from this side too.

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:11.921
So, you're not gonna get rid of the Y.

00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:18.095
Same thing with the X's, you actually don't have enough information. Y depends on what X is,and X depends on what Y is.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:25.918
Lucky for us however,we do have some more of these blocks laying around. And what we do is we take one of these X blocks.

00:02:25.918 --> 00:02:32.579
And I stack it over here,and I also take one of the Y block and I stack it right over there.

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:37.366
And then I keep adding all these ones until I balance these things out.

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:42.668
So, I keep adding these ones. Obviously if I just place this, this will go down cause there's nothing on that side.

00:02:42.668 --> 00:02:56.744
But I keep adding these blocks until it all balances out and I find that my scale balances once I have 5 kg on the right hand side

00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:03.633
So, once again let me ask you this information having X and Y on the left hand side and a 5kg on the right hand side

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:07.857
And the fact that they are balance, how can we represent that mathematically?

00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:21.593
Well our total mass on the left hand side is X plus Y. And our total mass, let me right that once again a little bit closer to the center.

00:03:21.808 --> 00:03:31.280
It's X plus Y on the left hand side and the right hand side I have 5 kg. I have 5kg.

00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:39.979
I have 5 kg on the right hand side. And we know that's actually balance the scale. So these total masses must be equal to each other.

00:03:40.564 --> 00:03:46.082
And this information by itself, once again. There's nothing I can do with it. I don't know what X and Y.

00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:51.750
If Y is 4 maybe X is 1 or maybe X is 4, Y is 1. Who knows what these are.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:04:00.998
The interesting thing is we can actually use both of these information to figure out what X and Y actually is.

00:04:01.168 --> 00:04:06.283
And I'm giving you a few seconds to think about how we can approach this situation.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.218
Well think about it this way, we know that X plus Y is equal to 5.

00:04:13.572 --> 00:04:18.188
So if we were to get rid of an X and a Y on this side,on the left hand side of the equation.

00:04:18.342 --> 00:04:24.486
What would we have to get rid of on the right hand side of the, or if we know if we get rid of X and Y on the left hand side of the scale

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.576
What would we get rid of the right hand side of the scale to take away the same mass?

00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:38.542
Well if we take away the X and Y on the left hand side, we know that an X plus Y is 5kg. So, we'll just have to take 5kg from the right hand side.

00:04:38.758 --> 00:04:45.439
So, lets think about what that would do. Well then I'll just have an X over here, I'll just have some of these masses left over here.Then I would what X is.

00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:48.831
Now lets think about how we can represent that algebraically

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.907
Essentially for taking an X and Y from the left hand side. If I'm taking an X and Y from the left hand side.

00:04:55.138 --> 00:05:09.758
I'm subtracting an X, and I'm subtracting an X. Actually let me think of it this way. I'm subtracting an X plus Y. I'm subtracting an X and Y on the left hand side.

00:05:09.896 --> 00:05:12.276
But then what am I gonna do on the right hand side?

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.689
Well an X and a Y we know has a mass of 5. So we can subtract 5 from the right hand side.

00:05:18.505 --> 00:05:22.428
And the only way I'm gonna be able to do this is because of the information that we got from the second scale.

00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:29.820
So I can take away 5. So this is going to be equal to taking away 5. Taking away X and a Y is equal to taking away 5.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:37.390
And we know that because an X and a Y is equal to 5kg. And if we take away an X and a Y on the left hand side, what do we left with?

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.526
Well this is gonna be the same thing. Let me rewrite this part.

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:54.970
This, taking away an X and a Y is the same thing if you distribute the negative sign as taking away an X and taking away a Y.

00:05:56.718 --> 00:06:05.738
And so on the left hand side, we're left with just 2X and we have taken away one of the X's, we're left just an X.

00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:09.601
And we had a Y and we've took away one of the Y. So we're left with no Y.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.227
We see that visually, we're left with just an X here.

00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:14.134
And what do we have on the right hand side?

00:06:14.564 --> 00:06:26.099
We had 8 and we know X and Y is equal to 5, so we took away 5. So to keep the scale balance. And so 8 minus 5 is going to be 3.

00:06:26.453 --> 00:06:38.949
8 minus 5 is equal to 3 and just like that using this extra information we're able to figure out that the mass of X is equal to 3.

00:06:39.242 --> 00:06:47.001
Now, one final question. We're able to figure out the mass of X, can you figure out what the mass of Y is.

00:06:48.648 --> 00:06:53.444
Well we can go back to either one of these scales. Probably be simpler to go back to this one.

00:06:53.766 --> 00:07:01.157
We know that the mass of X plus the mass of Y is equal to 5. So we could say, one thing we know that X is now is equal to 3.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:13.707
We know that this is now a 3kg mass. We can rewrite this is 3 plus Y is equal to 5

00:07:14.323 --> 00:07:17.554
Well now we say, we could take 3 away from both sides.

00:07:17.554 --> 00:07:24.103
if I take 3 away from the left hand side I just have to take 3 away from the right hand side to keep my scale balanced.

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:30.284
And I'll be left with the mass of Y is balance with a mass of 2 or Y is equal to 2.

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:43.488
That's an analogy of taking 3 from both sides of this equation. And on the left hand side, I'm just left with a Y and on the right hand side I'm just left with a 2.

00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:52.200
So, X is equal to 3kg and Y is equal to 2kg and what I encouraged you to do is verify that it made sense right up here.

00:07:52.369 --> 00:08:00.168
Figure out what the total mass on the left hand and the right hand or verify what the total mass right over here really was 8 to begin with.

00:08:00.492 --> 00:08:08.617
And you'll see that 2Xs are gonna be 6kg plus my Y is 2kg that will balance 8kg.

00:08:08.617 --> 00:08:12.617
And 3 plus 2 was equal to 5.
