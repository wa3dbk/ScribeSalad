00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
 

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.880
The circle is arguably the most
fundamental shape in our

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.490
universe, whether you look at
the shapes of orbits of

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.140
planets, whether you look at
wheels, whether you look at

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.840
things on kind of a
molecular level.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.860
The circle just keeps
showing up over and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.350
over and over again.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.110
So it's probably worthwhile for
us to understand some of the

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.330
properties of the circle.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.200
So the first thing when people
kind of discovered the circle,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.960
and you just have a look at the
moon to see a circle, but the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.570
first time they said well, what
are the properties

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.910
of any circle?

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.150
So the first one they might
want to say is well, a circle

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.690
is all of the points that are
equal distant from the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.440
center of the circle.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.710
All of these points along the
edge are equal distant from

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.210
that center right there.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.620
So one of the first things
someone might want to ask is

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.280
what is that distance, that
equal distance that everything

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.770
is from the center?

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.950
Right there.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.110
We call that the
radius of the circle.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.350
It's just the distance from
the center out to the edge.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.820
If that radius is 3
centimeters, then this radius

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.490
is going to be 3 centimeters.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.170
And this radius is going
to be 3 centimeters.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.270
It's never going to change.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.690
By definition, a circle is all
of the points that are equal

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.400
distant from the center point.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.050
And that distance
is the radius.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.880
Now the next most interesting
thing about that, people might

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.040
say well, how fat
is the circle?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.360
How wide is it along
its widest point?

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.710
Or if you just want to cut it
along its widest point, what

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.390
is that distance right there?

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.340
And it doesn't have to be just
right there, I could have just

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.490
as easily cut it along its
widest point right there.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.520
I just wouldn't be cutting it
like some place like that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.120
because that wouldn't be
along its widest point.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.810
There's multiple places
where I could cut it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.480
along its widest point.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.730
Well, we just saw the radius
and we see that widest point

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.580
goes through the center
and just keeps going.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.920
So it's essentially two radii.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.640
You got one radius there
and then you have another

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.240
radius over there.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.380
We call this distance along
the widest point of the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.030
circle, the diameter.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.390
So that is the diameter
of the circle.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.260
It has a very easy
relationship with the radius.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:16.155
The diameter is equal to
two times the radius.

00:02:16.155 --> 00:02:19.060
 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.790
Now, the next most interesting
thing that you might be

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.560
wondering about a circle is how
far is it around the circle?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.340
So if you were to get your tape
measure out and you were to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.910
measure around the circle like
that, what's that distance?

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:44.710
We call that word the
circumference of the circle.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.440
Now, we know how the diameter
and the radius relates, but how

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.790
does the circumference relate
to, say, the diameter.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.550
And if you're not really used
to the diameter, it's very

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.290
easy to figure out how it
relates to the radius.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.130
Well, many thousands of years
ago, people took their tape

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.890
measures out and they keep
measuring circumferences

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.430
and radiuses.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.280
And let's say when their tape
measures weren't so good,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.010
let's say they measured the
circumference of the circle

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.960
and they would get well, it
looks like it's about 3.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.600
And then they measure the
radius of the circle right here

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.280
or the diameter of that circle,
and they'd say oh, the diameter

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.290
looks like it's about 1.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.740
So they would say -- let
me write this down.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.750
So we're worried about
the ratio -- let me

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.660
write it like this.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:33.955
The ratio of the circumference
to the diameter.

00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:37.560
 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.900
So let's say that somebody had
some circle over here -- let's

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.170
say they had this circle, and
the first time with not that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.880
good of a tape measure, they
measured around the circle

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.340
and they said hey, it's
roughly equal to 3 meters

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.490
when I go around it.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.800
And when I measure the
diameter of the circle,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.050
it's roughly equal to 1.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.000
OK, that's interesting.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.520
Maybe the ratio of
the circumference of

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.500
the diameter's 3.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.820
So maybe the circumference
is always three

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.020
times the diameter.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.610
Well that was just for this
circle, but let's say they

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.720
measured some other
circle here.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.870
It's like this -- I
drew it smaller.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.200
Let's say that on this circle
they measured around it and

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.960
they found out that the
circumference is 6 centimeters,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.210
roughly -- we have a bad
tape measure right then.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.710
Then they find out
that the diameter is

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.520
roughly 2 centimeters.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.490
And once again, the ratio of
the circumference of the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.230
diameter was roughly 3.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.140
OK, this is a neat
property of circles.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.430
Maybe the ratio of the
circumference to the diameters

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.080
always fixed for any circle.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.260
So they said let me
study this further.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.510
So they got better
tape measures.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.090
When they got better tape
measures, they measured hey,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.630
my diameter's definitely 1.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.430
They say my diameter's
definitely 1, but when I

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.810
measure my circumference
a little bit, I realize

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.040
it's closer to 3.1.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.000
 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.290
And the same thing
with this over here.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.370
They notice that this
ratio is closer to 3.1.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.830
Then they kept measuring it
better and better and better,

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.200
and then they realized that
they were getting this number,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.300
they just kept measuring it
better and better and they were

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.850
getting this number 3.14159.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.550
And they just kept adding
digits and it would

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.620
never repeat.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.640
It was a strange fascinating
metaphysical number

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.300
that kept showing up.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.940
So since this number was so
fundamental to our universe,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.500
because the circle is so
fundamental to our universe,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.680
and it just showed up
for every circle.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.865
The ratio of the circumference
of the diameter was this

00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:32.390
kind of magical number,
they gave it a name.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.580
They called it pi, or you could
just give it the Latin or the

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.880
Greek letter pi --
just like that.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.090
That represents this number
which is arguably the most

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.790
fascinating number
in our universe.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.430
It first shows up as the ratio
of the circumference to the

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.070
diameter, but you're going to
learn as you go through your

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.160
mathematical journey, that
it shows up everywhere.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.500
It's one of these fundamental
things about the universe that

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.060
just makes you think that
there's some order to it.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.750
But anyway, how can we
use this in I guess

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.330
our basic mathematics?

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.490
So we know, or I'm telling you,
that the ratio of the

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:19.420
circumference to the diameter
-- when I say the ratio,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.390
literally I'm just saying if
you divide the circumference by

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:28.400
the diameter, you're
going to get pi.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.500
Pi is just this number.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.570
I could write 3.14159 and just
keep going on and on and on,

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.950
but that would be a waste of
space and it would just be hard

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.570
to deal with, so people just
write this Greek

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.330
letter pi there.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.850
So, how can we relate this?

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.920
We can multiply both sides of
this by the diameter and we

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.640
could say that the
circumference is equal to pi

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.820
times the diameter.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.570
Or since the diameter is equal
to 2 times the radius, we could

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.420
say that the circumference is
equal to pi times 2

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.360
times the radius.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.450
Or the form that you're
most likely to see it,

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.360
it's equal to 2 pi r.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.220
So let's see if we can apply
that to some problems.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.240
So let's say I have a circle
just like that, and I were to

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.600
tell you it has a radius --
it's radius right there is 3.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.820
So, 3 -- let me write this down
-- so the radius is equal to 3.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.310
Maybe it's 3 meters --
put some units in there.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.660
What is the circumference
of the circle?

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.180
The circumference is equal to
2 times pi times the radius.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.090
So it's going to be equal to 2
times pi times the radius,

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:47.280
times 3 meters, which is
equal to 6 meters times

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.520
pi or 6 pi meters.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.430
6 pi meters.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.740
Now I could multiply this out.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.900
Remember pi is just a number.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.680
Pi is 3.14159 going
on and on and on.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.460
So if I multiply 6 times that,
maybe I'll get 18 point

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.600
something something something.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.850
If you have your calculator you
might want to do it, but for

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.490
simplicity people just tend to
leave our numbers

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.120
in terms of pi.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.020
Now I don't know what this is
if you multiply 6 times

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.510
3.14159, I don't know if you
get something close to 19 or

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.910
18, maybe it's approximately
18 point something

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:21.720
something something.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.450
I don't have my calculator
in front of me.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.300
But instead of writing
that number, you just

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.060
write 6 pi there.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.770
Actually, I think it
wouldn't quite cross the

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.430
threshold to 19 yet.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.770
Now, let's ask
another question.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.270
What is the diameter
of the circle?

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.580
 

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.690
Well if this radius is 3, the
diameter is just twice that.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.730
So it's just going to be 3
times 2 or 3 plus 3, which

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.170
is equal to 6 meters.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.750
So the circumference is 6 pi
meters, the diameter is 6

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.620
meters, the radius is 3 meters.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.110
Now let's go the other way.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.310
Let's say I have
another circle.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.220
Let's say I have
another circle here.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.620
And I were to tell you that
its circumference is equal

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.560
to 10 meters -- that's the
circumference of the circle.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.990
If you were to put a tape
measure to go around it and

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:18.370
someone were to ask you what is
the diameter of the circle?

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.810
Well, we know that the diameter
times pi, we know that pi times

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.830
the diameter is equal to
the circumference; is

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.700
equal to 10 meters.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.020
So to solve for this we would
just divide both sides

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.520
of this equation by pi.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.860
The diameter would equal
10 meters over pi or

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.710
10 over pi meters.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.020
And that is just a number.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.540
If you have your calculator,
you could actually divide 10

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.030
divided by 3.14159, you're
going to get 3 point something

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.500
something something meters.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.960
I can't do it in my head.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.070
But this is just a number.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.320
But for simplicity we often
just leave it that way.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.270
Now what is the radius?

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.590
Well, the radius is equal
to 1/2 the diameter.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.870
So this whole distance right
here is 10 over pi meters.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.230
If we just 1/2 of that, if
we just want the radius, we

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.580
just multiply it times 1/2.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:13.160
So you have 1/2 times 10 over
pi, which is equal to 1/2 times

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.770
10, or you just divide the
numerator and the

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.140
denominator by 2.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.130
You get 5 there, so
you get 5 over pi.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.890
So the radius over
here is 5 over pi.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.690
Nothing super fancy about this.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.760
I think the thing that confuses
people the most is to just

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.820
realize that pi is a number.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:38.640
Pi is just 3.14159 and it just
keeps going on and on and on.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.950
There's actually thousands of
books written about pi, so

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.100
it's not like -- I don't know
if there's thousands, I'm

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.340
exaggerating, but you could
write books about this number.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.340
But it's just a number.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.480
It's a very special number, and
if you wanted to write it in a

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.390
way that you're used to writing
numbers, you could literally

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.680
just multiply this out.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.530
But most the time people just
realize they like leaving

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.640
things in terms of pi.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.680
Anyway, I'll leave you there.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.090
In the next video we'll figure
out the area of a circle.
