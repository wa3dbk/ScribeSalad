00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.100
We've defined the notion of a
projection onto a subspace,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.870
but I haven't shown you yet that
it's definitely a linear

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.960
transformation.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.965
Nor have I shown you that if
you know a basis for a

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:13.990
subspace, how do you actually
find a projection onto it?

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.080
So let's see if we can make
any progress on that here.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.220
So let's say I have
some subspace.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:28.750
Let's say v is a
subspace of Rn.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.720
And let's say I've got some
basis vectors for v.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.610
So let's say these are my basis
vectors, basis vector 1,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.160
2, and I have k of them.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.520
I don't know what v's
dimension is, but

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.760
let's say it's k.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:52.230
It's got k basis vectors,
so it is a basis for v.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.680
And that means that any vector--
that's not v vector,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.840
that's v subspace-- now that
means that any vector-- let me

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.100
call some vector, I don't know,
let's say, any vector a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.740
that is a member of my subspace
can be represented.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.170
That means that a can be
represented as a linear

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.190
combination of these guys.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.040
So I'll make my linear
combination.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.130
Let's say it is, I don't know,
y1 times b1, plus y2 times b2,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.700
all the way to plus
yk times bk.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.370
That's what the definition
of a basis is.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.590
The span of these guys is your
subspace v, so any member of v

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.830
can be represented as a linear

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.220
combination of my basis vectors.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.340
Now, if I were to construct a
matrix-- let's make it an n by

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.890
k matrix-- whose columns are
essentially the basis vectors

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.930
of my subspace.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.430
So A looks like this,
the first column is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.310
my first basis vector.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.800
My second column is my second
basis vector, and I go all the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.280
way to my k column, and I have
k columns, is going to be my

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.610
k'th basis vector.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.449
If I'm going to have my k'th
basis vector-- let me make the

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.140
closing bracket the same color
as my opening bracket, just

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.500
like that-- it's going to have
n rows, because each of these

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.360
basis vectors are
members of Rn.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.140
Remember, v is a subspace of Rn,
so each of these guys are

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.730
going to have n terms.
So this matrix is

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.560
going to have n rows.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.620
Now, saying that any member
of the subspace v can be

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.980
represented as a linear
combination of these basis

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.360
vectors, is equivalent to saying
that any member, that

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.170
a, that any member a of our
subspace v can be represented

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:57.540
as the product of our matrix A,
times some vector y, where

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.820
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:06.980
was equal to a, for some y,
that is a member of Rk.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.940
Now why is this statement and
that statement equivalent?

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.600
Well you can imagine, if you
were to just multiply this

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:20.110
times some vector y in Rk, so
it's y1, y2, all the way down

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.090
to yk, this is going to be equal
to y1 times v1, plus y2,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:35.960
times b2, all the way to plus yk
times bk, which is the same

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.280
thing as this.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.990
So you can always pick the
right linear combination.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.200
You can always pick the right
member, yk, so that you get

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.720
the right linear combination of
your basis vectors to get

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.500
any member of your subspace v.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.860
So any member of my subspace,
right there, can be

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.930
represented as the product
of the matrix A with

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.980
some vector in Rk.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.140
Now we don't know much about
this vector here in Rk.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.980
Now, the projection-- let's
say that x is just some

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:17.620
arbitrary member of Rn-- the
projection of x onto our

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.620
subspace v, that is by
definition going to be a

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.890
member of your subspace.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.540
Or another way of saying it is
that this guy, the projection

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.380
onto v of x is going to be equal
to my matrix A, is going

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.320
to be equal to-- I'll do it in
blue-- is going to be equal to

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:50.360
A times some vector y, or
some vector y in Rk.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.250
If we knew what that vector y
was, if we could always find

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.060
it, then we would have a
formula, so to speak, for

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.040
figuring out the projection
of x onto v.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.420
But we don't have that yet.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.160
All I've said is, any member of
v can be represented as a

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.760
product of our matrix A, which
has the basis for v as

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.260
columns, and some
member of Rk.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.670
That just comes out of the fact
that these guys span v,

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.960
that any member of
v is a linear

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.580
combination of those guys.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.620
We know that the projection of
x onto v is a member of our

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.760
subspace v, it has to
be inside of v.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.550
So it can also be represented
this way.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.740
Now what was our definition
of our projection?

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.420
Our definition of our
projection, we say--

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.330
Well, let me write
it this way.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.850
We know that x can be
represented as the sum of the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:55.910
projection onto v of x, plus
some member of v complement.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:04.140
Or maybe I could even write,
plus the projection onto the

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.410
orthogonal complement of v.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.620
You could write this way.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.810
I could have also written this
as w, where w is a member of v

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.170
complement.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.160
Actually, let me write
it that way.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.140
That might make it simpler.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.720
I don't want to get too many
projections here-- plus w,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:37.800
where w is a unique member
of the orthogonal

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.420
complement of v.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.610
Or you could say it this way,
if you subtract a projection

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.900
of x onto v from both sides, you
get x minus the projection

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.285
of x onto v, is equal to w.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.510
Or another way to say it is that
this guy right here is

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.280
going to be a member of the
orthogonal complement of v,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.700
right, because this is
the same thing as w.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.840
Now what's the orthogonal
complement of v?

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.070
We go back to this
matrix here.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.500
I have these basis vectors.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.410
Right here is the columns.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:21.310
So the column space of A is
going to be equal to v, right?

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.720
The column space of
A is just the span

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.100
of these basis vectors.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.420
And by definition, that is
going to be equal to my

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.630
subspace v.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.760
Now what is the orthogonal
complement of v?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.200
The orthogonal complement of v
is going to be the orthogonal

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.920
complement of my column space.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.160
And what's the orthogonal
complement of a column space?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.840
That's equal to the null space
of A transpose, or you could

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.750
also call that the left
null space of A.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.600
But we've seen that many,
many, videos ago.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.980
So we could say that x minus the
projection of x onto v as

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:07.240
a member of-- let me write
it this way-- x minus the

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:14.230
projection onto v of x is a
member of the orthogonal

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.050
complement of my column space
of my matrix, which is equal

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.870
to the null space
of A transpose.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.210
That's the orthogonal
complement of v.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.810
This is the same thing as the
orthogonal complement of v.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.540
But what does this mean?

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.910
What does this mean
right here?

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.640
This means that if I take A
transpose, and I multiply it

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.200
times this vector, because it's
a member of A transpose's

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.580
null space.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.540
So if I multiply it times that
vector right there-- so,

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.470
projection of x onto v-- then
I'm going to get 0.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.840
I'm going to get the 0 vector.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.160
That's the definition
of a null space.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.730
So let's write this out
a little bit more.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.990
Let's see if we can
algebraically

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.240
manipulate it a bit.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.020
So if we distribute this matrix
vector product, we get

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:06.150
A transpose times the vector
x, minus A transpose, times

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:13.520
the projection-- actually let
me write this this way.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.400
Instead of keep writing the
projection onto v of x, what

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.820
did we say earlier
in this video?

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.900
We said the projection of v onto
x can be represented as

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.750
the matrix product of
the matrix A, times

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.330
some vector y in Rk.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.690
That's where we started
off the video.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.240
So let me write it that way,
because that's what going to

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.050
simplify our work
a little bit.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.460
So I'm going to distribute
the A transpose, A

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.560
transpose times x.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.300
And then A transpose, minus A
transpose, times this thing.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:49.300
This thing I can write as A
times some vector y, and this

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.460
is just a byproduct of the
notion that the projection is

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.220
a member of our subspace.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.140
Because it's a member of our
subspace, it's going to be

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.480
some linear combination of
the column vectors of A.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.800
We saw that up here, so it can
be represented in this way.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:12.400
So instead of projection onto
v of x, I can just write Ay.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.500
This thing and this thing are
equivalent, because this thing

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.940
is a member of v.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.250
And then all of that is going
to be equal to 0.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.980
And then if we add this to both
sides of this equation,

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:38.500
we get that A transpose x is
equal to A transpose A of y.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.580
Now this is interesting.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.590
Remember where we started
off here.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:50.010
We said that the projection onto
v of x is equal to Ay for

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:56.040
some y that is a member of Rk.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.160
If we knew what that y was, if
we could always solve for that

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.450
y, then the projection of
x would be well defined.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.230
And we could always just
figure it out.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.840
Now can we solve for y here?

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.070
Well, we'll be able to solve
for y if we can take the

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.250
inverse of that matrix.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.360
If this major is always
invertible, then we're always

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.870
going to be able to
solve for y here.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.370
Because we just take the inverse
of this matrix and

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.120
multiply it times the
left side of both

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.660
sides in this equation.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.450
Now if you remember, three
videos ago, I think it was

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:34.180
three videos ago, I showed you
that if I have a matrix A

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:43.220
whose columns are linearly
independent, then A transpose

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:48.890
A is always invertible.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.580
The whole reason why I did that
video was for this moment

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.930
right here.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.430
Now, what about our matrix A?

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.650
Well, our matrix A has column
vectors that form the basis

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.500
for a subspace.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.740
By definition, basis vectors
are linearly independent.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.510
So our matrix A has columns that
are linearly independent.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.850
And if you watched that video,
and if you believe what I told

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.470
you, then you'll know that A
transpose A, in our case, is

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.760
going to be invertible.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.570
It has to be inveritible.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.330
So let's take the inverse
of it and multiply

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.350
it times both sides.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.940
If we take A transpose A
inverse-- we know that this

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.030
exists, because A has linearly
independent columns-- and

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:34.080
multiply it times this side
right here, A transpose x.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.430
And then on this side we get--
well, we're going to do the

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:43.080
same thing-- A transpose A
inverse, times this thing

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.060
right here, A transpose Ay.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.920
These two things when you
multiply them, when you

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.340
multiply the inverse of a
matrix, times the matrix,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.470
you're just going to get
the identity matrix.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.910
So that's just going to be equal
to the identity matrix.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.880
And the identity matrix times y
is just going to be y, so we

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.790
get-- and this is a vector--
so if I flip them around, I

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:09.080
get that y is equal to this
expression right here.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.720
A transpose A inverse, which'll
always exist, times A

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.120
transpose, times x.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.970
Now we said the projection of x
onto v is going to be equal

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.410
to A times y, for some y.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.660
Well we just solved for the y
using our definition of a

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.180
projection.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.700
We just were able
to solve for y.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:34.710
So now, we can define our
projection of x onto v as a

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.590
matrix vector product.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:44.020
So we can write the projection
onto v of our vector x is

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:51.030
equal to A, times y, and
y is just equal to

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.280
that thing right there.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:01.630
So A times A transpose A
inverse-- which always exists

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.600
because A has linearly
independent columns-- times A

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.010
transpose, times x.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.480
And this thing right here, this
long convoluted thing,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.880
that's just some matrix, some
matrix which always exists for

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.980
any subspace that
has some basis.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.200
So we've just been able to
express the projection of x

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.340
onto a subspace as a matrix
vector product.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.920
So anything that can be any
matrix vector product

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.670
transformation is a linear
transformation.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.710
And not only did we show that
it's a linear transformation,

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:45.420
we showed that, look, if you can
give me the basis for v,

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.810
I'm going to make those column
vectors equal to the column of

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.080
some matrix A.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.250
And then if I take matrix A, if
I take its transpose, if I

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.910
take A transpose times A, and
invert it, and if I multiply

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.130
them all out in this way,
I'm going to get the

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.000
transformation matrix
for the projection.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.440
Now this might seem really
complicated, and it is hard to

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.720
do by hand for many, many
projections, but this is super

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.340
useful if you're going to do
some three-dimensional

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.590
graphical programming.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:25.370
Let's say you have some
three-dimensional object, and

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.000
you want to know what it looks
like from the point of view of

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.185
some observer.

00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:30.890
So let's say you have
some observer.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.270
Some observer's point of view
is essentially going to be

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.020
some subspace.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.440
You want to see what the
projection of this cube onto

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.970
the subspace, how would it
look to the person who's

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.260
essentially on to this flat
screen right there.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.610
How would that cube look from
this point of view?

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.890
Well if you know the basis for
this subspace, you can just

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:54.260
apply this transformation.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.810
You can make a matrix whose
columns are these basis

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.790
vectors for this observer's
point of view.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.860
And then you can apply this to
every vector in this cube in

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.420
R3, and you'll know exactly how
this cube should look from

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.030
this person's point of view.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.200
So this is actually a
super useful result.
