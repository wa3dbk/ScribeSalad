00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.230
We're given a system of
equations here, and we're told

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.240
to solve for x and y.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.360
Now, the easiest thing to do
here, since in both equations

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.700
they're explicitly solved for y,
is say, well, if y is equal

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.080
to that, and y also has to equal
this second equation,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.080
then why don't we just set
them equal to each other?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.430
Or another way to think about
it is, if y is equal to this

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.920
whole thing right over here--
that's what that first

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.770
equation is telling us-- and if
we have to find an x and a

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.110
y that satisfy both of these
equations, if y is equal to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.800
that, why can't I just
substitute that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.690
right here for y?

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.760
And if we do that, the left-hand
side of this bottom

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.370
equation becomes negative
1/4x plus 100.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.150
And then that is going to be
equal to this right-hand

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.580
side-- and I'll do it in the
same color-- is equal to

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.270
negative 1/4x plus 120.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.470
Now, the first thing we might
want to do is maybe get all of

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.240
our x terms onto the
left- or the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.820
right-hand side of the equation.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.810
And if we wanted to get rid
of these x terms from the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.420
right-hand side, get them on the
left-hand side, the best

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.750
thing to do is to add 1/4x to
both sides of this equation.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.970
So let me do that.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.820
So we're going to add 1/4x here,
add 1/4x here, and you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.430
might already be sensing that
something shady is going on.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.750
So let's do it.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.040
So negative 1/4x plus 1/4x.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.720
They cancel out.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.990
You get 0x.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.760
So the left side of the
equation is just 100.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.370
And then the right side of
the equation, same thing.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.240
Negative 1/4x plus 1/4x.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.320
They cancel out.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.210
No x's.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.050
And you're just left with
is equal to 120.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.590
Which we know is definitely
not the case.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.870
100 is not equal to 120.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.810
We got this nonsensical
equation here,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.420
that 100 equals 120.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.305
So this type of system
has no solution.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.160
You know it has no solution
because in order for it to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.510
have any solution, these two
numbers would have to be equal

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.020
to each other, and they are
not equal to each other.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.210
And if you look at the original
equations, it might

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.840
jump out at you why they
have no solutions.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.820
Both of these lines, or both
of these equations, if you

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.620
view them as lines, have
the exact same slope.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.290
But they have different
y-intercepts.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.580
So if I just were to do a
really quick graph here.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.650
That's my y-axis, that is my
x-axis, so it's y and x.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.740
This first graph over here,
its y-intercept is 100.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.190
Let me do it a little
bit lower.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.792
Its y-intercept-- let's say
that that is 100, so it

00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:43.870
intersects right there.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.830
And there's a slope
of negative 1/4.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.800
So maybe it looks something
like this.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.380
That's that first line.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.030
This second line-- I'll do it
in pink right here-- y is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.980
equal to negative 1/4x plus 120,
its y-intercept might be

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.610
right here at 120.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.540
But it has the same slope,
negative 1/4, so its slope,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.530
the line would look something
like this.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.520
So you see that there are no x
and y points that satisfy both

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.770
of these equations.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.030
Another way to think about it.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.300
If y-- you take an x.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.740
This first equation says, OK,
you take your x, multiply it

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.350
by negative 1/4, and
add 100, and that's

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.200
going to give you y.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.020
Now, here we say, well, you
take that same x, and you

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.950
multiply it by negative 1/4 and
add 120, and that has to

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.870
be equal to y.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.480
Well, the only way that that
would ever be true is if 100

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.540
and 120 were the same
number, and they're

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.390
not the same number.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.390
So you're never going to have
a solution of this system.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.120
These two lines are never going
to intersect, and that's

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.250
because they have the
exact same slope.
