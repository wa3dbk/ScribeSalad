00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.650
Let's say we have some function,
f, and it's a

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.015
mapping from the set X to Y.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:14.520
So if I were to draw the set X
right there, that's my set X.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.640
If I were to draw the set
Y, just like that.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.740
We know, and I've done this
several videos ago, that a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.400
function just associates any
member of our set X-- so I

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.960
have some member of my set
X there-- if I apply the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.240
function to it, or if we're
dealing with vectors, we can

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.620
imagine instead of using the
word function, we would use

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.730
the word transformation.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.880
But it's the same thing.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.550
We would associate with this
element, or this member of X,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.040
a member of Y.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.120
So that's why we call
it a mapping.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.010
When I apply this function--
I'll do it in a different

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.850
color-- this little member of
X is associated with this

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.720
member of Y.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.790
If this is right here,
this is a capital X.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.370
Let's say we call this a,
and let's call that b.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.840
We would say that the function
where a is a member of X and b

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.860
is a member of Y, we would say
that f of a is equal to b.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.170
This is all a review of
everything that we've learned

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.870
already about functions.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.580
Now I'm going to
define a couple

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.610
of interesting functions.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.650
The first one-- I guess it's
really just one function, I

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.030
said it's a couple-- but I'll
call it the identity function.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.150
This is a function.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.960
I'll just call it
a big capital I.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.150
This identity function
operates on some set.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.490
So let's say this is the
identity function on set X,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.150
and it's a mapping
from X to X.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.840
What's interesting about the
identity function is that if

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.286
you give it some a that is a
member of X-- so lets say you

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:05.980
give it that a-- the identity
function applied to that

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.110
member of X, the identity
function of a, is going to be

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.090
equal to a.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.760
So it literally just maps
things back to itself.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.430
So the identity function, if I
were draw it on this diagram

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.500
right here, would
look like this.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.440
It would look like-- we pick a
nice suitable color-- it would

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.090
look like this.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.910
It would just kind
of be a circle.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.500
It just points back
at the point that

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.290
you started off with.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.150
It associates all points
with themselves.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.150
That's the identity function on
X, especially as it applies

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.790
to the point a.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.300
If you apply it to some other
point in X, it would just

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.940
refer back to itself.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.590
That's the identity
function on X.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.590
You could also have an identity
function on Y.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.180
So let's say that b
is a member of Y.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.340
So I drew b right there.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.300
Then the Y identity function--
so this would be that identity

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.600
function on Y applied
to b-- would just

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.855
refer back to itself.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.850
So that would be equal to b.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.600
This is the identity
function on Y.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.150
So you might say, hey
Sal, these are

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.080
kind of silly functions.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.910
But we'll use them.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.010
They're actually at least a
useful notation to use as we

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.080
progress through our

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.570
explorations of linear algebra.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.440
But I'm going to make
a new definition.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.150
I'm going to say that a
function-- let me pick a nice

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.650
color, pink-- I'm going to say
that a function, let me say f

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.800
since we already established
it right over here.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.360
I'm going to say that f is
invertible, introducing some

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.270
new terminology.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.883
f is invertible if and only
if the following is true.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.950
I could either write it with
these two-way arrows like

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.890
that, or I could write it
as iff with two f's.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.770
That means that if this is true,
then this is true, and

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.080
only if this is true.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.560
So this implies that, and
that implies this.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.290
So f is invertible-- I'm kind
of making a definition right

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:23.080
here-- if and only if there
exists a function, I'll call

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.650
it nothing just yet.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.710
I'll call it something
in a second.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.420
I'll write it as this f
with this negative 1

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.020
superscript on it.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.000
So f is invertible if and only
if there exists a function f

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.430
inverse-- well I guess I just
called it something.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.000
Let me do that in purple.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.860
Remember f is just a mapping
from X to Y.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.480
So this function, f inverse,
is going to be a

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.760
mapping from Y to X.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.560
So I'm saying that f is
invertible if there exists a

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.870
function, f inverse, that's a
mapping from Y to X such that

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:18.860
if I take the composition of f
inverse with f, this is equal

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.080
to the identity function
over X.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.730
So let's think about
what's happening.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.720
This is just part
of it actually.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.690
Let me just complete the
whole definition.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:41.950
This is true, this has to be
true, and the composition of f

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.400
with the inverse function has
to be equal to the identity

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.300
function over Y.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.270
So let's just think about
what's this saying.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.060
There's some function-- I'll
call it right now, this called

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:06.500
the inverse of f-- and it's
a mapping from Y to X.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.850
Let me draw it up here.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.680
So f is a mapping from X to Y.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.260
We showed that.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.570
This is the mapping
of f right there.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.020
It goes in that direction.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.650
We're saying there has be some
other function, f inverse,

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.390
that's a mapping from Y to X.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.370
So let's write it here.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:28.150
So f inverse is a mapping from Y
to X. f inverse, if you give

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.340
me some value in set
Y, I go to set X.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.660
So this guy's domain is this
guy's codomain, and this guy's

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.970
codomain is this guy's domain.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.480
Fair enough.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.770
But let's see what
it's saying.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.040
It's saying that the composition
of f inverse with

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.510
f, has to be equal to
the identity matrix.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.490
So essentially it's saying if I
apply f to some value in X--

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.050
right, if you think about
what's this composition

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.130
doing-- this guy's going
from X to Y.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.050
This guy goes from Y to X.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.690
So let's think about what's
happening here.

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:10.340
f is going from X to Y.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.090
Then f inverse is going
from Y to X.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.770
So this composition is going to
be a mapping from X to X,

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.660
which the identity function
needs to do.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.730
It needs to go from X to X.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.220
They're saying this equals
the identity function.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.670
So that means when you apply f
on some value in our domain,

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.750
so you go here, and then you
apply f inverse to that point

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.160
over there, you go back to
this original point.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:45.700
So another way of saying this
is that f-- let me do it in

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.980
another color-- the composition
of f inverse with

00:07:50.980 --> 00:08:01.650
f of some member of the set
X is equal to the identity

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.050
function applied on that item.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.220
These two statements
are equivalent.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.920
So by definition, this
thing is going to be

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.310
your original thing.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.380
Or another way of writing this
is that f inverse applied to f

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.370
of a is going to
be equal to a.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.050
That's what this first
statement tells us.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.680
If you think of it visually,
it's saying you start with an

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.050
a, you apply f to it, and you
get this value right here.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.520
That is f of a.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.620
I'm saying it equals b, or I
said it equalled b earlier on.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.130
Then if you apply this f
inverse-- and it doesn't

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.640
always exist-- but if you apply
that f inverse to this

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.179
function, it needs to
go back to this.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.755
By definition it needs to go
back to your original a.

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:49.650
It has to be equivalent to just
doing this little closed

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.800
loop right when I introduce you
to the identity function.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.080
Now that's what this statement
is telling us right here.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.940
The second statement is saying
look, if I apply f to f

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.640
inverse, I'm getting the
identity function on Y.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:10.140
So if I start at some point in
Y right there, and I apply f

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:16.880
inverse first, maybe
I go right here.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.400
Let's call that lowercase y So
this would be f inverse of

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.910
lowercase y.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.380
Then if I were to apply f to
that-- I know this chart is

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.690
getting very confusing-- if I
apply f to this right here, I

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.870
need to go right back
to my original Y.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.010
So when I apply f to f inverse
of Y this has to be equivalent

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.900
of just doing the identity
function on y.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.490
So that's what the second
statement is saying.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:51.130
Or another way to write it is
that f of f inverse of y,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.400
where y is a member of the
set capital Y, it has

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.750
to be equal to Y.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.790
You've been exposed to the idea
of an inverse before.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.150
We're just doing it a little
bit more precisely because

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.200
we're going to start dealing
with these notions with

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.380
transformations and matrices
in the very near future.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.670
So it's good to be exposed to it
in this more precise form.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.230
Now the first thing you might
ask is let's say that I have a

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:25.450
function f, and there does exist
a function f inverse

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.850
that satisfies these
two requirements.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.100
So f is invertible.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.300
The obvious question, or maybe
it's not an obvious question

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:45.100
is, is f inverse unique?

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.790
Actually probably the obvious
question is how do you know

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.780
when something's invertible.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.600
We're going to talk a
lot about that in

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.530
the very near future.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.460
But let's say we know that
f is invertible.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:57.080
How do we know, or do we know
whether f inverse is unique?

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.960
To answer that question, let's
assume it's not unique.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.500
So if it's not unique, let's say
that there's two functions

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.930
that satisfy our two constraints
that can act as

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.850
inverse functions of f.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.130
Let's say that g
is one of them.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.430
So let's say g is a mapping.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.330
Remember f is a mapping
from X to Y.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:27.850
Let's say that g is a mapping
from Y to X such that if I

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:36.230
apply f to something and then
apply g to it-- so this gets

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.850
me from X to Y.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.980
Then when I do the composition
with g, that gets

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.480
me back into X.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:47.560
This is equivalent to the
identity function.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.430
This was part of the definition
of what it means to

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.680
be an inverse.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:12:01.000
I'm assuming that g is
an inverse of f.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.370
This assumption implies
these two things.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:15.370
Now let's say that h is
another inverse of f.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.160
By definition, by what I just
called an inverse, h has to

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.285
satisfy two requirements.

00:12:26.285 --> 00:12:28.760
It has to be a mapping
from Y to X.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.730
Then if I take the composition
of h with f, I have to get the

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.940
identity matrix on the set X.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.510
Now that wasn't just part
of the definition.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.160
It implies even more
than that.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.490
If something is an inverse, it
has to satisfy both of these.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.430
The composition of the inverse
with the function has to

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.610
become the identity
matrix on x.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.610
Then the composition of the
function with the inverse has

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.610
to be the identity
function on Y.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.050
Let's write that.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.240
So g is an inverse of f.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.340
It implies this.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.670
It also implies-- I'll do
it in yellow-- that the

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:08.470
composition of f with
g is equal to the

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.630
identity function on y.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:14.560
Then if we do it with h, the
fact that h is an inverse of f

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.180
implies that the composition
of f with h is equal to the

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.210
identity function
on y as well.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.490
Let me redraw what I drew in the
beginning just so we know

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.070
what we're doing.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.890
So if this is a set X right
here-- let me do it in a

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:36.780
different color-- let's say this
right here is the set Y.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.640
We know that f is a
mapping X to Y.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.390
What we're trying to determine
is is f's inverse unique.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.440
So any inverse, so we're saying
that g is a situation

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.960
that if you take the composition
of g with f, you

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.130
get the identity matrix.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.530
So f does that.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.750
If you could take g
you're going to go

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.020
back to the same point.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.450
So it's equivalent.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.830
So taking the composition of g
with f-- that means doing f

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:10.670
first then g-- this is the
equivalent of just taking the

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.430
identity function in X, so just
taking an X and going

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.360
back to an X.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.210
It's equivalent to that.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.250
So this is g right here.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.430
The same thing is true with h.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.960
h should also be.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.590
If I start with some element in
X and go into Y, and then

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:31.660
apply h, it should also be
equivalent to the identity

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.400
transformation.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.000
That's what this statement and
this statement are saying.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.580
Now this statement is saying
that if I start with some

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.620
entry in Y here and I apply g,
which is the inverse of f, I'm

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.210
going to go here.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.340
So g will take me there.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:57.700
When I apply f then to that, I'm
going to go back to that

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.560
same element of Y.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.970
That's equivalent to
just doing the

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.930
identity function on Y.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.520
That's the same thing as the
identity function of Y.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.140
I could do the same
thing here with h.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.410
I just take a point here, apply
h, then apply f back.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.360
I should just go back
to that point.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.980
That's all of what
this is saying.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.570
So let's go back to
the question of

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.330
whether g is unique.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.680
Can we have two different
inverse functions g and h?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.660
So let's start with g.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:32.240
Remember g is just a mapping
from Y to X.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.130
So this is going to be equal to,
this is the same thing as

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.460
the composition of the identity

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.220
function over x with g.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.180
To show you why that's the case,
remember g just goes

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:50.130
from-- these diagrams get me
confused very quickly-- so

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.670
let's say this is
x and this is y.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:58.130
Remember g is a mapping
from y to x.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.220
So g will take us there.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.090
There's a mapping from y to x.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.060
I'm saying that this g is
equivalent to the identity

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.540
mapping, or the identity
function in

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.420
composition with this.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.020
Because all this is saying is
you apply g, and then you

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.440
apply the identity
mapping on x.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.270
So obviously you're going to get
to the exact same mapping

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.920
or the exact same point.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.390
So these are equivalent.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.020
But what is another
way of writing the

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.840
identity mapping on x?

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.010
What's another way
of writing that?

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.310
Well by definition, if
h is another inverse

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.440
of f, this is true.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.010
So I can replace this in this
expression with a composition

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.500
of h with f.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.680
So this is going to be equal to
the composition of h with

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.770
f, and the composition
of that with g.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.850
You might want to put
parentheses here.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.490
I'll do it very lightly.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.110
You might want to put
parentheses there.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.450
But I showed you a couple
of videos ago that the

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.610
composition of functions, or
of transformations, is

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.330
associative.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.430
It doesn't matter if you put
the parentheses there or if

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.250
you put the parentheses there.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.070
Actually I'll do that.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.160
I'll put the parentheses there
at first just so you can

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.990
understand that this
is the same thing

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.190
as that right there.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.440
But we know that composition
is associative.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.849
So this is equal to the
composition of h with the

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.920
composition of f and g.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.470
Now what is this equal to, the
composition of f and g?

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.109
Well it's equal to, by
definition, it's equal to the

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.695
identity transformation
over y.

00:17:24.695 --> 00:17:31.500
So this is equal to h composed
with, or the composition of h

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:37.260
with, the identity function over
y with this right here.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.020
Now what is this going to be?

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.010
Remember h is a mapping
from y to x.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.830
Let me redraw it.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.505
So that's my x and
that is my y.

00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:50.680
h could take some element
in y and gives me

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.930
some element in x.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.400
If I take the composition of the
identity in y-- so that's

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.270
essentially I take some element,
let me do it this

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.410
way-- I take some element in
y, I apply the identity

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.930
function, which essentially
just gives me that element

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.940
again, and then I
apply h to that.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.720
That's the same thing as just
applying h to the function to

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.690
begin with.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.360
So just going through this
little exercise we've shown,

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.510
even though we started off
saying I have these two

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.690
different inverses, we've
just shown that g

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.970
must be equal to h.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.770
So any function has
a unique inverse.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.030
You can't set up two
different inverses.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.180
If you do you'll find that
they're always going to be

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.170
equal to each other.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.310
So far we know what
an inverse is.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.350
We don't know what causes
someone to be able to have an

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.660
inverse or not, but we know if
they have an inverse, how to

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.910
think about it.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.730
We also know that that
inverse is unique.
