00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.260
We're on problem 46.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:10.960
In the figure below, line
segment AB is parallel to C.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.010
I think there's a typo here.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.130
I've got to believe this
has got to be CD.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.850
That's got to be a typo.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.690
All right, so AB, I'm assuming,
is parallel to CD.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.580
That's probably what they wanted
to have, because you

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.580
can't be parallel to a vertex.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.860
And they say, what is
the value of x?

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.620
So the way to think about it is,
if these two are parallel

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.080
lines, then this segment up
here is a transversal.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.500
If we just extend the two lines
like this, let me see if

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.890
I can do it well.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.510
So if I extended that line like
that, and if I extended

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.690
this line like that, then
segment AD is just a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.230
transversal.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.890
Let me see if I can
do that one right.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.610
So if I just extended it like
that, you see it's a

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.110
transversal, and I could go the
other direction as well.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.860
I think you get the idea.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.810
So if that is a transversal,
what do you know about

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.260
transversals?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.900
We know that this angle right
here, I'll draw it small, is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.920
congruent to this
angle over here.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.790
So the measure of this angle
is also x plus 40.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.650
Because they're corresponding
angles, and you could see that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.460
by inspection, and if you moved
around the transversal,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.400
it would make sense that
that's the case.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.800
So this is x plus 40 and this
is minus 40, and they're

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.570
clearly supplements
of each other.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.940
They're supplementary angles.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.510
Then the sum of these
two angles have

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.450
to be equal to 180.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.350
So let's figure it out.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.500
So x minus 40 plus x plus 40
is equal to 180, because

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.420
they're supplementary.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.960
The 40's cancel out.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.840
So you just minus 40, plus
40 adds up to zero.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.420
So you're left with 2x
is equal to 180.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.920
x is equal to 90.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.170
So it's D.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.410
47: The measures of the interior
angles of a pentagon

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.110
are 2x, 6x, 4x minus 6, 2x
minus 16, and 6x plus 2.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.990
What is the measure in degrees
of the largest angle?

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.590
OK, so first of all, we have to
remember what is the sum of

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.470
the interior angles
of a pentagon?

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.160
And that's where I always draw
an arbitrary pentagon.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.260
Let me see if I can do that.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.760
Actually, there's a
polygon tool here.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.010
How does it work?

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.840
I'm just trying to
draw a pentagon.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.130
I don't know if that's any
different than the line tool,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.750
but regardless.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.560
So how many triangles can
I draw in a pentagon?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.270
And that tells me what my total
interior angles are.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.970
And there is a formula for that,
but I like relying on

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.300
your reasoning more than the
formula, because you might

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.170
forget the formula, or even
worse, you might remember it,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.190
but not have the confidence to
use it, or you might remember

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.930
it wrong ten years
in the future.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.540
So the best thing to do, if
you have a polygon, is to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.180
count the triangles in it.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.330
Straightforward enough.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.060
It's almost easier than
using the formula.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.810
So a pentagon has three
triangles in it.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.580
So the sum of its interior
angles are going to be 3 times

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.170
180, because it has
3 triangles in it.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.070
Each triangle has 180 degrees.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.450
And I know you can't see
what I just wrote.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.710
So the sum of all of these
angles are going to be the sum

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.620
of all of the angles in
all three triangles.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.260
So it's 3 times 180 is
equal to 540 degrees.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.340
So that's the sum of all of
these interior angles.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.400
Now, they say that each of them
are 2x, 6x, et cetera.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.570
So the sum of all of these terms
have to be equal 540.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.365
I'm going to write
them vertically.

00:03:42.365 --> 00:03:43.660
It makes them easier to add.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:53.810
So if we write there 2x, 6x,
4x minus 6, 2x minus

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.320
16, and 6x plus 2.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.100
This is going to be the
largest, right?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.610
That sum is going
to equal 540.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.660
So let's add this up.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.050
Minus 6, minus 16,
that's minus 22.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.970
Plus 2 is minus 20.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.220
That's right.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:27.820
And 2x plus 6x that is 8x plus
4 is 12, 12 plus 2 is 14, 14

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.280
plus 6 is 20.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.220
So we have 20x minus 20 is
equal to 540 degrees.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.990
Let me write it again.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.890
20x minus 20 is equal to 540.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.740
Let's divide both sides of
this equation by 20.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.800
So you get x 1 minus 1 is equal
to-- it would be 54

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.610
divided by 2, which
is equal to 27.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.790
Add 1 to both sides,
x is equal to 28.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.040
And they want to know, what is
a measure in degrees of the

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.620
largest angle?

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.890
That's going to be this one.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.810
That's the largest one.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.900
It's 6 times x plus 2.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:21.320
So 6 times 28, that's 48.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.470
2 times 6 is 12 plus 4 is 168.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.510
So it's 168 plus 2.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.960
It's 170 degrees.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.610
Choice C.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:42.290
Problem 48: What is the
measure of angle 1?

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.770
So this we're going into
the angle game.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.530
And these are fun, because
they are kind of these

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.840
deductive reasoning problems
where you just use a couple of

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.220
simple rules and just fill
in the whole thing.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.590
So let's think about it.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.680
This is 36 degrees.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.720
They tell us that this
whole angle right

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.430
here is a right angle.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.560
So this angle right here is
going to be the complement to

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.100
36 degrees.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.790
36 plus this angle have
to be equal to 90.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.270
So what's this one?

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.860
This one is 90 minus
36, which is 54.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.980
That's going to be 54 degrees.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.560
90 minus 30 is 60.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.090
Right, that's 54.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.060
And this angle right here,
that's going to be the

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.810
supplement of 88.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.130
So this is going to be-- I'll
do it in a different color--

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.940
180 minus 88.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.260
That is equal to 92 degrees.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.290
Now this angle 1 plus the 54
plus the 92 is equal to 180.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:44.290
So we know that-- let's say
angle one plus 54 plus 92 is

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:51.920
equal to 180.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.860
This is 146 is equal to 180.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.790
Subtract 146 from both sides.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:06.430
The measure of angle one is
equal to 80 minus 40 is 40, so

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.820
80 minus 46 is equal
to 34 degrees.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.930
So the answer is A.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:20.460
Problem 49: What is the
measure of angle WZX?

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.820
So they want to know what this
angle right here is.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.110
Let's do the angle
game some more.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.950
Let's see, we can immediately
figure out what this angle is,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.350
because it is the supplement
of 132 degrees, so this is

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:40.460
going to be 180 minus 132.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.950
So this is 48 degrees.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.580
This angle plus this angle
is going to be

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.820
equal to this angle.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.630
Or this angle plus this
angle plus this

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.560
angle is equal to 180.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.510
I don't know what I just
said, I think I

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.450
said something wrong.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.230
Write that down.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.220
So this angle is going
to be equal to 180

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.780
minus 52 minus 48.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.460
Because the sum of the angles
add up to 180, and so that is

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:16.870
equal to 180 minus 100 which
equals 80 degrees.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.530
So this angle right here
is equal to 80 degrees.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.830
And the angle they want us to
figure out is the opposite of

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.200
this angle, or in the
U.S., I guess, they

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.630
say vertical angles.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.770
And so opposite or vertical
angles are equal or they're

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.080
congruent, so this is going
to be 80 degrees as well.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.750
And that is choice A.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:44.390
Problem 50: What is the measure
of an exterior angle

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.000
of a regular hexagon?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.560
A regular hexagon tells us that
all of the sides are the

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.750
same, it's equilateral, and
all of the angles are the

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.870
same, equiangular.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.350
So if we just knew what's the
total degree measure of the

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.630
interior angles, we could just
divide that by 6, and then

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.710
that would give us what each
of the interior angles are,

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.210
and then we could use that
information to figure out the

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:06.890
exterior angles.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.500
Let's just do it.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.180
So once again, I like to
just draw a hexagon.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.480
Let's just draw a hexagon and
count the triangles in it.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.440
Two sides, three sides,
four sides, five

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.070
sides and six sides.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.300
And how many triangles
do I have here?

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.650
One, two, three.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:33.710
So I have one, two, three,
four triangles.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.400
The sum of the interior angles
of this hexagon, of any

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.150
hexagon, whether it's regular
or not, are going to be 4

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:51.810
times 180 and that's
720 degrees.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.640
And it's a regular hexagon, so
all the interior angles are

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.390
going to be the same.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.600
And there's six of them.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:03.690
So each of them are going
to be 720 divided by 6.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:09.030
Well, 6 goes into
72 twelve times.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:15.250
So each of the interior angles
are going to be 120 degrees.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.160
And I didn't draw it that
regular, but we can assume

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.640
that all of these are
each 120 degrees.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.790
Fair enough.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.220
Now, if all of those are each
120 degrees, what is the

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.790
measure of an exterior angle?

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.150
Well, we could just extend
one of these sides

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.440
out a little bit.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.260
We could say, OK, if this is
120 degrees, what is its

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.670
supplement?

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.760
Well, these have to add
up to 180, so 180

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.560
minus 120 is 60 degrees.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.410
I could do it on any side.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.390
I could extend that line out
there, and I'd say, oh, that's

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.300
60 degrees.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.680
So any of the exterior angles
are 60 degrees.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.030
B.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.180
All right, do I have
time for one more?

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.665
I'll wait for the next one
in the next video.

00:10:55.665 --> 00:10:57.190
See you soon.
