00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.650
Let's review a bit of what we
learned in the last video.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.760
If I have some linear
transformation that's a

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.750
mapping from rn to rn, and if
we're dealing with standard

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.750
coordinates, that transformation
-- applied to

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.530
some vector x in standard
cooridenties -- will be equal

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.740
to the matrix a times x.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.220
So let me write this down.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:29.730
If we are dealing with standard
coordinates-- So I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.350
have x in standard
coordinates .

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.210
If I apply the transformation,
that is equivalent to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.770
multiplying x by a.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.730
If I multiply x by a then
I'm going to get the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.220
transformation of x in
standard corodinates.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.340
This is a world that we're
very, very familiar with.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.220
Now, let's say that we have
an alternate basis to rn.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:02.860
So let's say that b is equal to
v1, v2, all the way to vn.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.370
So it has n linearly independent
vectors.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.310
Let's say b is a basis for rn.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.840
So it's a basis for rn, but
it's a nonstandard basis.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.880
These aren't just our standard
basis vectors.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.760
So b is a basis for rn.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.980
And let's say that c , which
just has these guys as it's

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.210
column vectors, v1, v2, all the
way to vn , is the change

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:44.710
of basis matrix for
the basis b.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.800
Now, we've learned -- we've
seen this several times

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.750
already -- that if I have some
vector x in rn represented in

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.310
b coordinates, or in coordinates
with respect to b,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.310
I can multiply it by the change
of basis matrix and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.520
then I'll get just the standard
coordinates for x.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.270
Or, if you multiply both sides
of this equation by c inverse,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.760
you can get -- And, if I start
with the standard coordinates

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.710
for x , I can multiply it by c
inverse and then I can get the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.140
b coordinates for x, or the
alternate nonstandard

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.710
coordinates for x.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.810
So we've seen both
of these before.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.430
So let's apply that to this
little diagram here.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.300
So if I want to get x and if
I wanted to write it in

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.980
nonstandard coordinates,
what do I do?

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.400
Well, if I have x, and if I want
to write it, what do I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.710
multiply it by if I want to go
to nonstandard coordinates?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.410
Well, I multiply it
by c inverse.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.140
If I multiply it by c inverse--
Whatever I write

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.840
next to this line.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.370
You could say, what matrix do
you have to multiply by to get

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.310
to the other end point
on your line?

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.380
So I multiply x by c inverse
then I get the b

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.490
coordinates for x.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:20.920
So these are coordinates
with respect to b.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.480
I could do the same thing here
with the transformation of x.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.910
This is just the standard
representation of the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.000
transformation of x.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.100
So I could multiply it by c
inverse if we want to go in

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.030
that direction.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.650
And then we're going to get
the transformation of x

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.490
represented in b coordinates.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.580
Now, in the last video what we
saw was, hey, why do these

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.250
separately?

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.730
Maybe there is some matrix --
and we found out what it is --

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.850
maybe there's some matrix d that
if we multiply this guy

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.760
times it, I can go straight from
the b coordinates of x to

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.290
the b coordinates of the
transformation of x.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.600
And we said that is matrix d.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.400
And in that last video we
showed that d can be

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.090
represented by a-- Actually you
could go around the circle

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.060
and rederive it, if you like.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.200
But we found out that -- let me
write in another color --

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.810
that d is equal to c inverse
times a times c.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.270
Now, this is all a review of
everything that we learned in

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.750
the last video.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.070
Hopefully, it clarified things
up a little bit.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.750
It's nice to just realize that
these are just alternate ways

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.910
of doing the same thing.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.440
Both of these are the
transformation.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.650
When you multiply by a you're
applying the same

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.440
transformation when
you multiply by d.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.030
You're just doing it in a
different coordinate system.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.610
Different coordinate systems
are just different ways of

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.350
representing the same vector.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.020
This and this are different
labels for the same vector.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.510
This and this are different
labels for the same vector.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.990
So these are both performing
the transformation d.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.280
Now, this was a relation we
got in the last video.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.300
That if we have our change of
basis matrix, we have it's

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.190
inverse, and we have just our
standard basis linear

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.460
transformation matrix, we're
able to get this.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.970
Let's see if we can
go the other way.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.440
If we have d, can
we solved for a?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.900
Well, if you multiply both sides
of this equation on the

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.280
right by c inverse, you get dc
inverse is equal to c inverse

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.150
acc inverse.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.940
I just put a c inverse on the
right-hand side of both sides

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.890
of this equation.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.300
This is going to be the
identity matrix, so

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.780
we can ignore it.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.800
And then let's multiply both
sides on the left by c.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.690
So then you get cdc inverse
is equal to cc inverse a.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.830
And this is going to be
the identity matrix.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.520
And then you're left with a is
equal to c times d c inverse.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.040
Which is another interesting
result.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.380
It's another thing to
put in our tool kit.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.460
Now, everything I've been doing

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.070
has been fairly abstract.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.880
Let's actually apply some of
these principles with a real

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.590
concrete example.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.310
So let's say that I have a
transformation T -- I'll keep

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.900
these guys around just because
they might be useful -- that

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.270
is a mapping from R2 to R2.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.150
And let's say that the
transformation matrix for T,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.580
so let's say that T of x in
standard coordinates, is equal

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:38.360
to the matrix 3, 2, minus 2,
minus 2, minus 2 times x.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.080
In the example we just said,
this would be our

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.230
transformation matrix with
respect to the standard basis.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.750
And we could call that
a right there.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.525
Now let's say we have some
alternate basis.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:58.720
So alternate R2 basis.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.680
Let's call that b, because
we've been

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.400
calling it b so far.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.470
And let's say this alternate
R2 basis is

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:11.600
vectors 1, 2 and 2, 1.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.140
So let's see, given this
alternate basis, whether we

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.280
can come up for a transformation
matrix in that

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.660
coordinate world.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:31.090
So we're looking for some matrix
d such that, if I apply

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:40.490
my transformation to x and b
coordinates, or in coordinates

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.410
with respect to this alternate
basis, it should be equal to

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.860
this matrix.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:54.390
It should be equal to d times
x in the v coordinates.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.950
So this is what I'm
looking for.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.860
I'm looking for that.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.370
Or, if we go back to our
diagram, I'm looking for that.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.690
You give me x and b coordinates
and you multiply

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.020
it by d, and I'm going to give
you the transformation of x

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.280
and b coordiniates.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.830
Now, just applying it to this
concrete example here.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.230
We have this formula
right here.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.000
This is the formula
for d, which we

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.320
proved in the last video.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.650
So we have to figure
out c inverse.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.610
So what is the change of
basis matrix for b.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.770
I want to leave this up here.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:37.865
So change of basis matrix for b
is just going to be -- let's

00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:38.730
just call it c.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.539
And it's going to be the basis
vectors for b's within the

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.820
columns so 1, 2 and 2, 1.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.835
And then we're going to want
to figure out it's inverse.

00:08:47.835 --> 00:08:50.780
So let's figure out it's
determinant first. So the

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.490
determinate of c is equal to
1 times 1 minus 2 times 2.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.340
So 1 minus 4 is minus 3.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.950
And so c inverse is going to
be equal to 1 over the

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.070
determinent.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.410
1 over minus 3 or minus
1/3 times -- We

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.550
switch these two guys.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.170
So we switched the 1 and the 1,
and then we make these two

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.610
guys negative minus
2, minus 2.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.230
That is c inverse.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:22.160
So this d vector right here is
going to be equal to c inverse

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.830
times a times the transformation
matrix with

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.820
respect to the standard
basis times c.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.070
Let me write it down here.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.740
So the d that we're looking for
is going to be equal to c

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.970
inverse times a times c.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:51.170
Which is equal to-- c inverse
is minus 1/3 times 1 minus 2

00:09:51.170 --> 00:10:00.570
minus 2, 1 times a -- Let me do
this in a different color,

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.200
I like to switch colors.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.770
So c inverse times a -- a is
right there -- times 3 minus

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.330
2, 2 minus 2 times c.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.820
c is right there.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.300
I'll do it in yellow.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.410
Times c, which is 1,
2 and then 2, 1.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.880
Let's do this piece by piece.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.870
Let's work through this.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.170
So what is this piece going
to be equal to?

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.850
We have a 2 by 2
times a 2 by 2.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.730
That's going to give us
another 2 by 2 matrix.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.980
So this first term right here is
going to be 3 times 1 plus

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.200
minus 2 times 2.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.025
So 3, 3 minus 4.

00:10:40.025 --> 00:10:42.160
So it's going to be
minus 1, right?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.490
3 times 1 plus minus
2 times 2.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.130
Right, it's minus 1.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:51.490
Then you have 3 times 2, which
is 6, minus 2 times 1.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.330
So that is 4.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.480
3 times 2 minus 2 is 4.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.130
And then when you go down
here, 2 times 1

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.740
minus 2 times 2.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.920
That's 2 minus 4.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.630
That's minus 2.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.860
And then 2 times 2 is
4 minus 2 times 1.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.610
So 4 minus 2 is just 2.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.990
So our matrix d is going to be
equal to minus 1/3 times this

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.560
guy -- 1 minus 2 minus 2, 1 --
times this guy, which was just

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.030
the product of those
two matrices.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.320
Now let's figure out
what this is.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.760
If I take the product of these
two guys it's going to be

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.850
another 2 by 2 matrix.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.210
So 1 times minus 1.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:37.560
which is minus 1, plus minus
2 times minus 2--

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.700
So let me be sure.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:44.130
So minus 2 times minus 2
is 4, and then 1 times

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.440
minus 1 is minus 1.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.060
So it's going to be 3.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.130
And then we go to
the next term.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:56.700
We have 1 times 4 plus
minus 2 times 2.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.130
So that's 4 minus
4, which is 0.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:05.200
And then we have minus 2 times
minus 1 which is 2 plus 1

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.750
times minus 2.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.710
So that is 0.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.600
And then finally, we have minus
2 times 4, which is

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.230
minus 8, right?

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.175
Plus 1 times 2.

00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:21.470
So minus 8 -- minus 2 times
4 is minus 8 --

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.150
plus 2 is minus 6.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.230
And all that times minus 1/3.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.950
So this is going to be equal
to-- 3 times minus 1/3 is

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.030
minus 1 --0 and then 0.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:39.460
Minus 6 times minus 1/3 is 2.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:47.410
So d is now our transformation
matrix with respect

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.020
to the basis b.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.550
So we were able to figure
it out just applying

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.490
this formula here.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.570
Now, what happens -- Actually
I'll save that

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:00.350
for the next video.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.155
Where we actually show
that it works.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.440
We can actually take some
vectors x, apply the

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.420
transformation or apply the
change of coordinates, get to

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.000
this, and then apply d.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.300
And then maybe we could go up
that way, multiply by c to get

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:15.715
the transformation.

00:13:15.715 --> 00:13:17.410
It's going to be equivalent
to a.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.490
I'll do that in the
next video.
