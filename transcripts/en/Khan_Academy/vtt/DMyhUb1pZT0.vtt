00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.013
We're asked to simplify this
huge, long expression here. x

00:00:04.013 --> 00:00:07.720
to the third plus 3x minus 6--
that's in parentheses-- plus

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.700
negative 2x squared
plus x minus 2.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.420
And then minus the quantity
3x minus 4.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.790
So a good place to start, we'll
just rewrite this and

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.550
see if we can eliminate the
parentheses in this step.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.420
So let's just start
at the beginning.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.270
We have the x to the third
right over there.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.435
So x to the third and then
plus 3x-- I'll do that in

00:00:28.435 --> 00:00:29.685
pink-- plus 3x.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.510
And then we have a minus 6.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.570
And we don't have to put the
parentheses around there,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.770
those don't really
change anything.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.750
And we don't have to even write
these-- do anything with

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.480
these parentheses.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.225
We can eliminate them.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:45.760
Just because there's a positive
sign out here we

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.130
don't have to distribute
anything.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.670
Distributing a positive
sign doesn't do

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.980
anything to these numbers.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.490
So then plus, we have a
negative 2x squared.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.600
So this term right here
is negative 2x

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.440
squared, or minus x squared.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.590
And then we have a plus x.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.890
We have a plus x.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.435
Then we have a minus 2.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.180
Then we have a negative sign
times this whole expression.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.730
So we're going to have to
distribute the negative sign.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.190
So it's a positive 3x, but
it's being multiplied by

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.250
negative 1.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.480
So it's really a negative 3x.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.040
So minus 3x, then you have a
negative-- you can imagine

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.240
this is a negative 1 implicitly
out here-- negative

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.090
1 times negative 4.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.570
That's a positive 4.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.820
So plus 4.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.020
Now, we could combine
terms of similar

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.260
degree, of the same degree.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.360
Now, first we have an x to the
third term and I think it's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.150
the only third degree term here,
because we have x being

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.760
raised to the third power.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.770
So let me just rewrite
it here.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.835
We have x to the third.

00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:48.400
And now let's look at our x
squared terms. Looks like we

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.680
only have one.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.340
We only have this
term right here.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.740
So we have minus 2x squared.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.130
And then what about
our x terms?

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.980
We have a 3x plus an
x minus a 3x again.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.143
So that 3x minus the 3x would
cancel out, and you're just

00:02:04.143 --> 00:02:05.490
left with an x.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.490
So plus x.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.620
And then finally our constant
terms. Negative 6

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.810
minus 2 plus 4.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.790
Negative 6 minus 2 gets
us to negative 8.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.150
Plus 4 is negative 4.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.850
And we are done.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.560
We have simplified
the expression.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.570
Now we just have a four
term polynomial.
