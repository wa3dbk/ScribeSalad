00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
I have this problem here from
chapter five of the Kotz,

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.660
Treichel, and Townsend Chemistry
and Chemical

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.560
Reactivity book, and I'm doing
this with their permission.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.990
So they tell us that ethanol,
C2H5OH, boils at-- let me do

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.930
this in orange-- it boils at
78.29 degrees Celsius.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.860
How much energy, in joules,
is required to raise the

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.920
temperature of 1 kilogram of
ethanol from 20 degrees

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.390
Celsius to the boiling point and
then change the liquid to

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.850
vapor at that temperature?

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.440
So there's really two parts
of this problem.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.290
How much energy, in joules, to
take the ethanol from 20

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.340
degrees to 78.29 degrees
Celsius?

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.510
That's the first part.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.310
And then once we're there,
we're going to have 78.29

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.100
degrees Celsius liquid
ethanol.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.730
But then we also need the energy
to turn it into vapor.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.150
So those are going to
be the two parts.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.010
So let's just think about
just raising the liquid

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.260
temperature.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.220
Let's figure out how we're
going to do that.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.150
Just the liquid temperature.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.850
So the first thing I looked at
is well how many degrees are

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.970
we raising the temperature?

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:27.110
Well we're going from 20 degrees
Celsius-- let me write

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.560
Celsius there just so it's
clear-- 20 degrees Celsius to

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.120
78.29 degrees Celsius.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.250
So how much did we raise it?

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.040
Well, 78.29 minus 20 is 58.29.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:55.910
So our change in temperature
is equal to 58.29 degrees

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.050
Celsius or this could even
be 58.29 kelvin.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.400
And the reason why we can do
that is because differences on

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.800
the Celsius scale and
the kelvin scale

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.800
are the same thing.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.180
The kelvin scale is just
a shifted version

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.030
of the Celsius scale.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.840
If you added 273 to each of
these numbers you would have

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.270
the kelvin temperature, but
then if you take the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.990
difference, it's going to be
the exact same difference.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.240
Either way you do it,
78.29 minus 20.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.120
So that's how much we have
to raise the temperature.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.450
So let's figure out how much
energy is required to raise

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.420
that temperature.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.340
So we want a delta T.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.720
We want to raise the
temperature 58.29.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.190
I'll stay in Celsius.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.400
Actually let me just change it
to kelvin because that looks

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.490
like what our units are given
in terms of specific heat.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.390
So let me write that down.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.690
58.29 kelvin is our change
in temperature.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.060
I could have converted either of
these to kelvin first, then

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.510
found the difference, and gotten
the exact same number.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.470
Because the Celsius scale and
the kelvin scale, the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.820
increments are the
same amount.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.600
Now, that's our change
in temperature.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.820
Now how much ethanol are
we trying to boil?

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.420
Well, it tells us
right over here.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.030
It tells us that we're dealing
with 1 kilogram of ethanol.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.460
And everything else they give us
is in grams. So let me just

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.190
write that 1 kilogram, that's
the same thing as 1,000 grams.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.940
We could just write it here.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.050
1.00 kilogram is equal to-- or
let me write it this way--

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.760
times 1,000 grams
per 1 kilogram.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.710
These cancel out.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.950
This is the same thing as 1,000
grams. Although the

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.270
reality is we only have three
significant digits-- this

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.260
makes it look like
we have four.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.780
So we have 1,000 grams times
1,000 grams. And then we just

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.030
multiply this times the specific
heat of ethanol.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.410
The specific heat capacity of
ethanol right here, 2.44

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.720
joules per gram kelvin.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.920
So times 2.44 joules.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:11.460
Let me write it this way, 2.44
joules per gram kelvin.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.990
You see that the
units work out.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.150
This kelvin is going to cancel
out with that kelvin in the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.100
denominator.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.450
This gram in the numerator
will cancel out with that

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.959
grams. And it makes sense.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.180
Specific heat is the amount of
energy per mass per degree

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.510
that is required to push
it that 1 degree.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.290
So here we're doing 58 degrees,
1,000 grams, you just

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.870
multiply it.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.350
The units cancel out.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.110
So you have kelvin canceling
out with kelvin.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.880
You have grams canceling
out with grams.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.030
And we are left with-- take out
the calculator, put it on

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.380
the side here.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:57.660
So we have 58.29 times 1,000--
times one, two, three-- times

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.720
2.44 is equal to-- and
we only have three

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.890
significant digits here.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.200
So this is going to be 142--
we'll just round down--

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.310
142,000 kelvin.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.370
So this is 142,000.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.820
Sorry 142,000 joules.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.810
Joules is our units.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.220
We want energy.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.430
So this right here is the amount
of energy to take our

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.100
ethanol, our 1 kilogram of
ethanol, from 20 degrees

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.990
Celsius to 78.29 degrees
Celsius.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.950
Or you could view this as from
293 kelvin to whatever this

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.850
number is plus 273, that
temperature in kelvin.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.390
Either way, we've raised its
temperature by 58.29 kelvin.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.980
Now, the next step is, it's
just a lot warmer ethanol,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.900
liquid ethanol.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.200
We now have to vaporize it.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.750
It has to become vapor
at that temperature.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.490
So now we have to add the
heat of vaporization.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.460
So that's right here.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.260
We should call it the enthalpy
of vaporization.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.390
The enthalpy of vaporization,
they tell us, is

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.880
855 joules per gram.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.980
And this is how much energy you
have to do to vaporize a

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.400
certain amount per
gram of ethanol.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.570
Assuming that it's already
at the temperature of

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.460
vaporization, assuming that it's
already at its boiling

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.500
point, how much extra energy per
gram do you have to add to

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.880
actually make it vaporize?

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.960
So we have this much.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.690
And we know we have 1,000
grams of enthanol.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.990
The grams cancel out.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:43.150
855 times 1,000 is
855,000 joules.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.130
So it actually took a lot less
energy to make the ethanol go

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.220
from 20 degrees Celsius to 78.29
degrees Celsius than it

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.130
took it to stay at 78.29, but go
from the liquid form to the

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.790
vapor form.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.180
This took the bulk
of the energy.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.070
But if we want to know the total
amount of energy, let's

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.000
see if we can add this
up in our heads.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.910
855,000 plus 842,000.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.120
800 plus 100 is 900.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.340
That's 900,000.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.720
50 plus 40 is 90.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.970
5 plus 2 is 7.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:25.500
So it's 997,000 joules
or 997 kilojoules.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.220
Or we could say it's almost 1
megajoule, if we wanted to

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.360
speak in those terms. But that's
what it will take for

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.070
us to vaporize that 1
kilogram of ethanol.
