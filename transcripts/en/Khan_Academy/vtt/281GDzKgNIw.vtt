00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.630
Welcome back.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.710
Almost done.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.040
We're on problem number 19.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.330
Let me read it out loud.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.870
At a bottling company, machine
A fills a bottle with spring

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.580
water, and machine B accepts the
bottle only if the fluid

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
ounces is between 11
7/8 and 12 and 1/8.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.770
So let me say O for ounces.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:32.970
So the ounces have to be
between 11 and 7/8.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.450
That's O, not 0.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.010
Maybe I'll use x.
x for ounces.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.570
That's an x, that weird
looking symbol.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.790
And 12 and 1/8.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.130
That's what B accepts if the
ounces are between that.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.490
If B accepts a bottle containing
n fluid ounces,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.400
which of the following
describes all

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.910
possible values of n?

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.830
So they're actually saying
n for ounces.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.020
We could just say this.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.420
So n is between these two terms.
And they give a bunch

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.300
of choices that involve
absolute values.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.250
And what I'm going to do is
actually-- I'm going to draw

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.730
this on a number line, and
then I think the absolute

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.010
values are going
to make sense.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.330
Let me do another color just to
change things a little bit.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:38.760
So if this is the number line
and this is 11 and 7/8.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.670
And this is 12 and 1/8.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.680
And n has to be between
these two numbers.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.800
n can be anything between
these two numbers.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.660
So when they're doing absolute
value, I guess you can see

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.670
that they're saying that-- they
have all these 12's and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.750
all that-- and I think you could
immediately see that 12

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.660
is right in the middle
of these two numbers.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.070
12 is right there
in the middle.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.110
Let me do a different color.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.020
This is 12.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.550
It's right smack dab
in the middle.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.010
And as long as n is a little bit
less than 12 or a little

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.500
bit more than 12, we're OK.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.540
The machine B is going
to accept it, right?

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.890
So how much more than
12 can n be?

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.120
This is n. n can be anywhere
in this range.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.980
Obviously if n is 12,
it's like perfect.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.250
It's just like right
in the middle.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.960
It's definitely nowhere close
to one of the bad ounces.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.225
It's kind of the
perfect ounces.

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:41.600
The perfect number of
ounces in the bottle

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.980
of the spring water.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.880
Let's see.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.910
So how much more can--
it can be 1/8 more.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.140
This distance is 1/8.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.780
How much more can
n be than 12?

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.680
It can be 1/8 more.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.490
And how much less?

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.800
Well this distance
is also 1/8.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.240
So we know that n minus 12-- the
difference between n and

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.750
12-- and we don't know if n
is greater than 12, or n

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.080
is less than 12.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.560
So we'll say just
the difference.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.830
And we're going to take
the absolute value.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.850
Because if n is greater, the
absolute value doesn't matter.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.380
And if n is less, then n minus
12 will be a negative number.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.560
But we just care about the
absolute difference.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.500
We don't care whether one is
negative or one is positive.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.200
So we say that n minus 12 has
to be less-- the difference

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.650
between n and 12-- and that's
just the absolute value of n

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.210
minus 12-- has to be less
than or equal to

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.065
this kind of tolerance.

00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:42.810
You probably haven't done much
manufacturing yet, but if you

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.270
do this is the kind of thing
you'll deal with.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.080
So it has to be less than
or equal to 1/8.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.250
And I want you to play
around with this.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.760
I mean you could say, well
n can't be more than

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.470
1/8 more than 12.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.670
So you could say that n minus
12 has to be less than or

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.590
equal to 1/8.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.360
And then you could also say
that on this side, n minus

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.360
12-- right, if n is around
here-- n minus 12.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.399
So this if n is greater
than 12.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:22.560
And then if n is less than 12,
then n minus 12 has to be

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.150
greater than or equal
to minus 1/8.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.390
This might be more confusing
to you, and I'm debating

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.510
whether I should
even write it.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.970
But these two things would
also translate into this.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.140
But the big picture, absolute
value just means the

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.440
difference between
two numbers.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.590
I don't care if one is bigger
than the other.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.340
I'm just saying that the
difference between these two

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.660
numbers cannot be
more than 1/8.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.160
So n minus 12, the absolute
value is less

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.810
than or equal to 1/8.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.760
And this choice-- well actually,
it's between these

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.120
two values.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.380
It can't equal these values.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.020
So it can't equal these
values, so it's not

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.990
less than or equal.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.230
It's just less than.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.170
So n minus 12 is
less than 1/8.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.740
That's choice C.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.045
And we are on the
last problem.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.020
Number 20.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.150
Almost there.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.160
The least integer of a
set of consecutive

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.340
integers is minus 25.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.970
So the least, the smallest
is equal to minus 25.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.340
The least is minus 25.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:41.650
If the sum of these integers is
26, how many integers are

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.080
in this set?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.150
This is interesting.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:51.940
So I have minus 25 plus
something plus

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.290
something plus something.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:04.340
And when I add up all of
the integers, I get 26.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.530
So it's the least integer
of a set of consecutive

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.020
integers is minus 25.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.400
If the sum of these integers is
26, how many integers are

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.230
in this set?

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.560
Well we start with minus 25.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.120
So the rest of the integers are
going to have to equal--

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.610
this is an equation--
minus 25 plus all of

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.330
these random things.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.040
So let's add 25 to both
sides of these things.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.880
So the rest of the integers are
going to have to equal--

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.400
so you know, let's call it this
is I2 because this is I1,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.320
integer 3, integer 4 plus
integer n, because we don't

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.610
know how many there are.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.090
So that means that I2 plus I3
plus bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.000
We don't know, a bunch.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.400
In is going to equal-- I'm just
adding 25 to both sides

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.740
of this equation.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:10.980
So that is equal to 51.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.860
Let's see, the least integer
of a set of consecutive

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.260
integers is minus 25.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.980
Oh, I forgot.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.510
That's consecutive integers.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.310
So we would actually know what
these values are, consecutive.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.910
So I2 is going to be minus 24--
you could almost ignore

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.730
what I said just now.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.800
Let me actually clear this.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.040
I didn't read that
consecutive.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.000
It's important to read your
problems properly.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.280
So it's minus 25 plus minus 24
plus minus 23 is all-- and

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:49.360
then we don't know how high it
goes, but that is equal to 26.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.150
So what do we know?

00:07:51.150 --> 00:08:01.420
We know that we go from minus
25 plus minus 24 plus minus

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.090
23, and we're going to
go all the way to 0.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.660
And then we're going to keep
adding that to 1 plus 2 plus 3

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.190
plus 4, and we're going
to add-- so you know.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.260
Well let me write it this way.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:22.110
Minus 25 plus minus 24 plus
minus 23 plus bam, bam, bam,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:38.120
bam, bam plus minus 1 plus 0
plus 1 plus 2 plus 24 plus 25.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.110
So I claim that the sum of all
of the integers from minus 25

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.260
to 25 is going to be 0.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.610
And how do I know that?

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.930
Well because minus 1-- let me
switch colors-- minus 1 is

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.770
going to cancel out with 1.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.490
Minus 2 is going to
cancel out with 2.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.120
Minus 23 is going to cancel
out with positive 23.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.560
Minus 24 is going to
cancel out with 24.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:05.840
And negative 25 is going to
cancel out with positive 25.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.100
And so the last term, 26, has
nothing to cancel out with it.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.860
And that's the sum because
all of the other

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.780
terms canceled out.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.440
So how many terms are there?

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:23.430
So to go from minus 25 to minus
1, that is 25 terms.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:30.650
Then to go from 1 to 25, that's
25 terms. And then we

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:35.380
have 0 is one term, and then
26 is another term.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:40.130
So 25 plus 25 is 50
plus 1 plus 1.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.580
52 terms. And that
is choice E.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.920
And we are done that
first section.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.040
I hope you had fun.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.630
I'll see you soon.
