00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.400
Calculate the area of a
rectangular room that is 13

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.000
feet wide and 18 feet long.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.860
So the room might
look like this.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.470
We're looking at a floor plan.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:20.080
So it is 13 feet wide and
it is 18 feet long.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.130
So that dimension is 18 feet.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.920
And when you're looking for the
area of a rectangle, you

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.440
literally just multiply
the two dimensions.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.850
You multiply the width times
the length in this case.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.770
So the area is going
to be equal to 13

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.265
times 18 square feet.

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:40.750
So let's multiply that out.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.690
13 times 18.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.320
Now we're first going to worry
about this 8 in the ones

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.980
place, right?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.000
18 is really 10 plus 8.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.820
So when we take this 8 in the
ones place, 8 times 3 is 24,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.400
the 4 in the ones places.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.230
Regroup the 2, which is really
a 20, or carry the 2.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.390
8 times 1, now this 1 is really
a 10, so 8 times 1 is

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.510
8, plus 2 is 10, and there's
no other digits, so we can

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.690
write the whole 10 down here.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.170
So we now see that 8
times 13 is 104.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.340
Now let's worry about
the next digit.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.950
Let us worry about this 1 right
here in the tens place.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.170
Now since it's in the tens
place, we want to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.250
put a zero down here.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.230
1 times 3 is 3.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.370
1 times 1, we ignore this 2.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.200
That was from the other
digit so we ignore it.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.120
1 times 1 is 1.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.400
So you see that 8 times 13 is
104, 1 times 13, or we should

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.510
say 10 times 13, because
that 1 is in the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.740
tens place, is 130.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.200
18 is the sum of 10 and 8, so 18
times 13 is going to be the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.310
sum of these two numbers.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.260
So it's going to be
104 plus 130.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.310
4 plus 0 is 4, 0 plus 3
is 3, 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.152
So the area of the room is 234
square feet, or you could call

00:02:09.152 --> 00:02:11.530
it feet squared, however
you want to do it.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.860
I'll write it like this:
square feet.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.260
And if you're actually draw a
grid where you drew 18 lines

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.980
in this direction, if you kept
going, and 13 lines in this

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.740
direction, if you were to
count all the boxes,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.820
you would get 234.
