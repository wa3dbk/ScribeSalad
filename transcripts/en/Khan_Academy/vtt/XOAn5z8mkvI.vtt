00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:09.228
Solve for x. And we have 5x plus 7 is greater than 3 times x plus 1.

00:00:09.228 --> 00:00:12.632
So let's just try to isolate "x" on one side of this inequality.

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:15.733
But before we do that, let's just simplify this righthand side.

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:20.333
so we get 5x plus 7 is greater than -

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:27.533
let's distribute this 3. So 3 times x plus 1 is the same thing as 3 times x plus 3 times 1

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:32.554
so it's going to be 3x plus 3 times 1 is 3.

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:35.231
Now if we want to put our x's on the lefthand side,

00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:37.802
we can subtract 3x from both sides.

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:40.282
That will get rid of this 3x on the righthand side.

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:44.718
So let's do that. Let's subtract 3x from both sides, and

00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:51.759
we get on the lefthand side: 5x minus 3x is 2x plus 7

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:55.933
is greater than - 3x minus 3x - those cancel out.

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:59.383
That was the whole point behind subtracting 3x from both sides -

00:00:59.383 --> 00:01:05.867
is greater than 3. Is greater than 3. No we can subtract 7 from both sides

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:08.267
to get rid of this positive 7 right over here.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:14.129
So, let's subtract, let's subtract 7 from both sides. And we get on the lefthand side...

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:24.080
2x plus 7 minus 7 is just 2x. Is greater than 3 minus 7 which is negative 4.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.282
And then let's see, we have 2x is greater than negative 4.

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:31.210
If we just want an x over here, we can just divide both sides by 2.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.223
Since 2 is a positive number, we don't have to swap the inequality.

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:46.733
So let's just divide both sides by 2, and we get x is greater than negative 4 divide by 2 is negative 2.

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:51.425
So the solution will look like this. Draw the number line.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.195
I can draw a straighter number line than that. There we go. Still not that great,

00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:58.508
but it will serve our purposes.

00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:05.133
Let's say that's -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:09.662
X is greater than negative 2. It does not include negative 2.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:14.367
It is not greater than or equal to negative 2, so we have to exclude negative 2.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:20.431
And we exclude negative 2 by drawing an open circle at negative 2, but all the values greater than that

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:25.435
are valid x's that would solve, that would satisfy this inequality.

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:29.985
So anything above it - anything above it will work.

00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:33.667
And let's just try, let's try just try something that should work.

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.667
and then let's try something that shouldn't work.

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:39.887
So 0 should work. It is greater than negative 2. It's right over here.

00:02:39.902 --> 00:02:48.834
So, let's verify that. 5 times 0 plus 7 should be greater than 3 times 0 plus 1.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:55.404
So this is 7 - 'cause this is just a 0 - 7 should be greater than 3.

00:02:55.404 --> 00:03:00.236
Right. 3 times 1. So 7 should be greater than 3, and it definitely is.

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:04.400
Now let's try something that should not work. Let's try negative 3.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.831
So 5 times negative 3... 5 times negative 3 plus 7, let's see if it is greater than

00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:18.642
3 times negative 3 plus 1. So this is negative 15 plus 7 is negative 8

00:03:18.827 --> 00:03:21.569
That is negative 8.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.667
Let's see if that is greater than negative 3 plus 1 is negative 2 times 3 is negative 6.

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:34.200
Negative 8 is not - is not greater than negative 6. Negative 8 is more negative than negative 6.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.769
It's less than. So, it is good that negative 3 didn't work 'cause we didn't include that in our solution

00:03:39.831 --> 00:03:40.400
set.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.399
So we tried something that is in our solution set and it did work.

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:44.900
And something that is not, and it didn't work.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.069
So we are feeling pretty good.
