00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.160
Let's see if we can create a
linear transformation that is

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.740
a rotation transformation
through some angle theta.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.500
And what it does is, it takes
any vector in R2 and it maps

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.120
it to a rotated version
of that vector.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:28.420
Or another way of saying it, is
that the rotation of some

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:38.870
vector x is going to be equal
to a counterclockwise data

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.850
degree rotation of x.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.170
So this is what we want to
construct using our new linear

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.420
transformation tools.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.050
And just to make sure that we
can actually even do this, we

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.250
need to make sure there's an
actual linear transformation.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.810
I'll just do that visually.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.310
I actually don't even
have a mathematical

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.240
definition for this yet.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.190
This is about as good
as I've given you.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.250
So let me just draw some really
fast axes right here--

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.530
I have to draw them a little
bit neater than that-- so

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.210
that's my vertical axes.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.310
That's my horizontal axes.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.840
I could call this one
the x1 and I'll

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.260
call this the x2-axis.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.530
In the last video I called
them the x and the y.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.290
This is the first component
of our vectors.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.230
This is our second component
in our vectors, and so if I

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:31.080
have some vector x like
that, we know that a

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.160
counterclockwise rotation of
this will look like this.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.560
I'll do the rotations in blue.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.390
It will look like this,
where this angle

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.130
right here is theta.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.960
So this right here is
the rotation for an

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.640
angle of theta of x.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.910
That's what this vector
right here is.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.990
So what do we have to do to
make sure that this is a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.850
linear combination?

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.800
We have to show two things.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.100
We have to show that the
transformation, so the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.060
rotation through theta of the
sum of two vectors-- it's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.380
equivalent to the sum of each of
their individual rotations.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.600
The rotation of the vector
x plus the rotation

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.620
of the vector y.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.140
And I'll just show that
to you visually.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.700
This is the vector x.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.420
Let's say that the vector y
looks something like-- let me

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.395
draw the original vectors
in yellow.

00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:25.680
So let's say the vector
y looks like that.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.180
So that's y.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.650
So what's x plus y?

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.890
So let's put heads to tails.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.320
If we just shift y up here,
that's also vector y, not

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.600
drawn in standard position, but
x plus y would then look

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.850
pretty close to this.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.650
Let me draw it a little
bit neater. x plus y

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.340
would look like that.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.550
That would be the
vector x plus y.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.220
And what would its rotation
look like

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.530
through an angle of theta?

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.940
What's rotation if you just
rotate this guy through an

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.940
angle of theta?

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.100
I'm just approximating--
it would look

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.350
something like this.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.790
This right here would be the
rotation of data through an

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.580
angle of theta of x plus y.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.900
Now let's see if that's the same
thing as if we rotate x

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.110
and rotate y and then
add them together.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.735
So what's y if we rotate it
through an angle of theta?

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:22.530
If we rotate y through an angle
of theta, it's going to

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.070
look something like-- this
is all approximation.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.970
I should be doing it with a
ruler and a protractor.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:38.350
Maybe it looks something like
this-- the rotation of y

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.310
through an angle of
theta right there.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.830
That's the same theta
that I've been

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.745
doing the whole time.

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:45.560
Let me make it in a color that
you can actually see.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.215
So that's that vector
right there.

00:03:47.215 --> 00:03:49.120
The rotation of x
was right there.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.030
So if we add the rotation of x
plus the rotation of y-- I'm

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.180
kind of fudging it a little bit,
but I think you get the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.600
idea-- so this is the rotation
of x plus the rotation of y.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.870
You actually get the rotation
of x plus y.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.490
So at least visually it

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.760
satisfied that first condition.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.560
Now the second condition that we
need for this to be a valid

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.980
linear transformation, is that
the rotation through an angle

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.150
of theta of a scaled up version
of a vector should be

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.085
equal to a scaled up version
of the rotated vector.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.210
And I'll just do another visual
example here, so that's

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.880
just my vertical axis.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.630
That's my horizontal axis,
and let me say that this

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.346
is my vector x.

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:42.850
Now let's draw a scaled
up version of it.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.030
So a scaled up version of x
may be just like x, but it

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.750
gets scaled up a little
bit, so it goes

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.390
all the way out here.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.110
So this is my c times x and now
I'm going to rotate that

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.580
through an angle of theta.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.720
So if we rotate that through an
angle of theta, you'll get

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.930
a vector that looks something
like this.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.470
Rotating it counterclockwise.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.760
So this vector right here is
the rotation by an angle of

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.870
theta counterclockwise
of c, x.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.020
That's what this
is right there.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.620
Now what happens if we take
the rotation of x first?

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.840
So if we just rotate x first,
we're going to get this vector

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.560
right here.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.310
So this right here is just a
rotation for an angle of theta

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.510
of x and then we scale it up.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.460
What we see it's the same thing
of this scaled up to

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.920
that when you multiplied by c,
than this thing is going to

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.480
scale up to that when you
multiply it by c.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.740
So at least visually,
I've shown you

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.150
that this is satisfied.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.260
So rotation definitely is a
linear transformation, at

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.990
least the way I've shown you.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.070
Now let's actually construct
a mathematical

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.200
definition for it.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.730
Let's actually construct a
matrix that will perform the

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.540
transformation.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:06.120
So I'm saying that my rotation
transformation from R2 to R2

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.270
of some vector x can be defined
as some 2 by 2 matrix.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.250
And it's 2 by 2 because it's a
mapping from R2 to R2 times

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.320
any vector x.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.320
And I'm saying I can do this
because I've at least shown

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.360
you visually that it is indeed
a linear transformation.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.430
And how do I find A?

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:31.320
Well, I start with-- since this
where's mapping from R2--

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.060
I start with the identity
matrix in R2

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.710
which is 1, 0, 0, 1.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.990
Its columns are the basis
vectors for R2, right?

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.720
We refer to this one as e1 and
this column vector as e2.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.100
And to figure out A, we
essentially just perform the

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.750
transformation on each
of these columns.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.480
So let me write that.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.200
So A-- our matrix A-- is going
to be-- the first column of it

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.460
is going to be a rotation
transformation performed on

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.410
the vector 1, 0.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.210
And our second column is going
to be the rotation

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.020
transformation-- there's a
little data here that I'm

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.460
forgetting to write-- times the
second column vector-- or

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.730
the transformation of
that one, 0, 1.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.010
This is what our A is
going to look like.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.250
So how do we figure out
what these are?

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.200
I'm trying to get to some
numbers and this doesn't get

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.860
me there, so let's
try to do that.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.010
Let me draw some
more axes here.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.500
Let me pick a different color,
I'll do it in grey.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.820
So that is my vertical axes.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.940
That is my horizontal axes.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.560
I could call this the x1-axis
and this is the x2-axis.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.250
Now this basis vector e1,
what does it look like?

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.190
Well, it's 1 in the horizontal
x1 is 1 and x2 is 0.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.700
So this is 1 out here, e1
will look like that.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.210
Let me do it in a more
vibrant color.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:11.230
e1 will look like that
right there.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.370
Now let me write what e2 looks
like. e2 would look like--

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.750
I'll do it in yellow--
e2 would look

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.600
like this right here.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.810
e2-- that's that vector, 0, 1.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.980
This is 1 in our x2 direction.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.380
Now if I rotate e1 by an angle
theta, what will it look like?

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.130
So if I rotate e1 in angle theta
-- I'll do it in this

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.254
color right here-- it will still
have a length of 1, but

00:08:36.254 --> 00:08:38.669
it'll be rotated like
that and that angle

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.470
right there is theta.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:47.000
So this right here is the
rotation of e1 by theta.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.520
These are all vectors,
of course.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.670
That's what that is.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.280
Now what are the coordinates
for this?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.160
Or how do we specify
this new vector?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.000
Well we can break out a little
bit of our trigonometry.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.680
Its new x1 coordinate-- we
could call it-- or its x1

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.580
entry is going to be this
length right here.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.810
So if we draw a right triangle,
it is the side that

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.550
is adjacent to theta.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.740
This side is a hypotenuse
which is length 1.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.210
So how do we figure
out this side?

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.980
If we call this side
the adjacent side.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.480
The adjacent side over
the hypotenuse.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.940
Adjacent-- let me write
it over here.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.900
Adjacent over the hypotenuse
which is just 1, is equal to

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.920
the cosine of theta.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.580
That comes from SOH-CAH-TOA
Let me write that.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.530
Cosine is adjacent over
hypoteneuse, and the adjacent

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:51.480
side is going to be our new
x1 coordinate, right?

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.970
Well, we can obviously ignore
that 1, a divided by 1 is

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.680
equal to cosine theta, which
means that a is equal to

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.340
cosine theta, which means that
this length of our rotated

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.540
vector is equal to
cosine theta.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.870
Its horizontal component, or its
horizontal coordinate is

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.930
equal to cosine of theta.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:15.540
Now, what's its vertical
component going to be?

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.110
Its vertical component is going
to be this height right

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.960
here, which is the same thing
as that height right there.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.910
Or we could say sine of theta--
and call this the

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.400
opposite-- sine of theta is
equal to the opposite over 1.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.350
So this is going to be equal
to sine of theta, right?

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.090
This over 1, which is just
this, is equal to sine of

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.340
theta from SOH-KAH-TOA.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.070
So this vertical component is
equal to sine of theta.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.030
So the new rotated basis vector
could be written as

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.815
cosine of theta for its x
component, or for its

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:50.580
horizontal component.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.510
And sine of theta for its
vertical component.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.150
This is the new rotated
basis vector.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.990
Now what about e2?

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.630
We could do something very
similar there. e2 is going to

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.220
end up looking like this
when you rotate it

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.880
by an angle of theta.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.140
It's going to look like that.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.190
That angle right
there is theta.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:19.040
We can create a little right
triangle right there.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.540
And so if we want to know its
x coordinate-- so now we're

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.580
concerned with the rotation
through an angle of theta of

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.420
e2, which is that right
there, of e2.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.410
This is e2 right there.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.890
This is going to be
equal to what?

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.870
Its new x coordinate or its
first entry in this vector if

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.125
we wanted to draw it in
standard position.

00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:46.670
Or the point that it is
specifying is going to be

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.960
equal to this distance, which
is equal to this distance on

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.970
this triangle.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.910
But the coordinate is
going to be the

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:52.990
negative of this, right?

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.060
If this is a distance of
2, this coordinate is

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.370
going to be minus 2.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.030
So what's this?

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.840
We have an angle.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.140
It's a right triangle.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.930
This is opposite to the angle.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.500
Opposite over 1, opposite
over hypotenuse is equal

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.480
to cosine of theta.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.130
So this opposite side is equal
to the cosine of theta.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.040
So the x-coordinate
right here.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.270
Oh sorry, my trigonometry
is messing up.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.990
This is the opposite
side-- SOH-CAH-TOA.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.930
Sine is equal to opposite--
let me write it-- sine of

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.910
theta is equal to opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.360
So the sine of theta-- the sine
of this angle is equal to

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.290
the opposite over
the hypotenuse.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.820
The hypotenuse is 1, has length
1 because these are the

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.520
standard basis vectors.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.000
So this is equal to
the sine of theta.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.810
Now, this distance is equal to
the sine of theta that's going

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.630
in the negative direction, so
it's going to be equal to the

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.210
minus sine of theta.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.690
And then what it's new y
component going to be of this

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.710
rotated version of e2?

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.030
Well, we just look right here.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.530
We have our angle.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.570
This is adjacent to the angle.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.510
This adjacent side over the
hypotenuse-- adjacent over 1--

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.270
which is just this is adjacent
right here is just going to be

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.600
equal to cosine of theta.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.700
So its new y-coordinate going
to be cosine of theta.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.780
So when we apply the
transformation to each of our

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:21.620
basis vectors, we get A is equal
to the transformation

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:27.530
applied to e1 which is cosine
of theta and sine of theta.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.300
And the transformation applied
to e2, which is minus sine of

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.820
theta times the cosine
of theta.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.010
So now this is a big result.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.850
We've now been able to
mathematically specify our

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.750
rotation transformation
using a matrix.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:48.040
So we can now say that the
rotation transformation-- and

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.560
it's a transformation from R2
to R2-- it's a function.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.610
We can say that the rotation
through an angle of theta of

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:01.860
any vector x in our domain is
equal to the matrix cosine of

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:07.320
theta, sine of theta, minus
sine of theta, cosine of

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.960
theta, times your vector in your
domain, times x1 and x2.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.920
And you might be saying, oh Sal,
we did all this work and

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.710
that's kind of neat, but
how do I apply this?

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.200
I still have all these cosines
of thetas and sines of thetas

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.320
there-- how I do it?

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.730
Well, what you do is, you pick
an angle you want to rotate

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.590
to, and just evaluate these, and
you'll just have a normal

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.740
matrix with numbers in it.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.760
So let's say we wanted to rotate
through an angle of 45

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.660
degrees some vector.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.290
Well, this is going to
be equal to what?

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.510
We just apply, or we evaluate
each of these

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.950
ratios at 45 degrees.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.310
A cosine of 45 degrees is the
square root of 2 over 2.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.870
Sine of 45 degrees is square
root of 2 over 2.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.540
Sine of 45 is the square
root of 2 over 2.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.530
We have a minus there--
so minus the square

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.010
root of 2 over 2.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:02.960
And then cosine is just square
root of 2 over 2.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.220
So we multiply it times
our vector x.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.830
So this matrix, if we
multiply it times

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.700
any vector x, literally.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:17.330
So if we have some coordinates
right here.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:22.260
And let's say that I were to
have a bunch of vectors that

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.800
specify some square here.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.340
Let me see if I can
do it properly.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.300
Well, maybe it has some triangle
here--maybe that will

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.620
be a little easier
for me to draw.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.410
I'll do a square.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:40.382
Let's say it has some square
here in my domain.

00:15:40.382 --> 00:15:43.580
So this is in R2.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.760
If I literally multiply this
times each of the basis

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.880
vectors, or actually all of the
vectors that specify this

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.790
set here, I will get, when I
transform it, I'll get a

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.710
rotated version of this
by 45 degrees.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.380
Just to draw it, I'll actually
draw a little 45 degree angle

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.570
right there.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:07.430
And then it will map it to this
image right there, which

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:08.940
is a pretty neat result.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.670
And if you ever attempted to
write any computer game that

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.480
involves marbles or pinballs
going around, this is a very

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.220
useful thing to know-- how
you rotate things.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.360
In the future, we'll talk
about other types of

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.010
transformations.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.780
But this is a super useful one
and this is super hard to do.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.780
And I remember the first time I
wrote a computer program to

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.600
try to do this type of thing,
I just did it by hand.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.670
But when you have this tool at
your disposal, all you have to

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.625
do is evaluate this matrix at
the angle you want to rotate

00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:38.420
it by, and then multiply it
times your position vectors.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.010
And so obviously you
have a bunch of

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:40.930
position vectors here.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.780
But here you can just do it
times the vertices and then

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.720
you can say OK.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.990
And everything else is just
connect the dots between them.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.550
And then you have your
rotated image.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.910
And just to be clear, these are
the points specified by a

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.150
set of vectors and
I always want to

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.060
make this clear, right?

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.540
This point right here is
specified by some position

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.620
vector that looks like that.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.819
When you apply the rotation on
45 degrees of that vector,

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.319
this vector then looks
like this.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.650
And the vector that specified
this corner right here-- we'll

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.119
do it in a different color--
that specified this corner

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.880
right here, when you're rotated
by 45 degrees, then

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.540
becomes this vector.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.140
And the vector that specified
that corner over there, that

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.800
now becomes this vector.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.710
That's what actually being
mapped or actually being

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:29.650
transformed.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.430
Anyway, hopefully you found
this pretty neat.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.500
I thought this was, at least for
me, the first really neat

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:35.900
transformation.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.490
And you can already start
thinking about how to extend

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.860
this into multiple dimensions
especially three dimensionals.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.420
If you ever try to actually do
it by hand, three dimension

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.940
rotation becomes
very confusing.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.230
But in the next video we'll
actually figure out a way to

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.550
do three dimensional rotations
around certain axes.
