00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.370
In the last video we figured
out that if we had a proton

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.990
coming into the right at a
velocity of 6 times 10 to the

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.470
seventh meters per second.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.360
So the magnitude of the
velocity is 1/5

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.490
the speed of light.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.740
And if it were to cross this
magnetic field, we used this

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.560
formula to figure out that the
magnitude of the force on this

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.650
proton would be 4.8 times 10
to the negative 12 newtons.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.600
And then the direction, we
used our right hand rule

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.990
because it's a cross product.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.180
And we figured out that it would
be perpendicular-- well,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.820
it has to be perpendicular to
both, because we're taking the

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.470
cross product-- and right when
it enters, the net force will

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.500
be downwards.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.020
But then think about
what happens.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.830
If you have a downward force
right there, then the particle

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.950
will be deflected downward a
little bit, so its velocity

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.900
vector will then look
something like that.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.800
But it's still in the magnetic
field, right?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.090
And not only is it still in the
magnetic field, but since

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.470
the particle is still moving
within the plane of your video

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.145
screen, it's still completely
perpendicular to

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:01.130
the magnetic field.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.660
And so the magnitude of the
force on the moving particle

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.980
won't change, just the
direction will.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.430
Because if we do the right hand
rule here, but if we just

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.260
move our hand down a little bit,
if we tilt it down, then

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.080
our thumb's going to be pointing
in this direction.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.200
And that just keeps happening.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.590
It gets deflected that
way a little bit.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.560
So the magnitude of the velocity
doesn't ever change.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.670
It always stays perpendicular to
the magnetic field because

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.230
it's always staying
in this plane.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.510
But the orientation does change
within the plane.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.280
And because of that, because
the orientation of the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.130
velocity changes,
the orientation

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.400
of the force changes.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.550
So when the velocity is here,
the force is perpendicular.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.100
So it acts as kind of a
centripetal force, and so the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.340
particle will start moving
in a circle.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.290
So let's see if we can break
out our toolkit from what

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.740
we've learned before in
classical mechanics, and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.940
figure out what the radius
of that circle is.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.110
And that might seem more
daunting than it really is.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.530
Well, what do we know about
centripetal forces and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.140
radiuses of circles,
et cetera?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.250
So, what is the formula
for centripetal force?

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.750
And we proved it many, many
videos ago, early in the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.090
physics playlist. Well,
centripetal acceleration is

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.100
the magnitude of the velocity
vector squared over the radius

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.630
of the circle.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.330
And since this is acceleration,
if we want to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.920
know the centripetal force,
it's just the mass times

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.590
acceleration.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.250
So it's the mass of the
particle, or the object in

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.270
question, times the magnitude
of its velocity squared

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.740
divided by the radius
of the circle.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.452
In this case, this is the
radius of the circle.

00:02:50.452 --> 00:02:53.270
And that's what we're going
to try to solve for.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.940
And what do we know about
the centripetal force?

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.550
What is causing the
centripetal force?

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.930
Well, it's the magnetic field
and we've figured that out.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.460
This is going to be equal to
this, which we figured out is

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.770
going to be equal to-- at least
the magnitudes-- the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.060
magnitude of this is equal
to the magnitude of this.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.790
And that magnitude is
4.8 times 10 to

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.150
the minus 12 newtons.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.290
And so the radius is going to
be-- let's see, if we flip

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.510
both sides of this equation,
we get radius over mass

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.580
velocity squared is equal
to 1 over 4.8 times 10

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.460
to the minus 12.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.210
I could just figure out what
that number is, but I won't

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.830
worry about that now.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.330
Then we can multiply both sides
times this mv squared.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.840
And we get that the radius of
the circle is going to be

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.030
equal to the mass of the proton
times the magnitude of

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:06.910
its velocity squared divided
by the force from

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.930
the magnetic field.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.610
The centripetal force.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.830
4.8 times 10 to the
minus 12 newtons.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.830
And the radius should be in
meters, since everything is

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.300
kind of in the standard
SI units.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.149
And let's see if we can
figure this out.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.530
Get our calculator.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.470
And this is where that constant
function is useful

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.090
again, because what is
the mass of a proton?

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.210
Well, that's something that I

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.020
personally don't have memorized.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.090
But if we go into the built-in
constants on the

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.850
TI-85-- let's see more.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.800
Mass of a proton.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.920
This is mass of an electron.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.170
This is mass of a proton.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.420
So mass of a proton-- that's
what we care about-- times the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.740
magnitude of the velocity
squared.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.500
What was the velocity?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.440
It was 6 times 10 to the seventh
meters per second.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.220
So times 6 times 10
to the seventh

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.050
meters per second squared.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.380
And all of that divided
by the magnitude of

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.750
the centripetal force.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.040
Which is the force that's
being generated by the

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.520
magnetic field.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.590
That's 4.8 times 10 to
the negative 12.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:26.380
Divided by 4.8 E minus 12.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.940
Let's see.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.340
Hopefully we don't get
something funky.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.330
There we go.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.900
That's actually a pretty
neat number.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.510
1.25 meters.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.630
That's actually a number
that we can imagine.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:46.520
So if you have a proton going
in this direction at 1/5 the

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.140
speed of light through a--
what'd I say it was?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.830
It was a 0.5 tesla magnetic
field, where the vectors are

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.220
pointing out of the video.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.510
We have just shown that this
proton will go in a circle of

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.210
radius 1.25 meters.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.820
Which is neat because
it's a number that I

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.520
can actually visualize.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.940
And so this whole business of
magnetic fields making charged

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.820
particles go into circles, this
is one of the few times

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.100
that I can actually say has a
direct application into things

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.040
that you've seen.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.510
Namely, your TV.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.790
Or at least the old-school TVs.
The non-plasma or LCD

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.410
TVs, your cathode ray TVs,
take advantage of this.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.760
Where you essentially
have a beam of

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.015
not protons but electrons.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.570
And a magnet-- if you take
apart a TV, which I don't

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.170
think you should do, because
you're more likely to hurt

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.730
yourself because there's a
vacuum in there that can

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.280
implode, and all that-- but
essentially, you have a magnet

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.700
that deflects this electron beam
and does it really fast

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.930
so it scans your entire screen
of different intensities, and

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.980
that's what forms the image.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.000
I won't go into that detail.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.060
Maybe one day I'll do a whole
video on how TVs work.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.090
So that's one application of a
magnetic field causing a beam

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.210
of charged particles to curve.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.670
And then the other application,
and this is

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.600
actually one where it's actually
useful to make the

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.550
particle go in a circle, is
these cyclotrons that you read

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.200
about, where they take these
protons and they make them go

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.700
in circles really, really
fast, and then

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.470
they smash them together.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.990
Well, have you ever wondered,
how do they even make a proton

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.090
go in a circle?

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.440
It's not like you could
hold it and guide

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.300
it around in a circle.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.770
Well, that's what they do.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:21.120
They pass it through an
appropriate strength magnetic

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.620
field, and it curves the path
of the proton so that it can

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.610
keep going through the same
field over and over again.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.670
And then they can actually use
those electric fields.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.610
I don't claim to have any
expertise in this, but then

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.620
they can keep speeding it up
using the same devices,

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.750
because it keeps passing
through the

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.440
same part of the collider.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.180
And then once it collides,
you've

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.430
probably seen those pictures.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.860
You know, that you spend
billions of dollars on

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.020
supercolliders, and you end
up with these pictures.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.620
And somehow these physicists
are able to take these

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.470
pictures and say, oh, this is
some new particle because of

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.580
the way it moved.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.980
Well, what they're actually
talking about is these are

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.700
moving at relativistic speeds.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.580
And since they're at
relativistic speeds as they

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.430
move at different velocities,
their mass is

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.050
changing, and all that.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.770
But the basic idea is what
we just learned.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.110
They move in circles.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.680
They move in circles because
they're going through a

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.540
magnetic field.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.180
But their radiuses are different
because their

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.010
charges and their velocities
are going to be different.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.917
And actually some will move
to the left and some

00:08:24.917 --> 00:08:25.640
will move to the right.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.480
And that might be because
they're positive or negative,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.570
and then the radius will be
dependent on their masses.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:31.810
Anyway, I don't want
to confuse you.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.559
But I just wanted to show you
that we actually are touching

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.650
on some physics that
a physicist would

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.309
actually care about.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:42.377
Now with that said, what would
have happened if this wasn't a

00:08:42.377 --> 00:08:45.980
proton but if this was an
electron moving at this

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.360
velocity at 6 times 10 to the
seventh meters per second

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.260
through a 0.5 tesla
magnetic field

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.240
popping out of this video.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.260
What would have happened?

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.360
Well, this formula would
have still been safe.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.335
The magnitude of the force is
the charge-- but it wouldn't

00:09:01.335 --> 00:09:02.630
have been the charge of a
proton, it would have been the

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.040
charge of an electron, times 6
times 10 to the seventh meters

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.490
per second times 0.5 teslas.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.210
So what's the difference between
the charge of a proton

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.820
and the charge of an electron?

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.840
Well, the charge of an
electron is negative.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.040
So if this was an electron,
then the net force would

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.510
actually end up being
a negative number.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.030
So what does that mean?

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.260
Well, when we used the right
hand rule with the proton

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.800
example, we said that the-- at
least when the proton is

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.110
moving in this direction--
that the net

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.690
force would be downwards.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.880
But now, all of a sudden, if we
reverse the charge, if we

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.850
say we have a negative charge--
the same magnitude

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:36.980
but it's negative,
because it's an

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.410
electron-- what happens?

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.910
The force is now in this
direction, using the right

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.880
hand rule, but it
is a negative.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.530
So really it's going to be a
positive force of the same

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.640
magnitude in this direction.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.700
So if we have a proton,
it'll go in a

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.810
circle in this direction.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.610
It'll go like this.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.820
But if we have an electron,
it'll go in a circle of the

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.810
other direction.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.110
Now let me ask a question.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.520
Is that circle going
to be a tighter

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.870
circle or a wider circle?

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.843
Well, the mass of an electron is
a lot smaller than the mass

00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:09.830
of a proton.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.680
And we had the radius is equal
to the mass times the velocity

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.990
squared divided by the
centripetal force.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.625
So this mass is smaller
and the radius

00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:16.460
is going to be smaller.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.370
So the electron's path would
actually move up and it would

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.990
be a smaller radius.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.570
Actually proportional to the
difference in their radiuses

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.960
is the difference in their
masses, actually.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.650
But that would be the path
of the electron.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.920
Anyway, I thought you'd be
interested in that, as well.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.370
I have run out of time.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.800
I will see you in
the next video.
