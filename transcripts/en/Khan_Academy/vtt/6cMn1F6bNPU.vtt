00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:02.277
- [Voiceover] So let's say you
have yourselves some kind of

00:00:02.277 --> 00:00:03.299
multivariable function,

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:05.983
and this time its got some
very high dimensional inputs.

00:00:05.983 --> 00:00:09.983
So x1, x2 on and on and
on up to sub x sub n,

00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:12.781
for some large number n.

00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:14.979
In the last couple videos I told you about

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:16.565
the Laplacian operator,

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:19.695
which is a way of taking in
your scalar valued function f

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:21.563
and it gives you a new
scalar valued function

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:23.474
that's kind of like a
second derivative thing

00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:26.647
because it takes the
divergence of the gradient

00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:27.991
of your function f.

00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:30.190
So the gradient of f
gives you a vector field

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.199
and the divergence of that
gives you a scalar field.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.229
And what I want to show
you here is another formula

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.954
that you might commonly
see for this Laplacian.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.023
So first let's kind of
abstractly write out

00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:42.259
what the gradient of f will look like.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:44.577
So we start by taking this del operator,

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.308
which is going to be a vector
full of partial differential

00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:48.141
operators.

00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:49.867
Partial with respect to x1,

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:52.117
partial with respect to x2,

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:55.553
and kind of on and on and on up to

00:00:55.553 --> 00:00:59.900
partial with respect to
that last input variable.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.031
And then you kind of just
imagine multiplying it

00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:04.533
by your function,

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.239
so what you end up getting

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:08.882
is all the different
partial derivatives of f.

00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:12.665
It's partial of f with
respect to the first variable,

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:14.453
and then kind of on and on and on

00:01:14.453 --> 00:01:18.354
up until you get the
partial derivative of f

00:01:18.354 --> 00:01:20.634
with respect to that last variable,

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:21.467
x sub n.

00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:26.077
And the divergence of that

00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:29.125
and just to save myself
some writing I'm gonna say

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.198
you take that nabla operator,

00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:33.641
and then you imagine
taking the dot product

00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:35.310
between that whole operator

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.033
and this gradient vector
that you have here,

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:39.817
what you end up getting is

00:01:39.817 --> 00:01:42.545
well, you start by multiplying
the first components

00:01:42.545 --> 00:01:44.532
which involves taking
the partial derivative

00:01:44.532 --> 00:01:45.872
with respect to x1,

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.839
that first variable of the
partial derivative of f

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:50.708
with respect to that same variable.

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:54.730
So it looks like the second
partial derivative of f

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.730
with respect to that first variable.

00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:01.592
So the second partial derivative
of f with respect to x1,

00:02:01.592 --> 00:02:03.097
that first variable.

00:02:03.097 --> 00:02:05.215
Then you imagine kind of adding

00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:08.342
what the product of these
next two items will be

00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:10.497
and for very similar reasons
that's gonna look like the

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.952
second partial derivative
of f with respect

00:02:13.952 --> 00:02:15.580
to that second variable,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.163
partial x2 squared.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.522
And you do this to all of them

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:21.963
and you're adding them all
up until you find yourself

00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:23.505
doing it to the last one.

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:25.545
So you've got plus and
a whole bunch things

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:29.367
and you'll be taking the
second partial derivative of f

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:31.766
with respect to that last variable,

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.599
partial of x sub n.

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.491
This is another format in which
you might see the Laplacian,

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.295
and often times it's
written kind of compactly,

00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:43.426
so people will say the
Laplacian of your function f,

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:45.946
is equal to, using sigma notation,

00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:49.696
you'd say the sum from
i is equal to 1 up to,

00:02:51.998 --> 00:02:53.464
you know, 1, 2, 3 up to n.

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.495
So the sum from that up to n,

00:02:55.495 --> 00:02:57.608
of your second partial derivatives.

00:02:57.608 --> 00:03:01.358
Partial squared of f
with that i-th variable.

00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:06.437
So if you were thinking in
terms of three variables

00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:09.448
often x1, x2, x3 we instead write x, y, z,

00:03:09.448 --> 00:03:12.578
but is common to more
generally just say x sub i.

00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:15.706
So this here is kind of
the alternate formula

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:17.780
that you might see for the Laplacian.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.565
Personally I always like to think about it

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:23.224
as taking the divergence
of the gradient of f,

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:25.134
because you're thinking
about the gradient field,

00:03:25.134 --> 00:03:27.369
and the divergence of
that kind of corresponds

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.250
to maxima and minima of
your original function,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.554
which is what I talked about

00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:33.872
in the initial intuition
of Laplacian video.

00:03:33.872 --> 00:03:36.535
But this formula is probably
a little more straightforward

00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:39.049
when it comes to actual computations and,

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.398
oh wait sorry I forgot a
square there, didn't I?

00:03:43.398 --> 00:03:46.696
Partial x squared, so this
is the second derivative.

00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:50.074
So summing all these
second partial derivatives.

00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:51.704
And you can probably see this a kind of

00:03:51.704 --> 00:03:53.863
a more straightforward way
to compute a given example

00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:55.490
that you might come across,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.685
and it also makes it
clearer how the Laplacian

00:03:57.685 --> 00:04:01.590
is kind of an extension of the
idea of a second derivative.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.574
See you next video.
