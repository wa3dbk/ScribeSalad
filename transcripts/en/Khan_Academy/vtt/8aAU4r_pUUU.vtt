00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.226
- [Voiceover] In the last video,

00:00:01.226 --> 00:00:03.109
I talked about how if
you're trying to maximize

00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:05.168
or minimize a multi-variable function,

00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:07.012
you can imagine it's graph.

00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:08.828
In this case, this is just
a two-variable function

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:10.122
and we're looking at it's graph.

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:11.487
And you want to find the spots

00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:14.221
where the tangent plane
is completely flat.

00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:16.696
So one way to visualize this
is to imagine a flat plane

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:18.769
that just represents a constant Z value,

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.965
so a constant output
value for the function.

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:22.629
And if you kind of move it up and down,

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:25.797
you're looking for the spot
where it only barely intersects

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:28.014
with the graph at the top
before it's not intersecting

00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:30.344
with it anymore, meaning
that there's no values

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:32.220
of the function that get above that point.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.350
So you're looking just
for where it's tangent,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.306
where you can find a
tangent plane that's flat.

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:38.043
But this will give you some other points,

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:41.116
like the little local minima here,

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:43.347
the bumps where the value of the function

00:00:43.347 --> 00:00:45.128
at that point is higher than
all of the neighbor points.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.387
You know, if you walk in any direction,

00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:47.990
you're going downhill,
so that's another thing

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.633
you're gonna incidentally pick up

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:51.962
by looking for places where
this tangent plane is flat,

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:55.356
but there's also a really
interesting new possibility

00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:57.723
that comes up in the context
of multi-variable functions.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:01:00.106
And this is the idea of a saddle point.

00:01:00.106 --> 00:01:03.430
So let me pull up another
graph here, this guy.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.352
And the function that you're looking at,

00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:07.011
here, I'll write it down, the function

00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:11.178
that you're looking at is f(x,y)=x2-y2.

00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:17.862
So now let's think about
what the tangent plane

00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:20.939
at the origin of this
entire graph would be.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.529
Now the tangent plane to this graph

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:24.323
at the origin is actually flat.

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:25.873
Here's what it looks like.

00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:27.042
And to convince yourself of this,

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:29.031
let's go ahead and actually
compute the partial derivatives

00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.362
of this function and evaluate
each one at the origin.

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:35.027
So the partial derivative,
with respect to X,

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:37.007
we look here and
X-squared is the only spot

00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:39.083
where an X shows up, so it's 2X

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:40.787
and the other partial derivative.

00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:42.564
The partial with respect to Y,

00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:47.408
we take the derivative of
this negative Y-squared

00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:49.404
and we ignore the X because it looks

00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:51.139
like a constant as far as Y is concerned.

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:53.231
And we get negative 2Y.

00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:56.285
Now, if we plug in the point, the origin,

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:58.255
in to any one of these, you know,

00:01:58.255 --> 00:02:01.904
we plug in the point (X,Y)=(0,0),

00:02:01.904 --> 00:02:04.866
then what do each of these go to?

00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.450
Well the top one, X equals zero,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.870
so this guy goes to zero
and similarly over here,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.522
Y is zero, so this goes to zero.

00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:13.097
So both partial derivatives are zero

00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:14.403
and what that means is if you are standing

00:02:14.403 --> 00:02:17.045
at the origin and you
move in any direction,

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:19.464
there's no slope to your movement.

00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:22.181
And one way of seeing
this is to chop the graph.

00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:24.242
So if we imagine chopping it with a plane

00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:25.800
that represents a constant X-value

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.912
and we kind of chop off the graph there,

00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:30.548
what you'll see, here, I'll
get rid of the tangent plane.

00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:32.162
What you'll see is that the curve

00:02:32.162 --> 00:02:33.659
where this intersects the graphs,

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.341
let me trace that out, the curve

00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:36.748
where it intersects the graph

00:02:36.748 --> 00:02:40.960
basically has a local
maximum at that origin point.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.016
The tangent line of
the curve at that point

00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:46.260
in the Y direction is flat
and it's because it looks

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.306
like a local maximum
from that perspective.

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:50.887
But now let's imagine chopping
it in a different direction.

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:52.700
So if instead, we have the full graph

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.087
and instead of chopping it
with a constant X value,

00:02:55.087 --> 00:02:57.123
we chop it with a constant Y value,

00:02:57.123 --> 00:03:00.042
then in that case, we look at the curve

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:02.239
and if we trace out the curve

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.355
where this constant Y
value intersects the graph.

00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:07.287
Let's see what it would look like.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.472
It's also kind of this parabolic shape.

00:03:09.472 --> 00:03:12.178
Again, the tangent line is flat

00:03:12.178 --> 00:03:15.762
because it looks like a
local minimum of that curve.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.951
So because it's flat in one direction

00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:19.485
and it's flat in the other direction,

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:20.908
the tangent plane of the graph

00:03:20.908 --> 00:03:22.953
as a whole is indeed gonna be flat.

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:25.912
But notice this is neither a local maximum

00:03:25.912 --> 00:03:28.202
nor a local minimum
because from one direction,

00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:32.089
from one direction, it looked
like it was a local maximum.

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:33.992
Here, I'll get rid of that guy.

00:03:33.992 --> 00:03:35.366
It looks like it's a local maximum

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:36.955
when you look on the curve there,

00:03:36.955 --> 00:03:39.175
but from another direction,
if you chop it another way,

00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:41.169
it looks like a local minimum.

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.455
And if we look at the equations,

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:45.182
this kind of makes sense
because if you're just thinking

00:03:45.182 --> 00:03:46.950
about movements in the X direction,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.384
the entire function looks like X- squared

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:51.282
plus some kind of constant.

00:03:51.282 --> 00:03:53.150
So the graph of that would look

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.366
like an X-squared parabola shape

00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:57.376
that has a local minimum,
but if you're thinking

00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:59.365
of pure movements in the Y direction

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:01.761
and you're just focused on
that Y-squared component,

00:04:01.761 --> 00:04:04.514
the graph that you get for
negative Y-squared is gonna look

00:04:04.514 --> 00:04:06.626
like an upside down parabola.

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:07.898
Here, I'll draw that again.

00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:10.110
It's gonna look like
an upside down parabola

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.891
and that's got a local maximum.

00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:15.081
So it's kind of like the X
and Y directions disagree

00:04:15.081 --> 00:04:17.918
over whether this point,
whether this point

00:04:17.918 --> 00:04:20.008
where you have a flat tangent plane

00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:22.862
should be a local maximum
or a local minimum.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.340
And this is new to
multi-variable calculus,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.097
this is something that doesn't come up

00:04:27.097 --> 00:04:28.770
in single-variable calculus because

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.224
when you're looking at
the graph of a function,

00:04:30.224 --> 00:04:31.734
you know, you're looking
at some kind of graph.

00:04:31.734 --> 00:04:35.251
If the tangent line is zero, you know,

00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:37.493
if the tangent line is
completely flat at some point,

00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:40.170
either it's a local maximum
or it's local minimum.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.958
It can't disagree because
there's only one input variable.

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.670
There's only one X as the
input variable for your graph.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.337
But once we have two, it's
possible that they disagree.

00:04:49.337 --> 00:04:51.911
And this kind of point has a special name

00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:53.960
and the name is kind of after this graph

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.075
that you're looking at,
it's called a saddle point.

00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:57.158
Saddle point.

00:04:58.002 --> 00:05:01.289
And this is one of those rare times

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.925
where I actually kind
of like the terminology

00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:04.974
that mathematicians have given something.

00:05:04.974 --> 00:05:06.480
Because this looks like a saddle,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.016
the sort of thing that you would put

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.232
on a horse's back before riding it.

00:05:09.232 --> 00:05:10.501
So one thing that this means for us

00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.107
as we're gonna try to figure out ways

00:05:12.107 --> 00:05:15.548
to find the absolute maximum
or minimum of a function,

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:17.617
as we're trying to optimize a function

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:20.503
that might represent like
profits of your company

00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:22.767
or a cost function in a
machine learning setting

00:05:22.767 --> 00:05:24.532
or something like that,
is we're gonna have

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:27.258
to be able to recognize if
a point is a saddle point.

00:05:27.258 --> 00:05:29.351
And if you're just looking
at the graph, that's fine.

00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:30.687
You can recognize it visually,

00:05:30.687 --> 00:05:32.930
but oftentimes if you're
just given the formula

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.544
of a function and it's some long thing.

00:05:34.544 --> 00:05:36.120
Without looking at the graph,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.700
how would you be able to tell,

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.892
just by doing certain
computations to the formula,

00:05:39.892 --> 00:05:42.513
whether or not it's a saddle point?

00:05:42.513 --> 00:05:44.054
And that comes down to something

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:46.163
called the second partial derivative test,

00:05:46.163 --> 00:05:48.052
which I will talk about
in the next few videos.

00:05:48.052 --> 00:05:49.135
See you then!
