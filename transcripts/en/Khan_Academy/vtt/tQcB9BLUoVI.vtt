00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.310
After all the work we've been
doing with fluids, you

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.670
probably have a pretty good
sense of what pressure is.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.110
Now let's think a little bit
about what it really means,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.910
especially when we think
about it in terms

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.040
of a gas in a volume.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.070
Remember, what was
the difference

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.440
between a gas and a liquid?

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.590
They're both fluids, they both
take the shape of their

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.070
containers, but a gas is
compressible, while a liquid

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.230
is incompressible.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.680
Let's start focusing on gases.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:39.120
Let's say I have a container,
and I have a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.830
bunch of gas in it.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.430
What is a gas made of?

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.190
It's just made up of a whole
bunch of the molecules of the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.860
gas itself, and I'll draw each
of the molecules with a little

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.620
dot-- it's just going to have
a bunch of molecules in it.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.770
There's many, many, many more
than what I've drawn, but

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.090
that's indicative, and they'll
all be going in random

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.440
directions-- this one might be
going really fast in that

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.349
direction, and that one might
be going a little bit slower

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.220
in that direction.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.130
They all have their own little
velocity vectors, and they're

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.970
always constantly bumping into
each other, and bumping into

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.510
the sides of the container, and
ricocheting here and there

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.030
and changing velocity.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.250
In general, especially at this
level of physics, we assume

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.410
that this is an ideal gas, that
all of the bumps that

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.040
occur, there's no
loss of energy.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.710
Or essentially that they're all
elastic bumps between the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.540
different molecules.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.620
There's no loss of momentum.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.280
Let's keep that in mind, and
everything you're going to see

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
in high school and on the AP
test is going to deal with

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.560
ideal gases.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.400
Let's think about what pressure

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.740
means in this context.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.350
A lot of what we think about
pressure is something pushing

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.110
on an area.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.930
If we think about pressure
here-- let's pick

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.840
an arbitrary area.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.770
Let's take this side.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.295
Let's take this surface
of its container.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.940
Where's the pressure
going to be

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.540
generated onto this surface?

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.660
It's going to be generated by
just the millions and billions

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.040
and trillions of little
bumps every time-- let

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.850
me draw a side view.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.160
If this is the side view of the
container, that same side,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.590
every second there's always
these little molecules of gas

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.720
moving around.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.930
If we pick an arbitrary period
of time, they're always

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.380
ricocheting off of the side.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.000
We're looking at time over a
super-small fraction of time.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.790
And over that period of time,
this one might end up here,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.750
this one maybe bumped into it
right after it ricocheted and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.400
came here, this one changes
momentum and goes like that.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.140
This one might have already been
going in that direction,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.640
and that one might ricochet.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.280
But what's happening is, at
any given moment, since

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.760
there's so many molecules,
there's always going to be

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.190
some molecules that
are bumping into

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.960
the side of the wall.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.275
When they bump, they have
a change in momentum.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.900
All force is change in
momentum over time.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.410
What I'm saying is that in any
interval of time, over any

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.070
period or any change in time,
there's just going to be a

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.910
bunch of particles that are
changing their momentum on the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.500
side of this wall.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.250
That is going to generate force,
and so if we think

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.560
about how many on average--
because it's hard to keep

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.720
track of each particle
individually, and when we did

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.670
kinematics and stuff, we'd keep
track of the individual

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.460
object at play.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.780
But when we're dealing with
gases and things on a macro

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.280
level, you can't keep track of
any individual one, unless you

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.830
have some kind of unbelievable
supercomputer.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.490
We can say, on average, this
many particles are changing

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.240
momentum on this wall in
this amount of time.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.890
And so the force exerted on this
wall or this surface is

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.670
going to be x.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.910
If we know what that force is,
and we you know the area of

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.090
the wall, we can figure out
pressure, because pressure is

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.560
equal to force divided
by area.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.110
What does this help us with?

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.150
I wanted to give you that
intuition first, and now I'm

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.710
just going to give you the one
formula that you really just

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.970
need to know in thermodynamics.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.430
And then as we go into the next
few videos, I'll prove to

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.750
you why it works, and
hopefully give

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.700
you more of an intuition.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.230
Now you understand, hopefully,
what pressure means in the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.610
context of a gas
in a container.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.910
With that out of the way, let
me give you a formula.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.890
I hope by the end of this video
you have the intuition

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.520
for why this formula works.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.490
In general, if I have an ideal
gas in a container, the

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.630
pressure exerted on the gas-- on
the side of the container,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.910
or actually even at any point
within the gas, because it

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.000
will all become homogeneous at
some point-- and we'll talk

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.160
about entropy in future videos--
but the pressure in

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.920
the container and on its
surface, times the volume of

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.820
the container, is equal
to some constant.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.230
We'll see in future videos that
that constant is actually

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.830
proportional to the average
kinetic energy of the

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.100
molecules bouncing around.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.240
That should make sense to you.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.495
If the molecules were moving
around a lot faster, then you

00:05:56.495 --> 00:05:58.400
would have more kinetic energy,
and then they would be

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.880
changing momentum on the sides
of the surface a lot more, so

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.930
you would have more pressure.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.780
Let's see if we can get a little
bit more intuition onto

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.185
why pressure times volume
is a constant.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.180
Let's say I have a container
now, and it's got a bunch of

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.640
molecules of gas in it.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.190
Just like I showed you in that
last bit right before I

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.260
erased, these are bouncing
off of the sides

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.510
at a certain rate.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.950
Each of the molecules might
have a different kinetic

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.160
energy-- it's always changing,
because they're always

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.960
transferring momentum
to each other.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.030
But on average, they all have
a given kinetic energy, they

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.420
keep bumping at a certain rate
into the wall, and that

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.880
determines the pressure.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.920
What happens if I were able to
squeeze the box, and if I were

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.860
able to decrease the
volume of the box?

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.910
I just take that same box with
the same number of molecules

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.470
in it, but I squeeze.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.460
I make the volume of
the box smaller--

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.940
what's going to happen?

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:22.110
I have the same number of
molecules in there, with the

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.890
same kinetic energy, and on
average, they're moving with

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.830
the same velocities.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.300
So now what's going to happen?

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.150
They're going to be hitting the
sides more often-- at the

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.370
same time here that this
particle went bam, bam, now it

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.680
could go bam, bam, bam.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.400
They're going to be hitting
the sides more often, so

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.280
you're going to have more
changes in momentum, and so

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.550
you're actually going to have
each particle exert more force

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.130
on each surface.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.250
Because it's going to be hitting
them more often in a

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.510
given amount of time.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.350
The surfaces themselves
are smaller.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.540
You have more force on a
surface, and on a smaller

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.170
surface, you're going to
have higher pressure.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.060
Hopefully, that gives you an
intuition that if I had some

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.900
amount of pressure in this
situation-- if I squeeze the

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.190
volume, the pressure
increases.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.750
Another intuition-- if
I have a balloon,

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.940
what blows up a balloon?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:18.830
It's the internal air pressure
of the helium, or your own

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.320
exhales that you put
into the balloon.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.000
The more and more you try to
squeeze a balloon-- if you

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.580
squeeze it from all directions,
it gets harder and

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.040
harder to do it, and that's
because the pressure within

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.289
the balloon increases as you
decrease the volume.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:41.480
If volume goes down, pressure
goes up, and that makes sense.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.669
That follows that when they
multiply each other, you have

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.130
to have a constant.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.050
Let's take the same example
again, and what happens if you

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.190
make the volume bigger?

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:56.340
Let's say I have-- it's huge
like that, and I should have

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.890
done it more proportionally, but
I think you get the idea.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.090
You have the same number of
particles, and if I had a

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.740
particle here, in some period
of time it could have gone

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.930
bam, bam, bam-- it could have
hit the walls twice.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.420
Now, in this situation, with
larger walls, it might just go

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.300
bam, and in that same amount
of time, it will maybe get

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.150
here and won't even hit
the other wall.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.670
The particles, on average, are
going to be colliding with the

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.600
wall less often, and the walls
are going to have a larger

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.390
area, as well.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.860
So in this case, when our volume
goes up, the average

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:35.520
pressure or the pressure in
the container goes down.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.560
Hopefully, that gives you a
little intuition, and so

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.970
you'll never forget
that pressure

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.200
times volume is constant.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.590
And then we can use that to do
some pretty common problems,

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.110
which I'll do in
the next video.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.917
I'm about to run out of time.

00:09:46.917 --> 00:09:48.167
See you soon.
