00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.500
Let's see if we can learn
a thing or two about

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.160
the hyperbola.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.680
And out of all the conic
sections, this is probably the

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.340
one that confuses people the
most, because it's not quite

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.820
as easy to draw as the
circle and the ellipse.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.160
You have to do a little
bit more algebra.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.930
But hopefully over the course
of this video you'll get pretty

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.540
comfortable with that, and
you'll see that hyperbolas in

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.660
some way are more fun than any
of the other conic sections.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.420
So just as a review, I want to
do this just so you see the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.750
similarity in the formulas or
the standard form of the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.740
different conic sections.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.330
If you have a circle centered
at 0, its equation is x

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.730
squared plus y squared
is equal to r squared.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.720
And we saw that this could also
be written as-- and I'm doing

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.150
this because I want to show
that this is really just the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.890
same thing as the standard
equation for an ellipse.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.870
If you divide both sides of
this by r squared, you get x

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.760
squared over r squared plus y
squared over r squared

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.775
is equal to 1.

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:08.080
And so this is a circle.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.000
And once again, just as review,
a circle, all of the points on

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.370
the circle are equidistant
from the center.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.650
Or in this case, you can kind
of say that the major axis and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.630
the minor axis are the same
distance, that there isn't any

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.470
distinction between the two.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.280
You're always an equal distance
away from the center.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.780
So that was a circle.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.460
An ellipse was pretty much
this, but these two numbers

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.600
could be different.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.310
Because your distance from
the center could change.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.850
So it's x squared over a
squared plus y squared over

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.590
b squared is equal to 1.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.670
That's an ellipse.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.620
And now, I'll skip parabola for
now, because parabola's kind

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.770
of an interesting case, and
you've already touched on it.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.050
So I'll go into more depth
in that in a future video.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.820
But a hyperbola is very
close in formula to this.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.630
And so there's two ways that a
hyperbola could be written.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.770
And I'll do those two ways.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.750
So it could either be written
as x squared over a squared

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.815
minus y squared over b
squared is equal to 1.

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:15.060
And notice the only difference
between this equation and this

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.880
one is that instead of a
plus y squared, we have

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.630
a minus y squared here.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.870
So that would be one hyperbola.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.400
The other one would be
if the minus sign was

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.730
the other way around.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.970
If it was y squared over b
squared minus x squared over

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.330
a squared is equal to 1.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.850
So now the minus is in front
of the x squared term instead

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.820
of the y squared term.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.650
And what I want to do now is
try to figure out, how do

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.970
we graph either of
these parabolas?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.170
Maybe we'll do both cases.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.450
And in a lot of text books, or
even if you look it up over the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.920
web, they'll give you formulas.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.990
But I don't like
those formulas.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.205
One, because I'll
always forget it.

00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:56.530
And you'll forget it
immediately after

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.070
taking the test.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.790
You might want to memorize
it if you just want to

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.450
be able to do the test
a little bit faster.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.500
But you'll forget it.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.260
And the second thing is, not
only will you forget it, but

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.240
you'll probably get confused.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.440
Because sometimes they always
use the a under the x and the b

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.640
under the y, or sometimes they
always use the a under the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.070
positive term and to b
under the negative term.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.110
So if you just memorize, oh, a
divided by b, that's the slope

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.150
of the asymptote and all of
that, you might be using

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.040
the wrong a and b.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.490
So I encourage you to always
re-prove it to yourself.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.770
And that's what we're
going to do right here.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.450
It actually doesn't
take too long.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.440
So these are both hyperbolas.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.040
And what I like to do
whenever I have a

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.070
hyperbola is solve for y.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.480
So in this case, if I subtract
x squared over a squared from

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.970
both sides, I get-- let me
change the color-- I get minus

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.730
y squared over b squared.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.420
That stays there.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.680
Is equal to 1 minus x
squared over a squared.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.960
And then, let's see, I want to
get rid of this minus, and I

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.360
want to get rid of
this b squared.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.840
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation times

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.070
minus b squared.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.900
If you multiply the left hand
side times minus b squared, the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.550
minus and the b squared go
away, and you're just left

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.920
with y squared is equal
to minus b squared.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.440
And then minus b squared
times a plus, it becomes

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.990
a plus b squared over
a squared x squared.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.220
We're almost there.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.890
And then you get y is equal
to-- and I'm doing this on

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.720
purpose-- the plus or minus
square root, because it can be

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.010
the plus or minus square root.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.680
Of-- and let's switch these
around, just so I have

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.430
the positive term first.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:49.270
b squared over a squared x
squared minus b squared.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.060
Now you said, Sal, you
said this was simple.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.890
I'm solving this.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.430
This looks like a really
complicated thing.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.380
But remember, we're doing this
to figure out asymptotes of the

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.740
hyperbola, just to kind of
give you a sense of

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.090
where we're going.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.120
Let me do it here--
actually, I want to do

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.390
that other hyperbola.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.630
So a hyperbola, if that's
the x, that's the y-axis,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.340
it has two asymptotes.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.410
And the asymptotes, they're
these lines that the

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.420
hyperbola will approach.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.520
So if those are the two
asymptotes-- and they're always

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.440
the negative slope of each
other-- we know that this

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.110
hyperbola's is either, and
we'll show in a second which

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.090
one it is, it's either going to
look something like this, where

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.650
as we approach infinity we get
closer and closer this line and

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.150
closer and closer to that line.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.395
And here it's either going to
look like that-- I didn't draw

00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:36.095
it perfectly; it never
touches the asymptote.

00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:39.000
It just gets closer and closer
and closer, arbitrarily

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.750
close to the asymptote.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.830
It's either going to look
like that, where it opens

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.230
up to the right and left.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:51.610
Or our hyperbola's going
to open up and down.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.860
And once again, as you go
further and further, and

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.430
asymptote means it's just going
to get closer and closer to one

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.260
of these lines without
ever touching it.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.030
It will get infinitely close as
you get infinitely far away,

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.010
as x gets infinitely large.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.930
So in order to figure out which
one of these this is, let's

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.420
just think about what happens
as x becomes infinitely large.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.240
So as x approaches infinity.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.250
So as x approaches infinity, or
x approaches negative infinity.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.540
So I'll say plus or
minus infinity, right?

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.740
It doesn't matter, because
when you take a negative,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.430
this gets squared.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.100
So this number becomes really
huge as you approach positive

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.460
or negative infinity.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.160
And you'll learn more about
this when we actually do

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.490
limits, but I think
that's intuitive.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.650
That this number becomes huge.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.020
This number's just a constant.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.810
It just stays the same.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.970
So as x approaches positive or
negative infinity, as it gets

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.050
really, really large, y is
going to be approximately equal

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.900
to-- actually, I think
that's congruent.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.250
I always forget notation.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.420
Approximately.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.820
This just means not exactly
but approximately equal to.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.450
When x approaches infinity,
it's going to be approximately

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.420
equal to the plus or minus
square root of b squared

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.070
over a squared x squared.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.540
And that is equal to-- now you
can take the square root.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.520
You couldn't take the square
root of this algebraically,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.680
but this you can.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.280
This is equal to plus
or minus b over a x.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.080
So that tells us, essentially,
what the two asymptotes are.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.040
Where the slope of one
asymptote will be b over a x.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.260
This could give you positive b
over a x, and the other one

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.650
would be minus b over a x.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.930
And I'll do this with
some example so it makes

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.670
it a little clearer.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.990
But we still know what the
asymptotes look like.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.320
It's these two lines.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.340
Because it's plus b a x is one
line, y equals plus b a x.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.860
Let's say it's this one.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:51.410
This asymptote right here is y
is equal to plus b over a x.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.510
I know you can't read that.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.920
And then the downward sloping
asymptote we could say is y is

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.730
equal to minus b over a x.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.200
So those are two asymptotes.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.580
But we still have to figure out
whether the hyperbola opens up

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.930
to the left and right, or
does it open up and down?

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.350
And there, there's
two ways to do this.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.440
One, you say, well this
is an approximation.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.865
This is what you approach
as x approaches infinity.

00:08:14.865 --> 00:08:17.980
But we see here that even when
x approaches infinity, we're

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.060
always going to be a little
bit smaller than that number.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.380
Because we're subtracting a
positive number from this.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.950
We're subtracting a positive
number, and then we're taking

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.660
the square root of
the whole thing.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.060
So we're always going to be a
little bit lower than the

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.110
asymptote, especially when
we're in the positive quadrant.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.720
Right?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.940
So to me, that's how
I like to do it.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.185
I think, we're always-- at
least in the positive quadrant;

00:08:37.185 --> 00:08:38.800
it gets a little more confusing
when you go to the other

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.340
quadrants-- we're always going
to be a little bit lower

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.260
than the asymptote.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.460
So we're going to approach
from the bottom there.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.050
And since you know you're
there, you know it's going

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.790
to be like this and
approach this asymptote.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.960
And then since it's opening
to the right here, it's also

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.330
going to open to the left.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.900
The other way to test it, and
maybe this is more intuitive

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.840
for you, is to figure out,
in the original equation

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.130
could x or y equal to 0?

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.440
Because when you open to the
right and left, notice you

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.110
never get to x equal to 0.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.680
You get to y equal 0,
right here and here.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.940
But you never get
to x equals 0.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.620
And actually your teacher
might want you to plot these

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.730
points, and there you just
substitute y equals 0.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.300
And you can just look at
the original equation.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.240
Actually, you could even look
at this equation right here.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.600
Can x ever equal 0?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.890
If you look at this equation,
if x is equal to 0, this whole

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.370
term right here would cancel
out, and you'd just be left

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.730
with a minus b squared.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.330
Which is, you're taking b
squared, and you put a

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.270
negative sign in front of it.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.560
So that's a negative number.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.780
And then you're taking a square
root of a negative number.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.420
So we're not dealing with
imaginaries right now.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.440
So you can never
have x equal to 0.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.930
But y could be
equal to 0, right?

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.360
You can set y equal to 0 and
then you could solve for it.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.680
So in this case,
actually let's do that.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.050
If y is equal to 0, you get 0
is equal to the square root of

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.300
b squared over a squared x
squared minus b squared.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.140
If you square both sides,
you get b squared over a

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:08.280
squared x squared minus
b squared is equal to 0.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.740
I know this is messy.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.960
So then you get b squared
over a squared x squared

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.010
is equal to b squared.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.535
You could divide both sides
by b squared, I guess.

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:21.600
You get a 1 and a 1.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.250
And then you could multiply
both sides by a squared.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:29.875
You get x squared is equal to
a squared, and then you get

00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:33.270
x is equal to the plus or
minus square root of a.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.310
So this point right here is the
point a comma 0, and this point

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.860
right here is the point
minus a comma 0.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.936
Now let's go back to
the other problem.

00:10:42.936 --> 00:10:45.600
I have a feeling I might
be running out of time.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:52.920
So notice that when the x term
was positive, our hyperbola

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.250
opened to the right
and the left.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.660
And you could probably get from
detective reasoning that when

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.850
the y term is positive, which
is the case in this one, we're

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.810
probably going to
open up and down.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.780
And let's just prove
that to ourselves.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.240
So let's solve for y.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.730
You get y squared
over b squared.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.750
We're going to add x squared
over a squared to both sides.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:16.910
So you get equals x squared
over a squared plus 1.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.960
Multiply both sides
by b squared.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.310
y squared is equal to b
squared over a squared x

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.815
squared plus b squared.

00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:27.970
You have to distribute
the b squared.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.500
Now take the square root.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.020
I'll switch colors for that.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:36.260
So y is equal to the plus
or minus square root of b

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:42.150
squared over a squared x
squared plus b squared.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.170
And once again-- I've run out
of space-- we can make that

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:50.640
same argument that as x
approaches positive or negative

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:58.140
infinity, this equation, this
b, this little constant term

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.630
right here isn't going
to matter as much.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.800
You're just going to
take the square root of

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.300
this term right here.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:08.300
Which essentially b over a x,
plus or minus b over a x.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.790
And once again, those are the
same two asymptotes, which

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:17.170
I'll redraw here, that
line and that line.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.610
But in this case, we're
always a little bit larger

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.390
than the asymptotes.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.810
So in the positive quadrant,
that tells us we're going to

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:31.330
be up here and down there.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.430
Another way to think about it,
in this case, when the

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.510
hyperbola is a vertical
hyperbola, where it opens up

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.730
and down, you notice x could be
equal to 0, but y could

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.280
never be equal to 0.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.250
And that makes sense, too.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.735
Because if you look at our
original formula right here,

00:12:50.735 --> 00:12:52.060
x could be equal to 0.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.940
If x was 0, this would
cancel out and you

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.250
could just solve for y.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:00.670
But if y were equal to 0, you'd
have minus x squared over a

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.700
squared is equal to 1, and then
you would have, if you solved

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.950
this, you'd get x squared is
equal to minus a squared.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.340
And we're not dealing with
imaginary numbers, so you can't

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.740
square something, you can't
get a negative number.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.110
So once again, this
would be impossible.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.490
So that's this other clue that
tells you it opens up and down.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.600
Because in this case y
could never equal 0.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.690
Anyway, you might be a little
confused because I stayed

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.560
abstract with the
b's and the a's.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.770
In the next couple of videos
I'll do a bunch of problems

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.490
where we draw a bunch of
hyperbolas, ellipses, and

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.840
circles with actual numbers.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.342
See you soon.
