00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.340
I have here three equations
of four unknowns.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.530
You can already guess, or you
already know, that if you have

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.540
more unknowns than equations,
you are probably not

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.340
constraining it enough.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.800
You actually are going
to have an

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.360
infinite number of solutions.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.320
Those infinite number of
solutions could still be

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.180
constrained.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.400
Let's say we're in four
dimensions, in this case,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.810
because we have four
variables.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.350
Maybe we were constrained into a
plane in four dimensions, or

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.740
if we were in three dimensions,
maybe we're

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.750
constrained to a line.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.640
A line is an infinite number of
solutions, but it's a more

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.100
constrained set.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.700
Let's solve this set of
linear equations.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.830
We've done this by elimination
in the past. What I want to do

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.950
is I want to introduce
the idea of matrices.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.770
The matrices are really just
arrays of numbers that are

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.390
shorthand for this system
of equations.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.800
Let me create a matrix here.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.880
I could just create a
coefficient matrix, where the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.280
coefficient matrix would just
be, let me write it neatly,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.730
the coefficient matrix would
just be the coefficients on

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.340
the left hand side of these
linear equations.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.570
The coefficient there is 1.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.980
The coefficient there is 1.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.930
The coefficient there is 2.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.750
You have 2, 2, 4.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.860
2, 2, 4.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.820
1, 2, 0.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.360
1, 2, there is no coefficient
the x3 term here, because

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.920
there is no x3 term there.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.710
We'll say the coefficient on
the x3 term there is 0.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.210
And then we have 1,
minus 1, and 6.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.360
Now if I just did this right
there, that would be the

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.210
coefficient matrix for
this system of

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.600
equations right there.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.240
What I want to do is I want to
augment it, I want to augment

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.780
it with what these equations
need to be equal to.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.320
Let me augment it.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.520
What I am going to do is I'm
going to just draw a little

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.000
line here, and write the
7, the 12, and the 4.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.030
I think you can see that
this is just another

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.800
way of writing this.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.510
And just by the position, we
know that these are the

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.910
coefficients on the x1 terms.
We know that these are the

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.789
coefficients on the x2 terms.
And what this does, it really

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.790
just saves us from having to
write x1 and x2 every time.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.140
We can essentially do the same
operations on this that we

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.810
otherwise would have
done on that.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.560
What we can do is, we can
replace any equation with that

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.020
equation times some
scalar multiple,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.210
plus another equation.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.110
We can divide an equation,
or multiply an

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.390
equation by a scalar.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.810
We can subtract them
from each other.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.230
We can swap them.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.320
Let's do that in an attempt
to solve this equation.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.180
The first thing I want to do,
just like I've done in the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.220
past, I want to get this
equation into the form of,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.180
where if I can, I have a 1.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.910
My leading coefficient in
any of my rows is a 1.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.270
And that every other entry
in that column is a 0.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.180
In the past, I made sure
that every other entry

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.300
below it is a 0.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.950
That's what I was doing in some
of the previous videos,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.420
when we tried to figure out
of things were linearly

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.620
independent, or not.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.215
Now I'm going to make sure that
if there is a 1, if there

00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:08.040
is a leading 1 in any of my
rows, that everything else in

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.290
that column is a 0.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.260
That form I'm doing is called
reduced row echelon form.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.000
Let me write that.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.520
Reduced row echelon form.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.450
If we call this augmented
matrix, matrix A, then I want

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.240
to get it into the reduced row
echelon form of matrix A.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.410
And matrices, the convention
is, just like vectors, you

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.740
make them nice and bold, but use
capital letters, instead

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.770
of lowercase letters.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.550
We'll talk more about how
matrices relate to vectors in

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.530
the future.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.810
Let's just solve this
system of equations.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.820
The first thing I want to do is,
in an ideal world I would

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.530
get all of these guys
right here to be 0.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.090
Let me replace this guy with
that guy, with the first entry

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.390
minus the second entry.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.640
Let me do that.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.030
The first row isn't
going to change.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.900
It's going to be 1, 2, 1, 1.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.560
And then I get a
7 right there.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.910
That's my first row.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.930
Now the second row, I'm going
to replace it with the first

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.890
row minus the second row.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.770
So what do I get.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.840
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.380
2 minus 2 is 0.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.120
1 minus 2 is minus 1.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.800
And then 1 minus minus 1 is 2.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.630
That's 1 plus 1.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.710
And then 7 minus
12 is minus 5.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.610
Now I want to get rid
of this row here.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.360
I don't want to get rid of it.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.940
I want to get rid of
this 2 right here.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.830
I want to turn it into a 0.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.350
Let's replace this row
with this row minus

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.040
2 times that row.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.360
What I'm going to do is,
this row minus 2

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.420
times the first row.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.820
I'm going to replace
this row with that.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.730
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.050
That was the whole point.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.690
4 minus 2 times 2 is 0.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.310
0 minus 2 times 1 is minus 2.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.430
6 minus 2 times 1 is 6
minus 2, which is 4.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:36.835
4 minus 2 times 7, is 4 minus
14, which is minus 10.

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:38.210
Now what can I do next.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.770
You can kind of see that this
row, well talk more about what

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.590
this row means.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.860
When all of a sudden it's all
been zeroed out, there's

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.730
nothing here.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.870
If I had non-zero term here,
then I'd want to zero this guy

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.880
out, although it's already
zeroed out.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.850
I'm just going to move
over to this row.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.990
The first thing I want to do is
I want to make this leading

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.930
coefficient here a 1.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.260
What I want to do is, I'm going
to multiply this entire

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.840
row by minus 1.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.040
If I multiply this entire
row times minus 1.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.880
I don't even have to
rewrite the matrix.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.940
This becomes plus 1,
minus 2, plus 5.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.260
I think you can accept that.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.420
Now what can we do?

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.290
Well, let's turn this
right here into a 0.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.820
Let me rewrite my augmented
matrix in the new form that I

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.860
have. I'm going to keep the
middle row the same this time.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.940
My middle row is 0, 0, 1,
minus 2, and then it's

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.710
augmented, and I
get a 5 there.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.330
What I want to do is I want to
eliminate this minus 2 here.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.420
Why don't I add this row
to 2 times that row.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.600
Then I would have minus 2, plus
2, and that'll work out.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.450
What do I get.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.900
Well, these are just
leading 0's.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.540
Then I have minus 2,
plus 2 times 1.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.680
That's just 0.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:17.830
4 plus 2 times minus
2, that is minus 4.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.310
That's 4 plus minus 4,
that's 0 as well.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.720
Then you have minus
10 plus 2 times 5.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.200
Well, that's just minus 10
plus 10, which is 0.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.970
That one just got zeroed out.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.400
Normally, when I just did
regular elimination, I was

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.110
happy just having the situation
where I had these

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.790
leading 1's.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.420
Everything below it were 0's.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.100
I wasn't too concerned about
what was above our 1's.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.320
What I want to do is,
I want to make

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.730
those into a 0 as well.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.920
I want to make this
guy a 0 as well.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.170
What I can do is, I can replace
this first row with

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.740
that first row minus
this second row.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.680
What is 1 minus 0?

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.200
That's just 1.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.900
2 minus 0 is 2.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.770
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.830
1 minus minus 2 is 3.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.540
7 minus 5 is 2.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.810
There you have it.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.970
We have our matrix in reduced
row echelon form.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.350
This is the reduced row echelon
form of our matrix,

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.950
I'll write it in bold, of our
matrix A right there.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.620
You know it's in reduced row
echelon form because all of

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.360
your leading 1's in each
row-- so what are my

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.420
leading 1's in each row?

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.880
I have this 1 and
I have that 1.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.020
They're the only non-zero
entry in their columns.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.760
These are called the
pivot entries.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.290
Let me label that for you.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.080
That's called a pivot entry.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.810
Pivot entry.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.700
They're the only non-zero
entry in

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.320
their respective columns.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.080
If I have any zeroed out rows,
and I do have a zeroed out

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.930
row, it's right there.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.660
This is zeroed out row.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.330
Just the style, or just the
convention, is that for

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:20.200
reduced row echelon form, that
has to be your last row.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.250
We have the leading entries are
the only -- they're all 1.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.020
That's one case.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.980
You can't have this a 5.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.410
You'd want to divide that
equation by 5 if this was a 5.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.730
So your leading entries
in each row are a 1.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.760
That the leading entry in each
successive row is to the right

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.120
of the leading entry of
the row before it.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.290
This guy right here is to
the right of that guy.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.400
This is just the style, the
convention, of reduced row

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.790
echelon form.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.630
If you have any zeroed out rows,
it's in the last row.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.930
And finally, of course, and I
think I've said this multiple

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.860
times, this is the only non-zero
entry in the row.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.430
What does this do for me?

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.460
Now I can go back from
this world, back

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.850
to my linear equations.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.860
We remember that these were the
coefficients on x1, these

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.260
were the coefficients on x2.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.350
These were the coefficients on
x3, on x4, and then these were

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.000
my constants out here.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.730
I can rewrite this system of
equations using my reduced row

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:18.900
echelon form as x1,
x1 plus 2x2.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.500
There's no x3 there.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:26.000
So plus 3x4 is equal to 2.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.190
This equation, no x1,
no x2, I have an x3.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:38.310
I have x3 minus 2x4
is equal to 5.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.490
I have no other equation here.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.440
This one got completely
zeroed out.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.490
I was able to reduce this system
of equations to this

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.280
system of equations.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.430
The variables that you associate
with your pivot

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.160
entries, we call these
pivot variables.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.225
x1 and x3 are pivot variables.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.670
The variables that aren't
associated with the pivot

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.810
entry, we call them
free variables.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:12.140
x2 and x4 are free variables.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.540
Now let's solve for, essentially
you can only solve

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.620
for your pivot variables.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.370
The free variables we can
set to any variable.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.960
I said that in the beginning
of this equation.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.370
We have fewer equations
than unknowns.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.940
This is going to be a not well
constrained solution.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.170
You're not going to have just
one point in R4 that solves

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:31.550
this equation.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.020
You're going to have
multiple points.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.860
Let's solve for our pivot
variables, because that's all

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.360
we can solve for.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:45.170
This equation tells us, right
here, it tells us x3, let me

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:59.960
do it in a good color, x3
is equal to 5 plus 2x4.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:12.050
Then we get x1 is equal to
2 minus x2, 2 minus 2x2.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:20.560
2 minus 2x2 plus, sorry,
minus 3x4.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.930
I just subtracted these from
both sides of the equation.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.630
This right here is essentially
as far as we can go to the

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.180
solution of this system
of equations.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.730
I can pick, really, any values
for my free variables.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.155
I can pick any values for my
x2's and my x4's and I can

00:12:37.155 --> 00:12:38.540
solve for x3.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.560
What I want to do right now is
write this in a slightly

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.510
different form so we can
visualize a little bit better.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.680
Of course, it's always hard to
visualize things in four

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.530
dimensions.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.840
So we can visualize things a
little bit better, as to the

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.810
set of this solution.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.680
Let's write it this way.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.260
If I were to write it in vector
form, our solution is

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:03.070
the vector x1, x3, x3, x4.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.320
What is it equal to?

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.270
Well it's equal to-- let
me write it like this.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.370
It's equal to-- I'm just
rewriting, I'm just

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.700
essentially rewriting this
solution set in vector form.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.360
So x1 is equal to 2-- let
me write a little column

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.250
there-- plus x2.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.000
Let me write it this way.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.540
Plus x2 times something plus
x4 times something.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:45.280
x1 is equal to 2 minus 2 times
x2, or plus x2 minus 2.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.450
I put a minus 2 there.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.820
I can say plus x4
times minus 3.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.430
I can put a minus 3 there.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.300
This right here, the first
entries of these vectors

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.690
literally represent that
equation right there. x1 is

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:06.590
equal to 2 plus x2 times minus
2 plus x4 times minus 3.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.505
What does x3 equal?

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.600
x3 is equal to 5.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.090
Put that 5 right there.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.930
Plus x4 times 2.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.800
x2 doesn't apply to it.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.760
We can just put a 0.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.570
0 times x2 plus 2 times x4.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.430
Now what does x2 equal?

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:35.000
You could say, x2 is equal
to 0 plus 1 times x2

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.090
plus 0 times x4.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.430
x2 is just equal to x2.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.750
It's a free variable.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.600
Similarly, what does
x4 equal to?

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:50.020
x4 is equal to 0 plus 0 times
x2 plus 1 times x4.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.770
What does this do for us?

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.250
Well, all of a sudden here,
we've expressed our solution

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:59.170
set as essentially the linear
combination of the linear

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.360
combination of three vectors.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.040
This is a vector.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.290
You can view it as
a coordinate.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.590
Either a position vector.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.140
It is a vector in R4.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.440
You can view it as a position
vector or a coordinate in R4.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.230
You could say, look, our
solution set is essentially--

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:17.290
this is in R4.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.770
Each of these have four
components, but you can

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.640
imagine it in r3.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.130
That my solution set
is equal to some

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.180
vector, some vector there.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.190
That's the vector.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.800
Think of it is as a
position vector.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.210
It would be the coordinate
2, 0, 5, 0.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.590
Which obviously, this is four
dimensions right there.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:42.160
It's equal to multiples
of these two vectors.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.380
Let's call this vector,
right here, let's

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.650
call this vector a.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:51.390
Let's call this vector,
right here, vector b.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.650
Our solution set is all of this
point, which is right

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.440
there, or I guess we could call
it that position vector.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.590
That position vector will
look like that.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.560
Where you're starting at the
origin right there, plus

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.745
multiples of these two guys.

00:16:06.745 --> 00:16:11.390
If this is vector a, let's do
vector a in a different color.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.330
Vector a looks like that.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.260
Let's say vector a looks like
that, and then vector

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.620
b looks like that.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.660
This is vector b, and
this is vector a.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.690
I don't know if this is going to
be easier or harder for you

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.720
to visualize, because obviously
we are dealing in

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.340
four dimensions right here, and
I'm just drawing on a two

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.910
dimensional surface.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.260
What you can imagine is, is that
the solution set is equal

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.040
to this fixed point, this
position vector, plus linear

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.490
combinations of a and b.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.530
We're dealing, of
course, in R4.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.310
Let me write that down.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.030
We're dealing in R4.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.770
But linear combinations
of a and b are

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.930
going to create a plane.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.850
You can multiply a times 2,
and b times 3, or a times

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.120
minus 1, and b times
minus 100.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.450
You can keep adding and
subtracting these linear

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.230
combinations of a and b.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.960
They're going to construct
a plane that contains the

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.710
position vector, or contains
the point 2, 0, 5, 0.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:16.760
The solution for these three
equations with four unknowns,

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.660
is a plane in R4.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.140
I know that's really hard to
visualize, and maybe I'll do

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.010
another one in three
dimensions.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.890
Hopefully this at least gives
you a decent understanding of

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.570
what an augmented matrix is,
what reduced row echelon form

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.470
is, and what are the valid
operations I can perform on a

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:42.320
matrix without messing
up the system.
