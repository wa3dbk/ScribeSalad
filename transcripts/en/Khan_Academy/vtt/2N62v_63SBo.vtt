00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
 

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.210
In this video, we're going
to see if we can

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.245
graph a rational function.

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:08.760
A rational function is just
a function that has an

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.420
expression on the numerator
and the denominator.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.660
It has a polynomial in the
numerator-- Let's see, we have

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.600
x squared over-- and another
polynomial in the denominator

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.460
--x squared minus 16.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.090
We could obviously graph this by
just trying out a bunch of

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.560
points and then connecting
the dots.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.890
That's what a calculator would
do for us, a graphing

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.740
calculator.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.580
But what we want to do is,
before we try out some points

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.880
to kind of fill in the gaps, I
want to understand the basic

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.820
structure of this graph first.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.370
And to understand that, I want
to see what happens as x gets

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.880
really big, so x gets really
big, or x gets really, really

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.980
small, as x goes in the
negative direction.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.240
Or another way we could think
about it, I want to understand

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.210
what happens as the magnitude of
x, or the absolute value of

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.050
x, becomes really big as it
approaches really, really

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.760
bigness, or as it approaches
infinity.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.900
So when the size of x
approaches infinity.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.500
Which essentially is saying,
as x goes really far in the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.480
positive direction, or x goes
really far in the negative

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.430
direction, what is going
to happen to the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.020
value of this function?

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.210
So let's get out a calculator.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.470
Won't use the graphing part of
it just yet, but let's just

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.720
try out some values.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.810
What happens when x
is equal to 10?

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.880
It's going to be the same thing
as when x is equal to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.220
negative 10, because when you
put a negative 10 here, you

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.230
square it, you get 100,
just like 10.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.700
Same here, negative 10, you
square it, you get the same

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.320
thing as a positive 10.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.710
So whether you go in the super
high positive direction or the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.620
super low negative direction,
as you approach positive or

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.430
negative infinity, you're going
to approach the same

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.340
thing because you're squaring
the values.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.930
But let's try out some values.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.060
If I get 10 squared divided
by 10 squared

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.970
minus 16, I get 1.19.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.760
Now what happens if x gets
a little bit bigger?

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.800
This is x is equal to 10.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.140
What happens when x
is equal to 100?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:16.110
We have 100 squared divided
by 100 squared minus 16.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.340
I'm getting even closer to 1.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.960
When x was 10, around here,
we're getting y is 1.19.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.140
When x is 100, 100 squared
over 100 squared

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.470
minus 16, y is 1.0016.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.570
Just for fun, let's try 1,000.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:42.120
So it's 1,000 squared divided
by 1,000 squared minus 16.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.100
And we're even closer to 1.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.390
So as the size of x gets larger
and larger and larger,

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.900
our y gets closer
and closer to 1.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.830
And that would also be true
if this was a negative 10,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.070
because negative 10 squared over
negative 10 squared minus

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.040
16 is going to be the
exact same thing.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.490
Because the negative, when
you square it, is

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.700
going to be a positive.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.330
It's going to be the same thing
as 10 squared, same

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.640
thing over here.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.350
So whether x gets really big or
x gets really small, we're

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.190
going to be approaching
y is equal to 1.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.916
You could try it with a million
if you want, and

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:14.640
you're going to get a number
even closer to 1.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.870
So as the size of x approaches
infinity, the absolute value

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.400
of x, or the distance from the
origin, approaches infinity, y

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.690
is approaching 1.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.940
Or another way to think about
it is, the graph of this

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.700
function is going to approach
the line y is equal to 1.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.880
So let me graph the line
y is equal to 1.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.520
So I'll do it in a dotted line
because this isn't the graph

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.230
of our function, but this is
a line that our function is

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.960
approaching.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.480
So that is the graph
of y is equal to 1.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.110
Now, this idea of a function,
or the graph of a function,

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.810
approaching a line but never
quite touching it.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.000
So this is going to get closer
and closer and closer to this

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.280
line, y equal to one, in that
direction, but never quite

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.430
getting close enough to it.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.220
It'll approach 0, its distance
from this y equals 1, but

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.900
it'll never quite get there.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.190
This line that the graph
is approaching

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.440
is called an asymptote.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.000
 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.800
And it'll be even more
clear once I

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.030
actually graph the function.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.950
We're going to work up there.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.060
And since it's a horizontal
line, we call this a

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.310
horizontal asymptote.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.580
 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.690
This is what our graph
approaches as we go in the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.660
positive direction, or really
far in the negative direction.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.970
Let's think about some of the
other interesting things about

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.920
this, about this function
right here.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.000
Well one thing that might pop
out at you is this is a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.910
difference of squares.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.250
This is x squared
minus 4 squared.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.350
So we can rewrite this as
x squared over x plus 4

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.600
times x minus 4.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.870
So what's going to happen here,
as x approaches either

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.530
positive 4, or x approaches
negative 4?

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.580
Well, first of all, try
those values out.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.290
If x is equal to 4, what
is going to happen?

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.740
This expression right here, this
term right here, is going

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.900
to be equal to 0.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.660
And we're going to
be dividing by 0.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.050
We cannot do that.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.810
Similarly, if x is equal
to negative 4, we'd

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.060
be dividing by 0.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.470
This expression, right here,
is going to be equal to 0.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.110
We can't do that.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:37.880
We could say that this function
is undefined at x is

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.860
equal to plus or minus 4.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.580
It can't equal those values
because we'd be dividing by 0

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.290
in either one of those
circumstances.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.430
Now, what happens as we
approach those values?

00:05:51.430 --> 00:06:00.930
What happens as x approaches
negative 4?

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.430
Let's just do that
one for fun.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.150
What happens as x approaches
negative 4?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.155
Let's say we're approaching it
from the negative direction.

00:06:11.155 --> 00:06:16.490
 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.853
So let's try it out
in our calculator.

00:06:17.853 --> 00:06:21.950
 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.020
So let's say we want to go from
the negative direction.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.680
So let's start with
negative 4.1.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:39.700
So if we have negative 4.1
squared divided by negative

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:47.770
4.1 squared minus 16,
what do we get?

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.540
We get 20.75.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.960
So we get this number,
whatever.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.290
Let's see if we get even
closer to negative 4.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.495
So let me just get
that entry there.

00:06:55.495 --> 00:06:57.830
So let's get a little bit
closer to negative 4.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.950
So instead of negative 4.1,
let's do negative 4.01.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:09.752
So let me insert a
negative 4.01.

00:07:09.752 --> 00:07:15.890
And then over here, this
is negative 4.01,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.200
and see what it is.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.320
Now we went to 200, so
we're getting to

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.490
larger and larger values.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.730
Let's try negative 4.001.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.980
Let's try that out.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.990
 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.620
Whoops, that's not what
I wanted to do.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.630
I wanted to do that.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.670
So let's try.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.985
No that's not what
I want to do.

00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:37.840
Let's see.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.000
So we want to go to, instead of
4.01, I want to do 4.001,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.270
and over there, negative
4.001.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.260
And what do we get?

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.800
We get 2,000.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.110
So as we get closer and closer
to negative 4 from the

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.470
negative direction, we're
approaching larger and larger,

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.440
super larger numbers.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.360
And you can try it, if it's
4.0000001, it's going to get

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.130
to smaller and smaller numbers--
or sorry, larger and

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.170
larger numbers here.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.490
If you do 4.001, it's probably
going to be 20,000.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.540
And then if you add
another 0 here.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.860
So as we get closer and closer,
it's getting to larger

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.250
and larger numbers.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.850
So we could say, as x approaches
negative 4, we

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.950
could say y is approaching
infinity.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.970
It's getting to a larger and
larger and larger value.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.650
But we can't ever quite get
to x is equal to 4.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.680
It's undefined there.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.440
That will make the denominator
here equal to 0.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.570
So what we want to do here is,
we can never quite equal x

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.700
equal negative 4.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.150
So let me see, x is equal
to 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.220
We can never quite get to x
is equal to negative 4.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.520
Let me draw x is equal to
negative 4 as a dotted line,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.710
right there.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.090
That is x is equal
to negative 4.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.050
 

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.290
We can never quite get there,
but as we approached it from

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.430
the negative side, as we had
4.1, then 4.01, we went to

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.230
larger and larger values.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.330
And we also know that as we went
on the left-hand side, as

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.290
we go to larger and larger x
values, that y will get closer

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.530
and closer to 1.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.120
So you have a general sense of
what this part of the graph

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:13.920
will look like.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.200
This part of the graph
is going to look

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.230
something like that.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.700
As x gets to super negative
numbers, it gets closer and

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.980
closer to 1, as x gets closer
and closer to negative 4 from

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.700
the negative direction, it's
going to go closer and closer

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.720
to infinity.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.245
You're going to get closer and
closer to a very-- It's going

00:09:32.245 --> 00:09:33.750
to get larger and larger,
I guess, is an

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.280
easy way to say it.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.710
Now, just like x equal negative
4, x equals 4 will

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.760
also be a point where the
graph is undefined.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.620
So let me graph that here.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.600
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.850
Right here.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.380
 

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.936
Right over here.

00:09:50.936 --> 00:09:53.280
x is equal to 4.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.820
And, once again, what happens
as we approach x equals 4,

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.890
let's say from the positive
direction?

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:05.470
So as x approaches 4 from the
positive direction, what's

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.220
going to happen?

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.890
So this is like trying out x
is equal to 4.01, or x is

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:14.040
equal to 4.001, or x
is equal to 4.0001.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.420
So we're just getting closer and
closer and closer to x is

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.570
equal to 4.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.260
Well, these values are the exact
same values that we just

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.980
tried on our calculator, except
they are the negative

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.580
version of them, right?

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.440
And we already saw that, just
the way that this function is

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.340
set up, the negative numbers,
they get squared, so whether

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.410
you take the negative or the
positive x values, it's going

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.620
to be the same thing.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.930
This graph is symmetric.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.900
When x is equal to negative
5, it's the same thing

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.860
as x is equal 5.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.010
When x is equal to negative
10, it's the same

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.420
thing as x equals 10.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.720
So the same thing is
going to happen.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.465
You could try it out with your
calculator, if you like.

00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:46.900
If you try out these values,
you're going to see, as we get

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.330
closer and closer to 4, we're
going to approach larger and

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:50.960
larger numbers.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.190
These same numbers over here.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.820
So the graph over here, as we
get closer and closer to 4,

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.300
we're going to approach larger
and larger numbers.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.990
And then here, as x gets larger
and larger and larger,

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.510
we saw over here, we had these
horizontal asymptotes, y gets

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.650
closer and closer to 1.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:13.750
So just like we called this a
horizontal asymptote, these

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.460
values-- or you can even view
these vertical lines: x is

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.290
equal to negative 4 and x is
equal to 4 --we call these

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.540
vertical asymptotes.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:28.920
 

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.730
These are lines, asymptotes,
once again, they are lines

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.140
that the graph approaches,
but never quite touches.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.280
So that's what's
going on here.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.680
And then we can think about
what's happening to the graph

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.600
inside of here.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.450
So you could think of it
in a couple of ways.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:50.750
You could say, well, what
happens as x approaches 4 from

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.100
the negative direction?

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.430
So let's try that out, from
the negative direction.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:12:03.990
So what happens if you do 3.9
squared divided by 3.9

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.440
squared minus 16?

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.010
You get negative 19.25.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.070
Now what happens
if we do 3.99?

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.440
So let me put another 9 here.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.933
So we're going to get closer
and closer to 4, and we're

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:23.890
going to do it from
the left-hand side

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.470
as we approach 4.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:30.100
So insert another 9 here.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.255
So even more negative.

00:12:31.255 --> 00:12:34.220
So let's just do one more.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.400
So we're going to be
even more negative.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.610
So let me make it 3.999.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.245
Get even closer to 4.

00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:45.980
 

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.860
You're getting even
more negative.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.930
And this is also going to be
true if we did negative 3.9,

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:56.380
or negative 3.99, or negative
3.999, because when we square

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.540
it, the negatives and the
positives are the same thing.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.660
You square negative 1,
you get a positive 1.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:07.835
So as we approach 4 from-- you
go 3.9, 3.99, we get closer

00:13:07.835 --> 00:13:09.930
and closer to 4 --we're
getting more and

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.780
more negative numbers.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.040
We approach negative infinity.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.380
So as we approach-- let
me just graph it here.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.390
As we approach from this
direction, we're going to get

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.440
smaller-- want to not touch our
asymptote --it's going to

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.250
look something like that.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.430
As we approach it from the
left-hand side, we're getting

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.040
smaller and smaller numbers.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.840
And that's also going to be true
as we approach negative 4

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.220
from the right-hand
side, right?

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.210
As we get negative 3.9,
3.99, 3.999, we're

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:37.970
going to drop down.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.800
It's going to look something
like that.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.950
And now that we have a general
sense of what the graph is,

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.530
now is a good time where
we could maybe plot

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.150
a few points here.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.190
And the easiest one is, what
happens when x is equal to 0?

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:56.570
You have 0 squared over
0 squared minus 16.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.100
So the point when x is equal
to 0, we're going to have 0

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.430
over, well, negative 16,
which is just 0.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.300
So the point 0, 0 is
on this curve.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.900
And then we could try some other
points if you like, but

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.170
the general shape here
is going to look

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.805
something like this.

00:14:13.805 --> 00:14:18.010
 

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.360
You could plot more points if
you really want to nail down

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.430
exactly what the curve is doing
in between, but here is

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.120
the general structure.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.390
And we tried out a lot of values
with the calculator.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.280
And I did that because I really
wanted to show you why

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.500
it's dropping down like this.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.180
And if you think about it,
it makes complete sense.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.830
As you get closer and closer,
let's say you get closer and

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.200
closer to 4.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.790
Either way, as you get closer
and closer to 4, this is going

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.340
to become a smaller and smaller
and smaller number,

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.140
because this is the difference
between x and 4.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.480
So this is becoming
a smaller and

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.450
smaller and smaller number.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.100
Then, when you take 1
over that, right?

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.015
You can essentially view this as
x squared over x plus 4, or

00:15:00.015 --> 00:15:02.270
times 1 over x minus 4.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.870
If this is becoming smaller and
smaller, this whole thing,

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.730
1 over a super small number,
is a super large number.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.540
So as you can imagine, you're
going to get larger and

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.010
larger, and depending on whether
you are approaching

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.090
from the positive or negative,
so whether this is a super

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.470
small negative number or super
small positive number, that's

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.720
going to flip the sign.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.210
But either way, the magnitude--
So we're getting

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.060
to a very large magnitude in the
negative direction because

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.800
the difference between
x and 4 on this side

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.560
is negative, right?

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.010
3.9 minus 4 is 0.1.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.980
Take the inverse of
that, it's 10.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.640
So we're getting negative
numbers here.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.830
You take the inverse, you're
going to get super large

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.460
negative numbers.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.590
So I really want to give
you that intuition.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.070
But the general way of being
able to graph these type of

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.940
things, your first thing you
want to do is identify the

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.480
horizontal asymptotes.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.450
What happens as we get very--
the magnitude of our x is very

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.960
large, so super positive
values or

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.910
super negative values.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.860
You could try it out on a
calculator, if you like.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.820
You literally, if you try out
the value of a million or a

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.410
billion, it will kind of
give you the answer.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:11.170
But the way you could also think
about it is, as x gets

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.680
really large, you could view
that this thing, these terms

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.790
right here grow so much faster--
I mean this is just a

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.720
constant term.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.190
This term doesn't
matter anymore.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.140
If this is a million
and a million, who

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.330
cares about the 16?

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.970
So as x gets really large,
you could say that y is

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.000
approximately x squared
over x squared.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.690
These two terms dominate.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.880
You don't need to worry
about the 16 anymore.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.510
And of course, this is equal to
1, which is exactly what we

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.360
got when we plugged in
really large numbers.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.320
So, in a problem like this,
where you have the same

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.840
coefficient, or where you have
the same degree on the

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.040
numerator and the denominator,
you look at the coefficient of

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.470
those terms. So in this case,
the coefficient is 1 and 1.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.080
So our horizontal asymptote is
going to be 1 divided by 1, or

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.380
y is equal to 1.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.510
If this was 2x squared over
x squared minus 16, our

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.859
horizontal asymptote would
be y is equal to 2.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.930
We would approach that
line, up there.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.030
If it was a negative 2, our
horizontal asymptote would be

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.599
y is equal to negative 2.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.050
So that's how you identify the
horizontal asymptotes where

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.190
you have the same degree in
the numerator and the

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.115
denominator.

00:17:19.115 --> 00:17:22.220
If the denominator has a
larger degree, then the

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.769
denominator is going to get
larger much faster than the

00:17:24.769 --> 00:17:26.329
numerator, and your asymptote
is going to be 0.

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.359
I'll show an example of
that in the future.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.870
And obviously, if your numerator
has a higher degree

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.400
than your denominator, it's
going to grow way faster than

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.230
your denominator, and you won't
have any asymptote.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.340
You'll just keep growing,
or keep going in

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.020
the negative direction.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.970
And that's actually the case
with all of the polynomials

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.300
we've seen.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.620
You can do them all
as being over 1.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.070
In which case, there was no
horizontal asymptote.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.520
Now the vertical asymptotes you
identify by essentially

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.110
just factoring the denominator
and figuring out where

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.150
does it equal 0.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.870
Those are the points where the
function is not defined.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.660
And I'll show you in the future,
there are some special

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.030
cases where they won't be
vertical asymptotes, and I

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.870
guess that special case is,
for example, if you had--

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.950
Well, I won't show you the
special case right now.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.430
I'll show you that in
a future video.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.460
But in general, if you factor
the bottom terms and they

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.430
don't cancel out with anything
on the numerator, then you're

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.030
going to be dealing with
a vertical asymptote.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.800
If I had another x minus 4 up
here, if my numerator was x

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:29.500
squared times x minus 4, and
then these canceled out, and

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.500
my expression simplified to
this, the equation would still

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.500
be undefined at x is equal to 4,
because you would give the

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.700
0 in the denominator.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.825
But since that x minus 4 cancels
out with the x minus 4

00:18:40.825 --> 00:18:42.560
in the numerator, it
would not have

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.920
been a vertical asymptote.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.890
We'll look at that
in the future.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.070
But this equation wasn't that.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.310
So the general rule of thumb for
identifying the vertical

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:55.140
asymptotes, factor the
denominator, figure out where

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.440
the denominator equals 0, and
if those terms don't cancel

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.800
out with any terms of the
numerator, then those are

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.020
vertical asymptotes.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.050
And then to figure out the
behavior, I guess, within the

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.370
asymptotes, you can
plot some points.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.860
You can try out some points.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.180
You can actually substitute
values for x and

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.600
figure out what y is.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.100
Now just to validate that we
hopefully got the right

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:21.240
answer, let's actually graph
our rational function.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.830
So let me turn it on.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.525
Let me graph it.

00:19:24.525 --> 00:19:32.450
And we say y is equal to
x squared divided by x

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.980
squared minus 16.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.890
And let's see what we get.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.370
Nope, I just want to graph it.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.490
My range is off.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.150
Let me do my range.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.120
Let me see, x minimum value I
want for x, let's say it's

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.140
negative 10.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.850
My maximum value I
want for x is 10.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:20:01.750
x scale is 1. y minimum value,
I want negative 10.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.900
y maximum value, I want 10.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.630
Then y scale, I want 1.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.150
Now let me graph it.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.990
There we go.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.930
Look at that.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.160
Just like what we drew.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.830
We have an asymptote, as x gets
really large, or x gets

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.530
really, really small, that
asymptote is y is equal to 1.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.910
We have our vertical
asymptote.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.110
It graphed it because it tried
to connect the dots, but it

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.170
essentially graphed our
asymptotes for us, but that

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.860
wouldn't actually be
part of the graph.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.910
But as we approach 4 from
0, I guess we can

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.560
say, we go super negative.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.230
As we approach negative 4 from
0, we get super negative.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.220
Because in either of those
situations, as you approach 4

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.910
from this side, this term
is going to be negative.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.150
As you approach negative 4 from
thid side, this term,

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:50.330
right here, is going to be--
Well, this term right here is

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.440
going to be positive, but then
this term right here is going

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:53.980
to be negative.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.350
Negative times a positive,
you could play

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.090
with it as you like.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.550
But we approach negative
infinity in either case.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.270
And then as x approaches
infinity, this thing

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.220
asymptotes away.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.960
So hopefully you
found that fun.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.460
