00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.280
We're on problem 38.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.040
Which of the following best
describes the graph of this

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.410
system of equations?

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.130
OK, so maybe they're
the same line.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.200
Maybe they're parallel.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.240
Maybe they only intersect
in one point-- two lines

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.930
intersecting in only
two points.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.590
Well that's impossible.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.170
Two lines, I mean that can
happen with curves, but that's

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.220
not going to happen
with lines.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.460
So we can already cancel
out choice D.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.690
OK, now let's look
at these two.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.445
See I have a y here and
I have a 5y here.

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:30.610
Let's multiply this top equation
times 5 and see what

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.940
it looks like.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.660
So if you multiply the
left-hand side

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.370
by 5, you get 5y.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.200
I'll do it up here.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.750
You get 5y is equal to-- 5 times
minus 2 is minus 10x,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.980
plus 5 times 3 is 15.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.310
So if you multiply the top
equation-- both sides of it--

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.390
by 5 and it really doesn't
fundamentally change the line,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.230
the equation might look
different, but the equality

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.790
will still hold in the same
universe, which is

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.470
essentially that line.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.630
So if you just multiply both
sides by 5, they become the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.790
same equation.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.370
5y is equal to minus
10x plus 15.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.570
So they are the same lines.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.010
So that's A, two identical
lines.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.270
Problem 39.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.960
And they want us to simplify
5x to the third over 10x to

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.740
the seventh.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.560
So the easiest way to think of
this, or at least for me--

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.730
well, there's a lot of ways
you can do it and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.550
we'll do it both ways.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.610
This is the same thing as 5/10
times x to the third times x

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.010
to the minus 7.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.640
1 over x to the 7 is the same
thing as x to the minus 7.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.000
And this is equal to--
5/10 is 1/2.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.790
And then here, we have the
same base and we're

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.920
multiplying, so we can
add the exponents.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.640
3 plus minus 7 is minus 4.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.650
So x to the minus
fourth power.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.690
And we could write that as 1/2
times 1 over x to the fourth

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.030
or 1 over 2x to the fourth.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.790
And that is choice B.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.650
Now you could have done
it other ways.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.090
You could have said,
OK, let's see.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.500
Divide the numerator and
denominator by 5.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.030
So this would have been 1.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.960
This would have been a 2.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.170
And you say, OK, let's divide
the numerator and denominator

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.780
by x to the third.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.350
So this will become a 1.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.190
And x to the seventh
divided by x to the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.180
third is x to the fourth.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.840
You could have done
it that way.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.190
You had 1 over 2x
to the fourth.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.770
Either way.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.380
Or you could have even said--
you didn't have

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.060
to go to this step.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.060
You could have said, OK, when
I'm dividing with the same

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.370
base, I can just subtract
the exponents.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.500
So 3 minus 7 was minus 4.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.930
Either way.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.580
All of them would have valid
ways to approach this problem.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.870
Problem 40.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.130
This looks like a
simplification.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:08.200
They write 4x squared minus 2x
plus 8, minus x squared plus

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.670
3x minus 2 is equal to.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.650
So the key here is just to
realize that this is a minus.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.650
So you could kind of view it as
a plus minus 1 times this

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.430
whole thing.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.000
So we're just going to have
to distribute that out.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.890
So this is equal to 4x squared
minus 2x plus 8.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.090
And now we distribute this
minus over this whole

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.600
expression.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.990
So minus times x squared
is minus x squared.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.750
Minus times 3x, positive 3x.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.250
So it's minus 3x.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.290
The minus 1 times negative 2.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.100
Well now they cancel out
and you get a plus 2.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.610
We switch the sign on everything
here because

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.790
they're all being multiplied
by this negative 1.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.470
OK, now we can simplify.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.840
So let's take the x squared
terms first. So we have a 4x

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.410
squared, we have a
minus x squared.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.400
So 4x squared minus x squared
is 3x squared.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.480
4 minus 1 is 3.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.920
Then let's do our x terms.
We have a minus 2x, we

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.490
have a minus 3x.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.209
So minus 2 minus 3,
that's a minus 5x.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.679
And then last we have
our constants.

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:23.080
We have 8 plus 2.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.150
8 plus 2 is 10.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.340
So 3x squared minus
5x plus 10.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.850
And that is choice D.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.450
Problem 41.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.700
OK.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.010
They say the sum of
two binomial-- let

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.420
me copy this one.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.670
It's interesting.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.840
The sum of two binomials
is 5x squared minus 6x.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.810
So a binomial is just a
polynomial with two terms. If

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.660
one of the binomials is 3x
squared minus 2x, what is the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.910
other binomial?

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.790
So this binomial is one of them,
so they're saying 3x

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.430
squared minus 2x, and when you
add that to some other

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.960
binomial-- and I don't know, let
me just write that as A.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.290
I mean there is no constant
term here and there is no

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.940
constant term here, so I'm
assuming that my-- and it has

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.860
to be a binomial.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.600
There's only two terms. So I'm
assuming my two terms are an x

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.900
squared term and x term because
that's the only terms

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.870
that are involved in
both of these.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.770
So let's say my binomial
is Ax squared plus Bx.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.590
This is the mystery binomial.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.390
And their sum is equal
to this up here.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.360
Is equal to 5x squared
minus 6x.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.110
Now let's see what we can do.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.550
Well this is a plus here,
so the parenthesis

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.230
really don't matter.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:03.420
We can rearrange this as 3x
squared plus Ax squared minus

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:11.780
2x plus Bx is equal to
5x squared minus 6x.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.920
3 plus A.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.400
3x squared plus Ax squared,
that's the same thing as 3

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.270
plus A, x squared.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.750
And then, minus 2x plus Bx, or
we could switch them around.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.490
That's the same thing as plus
B minus 2-- I just took the

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.220
coefficients and added
them together-- x.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.160
I switched them, but we could
have written this in the other

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.560
order to begin with-- is equal
to 5x squared minus 6x.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.480
And now you just compare.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.530
OK, 3 plus A-- if you just look
at the x squared terms--

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.720
3 plus A has to be equal to 5.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.190
Because that's the coefficient
on the x squared term.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.380
So 3 plus A is equal to 5.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.560
Subtract 3 from both sides.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.630
You get A is equal to 2.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.200
And then we have B minus 2 has
to be the coefficient on x

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.980
here, so it has to be
equal to minus 6.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.640
Add 2 to both sides,
you get B.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.130
Minus 6 plus 2 is 4.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.600
So the other binomial, just
substituting that Ax squared

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:20.540
plus Bx, is 2x squared
plus Bx.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.910
Oh, sorry.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.450
This is a minus 4.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.060
Minus 6 plus 2 is minus 4.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.230
So plus Bx.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.790
So minus 4-- that's B-- x.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.680
And that is choice A.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.930
Next problem.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.000
OK, they say, which of the
following expressions is equal

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.980
to-- this is problem 42.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:56.400
And they write x plus 2, plus
x minus 2, times 2x plus 1.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.590
So we have to simplify this.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.750
And remember, order of
operations, multiplication

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.720
comes first. So we have to
multiply these two expressions

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.410
first. So let's do that.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.900
So this is-- I'll rewrite
this one over here.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.410
x plus 2 plus-- and now
let's multiply this.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.800
When you multiply these two
binomials, you're really just

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.860
doing the distributive
property twice.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.230
And let me show that to you.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.740
We could view this as x minus
2 times 2x plus x

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.970
minus 2 plus 1.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.060
So I'm just distributing the x
minus 2 times each of these

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:40.340
terms. So I could write this as
x minus 2 times 2x, plus x

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.600
minus 2 times the 1.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.880
All right, and now we can just
simplify that by doing the

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.300
distributive property again.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.840
So this is x plus 2 plus-- let's
distribute the 2x times

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.290
each of these.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.200
2x times x is 2x squared.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.060
2x times minus 2 is minus 4x.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.680
Plus, well, we're
disturbing a 1.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.970
1 times anything
is just itself.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.700
So plus x minus 2.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.730
And let's see what we can do.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.240
We only have 1x squared terms,
so let's write that down.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.420
2x squared.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.560
So 2x squared.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.440
And then our x terms, we
have a plus x, a minus

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.530
4x, and a plus x.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.430
So we have 1 minus
4 is minus 3.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.130
Plus 1 is minus 2.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.840
So its minus 2x.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.920
And then, let's see.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.480
We have a positive
2 and a minus 2.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.370
They cancel out.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.690
So we're left with 2x squared
minus 2x, and that's choice A.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.050
Problem 43, I think we
can fit in here.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.300
Let me copy and paste it.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:02.160
OK, copy it and now
pasting it.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.960
OK, it says, a volleyball
court is

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.490
shaped like a rectangle.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.670
Let me draw that.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.490
Well, I didn't want to draw
it filled in like

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.740
that, but fair enough.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.870
Shaped like a rectangle.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.970
It has a width of x meters and
a length of 2x meters.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.140
So it's width is x.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.060
Let me write, this could be
x and this would be 2x.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.330
Because this is longer.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.520
Which expression gives
the area of the

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.660
court in square meters?

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.680
Well the area is just the
width times the length.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:40.510
So it's just x times 2x, which
is equal to 2x squared.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.080
That's the same thing as 2
times, x times x, which is the

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.490
same thing as 2x squared.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.720
And that's choice B.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.890
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
