00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.390
In the last video we figured
out how many different ways

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:11.790
could 5 people sit in 3 chairs.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.580
So for example, if this is
chair one, this is chair

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.420
two, this is chair three.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.940
We said, well, in chair one
we could put 5 people.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.750
No one's sitting down.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.660
Then there's only going to be 4
people left, so we could put 4

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.940
different people in chair 2.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.820
And then there would be 3
people left that we could

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.730
put in chair three.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.220
So the total permutations, the
different ways that people

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.340
could sit in the different
yours if we cared about the

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.220
order-- if we cared about which
chair they were sitting down

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.840
in-- it would be 5
times 4 times 3.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.800
And another way of thinking
about that-- 5 times 4 times

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.770
3-- that's the same thing.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:59.290
That equals 5 times 4 times 3
times 2 times 1 over what?

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.880
Over 2 times 1.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.210
And that's the same thing as 5
factorial over 2 factorial.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.070
Now where does
this 2 come from?

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.320
How is 2 related
to the 5 and 3?

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.850
What's the difference
between the two?

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.850
So this is the same thing,
this is equal to 5 factorial

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.340
over 5 minus 3 factorial.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.070
And that in general is how
we figure out, how many

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.080
permutations can 5 things
place themselves or be

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.140
placed into 3 positions?

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.960
And the general formula
is-- and we learned

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.510
this in the last video.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.630
And I will switch colors.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.810
If we want to put n things into
k positions, and k has to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.500
be less than or equal to n.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.390
Well actually, it
doesn't have to.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.770
But for our purposes right now
we'll assume it is because our

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.970
formula might break
down if it weren't.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.320
And that equals n factorial
over n minus k factorial.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.760
I always find this harder
to memorize than just

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.870
thinking about the spot.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.950
Then just saying, oh well,
you know, 5 people, 5 of

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.110
the things could be here.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.340
And then once one thing is
here, there's 4 possibilities

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.800
left and then there's
3 possibilities left.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.590
The way I think of it I
take the first k terms

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.820
of the n factorial.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.230
Or in this case, I take
the first three terms

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.720
of the 5 factorial.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.380
5 times 4 times 3.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.370
That's how I think
of permutations.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.050
This is great if we cared--
let's say these are

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.410
people A, B, C, D, E.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.810
So these are the 5 people that
are going to sit in the chairs.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.470
This is great if we wanted to
count the permutation ABC as

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.900
different from the permutation
ACB, as different from the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.310
permutation-- I don't know--
BAC as different from

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.686
the permutation BCA.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.640
Because remember, when we did
this we actually cared about

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.380
where they're sitting.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.790
And in the previous video we
double counted everything

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.620
because it matters if person
A is in seat one and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.830
person B is in seat two.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.250
And then if they switch
we recounted, right?

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.260
This is where they switch.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.640
But what if we didn't
care about that?

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.400
What if we didn't care
who's in what seat?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.820
We just wanted to know how
many different ways can

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.860
the 5 people sit down?

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.760
So we want to count all the
situations where person A, B,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.360
and C are sitting down as
essentially one situation.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.890
We don't care who's
sitting in which chair.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.430
We just care that those are
the 3 people sitting down.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.200
That's the set, the subset
of the people sitting down.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.260
And so the question then
becomes not how many different

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.470
permutations or how many
different ways can the people

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.420
sit down, the question becomes,
how many subsets of 3 can

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.090
we take out of a set of 5?

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.840
And I know I'm kind of jumping
up around a little bit, but

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.130
that's essentially what
a combination is.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.020
A combination is a permutation
where you don't care

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.560
about the order.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.990
So how do we figure it out?

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.420
Well, when we figured out the
permutations using this formula

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.090
we counted-- for example, we
counted ABC, ACB, BAC,

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.500
BCA, and let's see.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.800
There should be two
more permutations.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.220
CAB and CBA.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.510
We counted all 6 of these
as different permutations.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.990
But in our combinations we're
going to want to-- this is all

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.830
essentially the same
combination because we don't

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.300
care about the order.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.990
So for any 3 different people
that are in these seats,

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.930
there's actually going to be 6
permutations that we're

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.770
counting when we do
the permutations.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.320
So if we want the combinations
we'll just divide by the number

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.770
of ways we can rearrange
3 people into 3 seats.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.490
That's essentially
what we did here.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.450
So how many different
ways can you arrange 3

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.030
people into 3 seats?

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.650
Well, this is kind of another
permutation problem.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.260
The first seat you could put 3
different people, the second

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.480
seat you put 2 different
people, and the last seat--

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.750
well, there's only
1 person left.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.410
So it equals 3 factorial,
which is equal to 6.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.780
This is equal to 3 factorial,
which is equal to 6.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.000
Hope I'm not confusing.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.230
What I'm just trying to say is
when you did a permutation we

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.340
counted all of the different
orders of how people could

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.450
arrange themselves.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.400
And what I'm saying now is
well, how many different ways

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.630
can people arrange themselves?

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.190
Well, it's going to be the
number of places factorial

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.980
because if we have 3 people
in 3 spots or let's say,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.190
4 people in 4 spots.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.250
The fourth spot can have 4
people, the second spot can

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.770
have 3, and so forth, the third
spot could have 2, and the

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.010
last spot will only have 1.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.150
So it's the number of spots
factorial is how many

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.500
permutations we're counting.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.710
When we have just the same
people, they're just playing

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.700
musical chairs in the
exact same seats.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.120
So on order to figure out the
combination, so if we wanted to

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.900
say how many people-- let's
say if we had 5 people.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.140
How many different groups
of 3 can be seated?

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.820
And we don't want to double.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.270
We don't want to more
than double count.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.240
I don't know what the
word is for counting

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.760
something six times.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.500
Well, it's just going to be the
same thing as the permutation

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.890
divided by all of the
extra counting we did.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.810
We'll just divide by the number
of ways that 3 people can

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.810
arrange themselves in 3 seats.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.830
And that's 3 factorial.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.230
And I hope I'm making sense.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.190
Maybe I'll do a couple more
examples in other videos.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.030
And definitely request
it if you think this

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.320
is extra confusing.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.220
So in general, if we say, what
are the different ways that

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.530
n things can be chosen?

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.050
Or the number of combinations
that n things can be chosen

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.000
into sets of r, where r is
less than or equal to n.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.540
It's equal to the number of
permutations you could create

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:24.320
of putting n things into r
spots, divided by r factorial.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.140
We're going to divide by the
number of ways the r spots

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.340
themselves could be rearranged
because we don't want to

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.670
count those as extra.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.580
And so if we go back to this
formula up here, well, this

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.240
was a k, but now we're
saying it's an r.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.160
This is the same thing as--
so the permutations was

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.350
n factorial over n
minus r factorial.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.360
And now we're dividing
everything by r factorial.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.840
So that equals-- let
me just write this.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.050
This is often written
as n choose r.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.320
Another way it's
written is n choose r.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.180
This is called the binomial
coefficient and we'll do a

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.460
whole series of modules on that
as well because this actually

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.450
shows up in polynomial
expansion when you take

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.690
polynomials to powers.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:20.640
But this is equal to n
factorial over r factorial

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.020
divided by n minus r factorial.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.210
You could memorize this.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.050
You know, it's useful if
you want to do things

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.820
quickly on tests.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.410
But it's very important to
think about where it came from.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.980
The n factorial over the n
minus r factorial-- this

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.220
is just the permutation.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.390
And what is that?

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.630
Well, that was just the first
r-- I guess you could call

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.710
it the first r factors.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.340
The r largest factors
of n factorial.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.510
That's all that is.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.250
And then when we do the
combinations we divided by r

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.310
factorial because we want to
divide it by all the different

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.830
arrangements that the people
could seat themselves

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:57.970
in r seats.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.420
Or, the balls could
be placed in r cups.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.450
So in this situation if we want
to know how many different

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.090
groups of 3 can be selected
from 5 people or from 5

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:16.370
letters, it's going to be 5
factorial over 3 factorial

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:21.040
times 5 minus 3 factorial.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.860
And that's 5 times 3 times
2 times 1, over-- 3

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.840
factorial is just 6.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.750
We'll put that aside
for a second.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.400
Divided by-- this
is 3 factorial.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.820
2 times 1.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.870
So notice, this is a
permutation part right here.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.590
This term just gets rid of
the two lowest factors.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.170
You get 5 times 3.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.810
Oh, sorry there's a 4.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.430
5 times 4 times 3, which is
the number of permutations.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.330
And then we divide by 6 because
we get 6 permutations for

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.150
really every combination.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.760
Maybe that confused you.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.520
But anyway, so we get 5 times
4 times 3 divided by 6.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.140
And that's what?

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:07.930
5 times 12 divided by 6,
which is equal to 5 times 2.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.330
There's 10 possible ways
that we can take sets of 3

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.750
from a group of 5 things.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.810
See you in the next video.
