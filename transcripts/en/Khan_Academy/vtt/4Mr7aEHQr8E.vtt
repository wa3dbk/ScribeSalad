00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.540
The whole point in learning
differential equations is that

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.270
eventually we want to model real
physical systems. I know

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.330
everything we've done so far has
really just been a toolkit

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.390
of being able to solve them, but
the whole reason is that

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.410
because differential equations
can describe a lot of systems,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.320
and then we can actually
model them that way.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.750
And we know that in the real
world, everything isn't these

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.820
nice continuous functions, so
over the next couple of videos

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.890
we're going to talk about
functions that are a little

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.880
bit more discontinuous than what
you might be used to even

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.460
in kind of a traditional
calculus or traditional

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.880
Precalculus class.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.910
And the first one is the
unit step function.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.790
Let's write it as u, and
then I'll put a little

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.290
subscript c here of t.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.110
And it's defined as when t is--
let me put it this way.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.150
It's defined as 0 when t is less
than-- whatever subscript

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.220
I put here-- when t
is less than c.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.380
And it's defined as 1-- that's
why we call it the unit step

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.900
function-- when t is greater
than or equal to c.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.700
And if I had to graph this, and
you could graph it as well

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.030
but it's not too difficult
to graph.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.622
Let me draw my x-axis
right here.

00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:13.010
And I'll do a little
thicker line.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.490
That's my x-axis right there.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.430
This is my y-axis right there.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.380
And when we talk about Laplace
transforms, which we'll talk

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.400
about shortly, we only care
about t is greater than 0.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.090
Because we saw, in our
definition of the Laplace

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510
transform, we're always taking
the integral from 0 to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.360
infinity, so we're
only dealing with

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.470
the positive x-axis.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.160
But anyway, by this definition,
it would be zero

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.970
all the way until you get to
some value c, so you'd be zero

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.400
until you get to c.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.460
And then at c, you jump, and the
point c is included x is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.220
equal to c here.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.070
So it's included, so I'll put
a dot there, because it's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.300
greater than or equal to c.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.040
You're at 1, so this
is 1 right here.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.790
And then you go forward
for all of time.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.960
And you're like, Sal, you just
said that differential

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.100
equations, we're learning to
model things, why is this type

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.760
of a function useful?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.580
Well, in the real world,
sometimes you do have

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.100
something that essentially jolts
something, that moves it

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.790
from this position
to that position.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.450
And obviously, nothing can move
it immediately like this,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.650
but you might have some
system, it could be an

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.580
electrical system or mechanical
system, where maybe

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.000
the behavior looks something
like this, where maybe it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.680
moves it like that
or something.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.090
And this function is a pretty
good analytic approximation

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.490
for some type of real world
behavior like this when

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.920
something just gets moved.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.010
Whenever we solve these
differential equations

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.540
analytically, we're really
just trying to get a pure

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.730
model of something.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.610
Eventually, we'll see that it
doesn't perfectly describe

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.730
things, but it helps describe
it enough for us to get a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.040
sense of what's going
to happen.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.820
Sometimes it will completely
describe things, but anyway,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.220
we can ignore that for now, so
let me get rid of these things

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.030
right there.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.180
So the first question is,
well, you know, what if

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.000
something doesn't jar
just like that?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.500
What if I want to construct more
fancy unit functions or

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.270
more fancy step functions?

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.470
Let's say I wanted to construct
something that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.350
looked like this.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.940
Let me say this is my y-axis.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.310
This is my x-axis.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.700
And let's say I wanted to
construct something that is

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.820
at-- and let me do it in
a different color.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.935
Let's say it's at 2
until I get to pi.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.410
And then from pi until forever
it just stays at zero.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.290
So how could I construct this
function right here using my

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.350
unit step function?

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.940
So what if I had written
it as-- so my unit step

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.630
function's at zero initially, so
what if I make it 2 minus a

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.100
unit step function that
starts at pi?

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.710
So if I define my function
here, will this work?

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.250
Well, this unit step function,
when we pass pi, is only going

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.970
to be equal to 1, but
we want this thing

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.900
to be equal to zero.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.820
So it has to be 2 minus 2, so
I'll have to put at 2 here,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.010
and this should work.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.730
When we're at any value below
pi, when t is less than pi

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.970
here, this becomes a zero,
so our function will just

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.870
evaluate to 2, which
is right there.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.490
But as soon as we hit t is equal
to pi, that pi is the c

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.050
in this example, as soon as
we hit that, the unit step

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.150
function becomes 1.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.120
We multiply that by 2, and we
have 2 minus 2, and then we

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.650
end up here with zero,

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.810
Now, that might be nice and
everything, but let's say you

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.610
wanted for it to go back up.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:03.600
Let's say that instead of it
going like this-- let me kind

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.180
of erase that by overdrawing the
x-axis again-- we want the

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.510
function to jump up again.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.860
We want it to jump up again.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.150
And lets say at some value,
let's say it's at 2pi, we want

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.210
the function to jump up again.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.920
How could we construct this?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.630
And we could make it jump to
anything, but let's say we

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.410
want it to jump back to 2.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.290
Well, we could just add another
unit step function

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.810
here, something that would have
been zero all along, all

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.270
the way up until this point.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.160
But then at 2pi, it jumps,
so in this case,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.475
our c would be 2pi.

00:05:36.475 --> 00:05:38.670
That's our unit step function,
and we want it to jump to 2.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.430
This would just jump
to 1 by itself.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.070
So let's multiply it by 2.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.480
And now we have this function.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.780
So you could imagine, you
can make an arbitrarily

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.180
complicated function of things
jumping up and down to

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.260
different levels based on
different essentially linear

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.720
combinations of these
unit step functions.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.090
Now, what if I wanted
to do something

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.030
a little bit fancier?

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.990
What if I wanted to do something
that-- let's say I

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.420
have some function that
looks like this.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.756
Let me draw some function.

00:06:07.756 --> 00:06:09.340
I should draw straighter
than that.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.950
I should have some standards.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.860
So let's say that just
my regular f of t--

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.740
let me, this is x.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.030
Actually, why am I doing x?

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.700
This would be the t-axis.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.940
We're doing the time domain.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.100
It could have been x.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.720
And then we'll call
this f of t.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.590
So let me draw some
arbitrary f of t.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.160
Let's say my function looks
something crazy like that.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.980
So this is my f of t.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.680
What if I'm modeling
a physical system

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.910
that doesn't do this?

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.260
That actually at some point--
well, actually, let's say it

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.330
stays at zero.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.050
It stays at zero until
some value.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.405
Let's say it goes to zero
until-- I don't know, I'll

00:06:53.405 --> 00:06:55.190
call that c again.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.870
And then at c, f of t
kind of starts up.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:03.140
So right at c, f of t should
start up, so it just kind of

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.620
goes like this.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.270
So essentially what we have here
is a combination of zero

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.860
all the way, and then we
have a shifted f of t.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.600
So at c, we have a shifted f of
t, so it shifts that way.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.960
So how can we construct this
yellow function, where it's

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.150
essentially a shifted version
of this green function, but

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.960
it's zero below c?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.020
This green function might
have continued.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.320
It might have gone something
like this.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.325
It might have, continued and
done something crazy, but what

00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:38.460
we did is we shifted it from
here to there, and then we

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.440
zeroed out everything
before c.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.870
So how could we do that?

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.880
Well, just shifting this
function, you've learned in

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.940
your Algebra II or your
precalculus classes, to shift

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.620
a function by c to the right,
you just to replace your t

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.970
with a t minus c.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:59.790
So this function right here
is f of t minus c.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.960
And to make sure I get it right,
what I always do is I

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.270
imagine, OK, what's going to
happen when t is equal to c?

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.400
When t is equal to c, you're
going to have a c minus a c,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.030
and you're going
to have f of 0.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.840
So f of 0, it should
be the same.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.270
So when t is equal to c, this
value, the value of the

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.560
function should be equivalent
to the value of the original

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.850
green function at zero, so it's
equivalent to that value,

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.110
which makes sense.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.110
If we go up one more above c, so
let's say this is one more

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:36.650
above c, so we get to this
point, if t is c plus 1, then

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.390
when you put c plus 1 minus c,
you just have f of 1, and f of

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.970
1 is really just this
point right here.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.650
And so it'll be that f of
1, so it makes sense.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.390
So as we move one forward here,
we're essentially at the

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.350
same function value as we were
there, so the shift works.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.320
But I said that we have to
also-- if I just shifted this

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.080
function, you would have all
this other stuff, because you

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.700
would have had all this other
stuff when the function was

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.500
back here still going on.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.770
The function-- I'll draw it

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.810
lightly-- would still continue.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.330
But I said I wanted to zero
out this function

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.390
before we reach c.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.800
So how can I zero out
that function?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.950
Well, I think it's pretty
obvious to you.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.750
I started this video talking
about the unit step function.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.680
So what if I multiply
the unit step

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.280
function times this thing?

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.990
What's going to happen?

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.870
So what if I-- my new function,
I call it the unit

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:35.130
step function up until c of
t times f of t minus c?

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.210
So what's going to happen?

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.300
Until we get to c, the unit
step function is zero when

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.250
it's less than c.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.700
So you're going to have zero
times I don't care what this

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.070
is Zero times anything is zero,
so this function is

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.260
going to be zero.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.900
Once you hit c, the unit step
function becomes 1.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.710
So once you pass c, this thing
becomes a 1, and you're just

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.320
left with 1 times
your function.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.520
So then your function can behave
as it would like to

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.450
behave, and you actually
shifted it.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.410
This t minus c is what actually
shifted this green

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.210
function over to the right.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.760
And this is actually
going to be a very

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.630
useful constructed function.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.110
And in a second, wer'e going
to figure out the Laplace

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.820
transform of this, and you're
going to appreciate, I think,

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.220
why this is a useful function
to look at.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.800
But now you understand at least
what it is and why it

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.000
essentially shifts a function
and zeroes out everything

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.520
before that point.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.140
Well, I told you that this is
a useful function, so we

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.480
should add its Laplace transform
to our library of

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.720
Laplace transforms.
So let's do that.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:49.410
Let's take a the Laplace
transform of this, of the unit

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.670
step function up to c.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.840
I'm doing it in fairly general
terms. In the next video,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.200
we'll do a bunch of examples
where we can apply this, but

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.300
we should at least prove to
ourselves what the Laplace

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.000
transform of this thing is.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.400
Well, the Laplace transform of
anything, or our definition of

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.260
it so far, is the integral from
0 to infinity of e to the

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.630
minus st times our function.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:18.240
So our function in this case is
the unit step function, u

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.950
sub c of t times f
of t minus c dt.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.530
And this seems very general.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.670
It seems very hard to evaluate
this integral at first, but

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.540
maybe we can make some form of
a substitution to get it into

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.860
a term that we can appreciate.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.940
So let's make a substitution
here.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.690
Let me pick a nice variable
to work with.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.370
I don't know, we're not
using an x anywhere.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.440
We might as well use an x.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.980
That's the most fun variable
to work with.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.325
Sometimes, you'll see in a
lot of math classes, they

00:11:50.325 --> 00:11:53.060
introduce these crazy Latin
alphabets, and that by itself

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.660
makes it hard to understand.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.510
So I like to stay away from
those crazy Latin alphabets,

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.180
so we'll just use a regular x.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.120
Let's make a substitute.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:08.790
Let's say that x is equal
to t minus c.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.560
Or you could, if we added t to
both sides, we could say that

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.700
t is equal to x plus c.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.600
Let's see what happens
to our subsitution.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.220
And also, if we took the
derivative of both sides of

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.360
this, or I guess the
differential, you would get dx

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.965
is equal to dt.

00:12:23.965 --> 00:12:27.460
Or I mean, if you took dx with
respect to dt, you would get

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.040
that to equal to 1. c
is just a constant.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.900
Then if you multiply both sides
by dt, you get dx is

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.700
equal to dt, and that's
a nice substitution.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.610
So what is our integral going
to become with this

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.100
substitution?

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.670
So our integral this
was t equals 0 to

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.520
t is equal to infinity.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:51.880
When t is equal to 0, what is
x going to be equal to?

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:57.080
Well, x is going to be
equal to minus c.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.170
Actually, before I go there,
let me actually take a step

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.350
back, because we
could progress.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:04.720
We could go in this direction.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.150
But we could actually simplify
it more before we do that.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.680
Let's go back to out original
integral before we even made

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.010
our substitution.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.680
If we're taking the integral
from 0 to infinity of this

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.290
thing, we already said what does
this integral look like

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.750
or what does this function
look like?

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.750
It's zero.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.870
We have this unit step function
sitting right here.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.650
We have the unit step function
sitting right there.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.980
So this whole expression
is going to be zero

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.980
until we get to c.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.220
This whole thing, by definition,
this unit step

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.400
function is zero until
we get to c.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.400
So this everything's going
to be zeroed out

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.940
until we get to c.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.890
So we could essentially say,
you know, we don't have to

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.010
take the integral from t equals
0 to t equals infinity.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:52.540
We could take the integral--
let me write it here.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.450
I'll just use that old
integral sign.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:59.070
We could just take the integral
from t is equal to c

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:05.790
to t is equal to infinity of e
to the minus st, the unit step

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:12.280
function, uc of t times
f of t minus c dt.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.990
In fact, at this point, this
unit step function, it has no

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.280
use anymore.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.210
Because before t is equal to c,
it's 0, and now that we're

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.090
only worried about values above
c, it's equal to 1, so

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.440
it equals 1 in this context.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.240
I want to make that
very clear to you.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.320
What did I do just here?

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.340
I changed our bottom boundary
from 0 to c.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.550
And I think you might realize
why I did it when I was

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.270
working with the substitution,
because this will simplify

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.090
things if we do this
ahead of time.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.550
So if we have this unit step
function, this thing is going

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.960
to zero out this entire integral
before we get to c.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.950
Remember, this definite integral
is really just the

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:56.060
area under this curve of this
whole function, of the unit

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.980
step function times
all of this stuff.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.200
All of this stuff, when we
multiply it, is going to be

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.050
zero until we get
to some value c.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.620
And then above c, it's going to
be e to the minus st times

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.760
f of t minus c.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.820
So it's going to start doing
all this crazy stuff.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.610
So if we want to essentially
find the area under this

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:16.840
curve, we can ignore all the
stuff that happens before c.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.520
So instead of going from t
equals 0 to infinity, we can

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.640
go from t is equal to c to
infinity because there was no

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.540
area before t was equal to c.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.960
So that's all I did here.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.920
And then the other thing I said
is that the unit step

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.640
function, it's going to be 1
over this entire range of

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.420
potential t-values, so we can
just kind of ignore it.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.370
It's just going to be 1 this
entire time, so our integral

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:46.380
simplifies to the definite
integral from t is equal to c

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:53.440
to t is equal to infinity of e
to the minus st times f of t

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.025
minus is c dt.

00:15:56.025 --> 00:15:58.030
And this will simplify
it a good bit.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.600
I was going down the other
road when I did the

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.830
substitution first, which would
have worked, but I think

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.750
the argument as to why I could
have changed the boundaries

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.760
would've been a harder
argument to make.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.900
So now that we had this, let's
go back and make that

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.760
substitution that x is
equal to t minus c.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.340
So our integral becomes-- I'll
do it in green-- when t is

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.990
equal to c, what is x?

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.950
Then x is 0, right?

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.440
c minus c is 0.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.680
When t is equal to infinity,
what is x?

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.720
Well x is, you know, infinity
minus any constant is still

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.460
going to be infinity, or if
the limit is t approaches

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.920
infinity, x is still going
to be infinity here.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.100
And it's the integral of e to
the minus s, but now instead

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.245
of a t, we have the
substitution.

00:16:39.245 --> 00:16:42.530
If we said x is equal to t minus
c, then we can just add

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.660
c to both sides and get t
is equal to x plus c.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:53.830
So you get x plus c there, and
then times the function f of t

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:58.230
minus c, but we said t minus
c is the same thing as x.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.370
And dt is the same
thing is dx.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:05.460
I showed you that right there,
so we can write this as dx.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.700
Now this is starting to look
a little bit interesting.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.780
So what is this equal to?

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.730
This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity-- let me

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:23.579
expand this out-- of e to
the minus sx minus sc

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:28.240
times f of x dx.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.360
Now, what is the equal to?

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.500
Well, we could factor out an e
to the minus sc and bring it

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.300
outside of the integral, because
this has nothing to do

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.150
with what we're taking the
integral with respect to.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.970
So let's do that.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.530
Let me take this guy out, and
maybe just to not confuse you,

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.600
let me rewrite the
whole thing.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.650
0 to infinity.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.010
I could rewrite this e term
as e-- actually, let me

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.460
write it this way.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.930
I'll do what was already in
green as e to the minus sx

00:17:55.930 --> 00:18:00.820
times e to the minus sc.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.860
Common base.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.800
So if I were to multiply these
two, I could just add the

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.430
exponents, which you would
get that up there, times

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.580
f of x, d of x.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.200
This is a constant term with
respect to x, so we can just

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.720
factor it out.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.350
We can just factor this thing
out right there, so then you

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:28.290
get e to the minus sc times
the integral from 0 to

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:37.810
infinity of e to the minus
sx times f of x dx.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.090
Now, what were we doing
here the whole time?

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:49.070
We were taking the Laplace
transform of the unit step

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.950
function that goes up to c, and
then it's 0 up to c, and

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:58.000
it's 1 after that, of t times
some shifted function

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.680
f of t minus c.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.720
And now we got that as being
equal to this thing, and we

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.710
made a substitution.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.490
We simplified it a little bit.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:16.610
e to the minus sc times the
integral from 0 to infinity of

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:21.600
e to the minus sx f of x dx.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.180
Something about the tablet
doesn't work properly right

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.290
around this period.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.920
But this should look
interesting to you.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.600
What is this?

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.470
This is the Laplace transform
of f of x.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.280
Let me write that down.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.610
What's the Laplace transform
of-- well, I could write it as

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.640
f of t or f of x.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.910
The Laplace transform of f of
t is equal to the integral

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:55.680
from 0 to infinity of e to the
minus st times f of t dt.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.040
This and this are the
exact same thing.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.520
We're just using a t here.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.960
We're using an x here.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.790
No difference.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.910
They're just letters.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.490
This is f of t.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.870
e to the minus st
times f of t dt.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.270
I could have also rewritten
it as the Laplace

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.970
transform of f of t.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.790
I could write this as the
integral from 0 to infinity of

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:24.470
e to the minus sy
times f of y dy.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.930
I could do it by anything
because this

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.740
is a definite integral.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.330
The y's are going to disappear,

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:29.190
and we've seen that.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.500
All you're left with
is a function of s.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.910
This ends up being some capital,
well, you know, we

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.140
could write some capital
function of s.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.060
So this is interesting.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.680
This is the Laplace transform
of f of t times some scaling

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.060
factor, and that's what
we set out to show.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:54.790
So we can now show that the
Laplace transform of the unit

00:20:54.790 --> 00:21:02.700
step function times some
function t minus c is equal to

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.870
this function right here, e to
the minus sc, where this c is

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.650
the same as this c right
here, times the Laplace

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.740
transform of f of t.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.370
Times the Laplace transform--
I don't know what's going on

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:21.450
with the tablet right
there-- of f of t.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.100
Let me write that.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.450
This is equal to-- because it's
looking funny there-- e

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:32.540
to the minus sc times the
Laplace transform of f of t.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.865
So this is our result.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.740
Now, what does this mean?

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.290
Oh, look it back-filled
it somehow.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:43.180
What does this mean?

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.285
What can we do with this?

00:21:45.285 --> 00:21:50.420
Well, let's say we wanted to
figure out the Laplace

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.910
transform of the unit
step function that

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.200
starts up at pi of t.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.430
And let's say we're taking
something that we know well:

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:05.510
sine of t minus pi.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.570
So we shifted it, right?

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.750
This thing is really
malfunctioning at this point

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:11.450
right here.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:14.600
Let me pause it.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.440
I just paused.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.890
Sorry if that was a little
disconcerting.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.420
I just paused the video because
it was having trouble

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.950
recording at some point
on my little board.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.130
So let me rewrite the result
that we proved just now.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:29.430
We showed that the Laplace
transform of the unit step

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:34.520
function t, and it goes to 1
at some value c times some

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.820
function that's shifted
by c to the right.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.770
It's equal to e to the minus cs
times the Laplace transform

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:45.520
of just the unshifted
function.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.400
That was our result.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.630
That was the big takeaway
from this video.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.550
And if this seems like some
Byzantine, hard-to-understand

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.630
result, we can apply it.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.930
So let's say the Laplace
transform, this is what I was

00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:01.080
doing right before the actual
pen tablet started

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:01.920
malfunctioning.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.500
If we want to take the Laplace
transform of the unit step

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.610
function that goes to 1 at pi,
t times the sine function

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:15.220
shifted by pi to the right, we
know that this is going to be

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:19.320
equal to e to the minus cs.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.700
c is pi in this case, so minus
pi s times the Laplace

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.760
transform of the unshifted
function.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.030
So in this case, it's
the Laplace

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.300
transform of sine of t.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.460
And we know what the Laplace
transform of sine of t is.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.250
It's just 1 over s
squared plus 1.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.770
So the Laplace transform of this
thing here, which before

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:47.720
this video seemed like something
crazy, we now know

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.090
is this times this.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:53.380
So it's e to the minus pi s
times this, or we could just

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:58.900
write it as e to the minus pi
s over s squared plus 1.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.990
We'll do a couple more examples
of this in the next

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.900
video, where we go back and
forth between the Laplace

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.950
world and the t and between
the s domain

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:06.810
and the time domain.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.730
And I'll show you how this is a
very useful result to take a

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.910
lot of Laplace transforms and
to invert a lot of Laplace

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.160
transforms.
