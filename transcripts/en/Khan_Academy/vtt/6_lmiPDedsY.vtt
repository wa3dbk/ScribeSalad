00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.790
I'm now going to do a
bunch more examples

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.120
using the chain rule.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.320
So let's see.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.920
Once again.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.930
If I had f of x is equal to,
let's see, I don't like this

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.100
tool that I'm using now,
let's have one of these.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:28.390
f of x is equal to, say, x to
the third plus 2x squared

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.600
minus, let's say, minus
x to the negative 2.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.960
We haven't put any negative
exponents in yet, but I

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.060
think you'll see that
the same patterns apply.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.520
And all of that to, let's
say, the minus seven.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.077
We want to figure out what
f prime of x, what the

00:00:47.077 --> 00:00:48.260
derivative of f of x is.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.540
So this might seem very
complicated and daunting to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.220
you, and obviously to take
this entire polynomial to

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.470
the negative seventh power
would take you forever.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.590
But using the chain rule, we
can do it quite quickly.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.610
So the first thing we want to
do, is we want to take the

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.460
derivative of the inner
function, I guess

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.420
you could call it.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.630
We want to take the
derivative of this.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.990
And what's the derivative of x
to the third plus 2x squared

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.770
minus x to the negative 2?

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.600
Well, we know how to do that.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.790
That was the first type
of derivatives we

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.210
learned how to do.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.210
It's 3x squared and 2 times 2,
plus 4x to the first, or just

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.270
4x, and then here, with a
negative exponent, we do

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.120
the exact same thing.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.320
We say negative 2 times
negative 1, right, there's a 1

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.450
here, we don't write it down.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.360
So negative 2 times negative 1
is plus 2 x to the, and then we

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.210
decrease the exponent by
1, so it's x to the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.530
negative 3, right?

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.980
So we figured out what the
derivative of the inside is,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.990
and then we just multiply
that, that whole thing, times

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.750
the derivative of kind of
the entire expression.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.210
So then that'll be, we
take the minus 7, let me

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.270
do a different color.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.800
So this is the entire thing.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.620
So then we take minus 7, so
it's times minus 7, this

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.130
whole expression, I'm
going to run out of space.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.370
x to the third plus 2x squared
minus x to the minus 2.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.400
That's minus x to the minus 2.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.900
And all of that, we just
decrease this exponent

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.980
by 1, to the minus 8.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.040
So let me write it all down
a little bit neater now.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.230
So we get f prime of x as the
derivative of f of x is equal

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:52.500
to 3x squared plus 4x plus 2x
to the minus third power, I

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.310
don't know why did that.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.190
That's minus 3.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:04.450
Times minus seven times x to
the third plus 2x squared minus

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.710
x to the minus two, all of that
to the negative eight power.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.970
And we could simplify
it little bit.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.640
Maybe we could just multiply
this minus 7, times, we could

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.005
distribute it across
this expression.

00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:23.510
So we'd say, that equals minus
7, so this equals minus 21 x

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:34.260
squared, minus 28 x minus
14x to the negative 3.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:43.980
All of that times x to the
third plus 2 x squared minus x

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.950
to the minus 2 to the minus 8.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:49.950
So there we did it.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.990
We took this, what I would say
is a very complicated function,

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.290
and using the chain rule and
just the basic rules we had

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.260
introduced a couple of
presentations ago, we were able

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.030
to find the derivative of it.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.650
And now, if we wanted to, for
whatever application, we could

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.320
find the slope of this function
at any point x by just

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.910
substituting that point into
this equation, and we'll get

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.120
the slope at that point.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.400
Let me do a slightly harder
one, to show you that the chain

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.400
rule, you can kind of go
arbitrarily deep in

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.969
the chain rule.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.610
OK.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.010
So let's say I had, let
me see if I can write it

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.000
a little bit thinner.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.340
If I had f of x, I don't know
if you can see that, I'm going

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.560
to do it a little fatter.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.480
f of x is equal to, I want to
make it a little bit more

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.520
complicated this time.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:05:03.420
3x to the minus 2 plus 5 x to
the third minus 7x, all of that

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.620
to the fifth, and then this
whole expression to

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.900
the third power.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.560
So I imagine you saying, Sal,
you're starting to go nuts,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.010
this is going to
take us forever.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.630
Well, I'll show you, using
the chain rule, it will

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.500
not take that long.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.200
So the way I think about
it, so-- f prime of x,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.480
f prime of x equals.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.360
I start off kind with
the innermost function.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.210
So let me see if I can
use colors to make it

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.820
a little bit simpler.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.430
Let's take the derivative of
this innermost function first.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.940
Actually, let me give
you the big picture.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.820
We want to find the derivative
of the innermost function, and

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.860
then a little bit bigger,
and then a little bit

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.890
more big than that.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.980
I know that's not precise
mathematical terms, but

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.310
you'll get the point when
I show you this example.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.860
So first we'll do this
inner function, this

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.860
inner expression.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.520
And the derivative of
that's pretty easy, right?

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.270
It's 15x squared
minus 7, right?

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.020
that was pretty
straightforward.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.150
And now we're going to want
to multiply that times this

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.010
entire derivative here.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.280
So let me circle that in
a different-- so then

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.750
we want to do this.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.240
We're going to multiply that
times this entire derivative.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.140
Well, that's just times 5.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.420
And we just pretend like this
is just an x here, right?

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.795
Because the derivative
of x to the fifth is 5x

00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:28.150
to the fourth, right?

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.590
But instead of an x, we have
this whole expression, 5x

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.680
to the third minus 7x.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.130
So we'll write that.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.360
5x to the third minus 7x.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.520
Now the exponent here
goes down by one.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.540
So it's 5 times 5x to the
third minus 7x, all that

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.070
to the fourth power.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.330
So we figured out the
derivative of this so far, and

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.646
then we want to figure out the
derivative of this, so we'll

00:06:51.646 --> 00:06:53.000
add it, right, because we're
trying to figure the derivative

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.880
of this entire expression.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.120
So this is an easy one.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.020
Let me draw that in
a different color.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.870
So we want the
derivative of this.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.450
So that's negative 2 times
3, so that's negative

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.430
6x to the minus three.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.610
So what have we done so far?

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.270
We've so far figured out the
derivative of this entire

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.540
expression, right?

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.850
The derivative of that
entire expression using

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.170
the chain rule is this.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.910
And now, we're almost done.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.290
We just have to multiply that.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.630
So I'm going to just, I've run
out of space on that line, but

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.170
let's just assume that
the line continues.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.770
So that's times.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.360
And now we just take the
derivative of kind of

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.410
this whole big thing.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.346
And now it's going to be the
derivative of, I'm going

00:07:40.346 --> 00:07:42.580
to use this brown color.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.950
So it's a whole big expression
to the third power, right?

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.520
So that becomes times 3 times
the whole expression, right?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.270
That's 3 times, now I'm going
to write the whole thing, 3x to

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:06.670
the minus 2 plus 5 x the third
minus 7x, that to fifth, and

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.220
then you decrement this by
1, to the second power.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.600
That was an ultraconfusing
example, and this is probably

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.850
the hardest chain rule problem
you'll see in a lot of

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.340
the questions you'll
have on your test.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.450
You see, it wasn't
that difficult.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.200
We just kind of went to the
smallest possible function, and

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.760
actually the smallest possible
function would have been one of

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.710
these terms, but we just found
the derivative of this, which

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.690
was 15 x squared minus 7, and
then we just used the principle

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.420
that the derivative of kind of
a function is just the

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.960
derivative of each of its
parts-- well, actually, the

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.400
derivative of-- we figured out
the derivative of this inner

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.464
piece, which was 15x squared
minus 7, and then we multiplied

00:08:43.464 --> 00:08:47.350
it times the derivative of this
slightly larger piece, which is

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:52.210
5 times this entire expression
to the fourth, then we added it

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.980
to the derivative of
3x to the minus 2.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.470
And then that whole thing, and
actually I should put a big

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.810
parentheses around here, that
whole thing, we multiply it

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.180
times the derivative of
this larger expression.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.630
I think I might have confused
you, so I apologize if I have,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.810
and in the next presentation
I'm going to just do a bunch

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.000
more chain rule problems, and
at some point, it should

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.670
start to make sense to you.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.210
I think it's just a matter
of seeing example, after

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.940
example, after example.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.380
I'll see you into the next
presentation, and I apologize

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.440
if I have confused you.
