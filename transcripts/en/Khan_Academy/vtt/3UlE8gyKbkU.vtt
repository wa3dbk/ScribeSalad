00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.580
Find the probability
of getting exactly two

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.530
heads when flipping three coins.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.230
So let's think about
the sample space.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.910
Let's think about all of
the possible outcomes.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.230
So I could get all heads.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.470
So on flip one I get a
head, flip two I get a head,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.070
flip three I get a head.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.080
I could get two heads
and then a tail.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.190
I could get heads,
tails, heads, or I

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.420
could get heads, tails, tails.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.760
I could get tails, heads, heads.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.420
I could get tails, heads, tails.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.040
I could get tails, tails, heads.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.992
Or I could get tails,
tails, and tails.

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:40.450
These are all of
the different ways

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.990
that I could flip three coins.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.406
And you can maybe
say that this is

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:45.660
the first flip, the second
flip, and the third flip.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.930
Now, so this right over
here is the sample space.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.610
There's eight possible outcomes.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.340
Let me write this, the
probability of exactly two

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:00.860
heads, I'll say H's
there for short.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.640
The probability of
exactly two heads, well

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.959
what is the size of
our sample space?

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.620
I have eight possible outcomes.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.510
So eight, this is
possible outcomes,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.150
or the size of our sample
space, possible outcomes.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.610
And how many of those
possible outcomes

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.050
are associated with this event?

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.620
You could call this
a compound event,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.610
because there's more
than one outcome that's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.560
associated with this.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.280
Let's think about
exactly two heads.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.840
This is three heads, so
it's not exactly two heads.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.390
This is exactly two
heads right over here.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.570
This is exactly two
heads right over here.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.990
There's only one head.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.690
This is exactly two heads.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.400
This is only one head,
only one head, no heads.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400
So you have one, two, three
of the possible outcomes

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.800
are associated with this event.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.410
So you have three
possible outcomes.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.620
Three outcomes
associated with event.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.870
Three outcomes
satisfy this event,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.570
are associated with this event.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.860
So the probability of
getting exactly two heads

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.240
when flipping three
coins is three outcomes

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.300
satisfying this event over
eight possible outcomes.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.410
So it is 3/8.
