00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.915
Let's say I've got me
a set of vectors.

00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:06.720
So let me call my set B.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.130
And let's say I have the vectors
v1, v2, all the way

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.380
through vk.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.960
Now let's say this isn't just
any set of vectors.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.160
There's some interesting things
about these vectors.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.080
The first thing is that all of
these guys have length of 1.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:36.080
So we could say the length of
vector vi is equal to 1 for i

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.890
is equal to-- well we could say
between 1 and k or i is

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.750
equal to 1, 2, all
the way to k.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.010
All of these guys have
length equal 1.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.020
Or another way to say it is
that the square of their

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.360
lengths are 1.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.240
The square of a vi whose
length is equal to 1.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.980
Or vi dot vi is equal to 1 for
i is any of these guys.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.630
Any i can be 1, 2, 3,
all the way to k.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.350
So that's the first interesting
thing about it.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.950
Let me write it in
regular words.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:19.940
All the vectors in
B have length 1.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.680
Or another way to say is that
they've all been normalized.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.260
That's another way to say that
is that they have all been

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.030
normalized.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.190
Or they're all unit vectors.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.160
Normalized vectors are vectors
that you've made

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.880
their lengths 1.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.400
You're turned them into
unit vectors.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.776
They have all been normalized.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.750
So that's the first
interesting thing

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.100
about my set, B.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.320
And then the next interesting
thing about my set B is that

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.130
all of the vectors are
orthogonal to each other.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.690
So if you dot it with itself,
if you dot a vector with

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.470
itself, you get length 1.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.940
But if you take a vector and dot
it with any other vector--

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.150
if you take vi and you were
to dot it with vj.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.539
So if you took v2 and dotted it
with v1, it's going to be

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.120
equal to 0 for i does
not equal j.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.210
All of these guys
are orthogonal.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.060
Let me write that down.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:31.416
All of the vectors are
orthogonal to each other.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.390
And of course they're not
orthogonal to themselves

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.160
because they all
have length 1.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.260
So if you take the dot product
with itself, you get 1.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.390
If you take a dot product with
some other guy in your set

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.400
you're going to get 0.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.630
Maybe I can write it this way.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.460
vi dot vj for all the members
of the set is going to be

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.330
equal to 0 for i does
not equal j.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.750
And then if these guys are the
same vector-- I'm dotting with

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.760
myself-- I'm going
to have length 1.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.430
So it would equal length
1 for i is equal to j.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.530
So I've got a special set.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.890
All of these guys have length
1 and they're all orthogonal

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.380
with each other.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.660
They're normalized and they're
all orthogonal.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.450
And we have a special
word for this.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.900
This is called an
orthonormal set.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:37.870
So B is an orthonormal set.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.560
Normal for normalized.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.130
Everything is orthogonal.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.180
They're all orthogonal relative
to each other.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.740
And everything has
been normalized.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.610
Everything has length 1.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.090
Now, the first interesting thing
about an orthonormal set

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.010
is that it's also going to be
a linearly independent set.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:03.200
So if B is orthonormal, B is
also going to be linearly

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.450
independent.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.990
And how can I show
that to you?

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.230
Well let's assume that it isn't
linearly independent.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.960
Let me take vi, let me take vj
that are members of my set.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.780
And let's assume that
i does not equal j.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.250
Now, we already know that
it's an orthonormal set.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.730
So vi dot vj is going
to be equal to 0.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.500
They are orthogonal.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.500
These are two vectors
in my set.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.180
Now, let's assume that they
are linearly dependent.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.570
I want to prove that they are
linearly independent and the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.370
way I'm going to prove that is
by assuming they are linearly

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.060
dependent and then arriving
at a contradiction.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:07.973
So let's assume that vi and
vj are linearly dependent.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.870
Well then that means that I
can represent one of these

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.420
guys as a scalar multiple
the other.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.790
And I can pick either way.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.290
So let's just say, for the sake
of argument, that I can

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.030
represent vi-- let's say
that vi is equal to sum

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.100
scalar c times vj.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.220
That's what linear
dependency means.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.200
That one of them can be
represented as a scalar

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.520
multiple of the other.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.560
Well if this is true, then
I can just substitute

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.880
this back in for vi.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.250
And what do I get?

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.590
I get c times vj-- which is just
another way of writing vi

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.300
because I assumed linear
dependence.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.050
That dot vj has got
to be equal to 0.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.160
This guy was vi.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.880
This is vj.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.780
They are orthogonal
to each other.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:01.200
But this right here is just
equal to c times vj dot vj

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.080
which is just equal to c times
the length of vj squared.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.720
And that has to equal 0.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.120
They are orthogonal so
that has to equal 0.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.070
Which implies that the length
of vj has to be equal to 0.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.150
If we assume that this is some
non-zero multiple, and this

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.175
has to be some non-zero
multiple-- I should have

00:06:23.175 --> 00:06:26.200
written it there-- c
does not equal 0.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.470
Why does this have to be
a non-zero multiple?

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.270
Because these were both
non-zero vectors.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.640
This is a non-zero vector.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.210
So this guy can't be 0.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.840
This guy has length 1.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.900
So if this is a non-zero vector,
there's no way that I

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.400
can just put a 0 here.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.600
Because if I put a 0 then
I would get a 0 vector.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.070
So c can't be 0.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.400
So if c isn't 0, then this guy
right here has to be 0.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.280
And so we get that the
length of vj is 0.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.450
Which we know is false.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.590
The length of vj is 1.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.020
This is an orthonormal set.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.035
The length of all of the
members of B are 1.

00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:56.960
So we reach a contradiction.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.960
This is our contradiction.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.290
Vj is not the 0 vector.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.290
It has length 1.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.380
Contradiction.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.560
So if you have a bunch of
vectors that are orthogonal

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.050
and they're non-zero, they
have to be linearly

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.160
independent.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.680
Which is pretty interesting.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.460
So if I have this set, this
orthonormal set right here,

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.140
it's also a set of linearly
independent vectors, so it can

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:25.790
be a basis for a subspace.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:35.960
So let's say that B is the basis
for some subspace, v.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:47.140
Or we could say that v is equal
to the span of v1, v2,

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.880
all the way to vk.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.370
Then we called B-- if it was
just a set, we'd call it a

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.790
orthonormal set, but it can be
an orthonormal basis when it's

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.290
spans some subspace.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.250
So we can write, we can
say that B is an

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:10.175
orthonormal basis for v.

00:08:10.175 --> 00:08:12.890
Now everything I've done is very
abstract, but let me do

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.520
some quick examples for you.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.600
Just so you understand what an
orthonormal basis looks like

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.140
with real numbers.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.240
So let's say I have
two vectors.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.520
Let's say I have the vector,
v1, that is-- say we're

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:33.700
dealing in R3 so it's 1/3,
2/3, 2/3 and 2/3.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:42.450
And let's say I have another
vector, v2, that is equal to

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.740
2/3, 1/3, and minus 2/3.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:58.480
And let's say that B is
the set of v1 and v2.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.030
So the first question
is, is what are the

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.830
lengths of these guys?

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.816
So let's take the length.

00:09:02.816 --> 00:09:09.580
The length of v1 squared
is just v1 dot v1.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.600
Which is just 1/3 squared,
which is just 1 over 0.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.190
Plus 2/3 squared,
which is 4/9.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.370
Plus 2/3 squared,
which is 4/9.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.770
Which is equal to 1.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.230
So if the length squared is 1,
then that tells us that the

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.440
length of our first vector
is equal to 1.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.640
If the square of the length is
1, you take the square root,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.970
so the length is 1.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.070
What about vector 2?

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:43.260
Well the length of vector 2
squared is equal to v2 dot v2.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.690
Which is equal to-- let's see,
two 2/3 squared is 4/9-- plus

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.680
1/3 squared is 1/9.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.470
Plus 2/3 squared is 4/9.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.340
So that is 9/9, which
is equal to 1.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.420
Which tells us that the length
of v2, the length of vector v2

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.680
is equal to 1.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.200
So we know that these guys are
definitely normalized.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.360
We can call this a
normalized set.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.360
But is it an orthonormal set?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.160
Are these guys orthogonal
to each other?

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.490
And to test that out we just
take their dot product.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:22.210
So v1 dot v2 is equal to 1/3
times 2/3, which is 2/9.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:27.390
Plus 2/3 times 1/3,
which is 2/9.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.360
Plus 2/3 times the minus 2/3.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.660
That's minus 4/9.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.950
2 plus 2 minus 4 is 0.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:36.860
So it equals 0.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.900
So these guys are indeed
orthogonal.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.140
So B is an orthonormal set.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.790
And if I have some subspace,
let's say that B is equal to

00:10:53.790 --> 00:11:01.760
the span of v1 and v2, then we
can say that the basis for v,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:10.400
or we could say that B is
an orthonormal basis.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.430
for V.
