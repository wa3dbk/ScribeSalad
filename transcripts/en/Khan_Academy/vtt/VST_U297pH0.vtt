00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.330
We have company ABCD trading at $50 a share

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.220
Let's draw a payoff diagram for a put option

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.780
with a $50 strike price trading at $10

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.170
So once again we get to draw two types of payoff diagrams

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.650
One type that only cares about the value of

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.630
the option at expiration.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.780
This is what you tend to see in academic settings

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.270
like business schools or textbooks.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.480
And the other one will actually draw a profit

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.390
and loss based-on that option position,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.840
so incorporate the price you actually paid for the option.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.990
You tend to see this more in practice.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.500
So you have a put option.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.990
Remember, this is the right to sell the stock at $50.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.280
So the stock let's say at expiration.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.900
All of these are at expiration.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.140
At expiration the stock is trading at $0,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.040
the company went bankrupt.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.850
Now it's worthless. What is the put option worth?

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.010
You would now go on the market, buy it for almost $0 ,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.510
and then you would exercise your put option

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.140
and then you would sell it for $50.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.810
So you would definitely excerise it,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.640
and you'd make a lot of money the underlying stock

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.620
can be bought for $0,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.470
the put option is now worth $50,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.430
because you can buy it for 0 and sell it for 50 dollars.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.760
if you have the put option.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.520
If the underlying stock price is $10,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.630
then you could still go to buy the stock for $10.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.060
If you had the option,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.390
you would excercise the option to sell it for $50,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.760
so you would make $40.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.070
So, the option would be worth $40.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.540
And anyone who's holding the option would make instant $40.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.630
So, the value of the option becomes less and less,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.340
as the value of the stock becomes more and more,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.720
up until you you get to $50.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.020
At $50 you wouldn't really care

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.220
you have the right to sell something at $50,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.120
which you could buy for $50.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.100
So, it's kinda worth nothing.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.110
The value of the put option could start at $50,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.300
because you have the right to

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.600
sell something worthless at $50,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.860
if the stock's going bankrupt

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.990
After $50, it becomes the option.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.570
You don't really doesn't have any value anymore.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.240
And if the stock goes anything above %50,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.510
it's still worthless.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.450
If the stock is $100 or something like that,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.170
there's no way you could exercise the option.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.050
because why would you excercise the right to

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.180
sell something at $50,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.480
while in the open market you can sell it at $100.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.520
Let's do the same thing for the profit/loss version.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.220
So, the stock is worth nothing,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.900
you can buy it for nothing,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.260
and then if you have the option, sell it for $50.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.440
But, we have to incorporate the fact that

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.470
you paid 10 dollars for the option.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.170
So, instead of the option is worth $50,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.620
we would say it's worth 50 minus this

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.780
So, it'd be worth $40.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.190
And this is all the way you would exercise the option

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.980
all the way until the option is worth $50

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.790
But at $50, instead of saying it's worthless,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.390
you have to remember, if the stock is 50$,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.910
you wouldn't exercise the option.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.170
But you did pay $10 for it.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.680
So, you wouldn't exercise something that you paid $10 for

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.010
so you would have to take a $10 loss.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.310
so the option started at 50,

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.720
and it'd become less and less,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.630
all the way to the point that if you don't exercise it,

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.000
you would took the loss of paying for the option.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.730
not exercising it.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.150
And any stock price above that,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.760
you just took a $10 loss.
