00:00:00.535 --> 00:00:05.286
Let's say we've got two countries: country A and country B

00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:08.202
And at the start of our little hypothetical thought experiment

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:11.119
they have a very stable exchange rate, maybe it's one for one.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:16.970
Every A, if you were to go into a foreing currency markets, you could get a B for it.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.368
So there's this kind of this stable supplying demand between this two currencies.

00:00:23.368 --> 00:00:30.370
Now let's say for whatever reason folks in A start to believe that country B is the hot place to invest.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.118
They want to buy country B's real state, they want to invest in country B's stock market.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:44.537
and so if they wanna buy stuff in B they essentially have to hold more B's currency and so more and more people in A

00:00:44.537 --> 00:00:51.702
want to exchange their "A's" for country B's currency. So you have this huge supply of A comming out to the foreign exchange markets

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:57.701
but you still have the same amount of B that wanna go the other way, maybe, you know,

00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:02.503
these are maybe there to either invest in country A or maybe buy some of country's A exports,

00:01:02.503 --> 00:01:03.969
or whatever it might be.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.287
But if we just let this happen on it's own when all of a sudden there's a much larger demand for converting

00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:16.568
A into B than converting B into A, you'll have a situation where the B will just get more expensive.

00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:19.170
There's more demand for B than there are for A.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.904
It'll get more expensive in terms of A.

00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:28.500
So if you look at it from country A's point of view, you're now having to pay more A per B

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.081
At a completely equivalent statement from country B's perspective

00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:39.638
you now have to pay fewer B's per A.

00:01:39.638 --> 00:01:48.170
Now, let's say for whatever reason you are the central bank (right over here) of country B

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.414
and you don't like your currency becoming stronger,

00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:54.035
maybe you just don't like the volatility in the exchange market,

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:58.332
you don't like the idea that the exchange rates go up and down so dramatically,

00:01:58.332 --> 00:02:02.169
maybe you just don't want your exports to get expensive or that imports

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:03.748
from another country to get cheap.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:07.037
For whatever reason you do not like this movement happening

00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:11.638
and so what you're going to do is, because you have the right to do it,

00:02:11.638 --> 00:02:13.770
because you are the central bank of your country,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.332
you can print more of your currency (right here the currency pies)

00:02:19.332 --> 00:02:24.902
so you're gonna print more of these, you could print more of them

00:02:24.902 --> 00:02:26.102
just like that

00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:29.637
and then you could use that extra bit that you've just printed to buy more A's

00:02:29.637 --> 00:02:36.505
and so now you've kind of renormalized the supply and the demand for B.

00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:38.170
But what's going to be the end product of that?

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.915
Well, you did succesfully keep your currency from appreciating relative to the A's

00:02:42.915 --> 00:02:45.969
which, based on how this was all set up, that was your goal,

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:50.502
but the other thing that you ended up with is such a printed B's that you're able to buy A

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:58.170
at the open market, you now, on your balance sheet, you have a bunch of A.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.302
And so when people talk about foreign currency reserves

00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:10.104
and pretty much every bank, every central bank has

00:03:10.104 --> 00:03:11.838
foreign currency reserves,

00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:13.569
this is what they're talking about.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.462
That central bank printed their own currency and went out to currency for and exchange markets

00:03:18.462 --> 00:03:21.236
and bought other countries' currencies.

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:23.378
And there's multiple reasons for them doing it.

00:03:23.378 --> 00:03:26.837
This might be one of them, or it might be to protect them in the case that

00:03:26.837 --> 00:03:29.546
this whole dinamic reverses in the other direction,

00:03:29.546 --> 00:03:33.546
specially if it reverses in a very dramatic way.
