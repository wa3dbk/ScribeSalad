00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.460
 

00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.830
In the last video, I touched on
the idea of a sigma bond.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.830
And that was a bond-- well, let
me draw two nucleuses and

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.630
let me just draw one
of the orbitals.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.330
Let's say this is an sp3
hybridized orbital, and that's

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.219
on this atom and this is kind of
this big lobe right there.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.730
And then this guy has an sp3
hybridized orbital as well.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.740
That's the small lobe,
and then that's the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.330
big lobe like that.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.080
A sigma bond is one where
there's an overlap kind of in

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.960
the direction in which the
lobes are pointed.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.520
And you might say, well, how can
there be any other type of

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.830
bond than that?

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.000
Well, the other type of bond,
so this right here-- let me

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.760
make this clear.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.070
This right here is
a sigma bond.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.600
And you say, well, what other
kind of bond could there be

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.650
where my two orbitals overlap
kind of in the direction that

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.490
they're pointing?

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.010
And the other type of bond you
could have, you can imagine if

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.510
you have two p orbitals.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.300
So let me draw the nucleus of
two atoms, and I'll just draw

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.390
one of each of their
p orbitals.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.410
So let's say that that's the
nucleus and I'll just draw

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.170
their p orbitals.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.140
So a p orbital is just
that dumbbell shape.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.980
Let me draw them a little
bit closer together.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.452
So a p orbital is that
dumbbell shape.

00:01:15.452 --> 00:01:19.375
So let me draw this guy's--
one of his p orbitals.

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.430
I want to draw it a little bit
bigger than that, and you'll

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.320
see why a second.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.665
So one of his p orbitals
right there.

00:01:25.665 --> 00:01:28.210
It comes out like that.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.140
And then this guy over here also
has a p orbital that is

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.050
parallel to this p orbital,
so it goes like that.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.510
 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.740
Let me draw that other one
a little bit straighter.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.090
It goes-- I want it to overlap
more, so it goes like that.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.330
I think you get the idea.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.500
So here, our two p orbitals are
parallel to each other.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.400
This, you can imagine, these are
sp3 hybridized orbitals.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.430
They're pointing
at each other.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.590
Here, they're parallel.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.620
p orbitals are parallel to each
other, and you see that

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.010
they overlap on this kind of
top lobe here and in this

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.580
bottom lobe here.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.210
And this is a pi bond.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.100
Let me make this clear.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.880
And this is one pi bond.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.060
So you could call it a pi,
literally, with the Greek

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.140
letter pi: pi bond.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.720
Sometimes you'll see this
just written as pi bond.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.540
And it's called a pi bond
because it's the Greek letter

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.910
for essentially p, and we're
dealing with p orbitals

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.600
overlapping.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.170
Now sigma bonds, which are
what form when you have a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.267
single bond, these are stronger
than pi bonds; pi

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:43.530
bonds come into play once you
start forming double or triple

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.440
bonds on top of a sigma bond.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.050
To kind of get a better
visualization of how that

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.600
might work, let's think
about ethene.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.680
So it's molecular structure
looks like this.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.560
So you have C double-bonded to
C, and then each of those guys

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.810
have two hydrogens.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.990
 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.200
So let me draw what it would
look like, or our best visual,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.960
or our best ability to kind
of conceptualize what the

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.395
orbitals around the carbon
might look like.

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:20.330
 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.340
So first I'll draw the sp2
hybridized orbitals.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.850
So let me just make it very
clear what's going on here.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.730
So when we were dealing with
methane, which is literally

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.200
just a carbon bonded to four
hydrogens, and if I actually

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.900
wanted to draw it in a way that
it kind of looks a little

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.810
three-dimensional with a
tetrahedral structure, it

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.640
might look like this.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.450
This hydrogen is pointing
out a little bit.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.360
This hydrogen is kind of in
the plane of the page, and

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.100
then maybe that hydrogen is
behind it, and then you have

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.880
one hydrogen popping up.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.440
That's methane.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.170
And we saw that these were all
sp3 hybridized orbitals around

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.110
the carbon, and then they each
formed sigma bonds with each

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.860
of the hydrogens.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.550
We saw that in the last video.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.470
And when we drew its electron
configuration, in order for

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.780
this to happen, carbon's
electron configuration when

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.899
bonding in methane needed
to look like this.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.540
It needed to look like 1s2.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.050
And then instead of having 2s2
and then 2p2, what you

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.430
essentially have is-- let me
try it this way, actually,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.370
even better.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.180
Let me write this better.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.350
In 1s, you had two electrons,
and then instead of two s's,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.770
you had two electrons and on
each of the p's, you had one,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:48.010
the s's and the p's all got
mixed up and you had a 2sp3

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.480
hybridized orbital, another
2sp3 hybridized orbital,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.650
another 2sp3 hybridized
orbital, and then

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.970
another one, sp3.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.810
Normally, when carbon's sitting
by itself, you would

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.600
expect a 2s here, and then
you'd have a 2p in the

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.480
x-direction, a 2p in the
y-direction, and then a 2p in

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.200
the z-direction.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.910
But we saw in the last video,
they all get mixed up and they

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.610
all have a 25% s-character,
and a 75% p-character when

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.080
carbon bonds in methane and the
electrons kind of separate

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.700
out in that situation.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.050
When you're dealing with the
carbons in ethene, remember,

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.560
eth- is for two carbons and
ene-, because we're dealing

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.320
with an alkene.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.240
We have a double bond here.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.400
In this situation, the
carbon's electron

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.050
configuration when they
bond in ethene

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.580
looks more like this.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.530
So you have your 1s, and
the 1s orbital is

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.870
still completely full.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.520
It has two electrons in it.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.250
But then in your 2 shell, I'll
just write-- let me do this in

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.910
a different color.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.570
So in our 2 shell, I'll show you
what I mean in a second.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.990
I'm not writing the s or p's so
far on purpose, but we're

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.350
going to have four electrons
just like we had before.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.600
We're still forming
four bonds.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.270
We're going to have these
four unpaired electrons.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.290
We're still forming one, two,
three, four bonds with each of

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.470
the carbons, so they're going
to be separated out.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.310
 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.130
But in this situation, instead
of all of them being a

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.490
mixture, kind of one part s,
three parts p, the s mixes

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.380
with two of the p orbitals.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:33.210
So what you have is
2sp2 orbital.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.660
So you can imagine that the s
orbital mixes with two of the

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.200
p orbitals.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.260
So now it's one part
s, two parts p.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.540
And then one of the p orbitals
kind of stays by itself.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.860
And we need this p orbital to
stay by itself because it is

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.800
going to be what's responsible
for the pi bond.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.210
And we're going to see that
the pi bond does something

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.020
very interesting to
the molecule.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.910
It kind of makes it unrotatable

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.640
around a bond axis.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.960
And you'll see what I
mean in a second.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.000
So let me see if I can, in three
dimensions, draw each of

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.250
these carbons.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.880
 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.270
So you have-- let me do
it a different color.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.530
You have this carbon
right there.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.880
So let's say that's
the nucleus.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.690
I'll put a C there so you
know which carbon

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.680
we're dealing with.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.280
And then I'll draw-- you could
assume that the 1s orbital,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.210
it's really small right
around the carbon.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.930
And then you have these
hybridized orbitals, The 2sp2

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.430
orbitals, and they're all going
to be planar, kind of

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.990
forming a triangle, or I guess
maybe a peace sign on some

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.160
level, but I'll try to draw it
in three dimensions here.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.480
So you have one, this is kind
of coming out a little bit.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.250
Then you have one that's
going in a little bit.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.140
And then you have-- and they
have another lobe a little bit

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.580
on the other side, but I'm
not going to draw them.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.500
It'll complicate it.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.520
They still have characteristics
of p, so

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.040
they'll have two lobes, but one
is bigger than the other.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.580
And then you have one that's
maybe going in this side.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.820
So you can imagine that this is
kind of a Mercedes sign if

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.480
you drew a circle around
it, on its side.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.870
So that's this carbon
right here.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.090
And, of course, it has
its hydrogens.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.000
So you have this
hydrogen there.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.410
And so this hydrogen might
be sitting right here.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.830
It just has one electron
in its 1s orbital.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.270
You have this hydrogen
up here.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.260
It's sitting right over there.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.760
And now let's draw
this carbon.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.270
 

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.840
This carbon will be sitting--
I'm drawing it

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.880
pretty close together.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.330
This carbon will be sitting
right there.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.679
He has his 1s orbital.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.610
They have the exact same
electron configuration.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.419
He has his 1s orbital right
around him, and then he has

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:44.890
the exact same configuration.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.290
Either of these guys, we've so
far only-- or in this first

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.860
guy, I've only drawn
these first three.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.140
I haven't drawn this
unhybridized p orbital yet.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.730
So I'll do that in a second.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.570
But let me draw his bonds.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.140
So first of all, he has this,
or you could imagine, that

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.490
bond right there, which would
be an sp2 hybridized bond.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.410
Let me do that in
the same color.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.210
So he has this bond right here,
which would be an sp2

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.310
hybridized bond,
just like that.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.250
And notice, this is
a sigma bond.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.480
They overlap in kind of the
direction that they're

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.070
pointing in.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.520
That's the best I could
think about it.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.210
And then he's got these two
hydrogens, so one-- he's got

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:31.200
this guy in the back, and then
there's one in the front.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.990
I'll draw it a little bigger so
it's kind of pointing out

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.690
at us, right?

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:39.470
And then we have this hydrogen
is sitting right over here.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.170
And these are also sigma bonds,
just to be very clear

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.950
about things.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.330
This is an s orbital overlapping
with an sp2

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.430
orbital, but they're kind of
overlapping in the direction

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.270
that they're pointed, or kind of
along the direction of each

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.830
other, of the two atoms. This
is a sigma bond, sigma bond,

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:01.140
and then we have this hydrogen
in the back, which is also

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.220
going to form a sigma bond.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.230
So everything I've drawn
so far is a sigma

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.430
bond, so that, that.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.930
Maybe I don't want to make this
picture too-- so I can

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.400
just put sigma bond there, sigma
bond there, sigma bond

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.870
there, sigma, sigma.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:23.540
So far I've drawn this bond,
this bond, this bond, this

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.600
bond, and this bond, all
of those sigma bonds.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.060
So, what happens to this
last p orbital for

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.650
each of these guys?

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.590
Well, that's going to be kind
of sticking out of the plane

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.770
of the Mercedes sign, is the
best way I can describe it.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.330
And let me see if I can do
that in a color that I

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.040
haven't done yet.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.070
Oh, maybe this purple color.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.480
So you can imagine
a pure p orbital.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.190
So a pure p orbital, I'm going
to need to draw it even bigger

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.560
than that, actually.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.400
A pure p orbital, it normally
wouldn't be that big relative

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.490
to things, but I have to
make them overlap.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:03.030
So it's a pure p orbital that's
kind of going in, maybe

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.960
you can imagine, the z-axis,
that the other orbitals are

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.230
kind of a Mercedes sign
in the x, y plane.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.610
And now you have the z-axis
going straight up and down,

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.530
and those bottom two have
to overlap so let

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.990
me draw them bigger.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.680
 

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.330
So it looks like that and
it looks like that.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.470
And they're going straight
up and down.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.510
And notice, they are
now overlapping.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:29.670
So this bond right here
is this bond.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.730
I could've drawn them in either
way, but it's that

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:32.710
second bond.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.600
And so what's happening
now to the structure?

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.310
So let me make it very clear.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.440
This right here, that is a pi
bond, and this right here is

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.980
also-- it's the same pi bond.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.300
It's this guy right here.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.860
It's the second bond
in the double bond.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.680
But what's happening here?

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.410
Well, first of all, by itself it
would be a weaker bond, but

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:56.940
because we already have a sigma
bond that's making these

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.100
molecules come closer together,
this pi bond will

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.290
make them come even
closer together.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.010
So this distance right here is
closer than if we were to just

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.270
have a single sigma
bond there.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.380
Now, on top of that, the really
interesting thing is,

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.400
if we just had a sigma bond
here, both of these molecules

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.300
could kind of rotate around
the bond axis.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.050
They would be able to rotate
around the bond axis if you

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.910
just had one sigma bond there.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.120
But since we have these pi bonds
that are parallel to

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.260
each other and they're kind of
overlapping and they're kind

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.000
of locked in to that
configuration, you can no

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.720
longer rotate.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.980
If one of these molecules
rotates, the other one's going

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.610
to rotate with it because
these two

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.020
guys are locked together.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.590
So what this pi bond does in the
situation is it makes this

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.360
carbon-carbon double bond-- it
means that the double bonds

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.060
are going to be rigid, that you
can't have one molecule

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.500
kind of flipping, swapping these
two hydrogens, without

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.340
the other one having
to flip with it.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.800
So you wouldn't be able to kind
of swap configurations of

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.620
the hydrogens relative
to the other side.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.530
That's what it causes.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.380
So, hopefully, that gives you
a good understanding of the

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.340
difference between sigma
and pi bond.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.990
And if you're curious, when
you're dealing with-- just to

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:11.430
kind of make it clear, if we
were dealing with ethyne, this

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.180
is an example of ethene, but
ethyne looks like this.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.670
You have a triple bond.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.340
And so you have each side
pointing to one hydrogen.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.140
In this case, one of these, so
the first bonds, you can

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.420
imagine, so these bonds
are all sigma bonds.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.660
They're actually
sp hybridized.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.870
Your 2s orbital only mixes with
one of the p's, so these

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:47.290
are sp hybrid orbitals forming
sigma bonds, so all of these

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.170
right here.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:52.310
And then both of these-- let me
do this in different color.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.360
Both of these are pi bonds.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.150
And if you had to imagine it,
could imagine another pi bond

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.820
kind of coming out of the page
and another one here coming

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.540
out of the page and into the
page, out and into the page,

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.270
and they, too, are overlapping,
and you just have

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.660
one hydrogen pointing out
in each direction.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.320
Maybe I'll make another
video on that.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.960
So, hopefully, you--

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.200
