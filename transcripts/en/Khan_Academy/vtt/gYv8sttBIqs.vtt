00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.270
Say I have some matrix a --
let's say a is n by n, so it

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.390
looks something like this.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.990
You've seen this before,
a 1 1, a 1 2, all

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.690
the way to a 1 n.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.980
When you go down the rows you
get a 2 1, that goes all the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.000
way to a 2 n.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.130
And let's say that there's some
row here, let's say row

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.200
i, it looks like a i 1,
all the way to a i n.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.710
And then you have some other row
here, a j, it's a j 1 all

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.330
the way to a j n.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.380
And then you keep going all the
way down to a n 1, a n 2,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.020
all the way to a n n.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.070
This is just an n by n matrix,
and you can see that I took a

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.030
little trouble to write out my
row a, my i'th row here and my

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.360
j'th row here.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.490
And just to kind of keep things
a little simple, let me

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.850
just define -- just for
notational purposes, you can

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.480
view these as row vectors if
you like, but I haven't

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.270
formally defined row
vectors so I won't

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.890
necessarily go there.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.640
But let's just define the term r
i, we'll call that row i, to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.990
be equal to a i 1, a i 2,
all the way to a i n.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.390
You can write it as
a vector if you

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.500
like, like a row vector.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.450
We haven't really defined
operations on row vectors that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.050
well yet, but I think
you get the idea.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.620
We can then replace this guy
with r 1, this guy with r 2,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.510
all the way down.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.122
Let me do that, and I'll do
that in the next couple of

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:39.830
videos because it'll simplify
things, and I think make

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.710
things a little bit easier
to understand.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.890
So I can rewrite this matrix,
this n by n matrix a, I can

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.700
re-write it as just r i.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.410
Actually, this just looks
like a vector,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.640
it's just a row vector.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.790
Let me write it as a
vector like that.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.490
And I'm being a little bit
hand-wavy here because all of

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.980
our vectors have been defined as
column vectors, but I think

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.280
you get the idea.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.770
So let's call that r 1, and then
we have r 2 is the next

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.960
row, all the way down.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.140
You keep going down, you get
to r i -- that's this row

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.190
right there -- r i.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.690
You keep going down, you get r
j, and then you keep going

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.160
down until you get
to the n'th row.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.780
And each of these guys are going
to have n terms because

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.540
you have n columns.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.480
So that's another
way of writing

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.870
this same n by n matrix.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.240
Now what I'm going to do here
is, I'm going to create a new

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.490
matrix-- let's call that
swapping the swap

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.700
matrix of i and j.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.540
So I'm going to swap i and
j, those two rows.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.790
So what's the matrix
going to look like?

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.990
Everything else is going
to be equal.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.380
You have row 1-- assuming that
1 wasn't one of the i or j's,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.460
it could have been.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.010
Row 2, all the way down to-- now
instead of a row i there

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.400
you have a row j there, and you
go down and instead of a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.040
row j you have a row i there.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.200
And you go down and
then you get r n.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.780
So what did we do?

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.900
We just swapped these
two guys.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.820
That's what the swap
matrix is.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.140
Now I think it was in the last
video or a couple of videos

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.530
ago, we learned that if you just
swap two rows of any n by

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.020
n matrix, the determinant of the
resulting matrix will be

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.520
the negative of the original
determinant.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:38.040
So we get the determinant of
s, the swap of the i'th and

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.840
the j rows is going to be equal
to the minus of the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.090
determinant of a.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.360
Now, let me ask you an
interesting question.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.000
What happens if those two rows
were actually the same?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.720
What if r i was equal to r j?

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.670
If we go back to all of these
guys, if that row is

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.150
equal to this row?

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.680
That means that this guy is
equal to that guy, that the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.460
second column-- the second
column for that row all the

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.700
way to the n'th guy is equal
to the n'th guy.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.829
That's what I mean when I say
what happens if those two rows

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.070
are equal to each other.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.120
Well, if those two rows are
equal to each other, than this

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.400
matrix is no different than this
matrix here, even though

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.020
we swapped them.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.340
If you swap two identical
things, you're just going to

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.640
be left with the same
thing again.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.430
So if-- let me write this down--
if row i is equal to

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.820
row j, then this guy,
then s, the swapped

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.760
matrix, is equal to a.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.530
They'll be identical.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.280
You're swapping two rows that
are the same thing.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.510
So that implies a determinant of
the swapped matrix is equal

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.830
to the determinant of a.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.250
But we just said, if the swap
matrix, when you swap two

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.800
rows, it equals a negative
of the determinant of a.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.140
So this tells us it also has to
equal the negative of the

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.910
determinant of a.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.440
So what does that tell us?

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.840
That tells us if a has two rows
that are equal to each

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.320
other, if we swap them, we
should get the negative of the

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.260
determinant, but if two rows are
equal we're going to get

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.730
the same matrix again.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.270
So if a has two rows that are
equal-- so if row i is equal

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.710
to row j-- then the determinant
of a has to be

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.770
equal to the negative of
the determinant of a.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.290
We know that because the
determinant of a, or a is the

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.710
same thing as the swapped
version of a, and the swapped

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.280
version of a has to have the
negative determinant of a.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.200
So these two things
have to be equal.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.510
Now what number is equal to a
negative version of itself?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.340
If I just told you x is equal
to negative x, what number

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.010
does x have to be equal to?

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.410
There's only one value that it
could possibly be equal to. x

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.850
would have to be equal to 0.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.820
So the takeaway here is, let's
say if you have duplicate

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.140
rows-- you can extend this if
you have three or four rows

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.330
that are the same-- leads
you to the fact that the

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.940
determinant of your
matrix is 0.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.800
And that really shouldn't
be a surprise.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.590
Because if you have duplicate
rows, remember what we learned

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.500
a long time ago.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:38.540
We learned that a matrix is an
invertible if and only if the

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:45.150
reduced row echelon form
is the identity matrix.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.290
We learned that.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.930
But if you have two duplicate
rows-- let's say these two

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.480
guys are equal to each other--
you could perform a row

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.250
operation where you replace this
guy with this guy minus

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.085
that guy, and you'll just
get a row of 0's.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.580
And if you get a row of 0's,
you're never going to be able

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.450
get the identity matrix.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:15.480
So we know that duplicate rows
could never get reduced row

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.980
echelon form to be
the identity.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.710
Or, duplicate rows are
not invertible.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.350
And we also learned that
something is not invertible if

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.335
and only if its determinant
is equal to 0.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.100
So we now got to the same result
two different ways.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.820
One, we just used some
of what we learned.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.710
When you swap rows, it should
become the negative, but if

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.340
you swap the same row, you
shouldn't change the matrix.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.950
So the determinant of
the matrix has to

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.400
be the same as itself.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.700
So if you have duplicate rows,
the determinant is 0.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.810
Which isn't something that we
had to use using this little

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.140
swapping technique, we could
have gone back to our

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.750
requirements for invertability--
I think was

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.040
five or six videos ago.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.320
But I just wanted to
point that out.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.970
If you see duplicate rows.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.930
and actually if you see
duplicate columns-- I'll leave

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.880
that for you to think about--
if you see duplicate rows or

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.840
duplicate columns, or even if
you just see that some rows

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.450
are linear combinations of
other rows-- and I'm not

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.740
showing that to you right here--
then you know that your

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.340
determinant is going
to be equal to 0.
