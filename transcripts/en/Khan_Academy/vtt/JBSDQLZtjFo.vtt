00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.470
I think we've had some pretty
good exposure to the quadratic

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.550
formula, but just in case you
haven't memorized it yet, let

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.760
me write it down again.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.770
So let's say we have a quadratic
equation of the

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:18.180
form, ax squared plus bx,
plus c is equal to 0.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.670
The quadratic formula, which we
proved in the last video,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.010
says that the solutions to this
equation are x is equal

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.390
to negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.590
minus 4ac, all of
that over 2a.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.080
Now, in this video, rather than
just giving a bunch of

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.770
examples of substituting in the
a's, the b's, and the c's,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.240
I want to talk a little bit
about this part of the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.110
quadratic formula, this
part right there.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.390
The b squared minus 4ac.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.150
And we've seen it in a couple of
the problems we've done as

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.420
examples, that this kind of
determines what our solution

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.000
is going to look like.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.610
If, for example, b squared minus
4ac is greater than 0,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.950
we're going to have two
solutions, right?

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.070
The square root of some
positive number that's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.600
non-zero, there's going to be
a positive and negative

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.190
version of it-- we're always
going to have a b over 2a or

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.540
negative b over 2a-- so you're
going to have negative b plus

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.560
that positive square root, and
a negative b minus that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.330
positive square root,
all over 2a.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.970
So if the discriminant is
greater 0, then that tells us

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.670
that we have two solutions.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.350
Now I just used a word, and
that word is discriminant.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.170
And all that is referring
to is this part of

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.596
the quadratic formula.

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:56.980
That right there-- let me do it
in a different color-- this

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.040
right here is the discriminant
of the quadratic equation

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.290
right here.

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:09.030
And you just have to remember,
it's the part that's under the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.700
radical sign of the
quadratic formula.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.960
And that's why it matters,
because if this is greater

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.120
than 0, you're having a positive
square root, and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.980
you'll have the positive and
negative version of it, you'll

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.860
have two solutions.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.820
Now, what happens if b squared
minus 4ac is equal to 0?

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.930
If this is equal to 0-- if you
take b squared minus 4, times

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.170
a, times c, and that's equal to
0-- that tells us that this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.040
part of the quadratic formula
is going to be 0, and the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.970
square root of 0 is just 0.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.450
And then, actually, your only
solution is going to be x is

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.970
going to be equal to
negative b over 2a.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.480
Or another way to think
about it is you

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.090
only have one solution.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.530
So if the discriminant
is equal to 0, you

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.756
only have one solution.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.320
And that solution is actually
going to be the vertex, or the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.510
x-coordinate of the vertex,
because you're going to have a

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.860
parabola that just touches the
x-axis like that, just touches

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.640
there, or just touches like
that, just touches at exactly

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.490
one point, when b squared
minus 4ac is equal to 0.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.130
And then the last situation
is if b squared minus 4ac

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.380
is less than 0.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.880
Then over here, you're going to
get a negative number under

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.870
the radical.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.770
And we saw an example of
that in the last video.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.570
If we're dealing with real
numbers, we can't take a

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.960
square root of a negative
number, so this means that we

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.310
have no real solutions.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.990
In the future, you're going to
see that we will have complex

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.300
solutions, but if we're dealing
with real numbers we

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.110
have no real solution.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.340
Because this makes no sense.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.760
The square of a negative number,
at least it makes no

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.830
sense in the real numbers.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.030
And then there's more
you can think about.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.340
If we do have a positive
discriminant, if b squared

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.350
minus 4ac is positive, we can
think about whether the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.460
solutions are going to
be rational or not.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.160
If this is 2, then we're going
to have the square root of 2

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.120
in our answer, it's going to
be an irrational answer, or

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.079
our solutions are going
to be irrational.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.590
If b squared minus 4ac is 16,
we know that's a perfect

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.010
square, you take the square
root of a perfect square,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.950
we're going to have
a rational answer.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.570
Anyway, with all of that talk,
let's do some examples,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.500
because I think that's
what makes all

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.700
of these ideas tangible.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.510
So let's say I have the equation
negative x squared

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.670
plus 3x, minus 6
is equal to 0.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.830
And all I'm concerned about is
I just want to know a little

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.990
bit about what kinds of
solutions this has.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.630
I don't want to necessarily
even solve for x.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.430
So if you're in a situation like
that, I can just look at

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.100
the discriminant.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.320
I can just look at b
squared minus 4ac.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:06.620
So the discriminant here is
what? b squared is 9 minus 4,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.140
times a-- negative 1-- times
c, which is negative 6.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.870
So what is this equal to?

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.220
This negative and that negative
cancel out, but we

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.420
still have that negative
out there, so it's 9

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.450
minus 4, times 6.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.640
This is 9 minus 24, which
is less than 0.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.190
So we're going to have a number
smaller than 0 under

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.070
the radical.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.970
So we have no real solutions.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.210
That was this scenario
right here.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.970
And so this graph is going to
point downwards, because we

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.940
have a negative sign there,
so it probably looks like

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.520
something like that.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.870
If that's the x-axis, the
graph is dipping down.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.270
Its vertex is below the x-axis
and it's downward-opening, so

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.080
it never intersects
the x-axis.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.680
We have no real solutions.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.660
Let's do another one.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.425
Let's say I have-- I'll do this
one in pink-- let's say I

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:07.280
have the equation, 5x squared
is equal to 6x.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.530
Well, let's put this in the
form that we're used to.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.550
So let's subtract 6x from both
sides, and we get 5x squared

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.860
minus 6x is equal to 0.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.560
And let's calculate
the discriminant.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.320
So, we want to get b squared.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.730
b squared is negative
6 squared minus 4,

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.070
times a, times c.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.380
Well, where is the c here?

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.240
There is no c here.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.580
There's a plus 0 that I'm
not writing here.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.780
There's no c.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.470
So in this situation,
c is equal to 0.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.670
There is no c in
that equation.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.500
So times 0.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.930
So that all cancels out.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.990
Negative 6 squared
is positive 36.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.800
The discriminant is positive.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.300
You'd have a positive 36 under
the radical right there, so

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.110
not only is it positive, it's
also a perfect square.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.250
So this tells me that I'm going
to have two solutions.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.390
So I'm going to have
two real solutions.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.610
And not only are they're going
to be real, but I also know

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.100
they're going to be rational,
because I have the

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.160
square root of 36.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.270
The square root of 36 is
positive or negative 6.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.680
I don't end up with an
irrational number here, so two

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.055
real solutions that
are also rational.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.160
This is this scenario
right there.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.440
And you could also have
irrational in this scenario,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.160
so it's this [? here ?]

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.080
plus the irrational.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.530
Let's do a couple more, just
to get really warmed.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:41.160
Let's say I have 41x squared
minus 31x, minus

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.820
52 is equal to 0.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.420
Once again, I just want to
think about what type of

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.240
solution I might be
dealing with.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.330
So b squared minus 4ac.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.540
b squared.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:08:01.350
Negative the 31 squared minus
4, times a, times 41, times

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.560
c-- times negative 52.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.480
So what do I have here?

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.260
This is going to be a
positive 31 squared.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.690
The negative times
the negative,

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.510
these are both positive.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.920
So I'm going to have
a positive, right?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.050
This is the same thing as 31
squared, plus-- this is a

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.220
positive number right here, I
mean, we could calculate it,

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.290
but it's 4 times 41, times 52.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.240
All I care about is my
discriminant is positive.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.550
It is greater than 0,
so that means I

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.980
have two real solutions.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.039
And we could think about whether
this is some type of

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:35.700
perfect square.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.850
I don't know.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.990
I'm not going to do it here.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.909
That would take a little
bit of computation.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.780
So we know they're real, we
don't know if they're rational

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.810
or irrational solutions.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.180
Let's do one more of these.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:58.370
Let's say I have x squared
minus 8x, plus

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.050
16 is equal to 0.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.620
Once again, let's look
at the discriminant.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:08.460
b squared, that's negative 8
squared minus 4, times a,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.350
which is 1, times
c, which is 16.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:17.300
This is equal to 64 minus
64, which is equal to 0.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:27.070
So we only have one solution,
and by definition it's going

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.000
to be rational.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.600
I mean, you could actually
look at it right here.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.360
It's x minus 4, times x
minus 4 is equal to 0.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.615
The one solution is x
equal to positive 4.

00:09:40.615 --> 00:09:43.610
And when I say by definition of
the quadratic formula, you

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.390
look there, if this is a 0,
all you're left with is

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.230
negative b over 2a, which is
definitely going to be

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.110
rational, assuming you have a,
b, and c are, of course,

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.480
rational numbers.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.410
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.550
It's a quick way.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.470
You don't have to go all the way
to solving the solution,

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.080
you just want to have to say
what types of solutions or how

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.910
many solutions, how many real
solutions, or inspect whether

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.120
they're real or rational.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.320
The discriminant can be kind
of a useful shortcut.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.640
And I also think it makes you
kind of appreciate the parts

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.590
of the quadratic formula
a little bit better.
