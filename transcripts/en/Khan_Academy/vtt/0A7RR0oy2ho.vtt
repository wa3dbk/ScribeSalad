00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.680
Let's see if we can learn
a thing or two about

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.070
conic sections.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.240
So first of all, what are
they and why are they

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.630
called conic sections?

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.480
Actually, you probably
recognize a few of them

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.130
already, and I'll
write them out.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:22.070
They're the circle, the
ellipse, the parabola,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.760
and the hyperbola.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.970
That's a p.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.040
Hyperbola.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.750
And you know what
these are already.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.590
When I first learned conic
sections, I was like, oh,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.540
I know what a circle is.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.660
I know what a parabola is.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.120
And I even know a little bit
about ellipses and hyperbolas.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.710
Why on earth are they
called conic sections?

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.450
So to put things simply because
they're the intersection

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.760
of a plane and a cone.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.150
And I draw you
that in a second.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.260
But just before I do that it
probably makes sense to just

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.360
draw them by themselves.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.610
And I'll switch colors.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.360
Circle, we all know
what that is.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.540
Actually let me see if
I can pick a thicker

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.010
line for my circles.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.620
so a circle looks
something like that.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.420
It's all the points that are
equidistant from some center,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.610
and that distance that they
all are that's the radius.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.130
So if this is r, and this is
the center, the circle is all

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.460
the points that are exactly
r away from this center.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.480
We learned that early in our
education what a circle

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.280
is; it makes the world
go round, literally.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.270
Ellipse in layman's terms is
kind of a squished circle.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.110
It could look
something like this.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.810
Let me do an ellipse
in another color.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.300
So an ellipse could
be like that.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.710
Could be like that.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.680
It's harder to draw using the
tool I'm drawing, but it could

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.500
also be tilted and
rotated around.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.530
But this is a general sense.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.050
And actually, circles are a
special case of an ellipse.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.010
It's an ellipse where it's not
stretched in one dimension

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.730
more than the other.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.560
It's kind of perfectly
symmetric in every way.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.070
Parabola.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.610
You've learned that if you've
taken algebra two and you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.580
probably have if you care
about conic sections.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.610
But a parabola-- let me draw a
line here to separate things.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.300
A parabola looks something like
this, kind of a U shape and you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.650
know, the classic parabola.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.080
I won't go into the
equations right now.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.550
Well, I will because you're
probably familiar with it.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.370
y is equal to x squared.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.570
And then, you could shift it
around and then you can even

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.170
have a parabola that
goes like this.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.520
That would be x is
equal to y squared.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.590
You could rotate these things
around, but I think you know

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.090
the general shape
of a parabola.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.100
We'll talk more about how do
you graph it or how do you know

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.780
what the interesting points
on a parabola actually are.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.730
And then the last one,
you might have seen this

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.500
before, is a hyperbola.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.520
It almost looks like two
parabolas, but not quite,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.500
because the curves look a
little less U-ish and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.520
a little more open.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.010
But I'll explain what
I mean by that.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.170
So a hyperbola usually
looks something like this.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.900
So if these are the axes,
then if I were to draw-- let

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.610
me draw some asymptotes.

00:03:07.512 --> 00:03:13.740
I want to go right through
the-- that's pretty good.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.230
These are asymptotes.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.130
Those aren't the
actual hyperbola.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.970
But a hyperbola would look
something like this.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.280
They get to be right here
and they get really

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.090
close to the asymptote.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.020
They get closer and closer to
those blue lines like that and

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.430
it happened on this side too.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.860
The graphs show up here and
then they pop over and

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.000
they show up there.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.580
This magenta could be one
hyperbola; I haven't done

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.840
true justice to it.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.290
Or another hyperbola could be
on, you could kind of call

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.060
it a vertical hyperbola.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.720
That's not the exact word, but
it would look something like

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.160
that where it's below
the asymptote here.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.160
It's above the asymptote there.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.060
So this blue one would be
one hyperbola and then the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.670
magenta one would be a
different hyperbola.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.050
So those are the
different graphs.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.525
So the one thing that I'm sure
you're asking is why are

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:04.790
they called conic sections?

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.430
Why are they not called
bolas or variations of

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.810
circles or whatever?

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.740
And in fact, wasn't
even the relationship.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.180
It's pretty clear that
circles and ellipses

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.330
are somehow related.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.430
That an ellipse is just
a squished circle.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.250
And maybe it even seems that
parabolas and hyperbolas

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.680
are somewhat related.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.340
This is a P once again.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.670
They both have bola in their
name and they both kind

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.110
of look like open U's.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.930
Although a hyperbola has two of
these going and kind of opening

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.380
in different directions,
but they look related.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.020
But what is the connection
behind all these?

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.390
And that's frankly where
the word conic comes from.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.800
So let me see if I can draw
a three-dimensional cone.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.200
So this is a cone.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.900
That's the top.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.640
I could've used an
ellipse for the top.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.910
Looks like that.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.130
Actually, it has no top.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.690
It would actually keep going
on forever in that direction.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.080
I'm just kind of slicing it
so you see that it's a cone.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.920
This could be the
bottom part of it.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.760
So let's take different
intersections of a plane with

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.930
this cone and see if we can at
least generate the different

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.830
shapes that we talked
about just now.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.650
So if we have a plane that goes
directly-- I guess if you call

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.030
this the axis of this
three-dimensional cone,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.460
so this is the axis.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.150
So if we have a plane that's
exactly perpendicular to that

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.660
axis-- let's see if I can
draw it in three dimensions.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.265
The plane would look
something like this.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.940
So it would have a line.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.410
This is the front line that's
closer to you and then they

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.370
would have another
line back here.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.370
That's close enough.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.443
And of course, you know these
are infinite planes, so it

00:05:47.443 --> 00:05:50.060
goes off in every direction.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.930
If this plane is directly
perpendicular to the axis

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.400
of these and this is where
the plane goes behind it.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.010
The intersection of this
plane and this cone is

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.230
going to look like this.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.790
We're looking at it from an
angle, but if you were looking

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.170
straight down, if you were
listening here and you look at

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.660
this plane-- if you were
looking at it right above.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.300
If I were to just flip this
over like this, so we're

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.290
looking straight down on this
plane, that intersection

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.700
would be a circle.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.070
Now, if we take the plane and
we tilt it down a little bit,

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.810
so if instead of that we
have a situation like this.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.250
Let me see if I can
do it justice.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.690
We have a situation
where it's-- whoops.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.190
Let me undo that.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.570
Edit.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.870
Undo.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.940
Where it's like this and has
another side like this,

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.900
and I connect them.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.950
So that's the plane.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.890
Now the intersection of this
plane, which is now not

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.710
orthogonal or it's not
perpendicular to the axis of

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.240
this three-dimensional cone.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.650
If you take the intersection of
that plane and that cone-- and

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.280
in future videos, and you
don't do this in your

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.870
algebra two class.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.470
But eventually we'll kind of
do the three-dimensional

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.940
intersection and prove that
this is definitely the case.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.760
You definitely do get the
equations, which I'll show you

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.880
in the not too far future.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.510
This intersection would
look something like this.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.400
I think you can
visualize it right now.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.490
It would look
something like this.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.120
And if you were to look
straight down on this plane, if

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.200
you were to look right above
the plane, this would look

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.440
something-- this figure I
just drew in purple-- would

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.410
look something like this.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.290
Well, I didn't draw
it that well.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.290
It'd be an ellipse.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.800
You know what an
ellipse looks like.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.250
And if I tilted it the other
way, the ellipse would

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.430
squeeze the other way.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.890
But that just gives you a
general sense of why both of

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.330
these are conic sections.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.350
Now something very interesting.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:52.020
If we keep tilting this plane,
so if we tilt the plane so

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.420
it's-- so let's say we're
pivoting around that point.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.870
So now my plane-- let me
see if I can do this.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.710
It's a good exercise in
three-dimensional drawing.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.730
Let's say it looks
something like this.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.310
I want to go through
that point.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.070
So this is my
three-dimensional plane.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.330
I'm drawing it in such a way
that it only intersects this

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.920
bottom cone and the surface
of the plane is parallel to

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.760
the side of this top cone.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.630
In this case the intersection
of the plane and the cone

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.110
is going to intersect
right at that point.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.900
You can almost view that I'm
pivoting around this point, at

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.850
the intersection of this point
and the plane and the cone.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.750
Well this now, the
intersection, would look

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.470
something like this.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.230
It would look like that.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.490
And it would keep going down.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.980
So if I were to draw it,
it would look like this.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.840
If I was right above the
plane, if I were to

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.390
just draw the plane.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.050
And there you get
your parabola.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.860
So that's interesting.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.830
If you keep kind of tilting--
if you start with a

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.530
circle, tilt a little bit,
you get an ellipse.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.695
You get kind of a more
and more skewed ellipse.

00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:04.350
And at some point, the ellipse
keeps getting more and

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.160
more skewed like that.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.660
It kind of pops right when you
become exactly parallel to

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.990
the side of this top cone.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.260
And I'm doing it all very
inexact right now, but I

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.060
think I want to give
you the intuition.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.400
It pops and it turns
into a parabola.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.190
So you can kind of view
a parabola-- there is

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.470
this relationship.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.550
Parabola is what happens when
one side of an ellipse pops

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.580
open and you get this parabola.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.240
And then, if you keep tilting
this plane, and I'll do it

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.520
another color-- so
it intersects both

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.140
sides of the cone.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.490
Let me see if I can draw that.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.620
So if this is my new
plane-- whoops.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.820
That's good enough.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.550
So if my plane looks like
this-- I know it's very hard to

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.550
read now-- and you wanted the
intersection of this plane,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.700
this green plane and the cone--
I should probably redraw it

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.950
all, but hopefully you're not
getting overwhelmingly

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.190
confused-- the intersection
would look like this.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.490
It would intersect the bottom
cone there and it would

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.760
intersect the top
cone over there.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.320
And then you would have
something like this.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.230
This would be intersection of
the plane and the bottom cone.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.200
And then up here would be
the intersection of the

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.090
plane and the top one.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.810
Remember, this plane goes off
in every direction infinitely.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.920
So that's just a general sense
of what the conic sections are

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.850
and why frankly they're
called conic sections.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.580
And let me know if this got
confusing because maybe I'll do

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.350
another video while I redraw
it a little bit cleaner.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.650
Maybe I can find some kind of
neat 3D application that can do

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.890
it better than I can do it.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.750
This is kind of just the reason
why they all are conic

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.730
sections, and why they really
are related to each other.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.720
And will do that a little
more in depth mathematically

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.860
in a few videos.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.080
But in the next video, now that
you know what they are and why

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.340
they're all called conic
sections, I'll actually talk

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.680
about the formulas about these
and how do you recognize

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.370
the formulas.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.060
And given a formula, how do
you actually plot the graphs

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.020
of these conic sections?

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.820
See you in the next video.
