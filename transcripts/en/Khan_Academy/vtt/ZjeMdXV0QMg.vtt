00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.350
In this video I want to do a
couple of inequality problems

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.060
that are deceptively tricky.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.090
And you might be saying,
hey, aren't all inequality

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.480
problems deceptively tricky?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.580
And on some level
you're probably right.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.630
But let's start with
the first problem.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:20.070
We have x minus 1 over x
plus 2 is greater than 0.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.130
And I'm actually going to show
you two ways to do this.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.370
The first way is, I think, on
some level, the simpler way.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.260
But I'll show you both methods
and whatever works for you,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.810
well, it works for you.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.480
So the first way you can think
about this, if I have just any

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.370
number divided by any other
number and I say that they're

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.435
going to be greater than 0.

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:41.840
Well, we just have to remember
our properties of multiplying

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.570
and dividing negative numbers.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.940
In what situation is
this fraction going

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.560
to be greater than 0?

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.300
Well, this is going to be
greater than 0 only if both a

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.170
and-- so we could write both a
is greater than 0 and

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.670
b is greater than 0.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.670
So this is one circumstance
where this'll

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.030
definitely be true.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.480
We have a positive divided
by a positive; it'll

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.770
definitely be a positive.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.670
It'll definitely be
greater than 0.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.910
Or we could have the situation
where we have a negative

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.940
divided by a negative.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.600
If we have the same sign
divided by the same sign we're

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.150
also going to be positive.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.350
So or-- a is less than 0
and b is less than 0.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.750
So whenever you have any type
of rational expression like

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.810
this being greater than 0,
there's two situations in

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.100
which it will be true.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.760
The numerator and the
denominator are both

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.900
greater than 0, or
they're both less than 0.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.890
So let's remember that and
actually do this problem.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.880
So there's two situations
to solve this problem.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.770
The first is where both of
them are greater than 0.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.330
If that and that are both
greater than 0, we're cool.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.320
So we could say our first
solution-- maybe I'll draw a

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.760
little tree like that-- is x
minus 1 greater than 0 and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.410
x plus 2 greater than 0.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.470
That's equivalent to this.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.240
The top and the bottom-- if
they're both greater than 0

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.890
then when you divide them
you're going to get

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.320
something greater than 0.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.060
The other option-- we just
saw that-- is if both of

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.640
them were less than 0.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.010
So the other option is x
minus 1 less than 0 and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.760
x plus 2 less than 0.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.280
If both of these are less than
0 then you have a negative

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.320
divided by a negative,
which will be positive.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.530
Which will be greater than 0.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.492
So let's actually solve in
both of these circumstances.

00:02:28.492 --> 00:02:32.580
So x minus 1 greater than 0.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.730
If we add 1 to both
sides of that we get

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.000
x is greater than 1.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.300
And if we do x plus 2 greater
than 0, if we subtract 2 from

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.160
both sides of that equation--
remember I'm doing this

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.270
right now-- we get x is
greater than minus 2.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.100
So for both of these to hold
true-- so in this little brown

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.450
or red color, whatever you want
to think of it-- in order for

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.100
both of these to go hold true,
x has to be greater than 1 and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.380
x has to be greater
than minus 2.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.770
This statement we figured out
means that x has to be greater

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.600
than 1 and this statement
tells us that x has to

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.560
be greater than minus 2.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.190
Now, if x is greater than 1 and
x has to be greater than minus

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.010
2, x clearly has to
be greater than 1.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.280
You know, 0 would not satisfy
this because 0 is greater

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.450
than minus 2, but it's
not greater than 1.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.490
So for something to be greater
than 1 and minus 2 it has

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.080
to be greater than 1.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.000
This whole chain of thought
where I'm saying the numerator

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.950
and the denominator are greater
than 0, that's only going to

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.285
happen if x is greater than 1.

00:03:45.285 --> 00:03:47.870
Because if x is greater than 1,
then x is definitely going to

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.430
be greater than negative 2.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.800
Any number greater than
1 is definitely greater

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.740
than negative 2.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.590
So that's one situation in
which this equation holds true,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.580
and we can even try it out.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.230
Let's say x was 2.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.700
2 minus 1 is 1 over 2 plus 2.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.360
It's 1/4.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.585
It's a positive number.

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:03.560
Now let's do the situation
where both of these

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.900
are negative.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.720
If the x minus 1 is less than
0, if we add 1 to both sides of

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.470
that equation that tells us
so x minus 1 is less than 0.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.160
That's the same thing-- if we
add 1 to both sides of that--

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.340
as saying that x
is less than 1.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.750
So that constraint boils
down to that constraint.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.225
Now this constraint, x
plus 2 is less than 0.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:30.050
If we subtract 2 from
both sides we get x

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.980
is less than minus 2.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.860
So this constraint boils
down to that constraint.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.080
So in order for both of these
guys to be negative, both the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.310
numerator and the denominator
to be negative-- we know that

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:50.130
x has to be less than 1 and x
has to be less than minus 2.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.140
Now if something has to be less
than 1 and it has to be less

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.110
than minus 2, well, it just
has to be less than minus 2.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.020
Anything less than minus 2 is
going to satisfy both of these.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.150
So this boils down to
just x could also be

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.740
less than minus 2.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.390
And remember, this is an or.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.400
Either both the numerator and
the denominator are positive,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.800
or they're both negative.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.810
So both of them being positive
boil down to x could be greater

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.350
than 1, or both of them being
negative boils down to x

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.940
is less than minus 2.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:30.400
So our solution is x could be
greater than 1 or-- that's

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.690
both of these positive--
or x is less than minus 2.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.150
That's both of these negative.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.380
And if we wanted to draw it on
a number line-- let me draw a

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.750
number line just like that.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.510
That could be 0 and then
we have 1, so x could

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.390
be greater than 1.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.490
Not greater than or equal to.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.840
So we put a little circle
there to show that

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.570
we're not including 1.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.880
And everything greater than 1
will satisfy this equation.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.860
Or anything less than minus 2.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.930
So we have minus 1, minus 2,
anything less than minus 2 will

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:13.410
also satisfy this equation by
both making the numerator

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.490
and denominator negative.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.720
And you could try it out.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.940
Minus 3.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.390
Minus 3 minus 1.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.830
I'll just do minus 3 minus
1 is equal to minus 4.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.360
And then minus 3 plus 2.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.590
Minus 3 plus 2 is
equal to minus 1.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.830
Minus 4 divided by
minus 1 is positive 4.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.610
So all of these negative
numbers also work.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.120
Now, I told you that I
would show you two ways

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.650
of doing this problem.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.030
So let me show you another way
if you found this one maybe

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.810
a little bit confusing.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.440
So the other way-- let
me rewrite the problem.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:56.810
You get x minus 1 over x
plus 2 is greater than 0.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.590
And actually, let's mix it up
a little bit and you could

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.440
apply the same logic.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.950
Let's say it's greater than or
equal-- well, actually no.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.020
I'll just keep it the same way
and maybe in the next video

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.020
I'll do the case where it's
greater than or equal just

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.610
because I really don't want
to-- maybe I want to

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.100
incrementally step up the
level of difficulty.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.800
We're just saying x minus
1 over x plus 2 is just

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.100
straight up greater than 0.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.600
Now one thing you might say is
well, if I have a rational

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.060
expression like this, maybe I
multiply both sides of this

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.790
equation by x plus 2.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.490
So I get rid of it in the
denominator and I can

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.920
multiply it times 0 and
get it out of the way.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.700
But the problem is when you
multiply both sides of an

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.300
inequality by a number-- if
you're multiplying by a

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.610
positive you can keep the
inequality the same.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.820
But if you're multiplying by a
negative you have to switch the

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.140
inequality, and we don't
know whether x plus 2 is

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.340
positive or negative.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.700
So let's do both situations.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.710
Let's do one situation
where x plus 2-- let

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.840
me write it this way.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.180
x plus 2 is greater than 0.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.080
And then another situation
where-- let me do that

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.180
in a different color.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:05.270
Where x plus 2 is less than 0.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.380
These are the two
possibilities for x plus 2.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.700
Actually, in those situations
can x plus 2 equal 0?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.520
If x plus 2 were to be equal to
0 than this whole expression

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.380
would be undefined.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.480
And so that definitely won't
be a situation that we

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.610
want to deal with it.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.960
It would an undefined
situation.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.000
So these are our two situations
when we're multiplying

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.130
both sides.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.530
So if x plus 2 is greater
than 0 that means that x

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.690
is greater than minus 2.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.460
We can just subtract 2 from
both sides of this equation.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.920
So if x is greater than
minus 2, then x plus

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.330
2 is greater than 0.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.950
And then we can multiply
both sides of this

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.520
equation times x plus 2.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.380
So you have x minus 1 over
x plus 2 greater than 0.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.200
I'm going to multiply both
sides by x plus 2, which I'm

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.400
assuming is positive because
x is greater than minus 2.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.610
Multiply both sides
by x plus 2.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.640
These cancel out.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.390
0 times x plus 2 is it just 0.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.670
You're just left with x minus
1 is greater than-- this

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.770
just simplified to 0.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.690
Solve for x, add 1 to
both sides, you get

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.670
x is greater than 1.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.830
So we saw that if x plus 2 is
greater than 0, or we could

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.890
say, if x is greater than
minus 2, then x also has

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.390
to be greater than 1.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.860
Or you could say if x is
great-- well, you could

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.180
go both ways in that.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.510
But we say, look, both of
these things have to be true.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.380
If for x to satisfy both
of these, it just has

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.380
to be greater than 1.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.010
Because if it's greater
than 1 it's definitely

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.670
going to satisfy this
constraint over here.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.760
So for this branch we come
up with the solution

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.050
x is greater than 1.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.300
So this is one situation where
x plus 2 is greater than 0.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.240
The other situation is x
plus 2 being less than 0.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.960
If x plus 2 is less than 0
that's equivalent to saying

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.070
that x is less than minus 2.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.560
You just subtract 2
from both sides.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.510
Now, if x plus 2 is less than
0, what we'll have to do

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.630
when we multiply both
sides-- let's do that.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.690
We have x minus 1
over x plus 2.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.190
We have some inequality
and then we have a 0.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.420
Now if we multiply both
sides by x plus 2, x plus

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.890
2 is a negative number.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.640
When you multiply both
sides of an equation by a

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.430
negative number you have
to swap the inequality.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.150
So this greater than sign will
become a less than sign because

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.340
we're assuming that the
x plus 2 is negative.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.680
These cancel out.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.090
0 times anything is 0.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.220
We get that x minus
1 is less than 0.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.640
Solving for x, adding 1 to
both sides, x is less than 1.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.430
So in the case that x plus 2 is
less than 0 or x is less than

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.580
minus 2, x must be less than 1.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.780
Well, I mean we know-- if you
say something has to be less

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.030
than minus 2 and less than 1,
just saying that it's less

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.720
than minus 2 will do the job.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.220
Anything less than minus 2 is
going to satisfy this one.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.790
But not anything that satisfies
this one is going to

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.510
satisfy that one.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.520
So this is the only constraint
we have to worry about.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.160
So in the event where x plus 2
is less than 0, we can just

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.470
say that x has to be
less than minus 2.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.420
That'll satisfy this equation.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.750
So our final result is x is
either going to be greater

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.710
than 1 or x is going to
be less than minus 2.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.581
So once again, I can graph
it on the number line.

00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:25.120
x is greater than
1 right there.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.160
You have 0, minus 1, minus 2.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.840
And then you have x is less
than minus 2, you're not

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.290
including the minus 2.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.310
And just like that.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.080
And that is the exact same
result we got up here.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.290
So whichever version
you find to be easier.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.120
But you can see, they're both a
little bit nuanced and you have

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.340
to think a little bit about
what happens when you multiply

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.790
or divide by positive
or negative numbers.
