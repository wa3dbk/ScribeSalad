00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.960
We've got a few more molecular
structures to name, so let's

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.980
look at this first
one right here.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.840
The first thing you always want
to do is identify the

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.730
longest chain.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.030
If we start over here, we have
one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.260
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050
carbons, looks pretty long.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.040
Now what if we start
over here?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.240
This looks like it could also
be a long chain: one, two,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.900
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.600
twelve, thirteen.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.180
So we have two different chains,
depending on whether

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.730
we want to go up here or whether
we go over here, that

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.520
have a length of thirteen.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.340
So you're probably asking, which
chain do you choose?

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.360
You should always, if we have
two chains of equal lengths

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.860
and they're the longest chains,
you pick the one that

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.690
will have more branches or
more alkyl groups on it.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.250
So this group right here, if we
pick this from here to here

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.560
as our chain, we only have
one group on it,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.830
that group up there.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.970
If we pick this chain, starting
over here and then

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.550
going over here, we have
two groups on it.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.250
We would have this group over
here and then we would have

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.140
this group over here.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.540
This is the better chain
to use because it has

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.730
more groups on it.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.110
It has more groups,
but the groups

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.100
are smaller and simpler.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.550
So let's start counting.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.010
And the direction we want to
count, we always want to start

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.980
on the side of the chain where
we're going to encounter

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.060
something first, and everything
is closer this end

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.090
of the chain so we'll
start counting here.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:45.530
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.870
eleven, twelve, thirteen, so
we have thirteen carbons on

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.650
our main chain.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.880
Let me draw our main chain.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.830
So our main chain is this thing
in orange I'm drawing

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.320
right here.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.640
That is our main chain.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.220
Thirteen, that's
three and ten.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.380
The prefix is tridec- and it's
tridecane because we have all

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.960
single bonds here, so
it's tridecane.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.360
Tridecane is the main chain.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.200
Then we have two groups
over here.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.650
This one in green, this only has
one the carbon branching

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.070
off of the main chain, so it's
prefix will be meth- and it'll

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.310
be a methyl group, so
that is methyl.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.560
That is a methyl group
right there.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.980
Then this one down here, we have
one, two, three carbons.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.200
the prefix is prop-, so this
is a propyl group.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.660
And the methyl is sitting on the
three carbon of our main

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.920
chain and the propyl group is
sitting on the four carbon:

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.590
one, two, three, four.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.370
Now when we figure out what
order to list them in when we

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.830
actually write out the name,
M, we just do it in

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.270
alphabetical order.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.720
M comes before P, so we right
3-methyl before 4-propyl.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.540
The entire compound here is
or the entire molecule is

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:33.540
3-methyl-4-propyltridecane And
this is actually all going to

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.520
be one word.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.250
You use dashes to separate when
you have numbers, but if

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.860
you have a word followed by
a word, it just becomes

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.530
propyltridecane, so
3-methyl-4-propyltridecane.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.530
And we're done.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.710
Let's do this one down here.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.090
Now this one seems a little
bit more complex.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.510
The first thing to see is what
is the largest chain or the

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.280
largest ring that we have
in our structure?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.910
The two candidates, we have
this chain over here.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.030
This has one, two, three, four,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.590
five, six, seven carbons.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.930
Let's see how many carbons
our ring has.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:13.140
Our ring has one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.190
nine carbons.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.290
So the ring is the largest
core structure in this

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.390
molecule, so that will be
our core structure.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.200
We have nine carbons-- let me
highlight it-- so the ring is

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.896
this right here.

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:30.620
It has nine carbons.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.260
The prefix for nine is non-.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.290
It's all single bonds, so it's
nonane, and it is in a cycle.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.420
It's a ring, so it's
cyclononane.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.070
This part right here, that
part right there, is

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.320
cyclononane.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.970
We have several things that
branch off of the cyclononane,

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.010
so let's look at them one at a
time, and then we'll think

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.070
about how we're going to number
them on the ring.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.090
We looked already at this at
this chain that has seven

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:10.520
carbons: one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.150
So that is a heptyl group.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.650
This over here, let's see
what we're dealing with.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.570
We have one, two, three carbons,
so that is just a

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.170
standard propyl group.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:37.540
Then here, we have one, two,
three, four carbons, so we

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.410
could say this is
a butyl group.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.960
But this isn't just
any butyl group.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.360
If we use the common naming,
the carbon we immediately

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.760
touch on or that we immediately
get to when we go

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.030
off of our main ring, that
branches off into three other

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.000
carbons, so this is tert-,
tert- for three.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.620
The tert- is usually
written in italics.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.140
It's hard to differentiate
that when you see it.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.470
I'll write it in cursive.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.810
This is tert.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.260
This is a tertbutyl group.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.090
Now, the next question is how
do we specify where these

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.070
different groups sit
on this main ring?

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.500
If you just had one group, you
wouldn't have to specify it,

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.930
but when you have more than one,
what you actually do is

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.900
you figure out which one would
be alphabetically first, and

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.990
that would be number one.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.860
Now, we have an H in heptyl, a
P in propyl, and tert-butyl,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.250
you might say, well, do I use
the T or do I use the B?

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.770
And this is just the convention,
you use the B.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.790
If you have sec-butyl or
tert-butyl, you ignore the

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.980
sec- or the tert-.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.190
If this was an isobutyl or an
isopropyl, you actually would

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.200
use the I, so it's a little
bit-- I guess the best way to

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.800
think about it is there's a dash
here so you can kind of

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.990
ignore it, but if this was
isobutyl it would all be one

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.940
word, so you would
consider the I.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.830
So in this situation, we would
consider the B, and B comes

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.200
before P or an H, so that
is where we will

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.410
start numbering one.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.580
Then to figure out which
direction to keep numbering

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.360
in, we just go in the direction
where we're likely

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.360
to encounter the first or where
we will encounter the

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.180
first side chain, so we'll go
in this direction because we

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.240
get right to the propyl group.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:19.440
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.180
So this compound, we're going
to start with the

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.430
alphabetically first side chain,
so it's 1-tert-butyl.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.290
I'll write this in cursive.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.100
1-tert-butyl.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.490
Then the next one
alphabetically

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.810
is the heptyl group.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.680
That's H for heptyl, so
then it is 5-heptyl.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:08:00.520
And then we have the propyl, and
then it is 2-propyl, and

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:10.120
then finally cyclononane,
and we're done!
