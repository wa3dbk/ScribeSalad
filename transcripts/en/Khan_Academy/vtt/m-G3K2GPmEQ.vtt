00:00:00.498 --> 00:00:01.331
- [Instructor] Hey folks.

00:00:01.331 --> 00:00:03.189
In this video I wanna show you
something pretty interesting

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.367
about these Lagrange multipliers
that we've been studying.

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:08.555
So the first portion I'm just
gonna kind of get this set up,

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:11.172
which is a lot of review
from what we've seen already,

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:12.958
but I think you're really
gonna like where this is going

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.222
in the end.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.111
So one of the examples I
showed, and I think this is a

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:17.750
pretty nice prototypical example

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.002
for constrained optimization problems,

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:21.213
is that you're running a company

00:00:21.213 --> 00:00:23.772
and you have some kind of revenue function

00:00:23.772 --> 00:00:26.232
that's dependent on various choices

00:00:26.232 --> 00:00:27.301
you make in running the company,

00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:29.804
and I think I said the
number of hours of labor

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:32.310
you employ and the number
of tons of steel you use,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.970
you know, if you were
manufacturing something metallic.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.678
And, you know, this might be
modeled as some multivariable

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:39.513
function of h and s, right
now we don't really care

00:00:39.513 --> 00:00:40.879
about the specifics.

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.591
And you're trying to maximize this, right,

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:44.579
that's kind of the
whole point of this unit

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.063
that we've been doing, is
that you're trying to maximize

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:49.005
some function, but you have a constraint.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.716
This is the real world, you
can't just spend infinite money,

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:54.488
you have some kind of budget,
some sort of amount of money

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:57.472
you spend as a function of
those same choices you make,

00:00:57.472 --> 00:01:00.421
the hours of labor you employ,
the tons of steel you use.

00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:02.228
And this, again, it's gonna equal some

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.259
multivariable function
that tells you, you know,

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.064
how much money you spend
for a given amount of hours

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:08.761
and given number of tons of steel.

00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:10.715
And you set this equal to some constant,

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:14.431
this tells you the amount of
money you're willing to spend.

00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:16.857
And our goal has been to
maximize some function,

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:18.712
subject to a constraint like this.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:20.413
And the mental model you have in mind

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.485
is that you're looking in the input space,

00:01:22.485 --> 00:01:23.890
inside the x-y plane,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.889
or I guess really, it's the
h-s plane in this case, right.

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:29.408
Your inputs are h and s,
and points in this plane

00:01:29.408 --> 00:01:31.317
tell you possible choices you can make

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:33.670
for hours of labor and tons of steel.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.595
And you think of this budget

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.702
as some kind of curve
in that plane, right.

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:41.421
All the sets of h and s that equal $10,000

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:43.577
is gonna give you some kind of curve.

00:01:43.577 --> 00:01:45.135
And the core value we care about is that,

00:01:45.135 --> 00:01:46.774
when you maximize this revenue,

00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:48.407
you know, when you set
it equal to a constant

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:51.607
I'm gonna call M star, that's
like the maximum possible

00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:54.168
revenue, that's gonna give you a contour

00:01:54.168 --> 00:01:56.275
that's just barely tangent

00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:58.988
to the constraint curve.

00:01:58.988 --> 00:02:00.014
And if that seems unfamiliar,

00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:03.328
definitely take a look at the
videos preceding this one.

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:04.787
But, just to kind of continue the review,

00:02:04.787 --> 00:02:06.122
this gave us the really nice property

00:02:06.122 --> 00:02:08.744
that you look at the gradient vector

00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:11.167
for the thing you're
trying to maximize, R,

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:14.793
and that's gonna be proportional
to the gradient vector

00:02:14.793 --> 00:02:19.659
for the constraint function,
for this B, so gradient of B.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.543
And this is because
gradients are perpendicular

00:02:21.543 --> 00:02:22.474
to contour lines.

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:25.176
Again, this should feel mostly
like review at this point.

00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:29.990
So the core idea was that
we take this gradient of R,

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.929
and then make it proportional,
with some kind of

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.599
proportionality constant lambda,

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.178
to the gradient of B, to the gradient

00:02:37.178 --> 00:02:38.947
of the constraint function.

00:02:38.947 --> 00:02:41.893
And up till this point, this value lambda

00:02:41.893 --> 00:02:43.562
has been wholly uninteresting.

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:45.403
It's just been a
proportionality constant, right,

00:02:45.403 --> 00:02:47.612
because we couldn't guarantee
that the gradient of R

00:02:47.612 --> 00:02:49.411
is equal to the gradient of B.

00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:50.617
All we care about is that they're pointing

00:02:50.617 --> 00:02:51.893
in the same direction.

00:02:51.893 --> 00:02:53.959
So we just had this constant sitting here,

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.533
and all we really said is
make sure it's not zero.

00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:59.677
But here, we're gonna get
to where this little guy

00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:01.677
actually matters.

00:03:01.677 --> 00:03:03.359
So, if you'll remember, in the last video,

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.672
I introduced this function
called the Lagrangian,

00:03:06.672 --> 00:03:07.736
the Lagrangian.

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:09.018
And it takes in multiple inputs,

00:03:09.018 --> 00:03:11.234
they'll be the same inputs that you have

00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:13.605
for your budget function
and your revenue function,

00:03:13.605 --> 00:03:15.033
or more generally, the constraint

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:16.731
and the thing you're trying to maximize.

00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:18.961
It takes in those same variables,

00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:21.850
but, also, as another one of its inputs,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.596
it takes in lambda.

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:25.915
So, it is a higher-dimensional function

00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:28.854
than both of these two, because
we've got this extra lambda.

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:32.184
And the way it's defined looks
a little strange at first,

00:03:32.184 --> 00:03:34.690
it just seems kind of like this random

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.339
hodgepodge of functions
that we're putting together.

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:38.770
But, last time, I kind of walked through

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.747
why this makes sense.

00:03:39.747 --> 00:03:41.732
You take the thing you're
trying to maximize,

00:03:41.732 --> 00:03:44.305
and you subtract off this lambda,

00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:48.176
multiplied by the constraint function,

00:03:48.176 --> 00:03:50.426
which is B of those inputs,

00:03:51.802 --> 00:03:55.043
minus, and then whatever
this constant is here, right.

00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:56.956
I'm gonna give it a name,
I'm gonna call this constant

00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:58.132
lowercase b.

00:03:58.132 --> 00:04:00.352
So maybe we're thinking of it as $10,000,

00:04:00.352 --> 00:04:03.097
but it's whatever your actual budget is.

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:04.356
So we think of that, and I'm just gonna

00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:08.857
emphasize here that
that's a constant, right,

00:04:08.857 --> 00:04:12.153
that this b is being treated
as a constant right now.

00:04:12.153 --> 00:04:13.874
You know, we're thinking
of h and s and lambda

00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:16.564
all as these variables, and this gives us

00:04:16.564 --> 00:04:19.510
some multivariable function.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.494
And if you'll remember
from the last video,

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:24.323
the reason for defining this function

00:04:24.323 --> 00:04:26.875
is it gives us a really
nice compact way to solve

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:29.401
the constraint optimization problem.

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:32.507
You set the gradient of L equal to zero,

00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:34.444
or really the zero vector,
right, it'll be a vector

00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:36.655
with three components here.

00:04:36.655 --> 00:04:39.637
And when you do that, you'll
find some solution, right,

00:04:39.637 --> 00:04:44.324
you'll find some solution,
which I'll call h star,

00:04:44.324 --> 00:04:48.334
s star, and lambda, here
I'll give it that green

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:50.501
lambda color, lambda star.

00:04:55.116 --> 00:04:57.367
You'll find some value
that, when you input this

00:04:57.367 --> 00:05:00.832
into the function, the
gradient will equal zero.

00:05:00.832 --> 00:05:02.450
And, of course, you might
find multiple of these, right,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.059
you might find multiple
solutions to this problem,

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.352
but what you do is, for each
one of them you're gonna take

00:05:08.352 --> 00:05:11.568
a look at h star and s star,
then you're gonna plug those

00:05:11.568 --> 00:05:13.786
into the revenue function, or
the thing that you're trying

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:14.795
to maximize.

00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:17.199
And, typically, you only get
a handful, you get a number,

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.768
then you can actually
plug each one of them into

00:05:18.768 --> 00:05:21.196
the revenue function, and
you'll just check which one

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:22.908
of them makes this function the highest.

00:05:22.908 --> 00:05:25.436
And whatever the highest value
this function can achieve,

00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:29.333
that is M star, that is the
maximum possible revenue,

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:31.250
subject to this budget.

00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:34.785
But it's interesting that when
you solve this, you get some

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:37.918
specific value of lambda,
right, there's a specific

00:05:37.918 --> 00:05:41.529
lambda star that will be
associated with the solution.

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.659
And, like I said, this
turns out not to just be

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.336
some dummy variable.

00:05:45.336 --> 00:05:48.605
It's gonna carry information
about how much we can increase

00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:51.876
the revenue if we increase that budget.

00:05:51.876 --> 00:05:53.518
And, here, let me show you what I mean.

00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:57.876
So we've got this M star,
and I'll just write it again,

00:05:57.876 --> 00:05:59.306
M star here.

00:05:59.306 --> 00:06:01.716
And what that equals, I'm
saying that's the maximum

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:03.000
possible revenue.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.834
So that's gonna be the revenue
when you evaluate it at

00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:07.353
h star,

00:06:07.353 --> 00:06:08.853
h star and s star.

00:06:10.692 --> 00:06:13.365
And h star and s star, they
are whatever the solution

00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:18.018
to this gradient of the Lagrangian
equals zero equation is.

00:06:18.018 --> 00:06:20.092
You set this multivariable
function equal to the

00:06:20.092 --> 00:06:23.377
zero vector, you solve when
each of its partial derivatives

00:06:23.377 --> 00:06:26.202
equal zero, and you'll
get some kind of solution.

00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:28.103
So when you plug that
solution in the revenue,

00:06:28.103 --> 00:06:31.081
that gives you the
maximum possible revenue.

00:06:31.081 --> 00:06:33.981
But what we could do is
consider this as a function

00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:35.967
of the budget.

00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:38.542
Now, this is the kind of thing
that looks a little bit wacky

00:06:38.542 --> 00:06:40.831
if you're just looking at the formulas.

00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:42.619
But if you actually
think about what it means

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:44.880
in this context of kind
of a revenue and a budget,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.741
I think it's actually pretty sensible,

00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:50.212
where, really, if we consider
this b no longer to be

00:06:50.212 --> 00:06:52.464
constant but something that
you could change, right,

00:06:52.464 --> 00:06:55.169
you're wondering, well what
if I had a $20,000 budget,

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.283
or what if I had a $15,000 budget?

00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:59.608
You wanna ask the question,
what happens as you change

00:06:59.608 --> 00:07:00.850
this b.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.677
Well, the maximizing
value, h star and s star,

00:07:04.677 --> 00:07:08.596
each one of those guys is
gonna depend on b, right.

00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:11.422
As you change what this
constant is, it's gonna change

00:07:11.422 --> 00:07:13.950
the values at which the
gradient of the Lagrangian

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.633
equals zero.

00:07:15.633 --> 00:07:18.800
So, I'm gonna rewrite this function as

00:07:20.308 --> 00:07:23.226
the revenue evaluated
at h star and s star,

00:07:23.226 --> 00:07:25.352
but now I'm gonna consider
that h star and s star

00:07:25.352 --> 00:07:27.852
each as functions of b, right,

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:30.259
because they depend on it in some way.

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:33.065
As you change b, it changes
the solution to this problem

00:07:33.065 --> 00:07:35.238
It's very implicit and it's
kind of hard to think about.

00:07:35.238 --> 00:07:37.460
It's hard to think, okay,
as I change this b, how much

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.628
does that change h star.

00:07:38.628 --> 00:07:40.304
Well that depends on what the, you know,

00:07:40.304 --> 00:07:42.963
what the definition of R
was and everything there.

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:45.155
But, in principle, in this
context, I think it's quite

00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:45.988
intuitive.

00:07:45.988 --> 00:07:48.040
You have a maximum possible revenue,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.030
and that depends on what your budget is.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.075
So, what turns out to be a
beautiful, absolutely beautiful

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:56.075
magical fact

00:07:57.204 --> 00:07:59.204
is that this lambda star

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:03.472
is equal to the derivative of M star,

00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:08.820
the derivative of this
maximum possible revenue

00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:13.695
with respect to b, with
respect to the budget.

00:08:14.796 --> 00:08:17.002
And let me just show you what
that actually means, right.

00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:19.064
So if, for example, let's say you did

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:22.288
all of your calculations and
it turned out that lambda star

00:08:22.288 --> 00:08:23.705
was equal to 2.3.

00:08:25.112 --> 00:08:27.167
You know, previously that just
seemed like some dummy number

00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:29.214
that you ignore, and you
just look at whatever the

00:08:29.214 --> 00:08:30.935
associated values here are.

00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:33.041
But if you plug this in the
computer and you see lambda star

00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:37.665
equals 2.3, what that means is,
for a tiny change in budget,

00:08:37.665 --> 00:08:40.765
like let's say your budget
increases from 10,000

00:08:40.765 --> 00:08:43.515
to 10,001, it goes up to $10,001,

00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:48.848
you increase your budget by
just a little bit, a little db.

00:08:48.848 --> 00:08:51.896
Then the ratio of the change
in the maximizing revenue

00:08:51.896 --> 00:08:53.896
to that db is about 2.3.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.204
So what that would mean
is, increasing your budget

00:08:57.204 --> 00:09:00.330
by a dollar is gonna increase M star,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.573
over here it would mean
that M star increases

00:09:03.573 --> 00:09:05.656
by about, you know, $2.30

00:09:07.065 --> 00:09:09.261
for every dollar that
you increase your budget.

00:09:09.261 --> 00:09:10.940
And that's information
you'd wanna know, right?

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.840
If you see that this
lambda star is a number

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.279
bigger than one, you'd say,
hey, maybe we should increase

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.134
our budget.

00:09:16.134 --> 00:09:18.948
We increase it from $10,000
to 10,001 and we're making

00:09:18.948 --> 00:09:20.016
more money.

00:09:20.016 --> 00:09:22.866
So, maybe, as long as lambda
star is greater than one,

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:24.798
you should keep doing
whatever it takes to increase

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:26.273
that budget.

00:09:26.273 --> 00:09:28.927
So this fact is quite surprising, I think,

00:09:28.927 --> 00:09:31.488
and it seems like it totally
comes out of nowhere.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.225
So what I'm gonna do in the
next video is prove this to you,

00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:37.640
is prove why this is true,
why this lambda star value

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.879
happens to be the rate of
change for the maximum value

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:43.595
of the thing we're trying to maximize

00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:46.709
with respect to this constant,
with respect to whatever

00:09:46.709 --> 00:09:49.538
constant you set your
constraint function equal to.

00:09:49.538 --> 00:09:51.554
For right now, though, I
just want you to kind of

00:09:51.554 --> 00:09:54.461
try to sit back and digest
what this means in the context

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:56.665
of this specific economic example.

00:09:56.665 --> 00:09:58.644
And, even if you never
looked into the proof

00:09:58.644 --> 00:09:59.697
and never understood it there,

00:09:59.697 --> 00:10:02.181
I think this is an
interesting and even useful

00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:05.841
tidbit of knowledge to have
about Lagrange multipliers.

00:10:05.841 --> 00:10:07.174
So with that, I'll see
you in the next video.
