00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.680
We're on problem 32.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.650
What are the solutions to the
equation 1 plus 1 over x

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.080
squared is equal to 3 over x?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.310
So at first. This looks like
a pretty daunting equation.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.340
You have these x's in the
denominator and x squared in

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.240
the denominator.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.020
But I think we can simplify it
if we can just get rid of

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.250
these x squares in
the denominator.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.770
The easiest way to do
that is to multiply

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.530
everything by x squared.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.050
So let's multiply both sides of
this equation by x squared.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.340
Then we'll get x squared times
1 is x squared, x squared

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.780
times 1 over x squared,
that's just 1.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.890
Then x squared times 3 over x,
that's 3x squared over x.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.350
x squared divided by x is just
x, so that is equal to 3x.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.700
We can subtract 3x from both
sides and you get x squared

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.450
minus 3x plus 1 is equal to 0.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.810
This is a simple quadratic.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.250
It's not obvious that
you can factor it.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.690
In fact, two numbers when you
multiply them equal 1, and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.040
then when you add them
equal minus 3.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.670
I'm guessing it might
even be imaginary.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.110
It will probably not be
imaginary, but it's just a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.900
strange number.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.230
So let's use the quadratic
equation.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.260
When in doubt, use the
quadratic equation.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.750
So minus B, this is B right?

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.900
B is this 3 right there,
negative 3.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.690
B is negative 3.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.480
So minus B is going to be plus
3, plus or minus the square

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.240
root of B squared.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.940
Minus 3 squared is 9, minus 4
times A, which is 1, times C

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.480
which is 1.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.060
So it's minus 4, all
of that over 2A.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.740
A is 1 so it's just over 2.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.080
That is equal to 3/2 plus
or minus the square

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.130
root of 5 over 2.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.990
I just separated these out
because I'm looking at the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.390
choices and it seems
like they did that.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.770
So you could've said that's 3/2
plus square root of 5 over

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.390
2 or 3/2 minus the square
root of 5 over 2.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.860
I just did that because
it seems like that's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.250
how they write it.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.840
That is choice A.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.870
Next problem, 33.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.840
I think this one actually might
be good to copy and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.510
paste the problem.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.230
Let me see if I can do this.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.330
OK, there are two numbers with
the following properties.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.450
Let me write down the properties
and let me copy and

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.720
paste it for you.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.410
OK, I've copied it.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.350
Let me go here.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.010
Then I've pasted it for you.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.260
All right.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.370
So there's two numbers with
the following properties.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.740
The second number is 3 more
than the first number.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.180
So let's say S for second number
and F for first number.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.490
So the second number is 3 more
than the first number.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.680
So the second number is equal
to the first number plus 3.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.570
That's from statement 1.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.950
The product of the two numbers
is 9 more than the sum.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:07.450
So the product of the two
numbers, that's S times F is 9

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:15.290
more, 9 plus their sum,
plus S plus F.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.180
So let's see, we have two
equations and two unknowns.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.380
This is nonlinear because I'm

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.000
multiplying these two variables.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.070
But I think we should be
able to solve them

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.690
one way or the other.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.730
So let's see, we have
what S is equal to.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.440
So let's just substitute that
back into this equation.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.350
So let's say that S is
equal to F plus 3.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:41.340
So if we substitute for these
S's, we get F plus 3 times F

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.990
is equal to 9 plus F plus 3,
right, instead of an S, F plus

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.772
3 and then plus F.

00:03:49.772 --> 00:03:51.450
Let's see if we can
simplify this.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.460
F times F is F squared plus
3F is equal to 9 plus

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.730
3 is 12 plus 2F.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.740
Subtract 2F from both sides,
you get F squared plus F is

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.180
equal to 12.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.000
Subtract 12, you get F squared
plus F minus 12 is equal to 0.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.380
This one looks factorable.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.510
I don't have to take out
the quadratic equation.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:30.170
Let's see, this is F plus 4
times F minus 3, right?

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.510
Because when you multiply those,
you get negative 12.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.400
When you add those, you get plus
1, so that is equal to 0.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.420
So in order for this to be true,
one or both of these

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.500
have to be equal to 0.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.870
So if F plus 4 is equal to
0, that means F could be

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.520
equal to minus 4.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.500
If F minus 3 is equal
to 0, then that says

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.690
that F could be 3.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.810
So F could be minus 4 or 3.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.710
Now, S is F plus 3, so if we're
dealing with the minus 4

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.730
scenario, if F is equal to
minus 4, then what is S?

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.940
Then S is going to be minus 4
plus 3, and S is going to be

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.390
equal to minus 1.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.090
Then if F is equal to 3,
than S is equal to 6.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.010
So let's see if we see either
of these combinations.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.900
Minus 4, minus 1,
that's choice B.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.040
Excellent.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.890
All right, problem 34.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.400
Let me see, maybe I should
copy and paste these word

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.460
problems so we can see how we
parse the problems. So I've

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.320
copied it, then I'll go here,
and then pasted it.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.020
Jenny is solving the equation x
squared minus 8x equals 9 by

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.470
completing the square.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.910
What number should be added to
both sides of the equation to

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.660
complete the square?

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.280
So x squared minus
8x is equal to 9.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.600
I wrote it with space
for a reason.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.420
When you're completing the
square, you're trying to turn

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.700
the left-hand side of this
equation into some type of a

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.650
perfect square.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.590
So if it's a perfect square,
I have two numbers.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.880
It's the same number that when
you add them together, you get

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.810
minus 8, and when you square
them, you should get something

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.470
else, right?

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.410
So what's half of minus 8?

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.270
Half of minus 8 is minus 4.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.430
So minus 4 squared is 16.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.830
So if I add 16 to both
sides, I'm all set.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.470
Why did that work?

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.460
Well, now it's a
perfect square.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.940
This is now x minus 4 squared
is equal to 9 plus 16 is 25.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.400
They're not even asking
us to solve it.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.070
They just want to know what we
had to add to both sides.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.990
So it's 16, D.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.310
Remember the whole logic here,
and I've done a few videos on

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.030
completing the squares, is what
number do I add here to

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.980
make this a perfect square?

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.470
You say, OK, I have a minus
8x, so I take half of this

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.540
number, because the same number
added to itself twice

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.590
is going to become minus 8.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.375
I take half of that number,
then I squared it.

00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:00.120
So half of minus 8 is minus 4.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.990
If you square it,
you get the 16.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.420
So add 16 to both sides,
you get this.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.420
You can actually
solve for this.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.070
x minus 4 is plus or minus 5.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.110
You keep going.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.070
That's actually where the
quadratic equation comes from.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.140
Anyway, next problem.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:20.980
16 was choice number D.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.950
I'm going to copy and paste
this entire problem here.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.810
Let's go here and
paste it here.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.660
OK, which of the following most
accurately describes the

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.810
translation of the graph y is
equal to x plus 3 squared

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.555
minus 2 to the graph y equals
x minus 2 squared plus 2?

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:50.090
So the y translation tends to be
pretty easy to figure out.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.610
Let me just draw some
example graph.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.190
So if I had the graph x squared,
the graph x squared

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.540
looks something like this.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.840
Let's see if I can draw it.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.980
The graph x squared looks
something like this, right?

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.790
And it intersects.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.330
When x is equal to 0, we're
at our minimum point.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.210
And any other value increases
in both directions.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:16.150
The graph of x squared plus
2, you're shifting up.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.870
This is the graph of
x squared plus 2.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.030
You would shift it up by 2.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.420
The graph of x squared minus 2,
you would shift down by 2.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.210
This would be x squared
plus 2.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.500
This would be x squared
minus 2.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.110
So the shift in the y direction
is very easy to see.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:44.760
So if we're going from something
minus 2 to plus 2

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.110
we're going to be shifting
it up 4, right?

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.710
So that's always the
easy one to just

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.120
eyeball and figure out.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.920
So we're definitely going to be
shifting from minus 2 to 2.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.860
So it's up 4.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.520
It's either going to be
choice A or choice D.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.270
The left/right shift is often
a little bit more hard for

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.400
people to visualize or to at
least internalize, but I'll

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.240
give you an attempt.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.100
Let's just go back to this.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.300
This is the graph of x squared,
this yellow line

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.920
right there.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.280
That's the graph of x squared.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.120
Let me ask you a question.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.820
What is the graph of
x minus 3 squared?

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.040
So does this shift it down 3 to
the negative direction or 3

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.660
to the positive direction?

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.290
Your intuition might say,
oh, I'm subtracting 3.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.130
When I did minus 2,
I shifted down.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.840
But it's actually the
opposite here.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.230
Because you have to think about
for what value of x am I

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.540
going to have a 0
squared here?

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.100
That happens with
x is equal to 3.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.200
So you can think
of it this way.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.190
Now, when we're at this point,
when x is equal to 3, it's the

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.650
same thing as this point when
we have just x squared.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.480
When you put 3 in here, this
whole expression becomes zero.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.610
As you get above 3, that's
like going above zero.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.370
As you go below 3, that's
like going below zero.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:07.090
So this graph will just get
shifted to the right by 3.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.242
That's x minus 3 shifts
to the right by 3.

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:14.410
x plus three would go in the
other direction, because when

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.870
x is minus 3, that's when
it would equal to zero.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.580
I haven't written that down.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.400
So let's think about this.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:25.640
We're going from x plus 3, so if
this is x squared, x plus 3

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.100
would look something-- let me do
it in a different color. x

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.410
plus 3 is actually shifted
to the left.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.630
The way I always think about
it, there's two ways

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.990
to think about it.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.390
The y shift is intuitive and
the x shift might not be.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.510
If you have a plus 3 here,
you're actually shifting in

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.070
the downward direction.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.430
The way to actually think about
the intuition is when

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.570
will this whole expression
equal 0?

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.740
This whole expression equals 0
when x is equal to minus 3.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.630
So that's the point at which
you're getting 0 squared.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.080
When I'm drawing these
graphs, I'm not

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.770
doing the y shift here.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.350
So this is going to be shifted
to the left 3.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.250
This is going to be shifted
to the right by 2.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.810
So if this is shifted to the
left 3 and this is shifted to

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.700
the right by 2, to go from this
to this, you're shifting

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.950
to the right by 5.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.000
So the actual graph x plus
3 squared minus 2

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.500
is going to be here.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.710
Then to go here, you have a plus
2, so you're shifting the

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.970
graph up by 4, and then you're
going to x minus 2.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.100
So this graph right here
is going to be up here.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.550
So you're shifting up by 4 and
then you're shifting to the

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.640
right by 5.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.180
Actually, even if you're
confused with your shifting

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.740
left or right, you can just
say the difference between

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.110
plus 3 and minus 2 is 5,
and 5 is only there.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.440
But you should hopefully
understand the problems a

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.800
little bit deeper than that.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.400
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
