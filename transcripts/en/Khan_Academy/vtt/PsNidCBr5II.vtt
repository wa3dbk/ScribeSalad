00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.490
In the last video, we showed
you the Cauchy-Schwarz

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.740
Inequality.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.395
I think it's worth rewriting
because this is something

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:16.530
that's going to show up a lot.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.570
It's a very useful tool.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.220
And that just told us if I have
two vectors, x and y,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.120
they're both members of Rn.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.390
And they're both nonzero
vectors.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.650
And that was an assumption we
had to make when we did the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.970
proof, otherwise there was a
potential of dividing by one

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.530
of their magnitudes.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500
So that would've been
a big no-no.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.830
But if we assume that they're
both nonzero, then we can say

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.990
that the absolute value of their
dot products is going to

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.970
be less than or equal
to the products of

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.740
their individual lengths.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.760
So that's the length of vector x
and we defined that a couple

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.730
of videos ago.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.890
And then this is the
length of vector y.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.870
And of course, this is just a
regular number and then each

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.209
of these are just
regular numbers.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.190
They're not vectors once
you take a length.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.780
The length of a 50 dimensional
vector could just

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.940
be the number 3.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.340
It's just a scalar value.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.190
So this is just scalar
multiplication here.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.710
And we also learned that the
only time that this inequality

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.310
turns into an equality is the
situation where x is equal to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.040
some scalar multiple of y.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.040
And so in some textbooks you'll
say-- and this has to

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.240
be a nonzero scalar multiple.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.190
But that's a bit obvious.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.800
I told you that x and
y are nonzero.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.910
So if this was 0 then
x would be 0.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.800
And we already said
that x is not 0.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.180
But if you want to say there you
could say that you know c

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.440
also is going to be nonzero.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.040
But that essentially
just falls out of

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.050
this information there.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.770
But if this is the case and if
and only if this is the case,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.550
then we can say that the
absolute value of the dot

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.490
product of the two vectors
is equal to the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.110
product of their lengths.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.220
Now, this is all just
a review of what I

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.729
did in the last video.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.850
Now what else can we do
that's useful with it?

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.030
So let's just play around
a little bit.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.890
I can't claim to be
experimenting, I know where

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.560
this is going to go.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.710
Let's see what happens
if I were to take the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.690
length of x plus y.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.240
So I'm going to add the two
vectors and then take the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.910
length of that vector squared.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.420
Well we know from a couple of
videos ago that the length

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.650
squared can also be rewritten as
the dot product of a vector

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.140
with itself.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.880
This right here, x
plus y, I know it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.860
looks like two vectors.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.820
But it's two vectors added
to each other.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.700
So it's really a vector. x
plus y is a real vector.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.560
I could graph x plus y.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.980
So the length of x plus y
squared, I can rewrite it as

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.010
the dot product of that
vector with itself.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.870
So x plus y dot x plus y.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.940
And all of these are vectors.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.240
These aren't just numbers.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.320
And this is the dot product.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.220
It's just not normal
multiplication.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.320
But we saw two videos ago that
the dot product has the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.920
distributive and the
associative and the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.210
commutative properties just
like regular scalar

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.280
multiplication.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.930
So you can kind of FOIL this out
if that's how you remember

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.940
multiplying your binomials.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.150
Or I will think of it more as
just doing the distributive

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.370
property twice.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.230
So this can be rewritten
as x dot x.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.160
Actually, let me write it as
the distributive property

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.690
because that's sometimes not
obvious to a lot of people.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.640
So let me write this x as a
yellow x and let me write this

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.790
whole term as x plus y.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.550
So this right here can be
rewritten as x dot-- so this x

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.620
dot this x plus y.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.270
And then it would be plus
this y dot-- I want

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.470
to just switch colors.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.440
Plus this y dot x plus y.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.100
It's good to see that when
you're multiplying these,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.650
you're just applying the
distributive property.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.630
All I did is I distributed this
term along each of these

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.430
terms into sum right here.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.780
So then I got this.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.240
And then I can distribute each
of these into the sum.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.990
So then this becomes-- I'll be
careful with the colors-- x

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:38.580
dot x plus x dot y.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.070
Maybe this was a little bit
overkill, but I think it's

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.030
good to see that this isn't
just some magic here.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.560
And we're just using the exact
properties that we proved with

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.680
the dot product.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.190
So that's that right there.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.655
And then it's plus y dot x.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:06.350
Plus this yellow y
dot the yellow x.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.100
Sorry, dot the blue y.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.200
So the magnitude or the length
of our vector x plus y squared

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.780
can be rewritten like this.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.390
And I'll just switch
back to one color.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.300
So this equals that and all of
that-- what does this equal?

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.850
This is equal to x dot x.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.300
What's x dot x?

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.216
x dot x is just the magnitude.

00:05:32.216 --> 00:05:35.490
So let me write this is just
equal to the magnitude

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.740
of our vector x.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.200
I should stop using the
word magnitude.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.100
The length of our vector
x squared.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.930
And then I have two
terms here.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.100
I have an x dot y
and a y dot x.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.830
We know that x dot y and y dot
x are really the same thing.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.150
We showed that order doesn't
matter when you take the dot

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.750
product, just like it doesn't
matter with regular

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.830
multiplication.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.400
So these are really the same
terms. So we could write plus

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.430
2 times x dot y.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.830
And then finally, we have that
last term sitting here.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.640
We have this y dot y.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.800
y dot y is the same thing
as the length of

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.080
our vector y squared.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.530
Now, let's see if we can break
out our Cauchy-Schwarz

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.010
Inequality.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.360
Or maybe Schwarz, I don't know
if I'm pronouncing it right.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.972
But x dot y.

00:06:33.972 --> 00:06:39.250
t We have the absolute value
of x dot y here.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:46.100
But we know that just x dot y is
going to be-- it has to be

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.760
less than or equal to the
absolute value of x dot y.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.780
Why is that?

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.370
Well this could be negative.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.910
I could show you
examples of dot

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.050
products that are negative.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.620
In fact, if x has all positive
terms and y has all negative

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.740
terms, you're going to have
a negative dot product.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.170
So this could be negative
or it could be positive.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.650
If it's positive the absolute
value-- their

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.750
equal to each other.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.130
If this is negative, than this
absolute value is definitely

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.690
going to be greater than it.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.040
We can add to the Cauchy-Schwarz
Inequality and

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.300
this is a bit obvious.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:27.310
We could say look, we could add
a little x dot y is less

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.890
than or equal to the absolute
value of x dot y.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.890
Which is less than or equal to
the length of x times the

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.160
length of y.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:42.580
So x dot y is definite-- this,
the dot product of x with y is

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.940
definitely less than it's
absolute value of that.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.740
Which is definitely less than
the lengths of those two

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.900
multiplied.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.870
So if I rewrite this, this
statement right here is

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:02.830
definitely less than or equal
to this exact statement.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.430
But if I replace these with the
lengths of the vectors.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.720
So that is definitely less than
or equal to-- I'm just

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.470
rewriting this x squared and
I'll write the plus 2 there.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.200
Plus 2.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.110
But I want to make it very clear
what I'm replacing here.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.790
And then I have the
plus length of my

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.280
vector y there squared.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.610
Now this I'm saying, this is
definitely less than the

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.100
absolute value of x dot y.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.400
Which is definitely less, by the
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.770
definitely less than the product
of the two lengths.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.880
So I'm just replacing this
with the product

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.740
of their two lengths.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:55.730
So I'm going to put the length
of x times the length of y.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.420
And since this is the
same as that, this

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.310
is the same as that.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.740
But this is definitely
less than this.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.140
This whole term has to be less
than this whole term.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.510
Now let me just remind you
what we were doing.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.860
I said that this thing that I
wrote over here, this is the

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.100
same as that.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.690
So this thing up here, which is
the same as that, which is

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.050
less than that also.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:23.030
So we can write that the
magnitude of x plus y squared

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.500
and not the magnitude, the
length of the vector x plus y

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.030
squared is less than
this whole thing

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.240
that I wrote out here.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.850
Or less than or equal to.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.220
Now, what is this thing?

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.900
Remember, I mean this might look
all fancy with my little

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.840
double lines around
everything.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.210
But these are just numbers.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.070
This length of x squared,
this is just a number.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.440
Each of these are numbers and I
can just say hey, look, this

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.770
looks like a perfect
square to me.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.510
This term on the right-hand side
is the exact same thing

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:57.913
as the length of x plus
the length of y.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.690
Everything squared.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.000
If you just squared this out
you'll get x squared plus 2

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.325
times the length of x times the

00:10:10.325 --> 00:10:12.580
length of y plus y squared.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:23.450
So our length of the vector x
plus y squared is less than or

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.500
equal to this quantity
over here.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.020
And if we just take the square
root of both sides of this,

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:33.820
you get the length of our vector
x plus y is less than

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:42.560
or equal to the length of the
vector x by itself plus the

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.800
length of the vector y.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.470
And we call this the triangle
inequality, which you might

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.865
have remembered from geometry.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.270
Now why is it called the
triangle inequality?

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.430
Well you could imagine
each of these to be

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.520
separate side of a triangle.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.600
In fact, let's draw it.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.190
We can draw this in R2.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.225
Let me turn my graph paper on.

00:11:08.225 --> 00:11:10.710
Let me see where the
graphs show up.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.170
If I turn my graph paper
on right there, maybe

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.420
I'll draw it here.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.540
So let's draw my vector x.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.260
So let's say that my vector x
look something like this.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.730
Let's say that's my vector x.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.610
It's a vector 2, 4.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.860
So that's my vector x.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.810
And let's say my vector y-- well
I'm just going to do it

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.130
head to tail because I'm
going to add the two.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.420
So my vector y-- I'm going to do
it in nonstandard position.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.690
Let's say it's look something
like-- let's say my vector y

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.330
looks something like this.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.430
Draw it properly.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.680
That's my vector y.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.060
What does x plus y look like?

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.330
And remember, I can't
necessarily draw any two

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.020
vectors on a two-dimensional
space like this.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.470
I'm just assuming that
these are in R2.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.986
But this is just to
give you the idea.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.500
So then this is their
sum, right?

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.490
You took from the tail of
x to the head of y.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.260
So this vector right here
is the vector x plus y.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.000
And that's why it's called
the triangle inequality.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.340
It's just saying that look, this
thing is always going to

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.370
be less than or equal to-- or
the length of this thing is

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.680
always going to be less than or
equal to the length of this

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.160
thing plus the length
of this thing.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.980
And that's kind of obvious
when you just learn

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.250
two-dimensional geometry.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.880
That look, this is a much more
efficient way of getting from

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.860
this point to this point
than going out here and

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.200
then going out here.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.850
And then, what's the case in
which this length is equal to

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:47.880
these lengths?

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.280
Well if you keep flattening this
triangle out and you go

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.510
to the extreme case where
maybe the vector

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.760
x looks like this.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:03.870
And if the vector y is just
kind of going in the exact

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.630
same-- vector y is going in
the exact same direction,

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.880
maybe it's going a little
bit further.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.790
This is vector x, this
is vector y.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.120
Now x plus y will just
be this whole vector.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.770
Now that whole thing
is x plus y.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.070
And this is the case now where
you actually-- where the

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.330
triangle inequality turns
into an equality.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.480
That's why that little
equal sign is there.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.460
The extreme case where

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.560
essentially, x and y are collinear.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.780
And why does that work out?

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.225
We can even go back to our
math and understand that.

00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:41.950
So let me turn my graph off.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.220
We can go back to
our math here.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.050
If I go back to this point,
remember, right here I made

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.760
the statement, look, this thing
is definitely less than

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.180
this thing over here.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.050
But what if I made
an assumption?

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:04.480
What if I said that x is equal
to some scalar times y?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.930
And actually, I have to be
careful because just some

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:12.420
scalar times y-- remember, our
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality said

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:18.290
that look, the inequality turns
into an equality if x is

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.810
some nonzero scalar of y.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.070
And then we can apply this.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.300
We can say that the absolute
value of x dot y is the same

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.440
as this over here.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.600
But I don't have the absolute
value of x dot y here.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.960
I don't know that this
is positive.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.340
I can say definitively that this
is a positive quantity

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.280
because I took the absolute
value of it.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.090
No absolute value here.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.450
So the only way that I can
assure that this is a positive

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.430
quantity, that this is the same
thing as the absolute

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.500
value of x dot y is to enforce--
if I'm kind of going

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.370
to go down this road, is to
enforce that this term right

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.740
here, that c be positive.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:58.890
Because if c is positive, then
x dot y, if x dot y then that

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:04.840
would be the same thing
as cy dot y.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.720
Which we know is just the same
thing as c times the magnitude

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.440
of y squared.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.770
And the only way that I can
ensure that this expression

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:18.340
right here is equal to the
absolute value of x dot y, the

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.830
only way I can assure this
is that c is positive.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.280
If c is negative, then this is
going to be a negative number

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.270
while this is a positive.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:30.690
So if I assume that this is
positive, then I can say that

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:36.590
x dot y is equal to the absolute
value of x dot y.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.170
And since it's a scalar
multiple, then I could say

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.820
that that term is equal to, not
just less than or equal

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.490
to, the magnitude
of x's and y's.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.660
So hopefully I'm not
confusing you.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.650
So all I'm saying is, if I can
assume that x is some positive

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.430
scalar multiple of y,
that this wouldn't

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.730
be a less than sign.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.300
Then I could say that x dot
y is the same thing as the

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.500
absolute value of x dot y
since this is positive.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.470
And if it's the same thing as
the absolute value of x dot y

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.480
and it's some scalar multiple
of each other, than we could

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.430
go down this other route.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.850
We could say that this
thing here-- I don't

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.700
want to get too messy.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.980
We could say that this
is equal to that.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.350
If this is equal to that, then
this would have become an

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.460
equal sign, not a less than
or equal to sign.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.770
And then we would have had the
limiting case-- I don't want

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:25.560
to call it the limiting case.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.920
But we could say that x plus y--
we would've done the same

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.080
work, but we would've had an
equal sign the whole way.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.620
Would equal the length of x.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.070
The length of x plus y would
equal the length of x plus the

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:42.030
length of y in the situation
where x is equal to some

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.930
positive scalar times y.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:48.480
So c is greater than 0.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.200
These two imply each other.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.060
And we saw that geometrically.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.820
I lost my axes here, but we see
that the only time that

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.795
the length of x plus y is equal
to the length of x plus

00:16:59.795 --> 00:17:02.550
the length of y is when
they're collinear.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.720
Over here this plus this is
clearly-- you can just

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.079
visually look at it-- longer
than this right there.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.930
So you might be saying Sal,
once again, this linear

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.440
algebra's a little bit silly.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.250
We learned the triangle
inequality in

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.700
eighth or ninth grade.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.300
Why did you go through all of
this pain to redefine it?

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.800
And this is the interesting
thing.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.750
What I just drew here and this
is what you learned in ninth

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.290
grade geometry.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.890
This is just in R2.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:31.085
This is just your Cartesian
coordinates, or I don't want

00:17:31.085 --> 00:17:33.120
to use the word dimension too
much because we're going to

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.870
define that formally.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.290
But this is kind of your
two-dimensional space

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.900
that's going on.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.440
What's interesting or what's
useful about linear algebra

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.890
is, we've just defined the
triangle inequality for

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:49.930
arbitrarily large vectors,
or vectors that have an

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.810
arbitrarily high number
of components.

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:56.170
Each of these, these don't
have to be in R2.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:00.830
This is true if we're in R100
where every vector has a

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.500
hundred components to it.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.270
We've just defined some notion
of the triangle inequality.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.790
We've abstracted well beyond
just our two-dimensional

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:10.800
Cartesian coordinates.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.380
Well beyond even our three
dimensions to essentially, n

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.210
dimensional space.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.770
And I haven't defined dimensions
yet, but I think

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.400
you're starting to appreciate
what they are.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.400
But anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.165
We can now take this result.

00:18:26.795 --> 00:18:31.190
And actually, that result with
this result and define what

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.910
the notion of an angle between
two vectors are.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.010
Once again, you know, on some
levels you're like well, why

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.640
do we have to define an angle?

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.480
Isn't an angle just-- isn't
that just an angle?

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.510
Well yeah, we know what an angle
is in two dimensions,

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.510
but what does an angle mean when
you abstract things to n

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.270
dimensions?

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.580
Or when you're in Rn.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.550
So that's what we'll talk
about in the next video.
