00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.690
In the last video, I started
with this matrix right here,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.980
and right from the get go, we
said the span of this matrix

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.530
is just the span of the column
vectors of it, and I just

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.240
wrote it right there.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.740
But we weren't clear whether
this was linearly independent,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.760
and if it's not linearly
independent, it won't be a

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.050
sufficient basis.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.880
And then we go off and
we figure out the

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.360
null space of A.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.140
We find out that the null space
of A contains more than

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.860
just the zero vector.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.870
It's just the span of these two
vectors here, which means

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.150
that these columns are not
linearly independent.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.180
We saw that several
videos ago.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.140
And we used that information
that they're not linearly

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.370
independent to try to make them
linearly independent by

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.830
getting rid of the
redundant ones.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.610
So we were able to get rid of
this guy and this guy, because

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.140
these were essentially the
columns associated with the

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.990
free variables.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.500
And we were able to do it using
this little technique

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.370
down here, where we set one of
these equal to 0, the other

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.830
one equal to negative
1 and then solved

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.140
for the pivot variables.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.890
And then we set the other one
equal to 0 and the other one

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.700
equal to negative 1 and solved
for the pivot variables.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.470
And you could imagine
that this is a

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.390
generalizable process.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.890
If you have a bunch of free
variables, you can set all of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
them but one to equal 0, and
then that one that you didn't

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.090
set to 0, you set it to
equal negative 1.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.960
And you can express it as a sum
of the pivot variables,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.280
where the pivot variables are a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.660
function of the free variables.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.700
In general, this would be
a quick way of doing it.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.910
We had to do it more
slowly over here.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.590
If I have some matrix A, and I
want to figure out the basis

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.220
for the column space, the column
space is just the span

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.960
of these, but if I wanted a
linearly independent basis, I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.920
need to figure out some set
of these that are linearly

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.880
independent.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.010
What I can do is put this guy
into reduced row echelon form.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.500
When I put them in reduced row
echelon form, and I did that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.700
over here, this is the reduced
row echelon form of A, I can

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.280
look at the variables
that are associated

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.380
with the pivot entries.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.360
So this is x1.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.320
Let me scroll up a little bit.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.479
This is associated
with x1, right?

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.160
When you multiply this times x1,
you get this column times

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.580
x1, this column times x2, this
column times x3, this column

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.950
times x4 like that.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.570
When you look at just regular A,
when you look at just your

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.990
matrix A, it's the same thing.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.100
If you were to write Ax equal
to 0, this column would be

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.380
associated with x1, this column
would be associated

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.350
with x2, x3 and x4 like that.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.290
What you can do is you put it
in reduced row echelon form.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.390
You say which columns have
my pivot entries or are

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.765
associated with pivot
variables?

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:43.830
You say, OK, x1 and x2 are
associated with pivot

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.730
variables, or they are the pivot
variables, and they're

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.930
associated with these first
two columns, and so those

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.640
first two columns would be a
basis for the column space.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.810
How did I get this?

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.660
Am I just making up
things on the fly?

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.630
Well, no!

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.650
It all comes from the reality
that you can always construct

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.100
a situation where the vectors
associated with the free

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.830
variables you can write them as
linear combinations of the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.640
vectors associated with the
pivot variables, and we did a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.630
special case of that
last time.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.540
But a very quick and dirty way
of doing it, and I don't know

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.260
if it's actually dirty, is just
take your matrix, put it

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.050
in it reduced row echelon form,
and you say, look, this

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.920
column and this column
are associated

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.310
with my free variables.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.200
Therefore, this column and this
column must be associated

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.610
with my free variables.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.910
The solution sets are the same
to Ax equal to 0 or the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.330
reduced row echelon form
of Ax is equal to 0.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.040
So they're the same.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.810
So if this column and this
column are associated with

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.970
free variables, so are this
column and this column, which

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.590
means that they can be expressed
just by judiciously

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.930
selecting your values of your
free variables as linear

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.730
combinations of the columns
associated with the pivot

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.470
variables, with the pivot
entries, which are that column

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.140
and that column.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.070
So this column and this column
would be a basis for

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.500
A, and we see that.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.959
We see that all the
way down here.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.860
1, 2, 3 and 1, 1, 4, We did a
lot of work and we got all the

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.170
way there, and we said this
is a basis for the

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.860
column span of A.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.180
Now, doing all of that work,
let's see if we can actually

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.630
visualize what the column
space of A looks like.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.840
I have a strange feeling I might
have said column span a

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.800
couple of times, but the
column space, what

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.310
does it look like?

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.800
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.480
what it looks like.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.990
One way is we can say, look,
this span this is 2-- that's a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.720
member of R3.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.800
That's a vector in R3 and
this is a vector in R3.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:07.070
Let me draw my x, z and-- well,
normally it's drawn--

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.920
this is normally y, x, and
z-axes in R3, if I'm want to

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.270
represent them as
three-dimensional space.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.050
Then the vector 1, 2, 3 might
look like this where it's one,

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.980
one, two, one, two, three,
so we go out one down

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.930
here, then up three.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.900
So the vector will look like
that in its standard form.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.340
That's that one right there.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.670
And the vector 1, 1, 4 would be
one, one and go up four, so

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.710
it might look something
like this.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.600
It's hard to actually draw
them very well in three

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.230
dimensions, but you
get the idea.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.690
But the column space is the span
of these, so all of the

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.630
linear combinations
of these two guys.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.860
So all of the linear
combinations of these two guys

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.380
are going to create
a plane that

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.140
contains these two vectors.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.670
If you just sum these guys up in
multiple combinations, you

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.000
can get any vector up there.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.280
If you just add them
up, you'll get that

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.100
vector right there.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.480
If you add this guy plus 2 times
that, you'll get some

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.550
vector up here.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.890
So if you view them as position
vectors, they'll

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.490
essentially form
a plane in R3.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.220
But let's see if we can get the
equation for that plane.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.700
Well, how can we do that?

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.990
Well, we know that we can figure
out the equation of a

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.080
plane based on the fact that
a normal vector dotted with

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.490
any-- let me write my normal
vector like this.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:29.440
The normal vector dotted with
any position vector specifying

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.870
a position on the plane.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:37.800
So let me call that x minus any
point on the plane or any

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.020
vector position on the plane.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:45.720
So I could do that minus
the vector 1, 2, 3 has

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.000
to be equal to 0.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.140
And we can use this information
to figure out the

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.270
equation for this plane.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.670
But what is a normal vector?

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.660
How can we find a normal
vector to this plane?

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.930
So this would be a vector.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.590
Let me see if I can draw
this in a way that

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.350
doesn't confuse the issue.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.050
If the plane is like that,
the normal vector would

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.890
come out like that.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.450
So how can I create
a normal vector?

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.690
Well, we learned that you take
the cross product of any two

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.960
vectors in R3, and the cross
product I've only defined so

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.020
far in R3, and I will get a
vector that's normal to both

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.680
of those vectors.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.830
So let's take the
cross product.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.030
This is a nice way of thinking
about it, because it's really

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.960
integrating everything that
we've covered so far.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.700
So let me define my normal
vector to be equal to 1, 2, 3

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.795
cross 1, 1, 4.

00:07:36.795 --> 00:07:38.045
And what does this equal?

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.450
So my first term,
I ignore that.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.850
I get 2 times 4 minus
3 times 1.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.940
2 times 4 is 8.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.100
2 times 4 minus 3 times 1.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.960
8 minus 3.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.920
Then for my second row, I have
1 times 4, and my temptation

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.150
is do 1 times 4 minus
3 times 1.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.260
But you reverse it.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.585
You do 3 times 1, so it's
3, minus 1 times 4.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.090
We've done that multiple
times.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.030
You might want to review the
cross product video if that

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:12.740
seems strange.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.250
You ignore the middle row, and
you normally do 1 times 4

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.940
minus 3 times 1, but the
middle row you switch.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.850
We're only defining it for R3,
so instead, we do 3 times 1

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.150
minus 1 times 4.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.210
And then finally for the last
row, we ignore it, and we say

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:32.400
1 times 1, which is 1, minus 2
times 1, which is minus 2.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.970
And this is equal to the vector
5, minus 1, minus 1,

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.059
which by definition of the cross
product, and I've shown

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.950
this to you multiple times,
is normal to both of these

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.280
vectors, and so it'll be
normal to any linear

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.370
combination of these
two vectors.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:56.280
So now that we have our normal
vector, we can define the

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.630
traditional equation
for the plane.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:03.470
So we now know that our normal
vector 5, minus 1, minus 1,

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:08.880
that I got by taking the cross
product of our basis vectors

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.450
dot any vector in our plane.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.665
So let me just write
any vector.

00:09:13.665 --> 00:09:16.080
Let me just write it x, y, z.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.840
So x, y, z since that's how
I defined my axes up here.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.920
This was the x-axis.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.530
x, y and z.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.040
x, y, z minus-- I just
picked one of these.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.100
I could have picked either of
them-- minus 1, 2, 3 has got

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.840
to be equal to 0.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.510
So what's this?

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.100
This is going to be equal to--
let me write it a little

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:45.920
smaller, a little neater-- 5,
minus 1, minus 1 dot-- what's

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.920
this guy going to be?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:53.780
x minus 1, y minus 2, and
z minus 3 has got

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.840
to be equal to 0.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.050
And what's the dot product?

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:03.890
It's 5 times x minus 1 plus-- or
maybe I should say minus 1,

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:10.340
so it's plus minus 1 times y
minus 2 plus minus 1 times z

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.410
minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.860
That's just the definition
of our dot product.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:27.360
If I simplify this, I get 5x
minus 5 minus y plus 2 minus z

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.660
plus 3 is equal to 0.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.850
You have 2 plus 3 is 5 minus
5, so those all cancel out.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.070
Those will equal 0.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:44.600
And we get 5x minus y minus
z is equal to 0.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.270
This plane in R3 is the
column space of A.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.250
So we've now shown you that
it's truly a plane in A.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.620
And actually, it makes
sense that this plane

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.890
intersects the origin.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.740
If you set x, y, and
z equal to 0, it

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.220
satisfies this equation.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.480
And that makes sense, because we
said that a column space of

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.850
a matrix has to be a valid
subspace, and a valid subspace

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.470
has to contain the
zero vector.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.320
And in R3 that's the
coordinate 0, 0, 0.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.810
Now, what I want to do now is
see if we can get at the same

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:27.400
answer going a completely
different way, or approaching

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.790
it in a completely
different way.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.220
Let me get my original A,
which I've forgotten.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.410
I've marked it up a good
bit, but let me just

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.460
copy and paste it.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.020
So that's my original
A right there.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.562
Let me copy it.

00:11:48.562 --> 00:11:50.700
Let me paste it.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.640
Nope.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.900
That's not what I
wanted to do.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.860
Let's see, so my original
A-- I copied and

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.110
pasted the wrong thing.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.520
Let me do it a little-- don't
want to waste your time.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.570
Edit, copy, edit, paste.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.090
There you go and let me scroll
this down and get to a point

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.436
that's relatively clean.

00:12:13.436 --> 00:12:15.130
Bring my A down.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.430
I've used a lot of space.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.250
So here you go.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.030
This is my original
A right there.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.030
And what I want to do is see
if I can get this result

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.700
completely different.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.310
I got this result by figuring
out the basis of the column

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.875
span, finding a normal vector by
taking the cross product of

00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:37.800
our two basis vectors, and then
using the dot product of

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.770
the normal vector with the
difference-- this vector right

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.730
here, where you take any vector
on our plane minus one

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.500
of our basis vectors,
that's to find some

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.380
vector in the plane.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.780
This is some vector
in the plane.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.200
So any vector in the plane
dotted with my normal vector

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.230
is going to be equal to 0.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.260
And actually, I should probably
make a side note

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.490
here, that the only reason I
was able to say that the

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.990
normal vector is a cross
product of my two basis

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.850
vectors, is because I knew that
these two basis vectors,

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.980
not only do they specify some
point on the plane-- so let's

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.970
say that this guy right here
is this blue vector.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.030
Not only does he specify some
point on the plane right

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:23.810
there, but the vector lies
completely on the plane.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:24.860
How did I know that?

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.950
Because I knew from the get go
that the 0, 0 vector is in my

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.980
span, right?

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.000
I knew that if I draw this guy
in just standard position, the

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.265
point 0, 0, 0, is in my span,
and I know its end point is in

00:13:42.265 --> 00:13:45.870
the span, so this whole vector
has to be in my plane, and

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.640
likewise, this whole vector
has to be in my plane.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.260
So if I take the cross product,
anything normal to

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.340
these guys or any combination
of these guys is going be

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.130
normal to the plane, and we got
this result right here.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.820
But let me take this right
here and use our other

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.250
definition of column span.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.060
Our other definition, or it's
really an equivalent

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:13.110
definition, is all of the valid
solutions to Ax where x

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:18.460
is a member of Rn.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.570
Or another way we could think of
it is, we could view it as

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:36.810
all of the valid b's where Ax
is equal to b, and x is a

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.840
member of Rn.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.340
These are equivalent
statements.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.940
I'm just defining b here to be
Ax, so these are equivalent

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.330
statements.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.350
But let's run with this
a little bit.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.840
So let's say that I define my
b, so b is going to be a

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.070
vector in R3, right?

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.580
We already have an intuition
like that.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.360
When I take Ax, I get a b
that's equal to x, y, z.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.600
And I want to figure out what x,
y's and z's can I get valid

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.880
solutions for?

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:16.780
So if I take my vector A and
then let me multiply it

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:28.290
times-- well, actually, the
best way to do it, I think

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.340
we're used to it right now.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:37.110
If I'm solving the equation
Ax is equal to b, I can

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.290
essentially just create the
augmented matrix, where I have

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:46.690
the matrix A and I can augment
it with b, and put this in

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.420
reduced row echelon form, and
that'll essentially represent

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.500
the solution set.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.420
So let me do that.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.155
So if I just augment this matrix
right here with b, so I

00:15:55.155 --> 00:15:56.790
write x, y, z.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.030
So this is A augmented with b.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.390
This is A, this is b.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.190
let me put this in reduced row
echelon form and find the

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.440
solution set.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.440
And these are x, y, and z's
that define a valid b.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.400
So what do I get?

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.710
The first thing I want to do,
and we've done this exercise

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:22.160
before, let's keep my
first row the same.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.720
1, 1, 1, 1, and I get an x.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.560
And let's replace our second row
with the second row minus

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.810
the first row.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.180
Actually let me do
it this way.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.620
Let me replace the second row
with 2 times the first row

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.715
minus the second row.

00:16:44.715 --> 00:16:46.770
So 2 times the first row minus
the second row, we're going to

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.550
get a 2x minus y up there.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.100
And then 2 times
1 minus 2 is 0.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.330
2 times 1 minus 1 is 1.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.990
2 times 1 minus 4 is minus 2.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.305
2 times 1 minus 3 is minus 1.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.260
Fair enough.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:17.930
And now let me replace my third
row with the third row

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.380
minus 3 times the first row.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:25.690
So we're going to do the third
row minus-- no, let

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.240
me do it this way.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:34.800
It's the third row minus
3 times the first row.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.670
So I'm just doing the b column
first, because I can remember

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.580
what I did.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.120
The third row minus 3
times the first row.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.900
3 minus 3 times 1 is 0.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.090
4 minus 3 times 1 is 1.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.710
1 minus 3 times 1 is minus 2.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:57.750
And then 2 minus 3 times
1 is minus 1.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:01.450
Now, I could go all the way to
reduced row echelon form, but

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.100
something interesting is
already happening.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.380
So let me from the get go try
to zero out this third row.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.710
And the best way to zero out
this third row is to just

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.140
replace the third row.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.850
So the first row-- well,
I won't even

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:16.350
write the first row.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:23.400
The second row is 0, 1, minus
2, minus 1, and 2x minus y.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.690
I'm not even going to worry
about the first row right now.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.110
But let's replace the third row,
just in our attempt to go

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.100
into reduced row echelon form.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.370
Let's replace it with
the second row

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.880
minus the third row.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:42.670
So you get 2x minus
y minus z plus 3x.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.560
I just took this minus this.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.300
So minus z plus 3x.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.420
So 0 minus 0 is 0.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.140
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:56.040
Minus 2 minus minus 2 is
0, and that's also 0.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:02.110
So we're only going to have a
valid solution to Ax equals b

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:08.270
if this guy right here
is equal to 0.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.830
What happens if he's
not equal to zero?

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.110
Then we're going to have a bunch
of zeroes equaling some

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.810
number, which tells us that
there's no solution.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.680
So if I pick a b where this guy
does not equal zero, then

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.800
I'll have no solution.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.340
If this guy equals 5, if I pick
x, y, and z's such as

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.820
that this expression is equal to
5, then Ax equal to b will

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.090
have no solution, because it
will have 0 is equal to 5.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.840
So this has to equal 0.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:40.510
So 2x minus y minus z plus 3x
must be equal to 0 in order

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:47.490
for b to be valid, in order for
b to be a member of the

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.700
column space of A, in order for
it to be a valid vector

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:56.510
that Ax can become, or the
product A times x can become

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.180
for some x.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.670
So what does this equal to?

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:09.570
If we add the 2x plus the 3x,
I get 5x minus y minus z is

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.050
equal to 0, which is the exact
same outcome we got when we

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.710
figured out the basis vectors.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.550
We said oh, you know what?

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.260
The basis vectors, they have
to be in the column space

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.490
themselves by definition.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.150
So let me find a normal vector
to them both by taking the

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:26.230
cross product.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.720
I did that, and I said the cross
product times any valid

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.910
vector in our space minus one of
the basis vectors has to be

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.320
equal to zero, and then
I got this equation.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.750
Or we could have done
it the other way.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.440
We could've actually literally
solved this equation setting

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.480
our b equal to this.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.100
We said what b's will give
us a valid solution?

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.620
And our only valid solution will
be obtained when this guy

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.540
has to be equal to zero, because
the rest of his row

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.760
became zero.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.250
And when we set that equal
to zero, we got

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.900
the exact same equation.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.000
So, hopefully, you found this
to be mildly satisfying,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.780
because we were able to tackle
the same problem from two

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.255
different directions and get the
same result, and it kind

00:21:05.255 --> 00:21:07.740
of shows you the beauty of
linear algebra, how it all

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.970
starts to fit together.
