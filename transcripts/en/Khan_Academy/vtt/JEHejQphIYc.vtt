00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.980
We're asked to multiply 32.12,
or 32 and 12 hundredths, times

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.620
0.5, or just 5 tenths.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.630
Now when you multiply decimals,
you multiply them

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.700
the exact same way you would
multiply whole numbers, and

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.380
then you count the number of
spaces behind the decimal you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.330
have in your two numbers you're
multiplying, and you're

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.720
going to have that many spaces
in your product.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.340
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.320
So let's just multiply
these two characters.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:35.720
So we have 32.12 times 0.5.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.670
And when you write them out, you
can just push both of them

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.710
all the way to the right.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.530
You could almost ignore
the decimal.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.285
Right now, you should write the
decimal where they belong,

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:48.660
but you can almost pretend that
this is 3,212 times 5,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.580
and then we'll worry about
the decimals in a second.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.920
So let's get started.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.390
So if we were just multiplying
5 times 3,212, we would say,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.540
well, 5 times 2 is 10.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.030
Regroup the 1.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.860
5 times 1 is 5, plus 1 is 6.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.260
5 times 2 is 10.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.720
Regroup the 1.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.400
And then finally, you have 5
times 3 is 15, plus 1 is 16.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.800
And then we don't have
any other places.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.800
If we were just doing this as
05, we wouldn't multiply 0

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.480
times this whole thing.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.240
We would just get 0 anyway.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.000
So just 5 times 3,212 gives
us this number.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.700
But now we want to care
about the decimals.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.740
We just have to count the total
number of spaces or

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.710
places we have behind the
decimal point in the two

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.750
numbers we're multiplying.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.380
So we have one, two, three
spaces, or three numbers, to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.090
the right of the decimals in
the two numbers that we're

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.970
multiplying.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.990
So we need that many numbers to
the right of the decimal in

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.530
our answer.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.910
So we go one, two, three, put
the decimal right over there.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.080
So 32.12 times 0.5 is 16.060.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.220
And this trailing zero right
here we can ignore, because

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.390
it's really not adding any
information there.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.200
So we could just write
this as 16.06.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.780
The last thing you want to do
is just make sure that this

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.670
makes sense.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.530
You have a number that's
almost 32, and we're

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.990
multiplying it by 0.5.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.860
Remember, 0.5 is the same thing
as 5 over 10, which is

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.090
the same thing as 1/2.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.670
So we're really multiplying
32.12 times 1/2.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.100
We're trying to figure out what
one half of 32.12 is.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.640
And half of 32 is 16, and half
of 0.12 0.06, so this makes

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.450
complete sense.
