00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
Now I'll give you a slightly
more complicated choice

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.320
between two payment options.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.100
Both of them are good, because
in either case

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.260
you're getting money.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.510
So choice one.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:28.510
Today I will give you $100.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.820
I'll circle the payment when
you get it in magenta.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.720
So today you get $100.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.912
Choice two.

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:39.990
And I'll try to write this
choice a little bit neater.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.410
Choice two is that not in
1 year, but in 2 years.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.660
So let's say this is year 1.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.270
And now this is year 2.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.390
Actually I'm going to give
you three choices.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.425
That'll really hopefully
hit things home.

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:03.930
So actually let me scoot this
choice two over to the left.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.000
Back to green.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.500
So now I'm back in business.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:21.530
So choice two, I am willing to
give you, let's say, oh I

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.820
don't know, $110 in 2 years.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.650
So not in 1 year.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.460
In 2 years I'm going
to give you $110.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.280
And so I'll circle in
magenta when you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.450
actually get your payment.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.570
And then choice three .

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.150
And choice three is going
to be fascinating.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.400
I've done it in a slightly
different shade of green.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.430
Choice three, I am going to pay
you-- I'm making this up

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:01.910
on the fly as I go-- I'm going
to pay you $20 today.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:09.566
I'm going to pay you
$50 in 1 year.

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:11.500
That's $70.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.780
Let me make this
so it's close.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:26.080
And then I'm going to pay you,
I don't know, $35 in year 3.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.580
So all of these are payments.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.740
I want to differentiate between
the actual dollar

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.920
payments and the
present values.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.930
And just for the sake of
simplicity, let's assume that

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.810
I am guaranteed.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.820
I am the safest person
available.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.230
If the world exists, if the sun
does not supernova, I will

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.730
be paying you this
amount of money.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.180
So I'm as risk-free as the
federal government.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.250
And I had a post on the previous
present value, where

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.550
someone talked about,
well is the federal

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.060
government really that safe?

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.330
And this is the point.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.740
The federal government, when
it borrows from you $100.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.720
Let's say it borrows $100
and it promises

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.730
to pay it in a year.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.690
It'll give you that $100.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.700
The risk is, what is
that $100 worth?

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.290
Because they might inflate
the currency to death.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.850
Anyway, I won't go into
that right now.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.860
Let's just go back to this
present value problem.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.010
And actually sometimes
governments

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.930
do default on debt.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.610
But the U.S. government
has never defaulted.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.970
It has inflated its currency.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.880
So that's kind of a round
about way of defaulting.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.580
But its never actually said,
I will not pay you.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.720
Because if that happened, our
entire financial system would

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.970
blow up and we would all be
living off the land again.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.490
Anyway, back to this problem.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.080
Enough commentary from Sal.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.380
So let's just compare choice
one and choice two again.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.870
And once again let's say that
risk-free, I could put money,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.900
I could lend it to the federal
government at 5%.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.090
Risk-free rate is 5%.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.990
And for the sake of simplicity--
in the next video

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.120
I will make that assumption less
simple-- but for the sake

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.830
simplicity, the government will
pay you 5% whether you

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.750
give them the money for 1 year,
whether you give them

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.380
the money for 2 years, or
whether you give them the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.490
money for 3 years, right?

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:26.380
So if I had $100, what would
that be worth in 1 year?

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.210
We figured that out already.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.400
It's 100 times 1.05.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.550
So that's $105.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.440
And then if you got
another 5%?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.800
So the government is giving
you 5% per year.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.000
It would be 105 times 1.05.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.310
And what is that?

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:08.230
So I have 105 times 1.05,
which equals $110.25.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.010
So that is the value
in 2 years.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.500
So immediately, without even
doing any present value, we

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.540
see that you'll actually be
better off in 2 years if you

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.120
were to take the money now
and just lend it to the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.550
government.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.080
Because the government,
risk-free, will give you

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:28.150
$110.25 in 2 years, while I'm
only willing to give you $110.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.610
So that's all fair and good.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.860
But the whole topic, what we're
trying to solve, is

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.550
present value.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.570
So let's take everything
in today's money.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.470
And to take this $110 and say
what is that worth today, we

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.000
can just discount it backwards
by the same method, right?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.350
So $110 in 2 years, what
is its 1-year value?

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.280
Well, you take $110 and
you divide it by 1.05.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.710
You're just doing the reverse.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.160
And then you get some
number here.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.450
Well that number you get
is 110 divided by 1.05.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.680
And then to get its present
value, its value today, you

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.530
divide that by 1.05 again.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.280
So you get 110 divided.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.260
If I were to divide by 1.05
again what do I get?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.310
I divide by 1.05, and then
I divide by 1.05 again.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.440
I'm dividing by 1.05 squared.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.040
And what does that equal?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.550
And I'm writing this on purpose,
because I want to get

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.690
you used to this notation.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.110
Because this is what all of
our present values and our

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.020
discounted cash flow, this type
of dividing by 1 plus the

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.300
discount rate to the power of
however many years out, this

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.820
is what all of that's
based on.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.520
And that's all we're doing
though, we're just dividing by

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.670
1.05 twice because we're
2 years out.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.930
So let's do that.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:07:08.390
110 divided by 1.05 squared
is equal to $99.77.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.830
So once again we have verified,
by taking the

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.610
present value of $110 in 2
years to today, that its

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.330
present value-- if we assume
a 5% discount rate.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.530
And this discount rate, this
is where all of the fudge

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.930
factor occurs in finance.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.600
You can tweak that discount
rate and make a few

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.110
assumptions in discount
rate and

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.160
pretty much assume anything.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.900
But right now, for
simplification, we're assuming

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.770
a risk-free discount rate.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.180
But when the present value is
based on that, you get $99.77.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.070
You say, wow, yeah, this really
isn't as good as this.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.530
I would rather have $100 today
than $99.77 today.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.960
Now this is interesting.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.490
Choice number three.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.780
How do we look at this?

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.020
Well what we do is, we
present value each of

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.540
the payments, right?

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.570
So the present value of $20
today, well that's just $20.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:07.160
What's the present value
of $50 in 1 year?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.000
Well the present value of that
is going to be-- so plus $50

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.460
divided by 1.05, right-- that's
the present value of

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.530
the $50, because it's
1 year out.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.990
And then I want the present
value of the $35.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:25.510
So that's plus $35 divided by
what-- it's 2 years out,

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.390
right, so you have to
discount it twice--

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:31.230
divided by 1.05 squared.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.780
Just like we did here.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.309
So let's figure out what
that present value is.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.590
Notice I'm just adding up the
present values of each of

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.000
those payments.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.299
Get out my virtual TI-85.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.740
Let's see, so the present value
of the $20 payment is

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.580
$20, plus the present value
of the $50 payment.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:56.920
Well that's just 50 divided by
1.05, plus the present value

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.685
of our $35 payment.

00:08:58.685 --> 00:09:03.240
35 divided by-- and it's 2 years
out, so we discount by

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:12.120
our discount rate twice-- so
it's divided by 1.05 squared.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:25.600
And then that is equal to--
we'll round it-- $99.37.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.770
So now we can make a very
good comparison

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.760
between the three options.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.270
This might have been
confusing before.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.080
You know, you have this
guy coming up to you.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.380
And this guy is usually in
the form of some type of

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.790
retirement plan or insurance
company, where they say, hey,

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.440
you pay me this for years a,
b, and c, and I'll pay you

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.790
that in years b, c, and d.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.990
And you're like, boy, how do I
compare if that's really a

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.840
good value?

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.010
Well this is how
you compare it.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.490
You present value all of the
payments and you say well what

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.440
is that worth to me today.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.590
And here we did that.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.870
We said well actually choice
number one is the best deal.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.450
And it just depended on how
the mathematics work out.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.130
If I lowered the discount rate,
if this discount rate is

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.160
lower, it might have changed
the outcomes.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.430
And maybe I'll actually do that
in the next video, just

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.360
to show you how important
the discount rate is.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.400
Anyway I'm out of time,
and I'll see

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.650
you in the next video.
