00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.610
 

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.090
In the last video, we showed
that the squared error between

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.060
some line, y equals mx plus
b and each of these n data

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.460
points is this expression
right over here.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.290
In this video, I'm really just
going to algebraically

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.190
manipulate this expression so
that it's ready for the

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.070
calculus stage.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.000
So we can actually optimize, we
can actually find the m and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.520
b values that minimize this
value right over here.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.500
So this is just going to be a
ton of algebraic manipulation.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.170
But I'll try to color code
it well so we don't

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.030
get lost in the math.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.300
So let me just rewrite this
expression over here.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.370
So this whole video is just
going to be rewriting this

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.430
over and over again.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.640
Just simplifying it a
bit with algebra.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.770
So this first term right over
here, y1 minus mx1 plus b

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.400
squared, this is all going
to be the squared

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.500
error of the line.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.370
So this first term over here,
I'll keep it in blue, is going

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:03.800
to be if we just expand it, y1
squared minus 2 times y1 times

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:12.970
mx1 plus b, plus mx1
plus b squared.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.930
All I did is I just squared
this binomial right here.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.480
You can imagine if this was a
minus b, it would be a squared

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.720
minus 2ab plus b squared.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.880
That's all I did.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.860
Now I'll just have to do that
for each of the terms. And

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.720
each term is only different by
the x and the y coordinates

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.410
right over here.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.530
And I'll go down so that we
can kind of combine like

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.070
terms. So this term over here
squared is going to be y2

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.220
squared minus 2 times
y2 times mx2 plus b

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.680
plus mx2 plus b squared.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.000
Same exact thing up here.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.330
Except now it was with x2 and
y2, as opposed to x1 and y1.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.660
And then we're just going to
keep doing that n times.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.170
 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.780
We're going to do it for the
third, x3, y3, keep going,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.220
keep going.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.610
All the way until we get the
this nth term over here.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.640
And this nth term over here when
we square it is going to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:22.340
be yn squared minus 2yn
times mxn plus b,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.640
plus mxn plus b squared.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.610
Now, the next thing I want to
do is actually expand these

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.130
out a little bit more.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.130
So let's actually scroll down.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.800
So this whole expression, I'm
just going to rewrite it, is

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.670
the same thing as-- and remember
this is just the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.960
squared error of the line.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.830
So let me rewrite this
top line over here.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.920
This top line over here
is y1 squared.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.400
And then I'm going to
distribute this 2y1.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.740
So this is going to be
minus 2y1mx1, that's

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.220
just that times that.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.470
Minus 2y1b.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.770
 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.840
And then plus, and now let's
expand mx1 plus b squared.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.950
So that's going to be m squared
x1 squared, plus 2

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:23.520
times mx1 times b
plus b squared.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.770
All I did, if was a plus b
squared, this is a squared

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.330
plus 2ab plus b squared.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.340
And we're going to do that for
each of these terms. Or for

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.370
each of these colors, I
guess you could say.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.480
So now let's move to
the second term.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.750
It's going to be
the same thing.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.620
But instead of y1's and
x1's, it's going

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.530
to be y2's and x2's.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:52.410
So it is y2 squared minus
2y2mx2 minus 2y2b plus m

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:01.280
squared x2 squared, plus 2 times
mx2b plus b squared.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.200
And we're going to keep
doing this all the way

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.450
to get the nth term.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.960
 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.690
I guess color we should say.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.755
So this is going to be yn
squared minus 2ynmxn.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:22.750
 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.160
And you don't even
have to think.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.230
You just have to kind of
substitute these with n's now.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.260
We could actually
look at this.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.760
But it's going to be the
exact same thing.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:39.190
Minus 2ynb plus m squared
xn squared, plus

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.920
2mxnb plus b squared.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.340
So once again, this is just the
squared error of that line

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.320
with n points.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.270
Between those n points and the
line y equals mx plus b.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.200
So let's see if we can simplify
this somehow.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.390
And to do that what I'm going to
do is I'm going to kind of

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.300
try to add up a bunch
of these terms here.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.880
So if I were to add up all of
these terms right here, if I

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.060
were to add up this
column right over

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.420
there, what do I get?

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:22.300
It's going to be y1 squared plus
y2 squared all the way to

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.230
all the way to yn squared.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.570
That's those terms
right over there.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.180
So I'm going to have that.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:37.800
And then have this common
2m amongst all of

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.800
these terms over here.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.960
So let me write that down.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.920
So then you have this 2m
here, 2m here, 2m here.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.210
Let me put parentheses
around here.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.300
So you have these terms
all added up.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:58.690
Then you have minus 2m times all
of these terms. Actually,

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.510
let me color code it so you
see what we're doing.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.580
I want to be very careful
with this math so

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.040
nothing seems too confusing.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.120
Although this is really just
algebraic manipulation.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.440
If I had all of these up, I get
y1 squared plus y2 squared

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.380
all the way to yn squared.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.080
I'll put some parentheses
around that.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.410
And then to that, we have this
common term, we have this

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.460
minus 2m, minus 2m, minus 2m.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.680
And so we can distribute
those out.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.890
And so I should actually
write it like this.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.150
So we have a minus 2m, once we
distribute it out up here,

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.080
we're just going to be
left with a y1x1.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.350
Or maybe I can call
it an x1y1.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.580
 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.860
That's that over there with
the 2m factored out.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.360
 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.015
Let me do that in
another color.

00:06:51.015 --> 00:06:52.960
I want to make this
easy to read.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.070
Plus x2y2.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.320
Plus xnyn.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.790
 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.206
Well we're going to keep adding
up-- we're going to do

00:07:04.206 --> 00:07:05.660
this n times.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.770
All the way to plus xnyn.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.030
This last term over here,
ynxn, same thing.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.430
So that's the sum.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:20.860
So this stuff over here, the sum
of all of this stuff right

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.960
over here, is the same thing as
this term right over here.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.330
And then we have to sum
this right over here.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.510
And you see again, we can factor
out here a minus 2b out

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:50.350
of all of these terms. So we
have minus 2b times y1 plus y2

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.180
plus all the way to to yn.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.780
 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.670
So this business.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.880
These terms right over here,
when you add them up, give you

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.650
these terms, or this term,
right over there.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.840
And let's just keep going.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.420
And in the next video, we're
probably going to run out of

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.250
time in this one, I'll simplify
this more and clean

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.370
up the algebra a good bit.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.260
So then the next term, what
is this going to be?

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.190
Same drill.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.100
We can factor out
an m squared.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:31.750
So we have m squared times
times x1 squared plus x2

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:36.650
squared-- actually, I want to
color code them, I forgot to

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.900
color code these over here.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.890
 

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:48.140
Plus all the way
to xn squared.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.200
Let me color code these.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.060
This was a yn squared.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.600
And this over here
was a y2 squared.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.150
So this is exactly this.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:04.900
So in this last step we just
did, this thing over here is

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.230
this thing right over here.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.340
And of course we
have to add it.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.980
So I'll put a plus out front.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.360
We're almost done with this
stage of the simplification.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:19.130
So over here, we have a common
2mb, so let's put a plus 2mb

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:30.370
times, once again, x1 plus x2
plus all the way to xn.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:36.450
 

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:43.730
So this term right over here
this is the exact same thing

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.540
as this term over here.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.610
And then finally, we have a b
squared in each of these.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.720
And how many of these b
squared do we have?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.850
Well we have n of these
lines, right?

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.050
This is the first line, second
line, then bunch, bunch, bunch

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.570
all the way to the nth line.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.170
So we have b squared added
to itself n times.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:06.320
So this right over here is
just b squared n times.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:12.560
So we'll just write that as
plus n times b squared.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.120
Let me remind ourselves what
this is all about.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.960
This is all just algebraic
manipulation of the squared

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.270
error between those n points
and the line y

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.350
equals mx plus b.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.540
It doesn't look like I've
simplified it much.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.020
And I'm going to stop in
the video right now.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.080
In the next video, we're just
going to take off right here

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.730
and try to simplify
this thing.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.267
