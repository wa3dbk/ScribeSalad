00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.960
We need to factor 49x squared
minus 49y squared.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.520
Now here there's a pattern
that you might already be

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.190
familiar with.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.910
But just to make sure you are,
let's think about what happens

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.870
if we multiply a plus b-- where
these are just two terms

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.000
in a binomial-- times
a minus b.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.210
If you multiply this out, you
have a times a, which is a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.660
squared, plus a times negative
b, which is negative ab--

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.280
that's a times negative b-- plus
b times a, which is the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.150
same thing as ab.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.780
And then you have b times
negative b, which

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.830
is negative b squared.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.230
So when you do that, you have
a negative ab and a positive

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.390
ab, they cancel out.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.840
And you're just going
to be left with an a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.720
squared minus a b squared.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.420
Now, this thing that we have
here is exactly that pattern.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.870
49x squared is a
perfect square.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.030
49y squared is a
perfect square.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.740
We can rewrite it like that.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:05.900
We could rewrite this over here
as 7x squared minus-- and

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.560
I'll do it in blue--
minus 7y squared.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.620
And so you see it's a pattern.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.200
It's a squared minus
b squared.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.600
So if you wanted to factor
this-- if you would just use

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.400
this pattern that we just
derived-- you would say that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:32.090
this is the same thing as a,
7x plus b plus 7y times 7x

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.880
minus b, minus 7y.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.290
And you'd be done.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.980
Now there's one alternate way
that you could factor this and

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.380
it'd be completely legitimate.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.530
You could start from
the beginning and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.350
say, you know what?

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.470
49 is a common factor here, so
let me just factor that out.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.380
So you could say it's equivalent
to 49 times x

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.615
squared minus y squared.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:58.820
And you say, oh, this fits the
pattern of-- this is a squared

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.980
minus b squared.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.190
So this will be x plus
y times x minus y.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.880
So the whole thing would
be 49 times x plus y

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.979
times x minus y.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.860
And to see that this, right
here, is the exact same thing

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.140
as this right over here, you
could just factor 7 out of

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.970
both of these.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.840
You'd factor out a 7 out
of that term, a factor

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.530
7 out of that term.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.380
And when you multiply them,
you'd get the 49.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.650
So these are-- this or this--
these are both ways to factor

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.110
this expression.
