00:00:00.773 --> 00:00:07.481
We're asked to convert pi radians and negative pi/3 radians to degrees.

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:08.855
And the first question I'll ask you:

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:13.613
If you do one revolution, You have an angle that went all the way around once.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:16.867
How many radians is that?

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:23.816
Well we know that it is 2 pi radians.

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:28.101
Now that exact same angle if we were to measure it in degrees,

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:29.488
How many degrees is that?

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:38.189
Well if you were doing degrees, it would be one full revolution. That is equal to 360 degrees

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:39.714
Now, can we simplify this?

00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:42.701
That's a bore to write this little, superscript circle

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:44.251
That's literally the units of the question.

00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:46.468
Sometimes it doesn't look like a unit but it is a unit.

00:00:46.468 --> 00:00:48.521
You could literally write degrees instead of that little symbol.

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:55.337
Now can we simplify this a little bit? Well sure,

00:00:55.337 --> 00:00:57.783
Both two pi and 360 are divisible by two

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.990
so lets divide things by two, and if we do that, what do we get?

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.871
Or what are pi radians equal to?

00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:09.731
Well on the left side here we're just left with pi radians,

00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:18.200
and on the righthand side here, 360 divided by two is 180.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.169
And we have still the units which are degrees.

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:24.241
So we get pi radians are equal to 180 degrees.

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:26.372
Which actually answers the first part of our question.

00:01:26.372 --> 00:01:28.336
We wanted to convert pi radians, well we just figured out!

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:37.039
Pi radians are equal to 180 degrees.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.398
If you want to think about it, pi radians are halfway around the circle

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:47.442
Halfway around the circle like that, and it is the same thing as 180 degrees.

00:01:47.442 --> 00:01:49.384
So now lets think about the second part.

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:52.884
We want to convertnegative pi over three radians.

00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:55.720
--Switch to a new color-- so negative pi over three,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.519
so how do we convert that?

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:07.810
So what do we get based on this information right over here.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.449
Well, to figure this out we need to know how many degrees there are per radian.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:21.017
We need to multiply this by degrees -- I'm going to write the word out instead of the circle here --

00:02:21.017 --> 00:02:26.799
It would be really hard to visualize that, degrees per radian

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.437
So how many degrees are there per radian?

00:02:29.437 --> 00:02:34.971
well we know that for 180 degrees we have pi radians.

00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:43.971
Or you can say there are 180 over pi degrees per radian.

00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:44.803
This is going to work out:

00:02:44.803 --> 00:02:46.593
We have however manyradians we have

00:02:46.593 --> 00:02:49.082
times the number of degrees per radian.

00:02:49.082 --> 00:02:54.969
So of course the units are going to work out. The radians cancel out, the pi also cancels.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:03.702
And you are left with 180 divided by 3, leaving us with

00:03:03.702 --> 00:03:05.796
what is that?

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:06.863
Negative 60, and we don't want to forget the units

00:03:06.863 --> 00:03:10.863
We could write them out, the only unit left is degrees. WE could write out the word degrees or just put that symbol there.
