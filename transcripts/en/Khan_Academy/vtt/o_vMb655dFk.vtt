00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.130
Welcome

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.400
back.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.350
We're ready to do part
D, and let me copy and

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.990
paste that in as well.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.330
See, I don't think that's going
to need this graph, so let

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.290
me just remove that with a
color other than yellow.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.150
It's copy and pasted.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.610
I don't know if you can read
it, but it's helpful for me

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.060
to review the problem
on our clipboard.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.430
OK.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.010
The rate at which tickets were
sold for t -- for over this

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.120
range is modeled by r of t--
let me write that in case you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.270
can't see it-- is the rate at
which tickets were sold. r of t

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.320
is equal to 550 te to the minus
t over 2 tickets per hour.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.590
Based on the model, how many
tickets were sold by 3:00 PM?

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.480
So my t equals 3-- to the
nearest whole number?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.650
So that's sometimes important.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.980
You don't want to give
a decimal answer.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.790
So this is the rate at
which tickets are sold.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.020
So this is the derivative
of the total tickets

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.940
sold function.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.870
Or another way that we could
write it is the total tickets

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.600
sold-- so let's call that, I
don't know, capital T sub--

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.740
well let me-- I don't want to
do T of t, that's

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.490
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.150
So let's say the tickets sold
as a function of time is going

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.547
to be equal to the definite
integral-- well, we could say

00:01:41.547 --> 00:01:45.260
is at any time t, the tickets
sold-- and this is the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.680
fundamental theorems calculus,
I think it might be one of its

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.500
correlaries or actually
sometimes it is the fundamental

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.810
theorem of calculus, I always
forget my definitions.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.340
Between time equals 0 and t--
or if we want to know the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.260
tickets sold, between time
equals 0 and t is equal to the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.580
integral of the rate at which
the tickets sold was changing.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.970
So that's equal to 550te
to the minus t over 2dt.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.210
Right?

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.020
That's it.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.180
And so if we want to know how
many tickets were sold at time

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.120
equals 3, that's just equal to
the definite integral from 0 to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.520
3, or we could also view it as
the area under this curve, from

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.390
time equals 0 to time equal to
3 of 550te to the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.640
minus t over 2dt.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.990
Now this integral right here,
you can solve it analytically

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.120
using integration of parts,
which I just called the reverse

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.840
product rule, but you only have
45 minutes to do all three of

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.980
these problems, and they'll let
you use your graphing

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.050
calculator, and your graphic
calculator is excellent at

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.210
doing definite integrals, and
they just want the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.180
number, right?

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.210
So let's use our graphic
calculators to get that number.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.350
Let's see.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.090
I don't want to copy,
so how do we do that?

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.320
We just do second the division
button but that's calc--

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.620
definite, let me use the
definite integral, and like

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.790
what was, let's see, let me
make sure I have that--

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.560
550 let's just use x.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:37.180
550 times x times second e to
the minus x divided by 2.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.220
I think that's the
whole function.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.730
And let's see.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.610
My independent variable is x,
I've just swapped t for x

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.060
there, and I'm taking the
integral from 0 to 3.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.520
Click enter, let the
calculator do the work.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.720
This would have taken you quite
a while if you had to actually

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.140
do the integral yourself.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.810
972.78, and they want
us to round to the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.030
nearest whole number.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.770
So the nearest whole
number is 973.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:18.840
So we say 973 tickets
sold by 3:00 PM.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.490
And we're done.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.970
That only took us four minutes.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.230
And it would have taken us
even less if we didn't

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.130
have to explain it.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.020
Anyway.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.840
I will see you in
problem number three.
