00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.730
We're told that the formula
for converting a Celsius

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.400
temperature into Fahrenheit is
the Celsius temperature, or C,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.800
is equal to 5/9 times
the Fahrenheit

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.340
temperature minus 32.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.320
Rewrite the formula so it
solves for Fahrenheit.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.940
So just like I mentioned, the
C is Celsius, is the Celsius

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.780
temperature.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.045
And the F is the Fahrenheit
temperature.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.360
So right now, it's expressed in
terms of, we've solved for

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.560
C in terms of F.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.830
Now we want to solve for
F in terms of C.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.480
So let's see how we're
going to do that.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.430
So I'll just rewrite it.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.060
C is equal to 5/9 times
F minus 32.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.510
And we want to solve for F.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.480
So the first useful thing to do
might be to get rid of this

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.010
5/9 from both sides, or at least
from the right side of

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.860
the equation, so we just
have an F minus 32.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.260
And the easiest way to do
that is to multiply by

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.295
the inverse of 5/9.

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:04.810
So if we multiply both sides of
this equation by 9/5-- and

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.810
I could put it here, but it'll
squeeze a little tight, let me

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.870
try it-- 9/5 in there.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.780
If I do it to the right-hand
side of the equation, I also

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.600
have to do it to the left-hand
side of the equation.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.300
And what do I get?

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.050
The left-hand side becomes 9/5
Celsius, or the Celsius

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.480
temperature, 9/5 times the
Celsius temperature, is equal

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.060
to-- the whole reason we wanted
to multiply the right

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.330
side by 9/5 is these 9's cancel
out, this 5 cancels

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.910
out, and this just
becomes a 1.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.820
So 9/5 times the Celsius
temperature is going to be

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.720
equal to this expression:
the Fahrenheit

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.430
temperature minus 32.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.560
We don't need the parentheses
anymore, because this is the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.410
only expression on the
right-hand side.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.620
Now, we want to solve for the
Fahrenheit temperature.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.580
So let's see if we can get
rid of this 32 from

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.600
the right-hand side.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.350
The easiest way I know how
to do that is to add 32.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.920
Add 32 to both sides
of this equation.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.360
Add 32 to both sides.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.070
The left-hand side now becomes
9/5 times the Celsius

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:16.060
temperature, plus 32.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.580
And that's going to be equal
to-- this negative 32 and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.630
positive 32 cancel out, that
was the whole point behind

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.950
adding 32, so it's just going
to be equal to F.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.150
And we're done.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.430
We have rewritten this formula,
up here, so it solves

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.770
for Fahrenheit.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.460
This is the Fahrenheit
right here.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.030
We've solved for Fahrenheit
in terms of the Celsius

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.280
temperature.
