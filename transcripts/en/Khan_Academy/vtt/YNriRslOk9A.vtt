00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
 

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.490
We're told methanol, which is
used as a fuel in racing cars

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.650
and fuel cells, can be made
by the reaction of carbon

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.840
monoxide and hydrogen.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.810
So this is the methanol
right there.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.830
They're giving us 356 grams
of carbon monoxide.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.280
So carbon monoxide we have
356 grams of it.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.390
And they're giving us 65
grams of hydrogen,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.640
of molecular hydrogen.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.580
 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.200
They're mixed and allowed
to react.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.300
They say what mass of methanol
can be produced?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.040
And then they say what mass of
the excess reactant remains

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.260
after the limiting reactant
has been consumed?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.020
So that tells you this is a
limiting reactant problem,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.800
that we have too much
or too little of one

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.320
of these two reactants.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.100
These are the two
reactants there.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.190
The one that we have less of is
the limiting reactant and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.740
that'll dictate how much of the
product we can produce.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.260
And the one that we have more
of is the excess reactant.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.230
But first we have to figure out
which is the limiting and

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.940
which is the excess.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.960
And before we even do that, we
should always check that our

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050
equation is actually balanced.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.380
So let's just check that.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.130
On the left-hand side of this
equation we have 1 carbon

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.270
right there.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.760
On the right-hand side we also
have 1 carbon, so that looks

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.530
good so far.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.330
On the left-hand side of the
equation we have 1 oxygen, and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.080
on the right-hand side
we have 1 oxygen.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.300
Looks good so far.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.460
Left-hand side we have 4
hydrogens, 2 times 2.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.400
On the right-hand side we have
4 hydrogens, 3 plus 1.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.040
So this is balanced so we can
proceed to try to figure out

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.360
what the limiting reactant is.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.360
So the way we want to do it is
to figure out how many moles

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.140
of each of these we're given,
and then figure out how many

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.840
moles the stoichiometric
ratio that's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.770
required by this reaction.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.760
We already know what it is.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:56.690
We know that for every two moles
of hydrogen required, we

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.600
require-- you can see it right
here from the equation-- 1

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.265
mole of carbon monoxide.

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:06.980
 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.419
This is what the equation tells
us, so let's see how

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.000
many moles of hydrogen and how
many moles of carbon monoxide

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.320
we have.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.790
The first place to start--
we've done this several

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.610
times-- is what is
the molecular

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.860
weight of carbon monoxide?

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.770
So carbon monoxide molecular
weight-- let me write it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.910
here-- molecular weight
for carbon monoxide.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.620
It's a carbon, has a molecular
weight of 12-- it's good to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.750
memorize that, carbons and
oxygens and hydrogens show up

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.690
so frequently.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.930
And then oxygen is 16.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.100
So it's equal to 28-- a
molecular weight of 28, which

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.060
tells us that carbon monoxide,
if we want to view it this

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.860
way-- so let's do the carbon
monoxide first. So we're

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.370
dealing with the carbon
monoxide.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.150
So we have 356 grams of carbon
monoxide, and we want to write

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.970
this in terms of how many moles
of carbon monoxide do we

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.010
have. So what we want is how
many grams per mole-- but I

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.710
actually write-- 1 mole
has how many grams?

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.570
So 1 mole of carbon monoxide
has how many grams?

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.650
Well it's molecular weight
is 28 so if we

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.520
have a mole of them.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.330
If we have that 6.02 times 10
to the 23rd molecules of

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.100
carbon monoxide.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.610
That's going to weigh 28 grams.
So 1 mole of carbon

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.560
monoxide is 28 grams, or I
guess you have 1 mole per

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.120
every 28 grams. The reason why
I wanted to put the grams in

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.750
the denominator so it cancels
out over here.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.870
So those cancel out
when we multiply.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.300
And so we are left with 356
times 1 divided by 28 moles of

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.250
carbon monoxide.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.100
So let's figure what that is.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.910
That's 356 divided by 28--
right, that's essentially what

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.320
we're doing-- divided by
28 is equal to 12.71.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.390
Let's just say it's 12.7 moles
of carbon monoxide.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:25.430
 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.300
Now let's do the same thing
for the hydrogen.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.970
 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.830
We have 65 grams of molecular
hydrogen.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.840
What's the molecular
weight of hydrogen?

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.010
I'll do this in green
over here.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.390
Molecular weight of hydrogen
is-- well each hydrogen atom

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.530
has a molecular weight of 1
times 2, which is equal to 2.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.690
So we have 65 grams of a
molecular hydrogen, and the

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.310
same way, we want to
write it in moles.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.860
So we're going to multiply it
times-- 1 mole of hydrogen is

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.540
equal to how many grams?

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.440
Well we just figured it out.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.260
1 mole is equal to its molecular
weight is 2.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.340
So a mole of it is going to have
a mass of 2 grams. You

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.110
can view this as 2 grams per
mole or 1 mole per 2 grams.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.480
And we want the grams in
the denominator so it

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.890
cancels out over here.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.230
So let's do the math.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.120
That cancels out with that.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.190
And we have 65 times
1 divided by 2.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:41.040
65 divided by 2 is what--
32.5 moles of hydrogen.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.520
Now we know exactly how many
moles of carbon monoxide and

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.270
how many moles of hydrogen
they've given us.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.300
Let's figure out what
the ratio is.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.710
And we'll do it in the exact
same way as we wrote up here.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.910
So we have 32.5-- this is what
we're given-- moles of

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.730
hydrogen-- let me write
that a little bit

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.250
neater-- moles of hydrogen.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.910
And we're given 12.7 moles--
I'll do that in the same

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.830
color-- 12.7 moles of
carbon monoxide.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.190
So if we were to just divide
this, what is this?

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.920
I guess you could imagine,
divide the numerator and the

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.840
denominator by 12.7, or just
divide 32.5 divided by 12.7,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.090
what do we get?

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.520
 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.792
32.5 divided by 12.7--
no, that's not-- let

00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:36.630
me write that again.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.180
32.5-- man, these buttons are--
let me do it with the

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:47.015
keyboard-- 32.5 divided by
12.7-- that's a lot better--

00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:53.960
is 2.5-- I'll just say 2.56.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.430
So this can be re-written as--
so if I just re-write this-- I

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.490
should have written it here to
begin with-- I could write

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:11.690
this as we have 2.56 moles of
molecular hydrogen for every 1

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.646
mole of carbon monoxide.

00:07:14.646 --> 00:07:18.340
 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.910
So this is what we need for
a reaction to occur.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.540
This is what the balanced
equation tells us.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.030
It tells us that we need 2 moles
of hydrogen for every

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.800
mole of carbon dioxide.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.070
Based on what they've given us,
we just figured out that

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.040
we have 2.56 moles of
hydrogen for every

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.550
mole of carbon dioxide.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.480
So we have more than
enough hydrogen.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.810
We only need 2 for every
mole of carbon dioxide.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.160
We have 2.56.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.070
So we have an excessive
amount of hydrogen.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.690
So the excess reactant
is the hydrogen.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:08:01.360
Hydrogen is excess reactant.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.420
And the other one's going to
be the limiting reactant.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.850
We don't have enough carbon
monoxide to react all of the

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:08.760
hydrogen, right?

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.400
We only have 1 for every 2.56.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.390
We would actually, for this,
says you need 1.25 or whatever

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.400
for every, or 1.28
for every 2.56.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.770
It should be a 1:2 ratio.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.600
So we don't have enough
carbon monoxide to

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.760
react all of the hydrogen.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:37.400
So carbon monoxide is the
limiting reactant.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.700
Now given that this is the
excess reactant, we can use

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.320
the stoichiometric ratios to
figure out how much methanol's

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.020
going to be produced.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.050
It's all going to be limited
by our carbon monoxide.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.090
Did I just say-- hydrogen's
not the limiting reactant,

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.300
carbon monoxide is the
limiting reactant.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.500
We have more than
enough hydrogen.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.940
So how much carbon monoxide
do we have?

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.880
We already figured it out.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:08.370
We have 12.7 moles of
carbon monoxide.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.990
And we look at our-- let me
write this over here-- so we

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:18.840
have 12.7 moles of
carbon monoxide.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.780
And looking at our original
equation, we see for every

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.675
mole of carbon monoxide, we
produce 1 mole of methanol.

00:09:26.675 --> 00:09:28.710
So let's write that down.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.240
Times-- and we want the carbon
monoxide in the denominator.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:41.910
So for every 1 mole of carbon
monoxide used we have 1 mole

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:49.340
of methanol, which is, what,
CH3OH-- did I get that right,

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.750
yup-- produced.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.880
We get that straight from
the balanced equation.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.880
And this math is pretty
easy, but it gives

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.740
us the right unit.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.980
Remember, we're using the
carbon monoxide, not the

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.380
hydrogen because the
carbon monoxide's

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.760
the limiting reagent.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.680
That's what's telling us what's
going-- if we used

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.620
hydrogen as the limiting
reactant, then we wouldn't

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.440
have enough carbon monoxide
for the reaction to occur.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.410
So this is what's kind of
capping off on how much this

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.040
reaction can move forward.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.130
But the whole point of this was
to cancel that and that.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:28.210
So, obviously, if we're using
12.7 moles of carbon monoxide,

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:34.700
we're going to produce
12.7 moles of

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.540
methanol will be produced.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.130
 

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.520
And now we just have to figure
what is the mass of 12.7 moles

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.500
of methanol.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.520
And we just think about what
the atomic weight.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.340
So if you look at methanol,
CH3-- let me

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.490
put the H3-- H3OH.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:05.090
Its atomic weight is 12 plus 3
times 1 plus 3 plus 16 plus 1.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.730
So what is this?

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:14.150
This is 20 plus 2 is equal to
32, or if we think in moler

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:19.650
terms-- or not moler terms, I
should just say 32 moles--

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.940
this is its atomic weight.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.090
So that tells us that if we have
a mole of it we're going

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:38.930
to have 32 grams of methanol
per 1 mole of methanol.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.730
And once again, we got
that by figuring

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.310
out its atomic weight.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.150
Now to convert the number of
moles that we have of methanol

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.260
to the number of grams, we just

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.420
multiplied that times that.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.440
That units work out.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.590
This is in the numerator, this
is in the denominator.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.970
Let me just copy and paste it.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:12:00.180
So we have that, copy and
paste, and then we can

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.440
multiply it times that.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.360
Let me copy and paste it.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.430
You get that right there, and
I'll pick a different color,

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.660
maybe a blue.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.620
Just like that, and then let's
multiply these two.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:27.200
We have moles of methanol, and
we're left with 12.7 times 32

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.980
is equal to-- so let me just
keyboard again, let me clear

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:41.470
it out-- 12.7 times 32, 406.4.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.650
I'm kind of adding an extra
significant digit there, but

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.510
let's just go with it.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:50.610
406.4-- actually, I
should just stay

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.440
with significant digits.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:58.230
So we'll say 406 grams-- I'm
rounding down-- 406 grams of

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:05.390
methanol-- let me write it with
the units-- so grams of

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:11.530
methanol-- I went off the
screen-- of methanol produced.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.720
I could write the produced
down here

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.940
since we're all done.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.880
So I think that was the first
part of our question.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.190
How many grams of methanol.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:24.560
What mass of methanol, that's
400-- I have a horrible

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:31.170
memory-- 406 grams. And then
they say what mass of excess

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.900
reactant remains after
the limiting

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.030
reactant has been consumed?

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.280
Now there's a couple of
ways you can do this.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.320
The easiest way to think
about it is that the

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.650
mass has to be conserved.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:53.510
So we started off over here with
65 grams of-- let me be

00:13:53.510 --> 00:14:00.250
careful-- we started off here
with 356 grams of carbon

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:07.260
monoxide, and 65 grams of
hydrogen, and we were able to

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.450
produce 406 grams of methanol.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.020
And we figured out that
carbon monoxide was

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.190
the limiting reactant.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.750
So all of this gets consumed,
and only some

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.560
of this gets consumed.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.800
So if you do the math, what gets
consumed has to be equal

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.900
to 406 grams because that's
what gets produced.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.440
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.630
The left-hand side, how many
total grams do we have?

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:45.740
So if we have 356 plus 65, we're
starting off with 421

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.010
grams of reactant.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:58.860
So we're starting with 421 grams
of reactant, and then we

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:09.810
end up with 406 grams of
product, of our methanol.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:15.510
So that means that 421
minus 406 grams of

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.070
reactant was not used.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:23.730
So that means that 421 minus
406, which is equal to what?

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:34.780
21 minus 6 is 15 grams
of reactant not used.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.400
Now the reactant that's not
going to be used is the one

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.550
that you have an excess of.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:42.296
And we figured out that we have
an excess of hydrogen.

00:15:42.296 --> 00:15:45.480
 

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:51.270
So all of that 15 grams must
have been 15 grams of hydrogen

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.870
that was not used.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:16:00.020
So 15 grams of hydrogen
left over.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.760
Now the other way you could
have done this exact same

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:10.260
problem is you could have said
look, we're starting with 12.7

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.410
moles of carbon monoxide--
that's the limiting reactant.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.840
It's a 2:1 ratio-- you need 2
moles of hydrogen for every

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.670
mole of carbon monoxide.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.410
So you said, OK, if we have
12.7 moles of this, I need

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.830
twice that many moles
of hydrogen.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.470
So you would say well,
what's twice that?

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.820
That's 25.4.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.600
You need 25.4 moles, you have
32.5, so you subtract the

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:44.255
difference-- you subtract 32.5
minus 25.4-- And that number

00:16:44.255 --> 00:16:46.450
of moles of hydrogen
is left over.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:53.310
You'd multiply it times the
grams per mole, which is 2,

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.330
and then you, once again, would
get the same thing.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.040
You would get 15 grams.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.730
Let's do that.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.160
I just want to make sure
you understand.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:11.490
So we're starting off with 12.7
moles of carbon monoxide.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:17.770
And we know that we are required
that 2 moles of

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:24.150
hydrogen are required for every
1 mole of CO, of carbon

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.760
monoxide, that is required.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.940
So you know that this cancels
with that, you know 12.7 times

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:42.070
2 is 25.4 moles of
H2 required.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.560
And what is the mass of
25.4 moles of H2.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.460
So let's write that.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:54.160
25.4 moles of hydrogen
required.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.080
Times-- well we know the
molecular weight of H2 is 2,

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.080
so 1 mole, we're going
to have 2 grams of H2

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.950
per 1 mole of H2.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.260
This cancels out, mole
of H2, mole of H2.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:19.050
So we're going to have
25.4 times 2 is what?

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.930
That is 50.8.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:29.560
That is going to be 50.8
grams of H2 required.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.710
 

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.940
That's how much we're going to
consume in the reaction.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.450
Now they wanted to know
how much is left over.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.680
So we're going to
consume 50.8.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.910
We started with 65.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:50.660
So if you subtract 50.8 from
65-- 65 minus 50.8-- you're

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:51.520
going to get what?

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:59.240
You're going to get 14.2
grams left over.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:06.200
And that compares to the 16 we
got left over when we just

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.040
took the 421 minus the 406.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.010
And the difference between the
14.2 and the 15 is really just

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.200
a little rounding here and
there with our digits.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.880
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
