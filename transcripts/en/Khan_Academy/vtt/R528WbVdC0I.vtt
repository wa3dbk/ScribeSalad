00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.310
Let's put all of the moral
hazard issues and all the

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.620
fairness issues aside.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.240
And just think hard
about whether this

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.850
bailout could work.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.070
Because frankly, if it doesn't
work, then it's definitely not

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.290
something that any of us
should worry about.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.510
And even if it does work, then I
think you should worry about

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.860
the moral hazard issues.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.190
But let's say this is Bank
A, shady Bank A.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.620
And it has-- and let's see,
these are its assets on the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.440
left hand side.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.690
And these are its liabilities.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.860
And so it has, at least on its
books, the book value of the

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.250
CDOs that it has
is $5 billion.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.400
And what the government is
saying, is that right now,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.150
Bank B has lent Bank
A this loan.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.310
Bank B has given them $8 billion
that maybe has to be

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.720
paid back next month.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.280
And the big fear is that Bank B
is going to get scared, and

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.500
then when this loan is due in
a month's time, that Bank B

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.630
won't give them a new loan
or renew the loan.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.730
They're just going to want to
take the money back, because

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.220
they're afraid of keeping money
with these guys, when

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370
you don't know what these
CDOs are worth.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.350
And that's a legitimate
fear, right?

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.790
Because if these CDOs really are
worth $5 billion, then you

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.510
really do have $4 billion
of equity here, right?

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.560
Total assets are $12 billion
minus $8 billion of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.840
liabilities means you have
$4 billion of equity.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.380
Fair enough.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.520
But what happens if these CDOs
are only worth $1 billion?

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.950
And this is worth $1 billion,
and these are worth $7

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.400
billion, then you only have
$8 billion in assets.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.350
And $8 billion in liabilities,
and there's no equity.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.980
Or even worse.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.170
What if this these CDOs
are worth zero?

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.270
Then you have negative equity.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.760
Then if these guys were to go
bankrupt, if they were to be

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.990
the next Lehman Brothers, then
all this Lender B would get if

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.730
they went bankrupt are these
CDOs worth 0 and these $7

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.940
billion of assets.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.330
For every $8 they let lend to
Bank A, it'll only get $7.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.360
So what the government is saying
is, OK, to keep Bank B

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.960
from pulling their money out of
Bank A, let's buy out these

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.840
CDOs at essentially at a price
that keeps this bank solvent.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.420
Even if they really are worth
0, we're not the Fed or the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.240
Treasury-- the Treasury's
the one doing it.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.530
The Treasury's not going to pay
0, because if they paid 0,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.690
this guy would just
go bankrupt.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.560
It would be another
Lehman Brothers.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.880
So the Treasury wants to
essentially, maybe pay $5

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.640
billion for it.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.320
So that you take $5 billion--
buy these CDOs for $5 billion.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.860
And all of a sudden this doesn't
become CDOs of $5

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.360
billion, this becomes cash.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.370
And their argument is, if you
were to do this, no matter how

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.420
unfair it might be, because this
is essentially a check of

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.490
$5 billion, if you assume these
CDOs are worthless.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.770
This is essentially a check
that's being written to the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.670
equity holders and the
unsecured debt

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.260
holders of this bank.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.300
But let's assume that-- Let's
put all that aside.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.860
Let's assume that this works.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.550
That now Bank B will say, oh
boy, I don't have to worry

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.590
about those CDOs anymore.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.480
Those CDOs have been
turned into cash.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.450
This company definitely has
positive book value, and

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.620
therefore, I will continue
to loan to this company.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.980
But it isn't that simple.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.700
Because right behind these CDOs,
there are other assets

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.440
on this book.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.590
On most banks' books.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.680
So these were the subprime
CDOs, the

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.570
stinkiest of the stinky.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.750
Then you have other
things that are a

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.760
little bit less risky.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.060
They're Alt-A CDOs.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.970
These are loans that were given
to people who aren't

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.260
necessarily subprime.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.880
These are people who had
decent credit scores.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.260
But they still put no money
down, and they still were able

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.130
to essentially fabricate their
income on there loan

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.780
applications.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.290
So these are the Alt-A loans.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.655
Then above that-- And these
might be Alt-A CDOs.

00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:49.440
They've been sliced and diced,
so some tranches are more

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.730
risky, some tranches
are less risky.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.110
Above that, you might have
commercial real estate CDOs.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.830
So I'll call that commercial
real estate CDOs.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.170
Then above that, you might
have commercial loans.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.420
Just a regular companies.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.990
Or even better, these could be
loans to private equity--

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.840
actually, that's even better.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.560
Let's put some private equity
loans in there, because I

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.310
wanted to show you that this
isn't the only stinky thing on

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.959
the balance sheets,
these CDOs.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.010
That this is just the stinkiest
of them all.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.580
A good way to think about it is,
if you have a dead skunk

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.970
in your house, you won't
notice that the

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.830
milk is going bad.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.030
And that is the situation.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.360
These CDOs, they seem really
bad now, but you know what?

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.630
Six months ago, or
even a year ago.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.430
Six months ago, these CDOs
looked a lot like-- these

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.190
subprime CDOs look a lot
like these Alt-A CDOs

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.560
are starting to look.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.700
And the way these Alt-A CDOs
looked six months ago is how a

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.910
lot of these commercial real
estate CDOs are starting to

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.150
look right now.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.230
So this is just the tip of
the iceberg, these CDOs.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.820
So you have an issue here.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.080
The government goes in.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.170
It spent $700 billion.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.360
It buys these assets that are
of questionable value.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.750
And it's claiming to us that
the problem will be solved.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.100
But Bank B isn't an idiot.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.050
Bank B isn't an idiot.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.400
They're probably more
prudent than Bank A.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.640
They didn't buy these
subprime assets.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.080
Subprime CDOs.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.440
But I wouldn't be surprised if
Bank B probably has some of

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.270
these less stinky things on
their balance sheets.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.800
Alt-A.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.360
I mean, they definitely have
something stinky, which is

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.210
called a loan to A.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.170
That's one of their assets.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.710
And then they might have loans
to private equity, private

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.450
equity loans.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.720
Then they might have some
commercial real estate CDOs.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.390
They might have CDOs that are
backed by credit card debt.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.870
The bottom line is that this
bank can look into its own

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.820
assets, and it can see that the
fundamental value behind

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.480
these assets are
deteriorating.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.970
Anyone who talks to anyone in
the real economy right now

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.430
knows that the economy's
slowing.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.990
That consumers can't spend
any more money.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.310
In fact, last year consumers
had negative savings, which

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.950
means that they had to borrow
money to fuel their

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.510
consumption.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.790
And the only way that you can
have consumption growth in

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.130
that type of environment is if
either salaries increased,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.400
which isn't happening,
or people are able

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.440
to borrow more money.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.990
And we already know that credit
is getting tightened.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.520
So if you're Bank B, will the
government buying out this

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.430
asset, irregardless of how fair
it is, will that make you

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.560
confident in loaning
to Bank A?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.300
Well, no, because you see in
your own balance sheet that

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.180
things are deteriorating.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.850
And frankly, you have loans to
other people too, right?

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:48.860
You have loans to Bank C.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.170
That's a loan to Bank E.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.440
That's a loan to some sovereign
wealth fund.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.460
And then you have your
equity here.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.850
So you have a double
conundrum, right?

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.000
You have all of these guys.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.050
These loans might come due, so
you're going to need some cash

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.930
for that in the future.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.010
And you see the trend.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.730
You're not an idiot.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.520
You aren't as risk-taking as
this guy, and you see that

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.070
this wasn't the only stinky
thing out there.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.050
That there are other assets
classes, other types of CDOs,

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.160
and just loans in general,
that are starting to

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.600
deteriorate.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.370
That's starting to
deteriorate.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.020
That's starting to
deteriorate.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.420
That's starting to
deteriorate.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.630
So maybe this credit
crunch isn't just

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.650
because of these CDOs.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.790
Maybe it's because this banker
is actually being prudent.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.050
Maybe this banker's actually
saying, you know what, I need

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:34.800
to be careful.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.805
I see the left hand side of my
balance sheet deteriorating.

00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:41.910
I need to pull this money, just
in case, just really in

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.710
the best interest of
my equity holders.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.410
Of my shareholders, or even
of my bond holders.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.080
So even on this first cut, even
if there wasn't all of

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.320
this controversy, and even if
George Bush didn't go up, and

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.730
do a primetime speech telling
us that we're about to reach

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.970
financial armageddon, if I was a
prudent banker I would still

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.290
be wary of loaning to Bank A,
even if the government were

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.310
able to pull this buyout.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.060
Now on top of that, I work in
the financial industry.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.000
Bankers were prudent.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.010
They see reality.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.260
They see things are
deteriorating.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.930
So they want to be cautious.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.720
But frankly, when Bush, and
Paulson and Bernanke go up on

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.690
TV and say, tell the world that
you have to pass this

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.000
bill and if not, we're
essentially on-- they use

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.950
words like "preicipice." These
are the real precipice.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.720
And they use "financial
armageddon." It's either their

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.350
words, or some of the
other words that

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.799
I've heard out there.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.960
Financial armageddon.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.870
And days away from
the precipice.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.830
So my question is to you,
regardless of whether the

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.040
government buys this out, is
this type of language going to

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.550
instill any type of sense
of confidence in Bank B?

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.450
If I'm the chairman or CEO of
Bank B, I'm like, you know

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.740
what, I thought things
were bad.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.710
And that's why I was trying
to, instead of charge 2

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.560
percent for a loan, I was
going to charge 6

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.520
percent for a loan.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.520
But now the President of the
United States, the Treasury

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.080
Secretary, and the Chairman of
the Federal Reserve have

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.830
frankly used language that no
elected or unelected official

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.250
has ever used before.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.050
Days away from financial
armageddon?

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.330
We're on the precipice?

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.200
Hell, I'm definitely not going
to lend right now.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.790
I don't care even if
they do buy assets.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.170
And then I'm going to
throw another monkey

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.430
wrench into the picture.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:35.880
The plan calls for a reverse
auction, where the essentially

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.470
the Fed says, hey everybody,
I have $1 billion.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.030
Who wants to sell me
their mortgages

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.510
for the lowest price?

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.600
Well, guess what?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.560
The people who are willing to
sell their CDOs for the lowest

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.350
price are probably the most
desperate out there.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.590
And if anyone participates in
those auctions and sells at a

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.930
discount, those are the people
that are going to be on my red

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.570
flag list. Those are the banks
that I'm going to be the least

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.020
likely to lend to, because I
knew that they were desperate.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.570
That they were just covering up
their balance sheet for as

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.290
long as they could.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.020
They were waiting for the
government bailout.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.420
And if they're willing to take
the government bailout, those

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.700
are the very banks that I
don't want to lend to.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.290
Anyway, I'll leave you there.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.570
But I just want to give you the
point that everyone-- that

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.240
George Bush and then the rest of
his gang is trying to scare

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.320
the world and say, oh, we are
trying to save the economy.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.940
They don't mention the fact that
even with their bailout,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.560
regardless of how unfair it is,
we're probably going to

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.980
end up in the same situation.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.360
And frankly, it might even
make the situation worse.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.190
And that's something I really
want to hit home with people.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.530
It's like when they started
banning short selling in a

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.010
small number of stocks.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.620
When they said, oh you can't
short Banks A, B, and C.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.970
Immediately that made everyone's
ears go up and say,

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.420
oh the government knows
something that we don't know.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.600
I'm not going to deal with
Banks A, B, and C.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.490
Because those are probably the
stinkiest of them all.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.030
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
