00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.030
We're on problem 161.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.190
The positive integer n
is divisible by 25.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:15.040
If the square root of n is
greater than 25, which of the

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.150
following could be the value
of n divided by 25?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.650
So what could be a valid value
for n divided by 25?

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.130
So let's see if we can
manipulate this a little bit.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.990
If we square both sides, we get
n, right-- the square of

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.270
the square root of n is n--
is greater than 625.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.090
And then if we divide both sides
by 25, we get n/25 is

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.440
greater than 25.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.970
So a valid value for n/25 has
to be greater than 25.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.100
If we look at all the choices,
there's only one value that's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.690
greater than 25, and
that's E, 26.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.280
Problem 162.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.600
It looks they want to make
sure we know how

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.300
to deal with fractions.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.510
1 over 1 plus 1 over
2 plus 1/3.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.770
Let's just drive through
this math.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.080
That equals 1 over 1 plus 1
over-- let's see, 2 is the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.630
same thing as 6/3 right--
6/3 plus 1/3 is 7/3.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.806
So this is equal to 1 over 1
plus-- 1 over 7/3 is the same

00:01:30.806 --> 00:01:37.810
thing as 3/7-- so that's equal
to 1 over 7/7 plus

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.170
3/7, so it's 10/7.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.000
Which is equal to 7/10,
which is choice B.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.030
Let's switch colors.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.670
163.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.880
A fruit salad mixture consists
of apples, peaches, and grapes

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.880
in the ratio-- so the so the
apples to peaches to grapes--

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.729
is equal to 6 to 5 to 2,
respectively by weight.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.740
If 39 pounds of the mixture is
prepared, the mixture includes

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.760
how many more pounds of
apples than grapes?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.850
So they want to figure out the
apples minus the grapes.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.410
OK, so they tell us that the
apples plus the peaches plus

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.560
the grapes is equal
to 39 pounds.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.360
When you're dealing with a
ratio, it's useful to say well

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.495
each of these is going to be
equal to, I guess you'd call

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:36.950
it their ratio number times
some number, right?

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.850
Let me explain what
I'm saying.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.420
Let's just say that apples
are equal to 6 times

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.250
some number x, right?

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.930
Well if apples are equal to 6
times some number x, then

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.370
peaches are going to
be equal to 5 times

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.140
that number x, right?

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.380
Because the ratio of the apples
to the peaches is a 6

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.430
to 5, right?

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.070
So if you did 6x over 5x,
you'd get 6 to 5.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.940
And by the same logic, then the
grapes would be 2 times

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.110
that same number x.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.780
And all the ratios
would work out.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.570
So we can substitute all of
these back into that equation.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:17.780
And you get 6x plus 5x plus
2x is equal to 39.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.850
6 plus 5 is 11, plus 2--

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.230
Well

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.860
actually I have a phone call
that I was expecting.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.110
So let me continue this
in the next video.
