00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.470
Let's think about 2 different scenarios

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.402
where I might borrow money from you,

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:08.521
So this is me over here, and this is you

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.225
in the first scenario, I borrow money from you

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:13.459
for a relatively short amount of time,

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:19.474
so I'm gonna borrow $100 from you

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:25.919
and then in 1 week I will pay that $100 back to you

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.412
I will pay back the $100, and then I will pay

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:33.979
some interest. And we'll calculate the interest

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:36.777
on an annual basis, but obviously it will be less than

00:00:36.777 --> 00:00:38.715
a year's interest because I'm only paying for a week

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:41.102
but we can annualize it, it would give us some

00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:45.835
annual interest. The other scenarios is I borrow for a longer period of time

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:48.456
So I'll do the other scenario in pink right over here

00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:51.688
So let's say I borrow $100. Instead of paying you back

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:56.679
in a week, we agree that I can pay you back in 2 years.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:04.710
I'm going to pay you back $100 plus some interest.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.712
And what I want to think about here is there any reason

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:10.938
why on an annual basis, I should have a different interest rate

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:14.441
for the short-term borrowing than the long-term borrowing

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:17.069
You might say, "Look, it's the same guy that's borrowing,

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:19.869
"...has the same credit rating, has the same kind of legitimacy"

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.761
and all of that, but you would say, "Well look,

00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:26.835
"...over here in 1 week, there's less of a chance of something catastrophic happening"

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:29.287
There's more predictability here,

00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:33.002
you have a better sense of what the world 1 week from now

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:34.690
is going to look like, than you do 2 years

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.818
maybe 2 years from now we enter into a hyper-inflationary environment

00:01:37.818 --> 00:01:39.719
maybe I get hit by a truck, maybe I lose a job

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.216
there's a lot more that can happen in 2 years

00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:44.587
than can happen in 1 week.

00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:48.689
And so you say, "Look, I think that this loan right here is riskier"

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.584
and it's not always the case that this would happen

00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:54.472
but many times you'd say look, if lending it for longer it's riskier

00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:58.518
there's more uncertainty, so on an annual basis

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:07.855
I would charge higher interest, on an annual basis.

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:10.460
Maybe in this scenario up here, you say

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.019
"Look, I'll charge you 5% per year interest"

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.950
So obviously the interest I would pay after a week

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.697
would be some fraction of this, some small fraction of $5 or 5%

00:02:21.697 --> 00:02:25.517
and over here, since there's more risk, more uncertainty over 2 years

00:02:25.517 --> 00:02:31.690
I will charge you, or you will charge me I should say, 10% per year.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.714
And it's not always the case, that the longer maturity debt

00:02:35.714 --> 00:02:37.658
is going to have a higher interest,

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:39.554
although it tends to be the case. If it goes lower

00:02:39.554 --> 00:02:41.654
we'll talk about it in a future video, it actually shows

00:02:41.654 --> 00:02:43.758
that something bad might be happening in the economy

00:02:43.758 --> 00:02:47.305
or we might somehow be entering into a deflationary period

00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:49.327
But the whole point of this video is to show you that

00:02:49.327 --> 00:02:52.623
depending upon how long someone borrows money from someone else,

00:02:52.623 --> 00:02:56.707
they might want to charge a different amount of interest per year

00:02:56.707 --> 00:02:59.271
depending on perceived risk,

00:02:59.271 --> 00:03:03.246
the same thing is true when people lend to corporations

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:05.054
or to the Federal Government.

00:03:05.054 --> 99:59:59.999
What we're going to see in the next video is how that plays out in the yield curve.
