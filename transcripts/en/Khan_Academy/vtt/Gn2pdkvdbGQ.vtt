00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.770
I'll now show you how
to convert a fraction

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.920
into a decimal.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.990
And if we have time, maybe
we'll learn how to do a

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.730
decimal into a fraction.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.420
So let's start with, what
I would say, is a fairly

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.480
straightforward example.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.210
Let's start with
the fraction 1/2.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.390
And I want to convert
that into a decimal.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.170
So the method I'm going to
show you will always work.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.850
What you do is you take the
denominator and you divide

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.530
it into the numerator.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.510
Let's see how that works.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.110
So we take the denominator-- is
2-- and we're going to divide

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.280
that into the numerator, 1.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.110
And you're probably saying,
well, how do I divide 2 into 1?

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.010
Well, if you remember from the
dividing decimals module, we

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.220
can just add a decimal point
here and add some trailing 0's.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.880
We haven't actually changed the
value of the number, but we're

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.260
just getting some
precision here.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.700
We put the decimal point here.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.650
Does 2 go into 1?

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.280
No.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.180
2 goes into 10, so we go 2
goes into 10 five times.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.060
5 times 2 is 10.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.050
Remainder of 0.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.150
We're done.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.675
So 1/2 is equal to 0.5.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.050
Let's do a slightly harder one.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's figure out 1/3.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.190
Well, once again, we take the
denominator, 3, and we divide

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.740
it into the numerator.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.470
And I'm just going to add a
bunch of trailing 0's here.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.800
3 goes into-- well, 3
doesn't go into 1.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.150
3 goes into 10 three times.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.452
3 times 3 is 9.

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:35.720
Let's subtract, get a
1, bring down the 0.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.700
3 goes into 10 three times.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.700
Actually, this decimal
point is right here.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.710
3 times 3 is 9.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.930
Do you see a pattern here?

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.070
We keep getting the same thing.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.350
As you see it's
actually 0.3333.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.830
It goes on forever.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.160
And a way to actually represent
this, obviously you can't write

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.020
an infinite number of 3's.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.430
Is you could just write 0.--
well, you could write 0.33

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.060
repeating, which means that
the 0.33 will go on forever.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.960
Or you can actually even
say 0.3 repeating.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.630
Although I tend to
see this more often.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.840
Maybe I'm just mistaken.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.410
But in general, this line on
top of the decimal means

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.320
that this number pattern
repeats indefinitely.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.210
So 1/3 is equal to 0.33333
and it goes on forever.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.770
Another way of writing
that is 0.33 repeating.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.400
Let's do a couple of, maybe a
little bit harder, but they

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.060
all follow the same pattern.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.890
Let me pick some weird numbers.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.890
Let me actually do an
improper fraction.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.050
Let me say 17/9.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.160
So here, it's interesting.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.260
The numerator is bigger
than the denominator.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.200
So actually we're going to
get a number larger than 1.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.270
But let's work it out.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.586
So we take 9 and we
divide it into 17.

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:06.000
And let's add some trailing 0's
for the decimal point here.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.730
So 9 goes into 17 one time.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.260
1 times 9 is 9.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.040
17 minus 9 is 8.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.240
Bring down a 0.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.080
9 goes into 80-- well, we know
that 9 times 9 is 81, so it has

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.830
to go into it only eight times
because it can't go

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.230
into it nine times.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.010
8 times 9 is 72.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.560
80 minus 72 is 8.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.770
Bring down another 0.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.260
I think we see a
pattern forming again.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.990
9 goes into 80 eight times.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.820
8 times 9 is 72.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.350
And clearly, I could keep
doing this forever and

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.790
we'd keep getting 8's.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.740
So we see 17 divided by 9 is
equal to 1.88 where the 0.88

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.080
actually repeats forever.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.200
Or, if we actually wanted to
round this we could say that

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.430
that is also equal to 1.--
depending where we wanted

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.860
to round it, what place.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.990
We could say roughly 1.89.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.480
Or we could round in
a different place.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.310
I rounded in the 100's place.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.350
But this is actually
the exact answer.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.126
17/9 is equal to 1.88.

00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:17.380
I actually might do a separate
module, but how would we write

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.730
this as a mixed number?

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.030
Well actually, I'm going
to do that in a separate.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.390
I don't want to
confuse you for now.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.380
Let's do a couple
more problems.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.980
Let me do a real weird one.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.360
Let me do 17/93.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.710
What does that equal
as a decimal?

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.130
Well, we do the same thing.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.630
93 goes into-- I make a really
long line up here because

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.930
I don't know how many
decimal places we'll do.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.220
And remember, it's always the
denominator being divided

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.930
into the numerator.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.950
This used to confuse me a lot
of times because you're often

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.630
dividing a larger number
into a smaller number.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.580
So 93 goes into 17 zero times.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.080
There's a decimal.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.990
93 goes into 170?

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.270
Goes into it one time.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.410
1 times 93 is 93.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.370
170 minus 93 is 77.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.360
Bring down the 0.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.700
93 goes into 770?

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.660
Let's see.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.120
It will go into it, I think,
roughly eight times.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.330
8 times 3 is 24.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.970
8 times 9 is 72.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.730
Plus 2 is 74.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.186
And then we subtract.

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:43.990
10 and 6.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.710
It's equal to 26.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.760
Then we bring down another 0.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.800
93 goes into 26--
about two times.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.020
2 times 3 is 6.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.704
18.

00:05:58.704 --> 00:05:59.920
This is 74.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.930
0.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.380
So we could keep going.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.030
We could keep figuring
out the decimal points.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.020
You could do this indefinitely.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.090
But if you wanted to at least
get an approximation, you would

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:23.490
say 17 goes into 93 0.-- or
17/93 is equal to 0.182 and

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.020
then the decimals
will keep going.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.170
And you can keep doing
it if you want.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.650
If you actually saw this on
exam they'd probably tell

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.640
you to stop at some point.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.650
You know, round it to the
nearest hundredths or

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.610
thousandths place.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.550
And just so you know, let's try
to convert it the other way,

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.830
from decimals to fractions.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.090
Actually, this is, I
think, you'll find a

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.300
much easier thing to do.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:49.810
If I were to ask you what
0.035 is as a fraction?

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:56.845
Well, all you do is you say,
well, 0.035, we could write it

00:06:56.845 --> 00:07:05.130
this way-- we could write
that's the same thing as 03--

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.300
well, I shouldn't write 035.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.700
That's the same
thing as 35/1,000.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.580
And you're probably
saying, Sal, how did

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.120
you know it's 35/1000?

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.590
Well because we went to 3--
this is the 10's place.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.230
Tenths not 10's.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.360
This is hundreths.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.230
This is the thousandths place.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.890
So we went to 3 decimals
of significance.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.260
So this is 35 thousandths.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:38.650
If the decimal was let's
say, if it was 0.030.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.140
There's a couple of ways
we could say this.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.490
Well, we could say, oh well
we got to 3-- we went to

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.570
the thousandths Place.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.240
So this is the same
thing as 30/1,000.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.610
or.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:55.550
We could have also said, well,
0.030 is the same thing as

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:02.710
0.03 because this 0 really
doesn't add any value.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.920
If we have 0.03 then we're only
going to the hundredths place.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.100
So this is the same
thing as 3/100.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.160
So let me ask you, are
these two the same?

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:16.670
Well, yeah.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.680
Sure they are.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.065
If we divide both the numerator
and the denominator of both of

00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:24.890
these expressions by
10 we get 3/100.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.220
Let's go back to this case.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.550
Are we done with this?

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.120
Is 35/1,000-- I
mean, it's right.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.660
That is a fraction.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.584
35/1,000.

00:08:32.584 --> 00:08:35.440
But if we wanted to simplify it
even more looks like we could

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.530
divide both the numerator
and the denominator by 5.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.860
And then, just to get
it into simplest form,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:47.280
that equals 7/200.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.020
And if we wanted to convert
7/200 into a decimal using the

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.150
technique we just did, so we
would do 200 goes into

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.120
7 and figure it out.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.170
We should get 0.035.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.650
I'll leave that up to
you as an exercise.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.370
Hopefully now you get at least
an initial understanding of how

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.320
to convert a fraction into a
decimal and maybe vice versa.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.840
And if you don't, just do
some of the practices.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.990
And I will also try to record
another module on this

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.880
or another presentation.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.090
Have fun with the exercises.
