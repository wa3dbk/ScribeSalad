00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.630
The goal of this video is to
start with our definition of

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.690
the cross product and the result
that we started off

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.370
with or that we got to in a
different video-- I think it

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.610
was three videos ago-- where
we found out that the dot

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.140
product of two nonzero vectors,
a dot b, is equal to

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.070
the product of their lengths.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.540
So the product of the length
of a with the length of b

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.780
times the cosine of the
angle between them.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.310
We're going to start with
these two things.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.680
This definition of a cross
product in R3, the only place

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.290
it really is defined, and
then this result.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:42.300
And we want to get to the result
that the length of the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.870
cross product of two vectors.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.660
And so obviously, when
you take a cross

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.760
product you get a vector.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.910
But if you take its length you
get a number again, you just

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.580
get a scalar value, is equal to
the product of each of the

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.180
vectors' lengths.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.610
It's the product of the length
of a times the product of the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.050
length of b times the sin of
the angle between them.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590
Which is a pretty neat outcome
because it kind of shows that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.200
they're two sides of
the same coin.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.340
Dot product has cosine,
cross product has sin.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.320
I'm sure you've seen
this before.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.060
Well you definitely have seen
it if you've watched my

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.360
physics playlist. And I even do
a whole video where I talk

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.360
about the intuition behind
what this really means.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.790
And I encourage you to re-watch
that, and I'll

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.180
probably do that again in the
linear algebra context.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.270
But the point of this video
is to prove this to you.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.380
Is to prove that with this and
this, I can get to this.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.100
Now if you're just believe me,
and you just say, oh I've seen

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.630
that before.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.270
And I just think it definitely
is the case, then you don't

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.380
have to watch the rest of this
video because I'll tell you

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.270
right now, it's going
to get dirty.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.340
It's going to be a hairy,
hairy proof.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.530
But if you're willing to watch
and bear with me, let's start

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.380
proving this result.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.910
So the place I'm going to start
is with the idea of

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.570
taking the length of
a cross b squared.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.080
That's a cross b right there.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.460
So I'm essentially taking the
length of this vector squared.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.860
And we saw in many videos and
I've used this idea multiple

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.550
times, that if I just have some
arbitrary vector, let me

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.600
just say some arbitrary
vector.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.580
And I take its length squared,
that's just equal to that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.590
vector dotted with itself or
the square of each of its

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.420
terms summed up all the
way to xn squared.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.410
So what will this be equal to?

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.780
Well this is just equal
to that vector.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.640
And we only have three
components, so it's equal to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.960
the sum of the squares of each
of these components.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.010
Let me write this down.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.410
It's equal to this
term squared.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.020
So let me write that down.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.750
a2 b3 minus a3 b2 squared.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.990
Plus this term squared.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:02.490
So plus a3 b1 minus
a1 b3 squared.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.240
And then finally, plus
that term squared.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:15.560
So plus a1 b2 minus
a2 b1 squared.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.670
And what is this equal to?

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.590
Well let's just expand it out.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.930
Let's expand that out.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.070
So this term right here, we're
just going to have to do our

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.550
expansion of the square
of a binomial.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.960
And we've done this
multiple times.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.120
So this is going to be equal
to a2 squared b3 squared.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.180
And then we're going to have
these two multiplied by each

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.230
other twice.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.030
So minus 2.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.150
I'm just multiplying this out.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.740
Minus 2 times a2 a3 b2 b3.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.460
I'm just rearranging them
to get the order right.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.620
Plus a3 squared b2 squared.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.870
That term squared.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.500
Then I have to add this term.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:08.490
So plus a3 squared b1 squared
minus 2 times both of these

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.370
terms multiplied.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.019
Minus 2 times a1 a3 b1 b3.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.620
Plus that term squared.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.470
a1 squared b3 squared.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.190
And then finally, this
term squared.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:37.240
So plus a1 squared b2 squared
minus 2 times a1 a2 b1 b2.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.080
Plus a2 squared b1 squared.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.840
So there you go.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.450
And let's see if we can write
this in a form-- well, I'm

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.090
going to write this in
a form that I know

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.170
will be useful later.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.880
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to factor out the a2,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.090
a1, a3 squared terms. So I could
write this as-- let me

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.360
pick a new neutral color.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.940
So this is equal to, if I just
write a1 squared, where's my

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.610
a1 squared terms?

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.070
I got that one right there and
I have that one right there.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.720
So a1 squared times b2 squared
plus b3 squared.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.300
This would be 3 squared.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.180
Good enough.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.370
Now where are my a2
squared terms?

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.800
a plus a2 squared times-- I have
that one and that one.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.470
So times b1 squared.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.050
That's that.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.300
Plus b3 squared.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.220
And then finally, let me
pick another new color.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.870
I can go back to yellow.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.690
Plus a3 squared times--
well that's that

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.970
term and that term.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.510
So b1 and b2.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.830
So b1 squared plus b2 squared.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.760
And obviously, I can't forget
about all of that mess that I

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.450
have in the middle, all of
this stuff right here.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.680
So plus, or maybe I should write
minus 2 times all of

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.250
this stuff.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:11.580
Let me just write it real fast.
So it's a2 a3 b2 b3 plus

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.340
a1 a3 b1 b3.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.940
Plus a1 a2 b1 b2.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.440
There you go.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.510
Now let's put this aside
for a little bit.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.540
Let me put this on the side
for a little bit.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.150
We'll let that equation rest
for a little while.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.990
And remember, this is just an
expansion of the length of a

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.900
cross b squared.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.040
That's all this is.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.330
So just remember that.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.660
And now, let's do another
equally hairy and cumbersome

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.350
computation.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.990
Let's take this result
up here.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.150
We know that the magnitude or
the length of a times the

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.880
length of b times the angle
between them is

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.680
equal to a dot b.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.860
Which is the same thing as
if we actually do the dot

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:17.670
product, a1 times b1 plus a2
times b2 plus a3 times b3.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.830
Now, just to kind of make sure
that I get to do the hairiest

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.800
problem possible, let's take
the square of both sides.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.600
If we square this side,
you get a squared b

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.630
squared cosine squared.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.260
Then you got a dot b
squared or you get

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.710
this whole thing squared.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.700
So what's this whole
thing squared?

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.980
For me, it's easier to just
write out the thing again.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:47.020
Instead of writing a square,
just multiply that times a1 b1

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.050
plus a2 b2 plus a3 b3.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.250
And let's do some polynomial
multiplication.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.270
So first, let's multiply this
guy times each of those guys.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.380
So you have a1 b1 times--
well there a1 b1.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.320
I'm going to do it right here.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:11.620
You get a1 squared b1 squared
plus a1-- plus this

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.290
guy times this guy.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:22.650
Plus a1 a2 times b1 b2.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.530
Plus this guy times that guy.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:31.870
Plus a1 a3 times b1 b3.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.120
Fair enough.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.250
Now let's do the second term.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.960
We have to multiply this guy
times each of those guys.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.960
So a2 b2 times a1 b1.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.870
Well that's this
one right here.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:50.560
a2 b2 times a1 b1.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.700
I wrote it right here because
this is really the same term

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.790
and eventually, we want
to simplify that.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.430
So that's that times that guy.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.990
Then we have this guy times
that over there.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.340
So let me write it over here.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:07.860
So that's a2 squared
b2 squared.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.740
Put a plus right there.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.910
And then finally, this middle
guy times this third guy.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.400
So let me write it over here.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:27.410
Plus-- so a2 a3 b2 b3.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.063
Now, we only have one left.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.940
Maybe I'll do it in
this blue color.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.620
I have to multiply this guy
times each of those guys.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.840
So a3 b3 times a1 b1.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.030
That's the same thing as
this term right here.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.240
Because you have a3.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.170
Let me write it right here.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:51.730
You have a3 b3 times a1 b1.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.150
Then you have this guy times
that guy, which is this

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:04.710
because it's a3 b3
times a2 b2.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.390
Let me put a little
plus sign there.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.940
And then finally, you have
this guy times himself.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.170
So you have a3 squared
b3 squared.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.630
And so if you add up all
of this business

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.880
here what do you get?

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.050
I'll switch to another color.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:30.870
You have a1 squared
b1 squared.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.180
Plus, and I'm doing these colors
in a certain way on

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.570
purpose, plus a2 squared
b2 squared.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.800
Plus a3 squared b3 squared.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.950
Plus, and let me do it in this,
I'll do it in white.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.250
Plus, what do you have here?

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.640
You have this term times 2.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.880
You have this term times 2.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.700
And then you have this
term times 2.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.970
So plus 2 times a1-- let
me write that down.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:11.490
Plus 2 times a1 a2 b1 b2--
that's that term.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.920
Plus this one right here.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:18.040
Plus a1 a3 b1 b3.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.790
Finally, plus this one.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.860
a2 a3 plus b2 b3.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.000
And you might have noticed
something interesting already.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.640
If you compare this term right
here, if you compare that guy

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.600
right there to this guy right
there, they're the same thing.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.260
You have an a1 a2 b1
b2, a1 a2 b1 b2.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.340
This term and that term
are the same.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.200
Let's look at the other terms.
Let me pick a nice color.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.300
a1 a3 b1 b3, a1 a3 b1 b3.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.140
That term and that
term is the same.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:57.130
And then finally, if you
compare a2 a3 b2 b3.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:57.920
This shouldn't be a plus.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.760
This is just this one.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.240
So a2 a3-- they're
all multiplied.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.530
a2 a3 b2 b3, a2 a3 b2 b3.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.020
This term and this
term is the same.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.850
And in this expression, when we
expanded it out, we have 2

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.840
times this, positive
2 times this.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.780
And this term right here when
we expanded it out, we have

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.190
minus 2 times this.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.220
So let's see if we can simplify
things a little bit.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.490
So what happens if we add
this guy to this guy?

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.780
Let's do it.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.740
So it's a little exciting.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:37.150
So we get a cross b, the
length of that squared.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.310
And we're going to add to that
this expression right here, so

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:47.130
plus the length of a squared
times the length of b squared

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.180
times the cosine of the angle
between them squared.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.490
What's that going to equal?

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.610
It's going to be equal to this
thing plus this thing.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.810
Let's do a simplification.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.680
What's this thing
plus this thing?

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.560
Well we already said this is
the minus 2 times this.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.650
This is the plus 2 times this.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.000
So this guy-- let me
be very clear.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.200
This right here is going
to cancel out.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.360
When we add the two terms
it's going to cancel

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.170
out with this guy.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.740
These guys are going
to cancel out.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.750
Thank God.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.550
Cancel out.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.730
Makes our life a little
bit easier.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.620
And what are we left with?

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.810
We're left with this right here
plus that right there.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.160
Then we see we have an a1
squared term, so we just add

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.690
the coefficients on
the a1 squared.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.300
We add the coefficients
of the a2 squared.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.900
We add the coefficients
of the a3 squared,

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.280
and what do we get?

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:41.560
We get a1 squared times this
coefficient plus this

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.340
coefficient.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:48.040
So you get b1 squared plus b2
squared plus b3 squared.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.700
Things are starting to
look a little bit

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.470
orderly all of a sudden.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:57.930
And then you have plus a2
squared times all of their

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:58.900
coefficients added up.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:05.300
So b1 squared plus b2 squared
plus b3 squared.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:11.470
And then finally, in yellow,
you have plus a3-- sorry, I

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.240
was trying to do
that in yellow.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.180
You have a3 squared
and you have that.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.410
You have b1 squared, b2 squared
and b3 squared.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:26.540
So b1 squared plus b2 squared
plus b3 squared.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.240
And as you see, we're
multiplying all of these

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.543
things by this b1 squared plus
b2 squared plus b3 squared, so

00:14:31.543 --> 00:14:34.520
we can actually factor that out
and we get something very

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.140
interesting.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.260
So this is equal to, if we
factor this thing out of all

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.340
the terms, we get b1 squared
plus b2 squared plus b3

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:51.010
squared times my a squared
terms. Times a1 squared plus

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:55.250
a2 squared plus a-- I'm getting
excited, the home

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.580
stretch is here-- a3 squared.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.360
So these two things are
equal to each other.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.270
But what's this thing?

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.320
What's another way I
could write this?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.960
This is the same thing as b
dot b or the length of my

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.720
vector b squared.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.980
And what's that?

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.460
That's the length of my
vector a squared.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.850
This is my length of my
vector a squared.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.740
That's just a dot a.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.050
Let me rewrite everything.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.230
So we have the length of a--
that's a darker green.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.150
a cross b squared
plus this thing.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:40.320
Plus the length of-- plus,
let me actually just

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.400
copy and paste it.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.720
It gets monotonous.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.370
Plus that thing right there.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.535
Why isn't it?

00:15:49.535 --> 00:15:52.010
If I control, copy and paste.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.370
So it's not working.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:57.520
All right, so plus that thing.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.200
The length of a squared times
the length of b squared times

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.560
the cosine of the angle
squared between

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.950
them is equal to that.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:10.120
Now what if we subtract
this from both sides?

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.140
What do we get?

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:17.720
We get the length of a cross
b squared is equal

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.720
to this minus this.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.450
And we can factor-- so
let me write that.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.240
Actually, let me just subtract
this on this line.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.680
So if I subtract it from both
sides, I could get that out

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.220
there and I'll put the minus the
length of a squared times

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.430
the length of b squared times
the cosine squared of the

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.680
angle between them.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.200
And we can factor this a squared
b squared, the lengths

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.680
of the two vectors out, right?

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.630
I'm just switching the order.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:49.170
So this is equal to the lengths
of a squared times the

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:56.150
length of b squared times-- and
this is exciting-- time,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.100
when you factor this out of
this, you just get a 1, minus

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.120
cosine squared of theta.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.380
And what is 1 minus cosine
squared of theta?

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.290
Well, sin squared of theta plus
cosine-- this is the most

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.460
basic trig identity.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:15.290
Sin squared of theta plus cosine
squared of theta is

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.440
equal to 1.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.240
So if you subtract cosine
squared from both sides you

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.140
get sin squared of theta is
equal to 1 minus cosine

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.010
squared of theta.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:29.310
So this is sin squared
of theta.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.650
And then what happens if
you take the square

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.510
root of both sides?

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.250
This is really exciting.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:40.530
You get the length of vector a
crossed with vector b is equal

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:46.450
to the length of vector a times
the length of vector b

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.120
times the sin of the
angle between them.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.790
I just took the square root
of both sides of this.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.460
And we finally get our result.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.340
I never thought I
would get here.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.820
And so hopefully you're
satisfied.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.200
You never have to take
this as kind of a

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.690
leap of faith anymore.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.470
And hopefully you're satisfied
with this.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.020
And I'm going to stop recording
this video before I

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.410
make a careless mistake or the
power goes out; that would

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.000
ruin everything.
