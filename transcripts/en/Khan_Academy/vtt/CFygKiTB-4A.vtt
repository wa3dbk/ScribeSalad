00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
 

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.690
Welcome back.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.950
We will now do a momentum
problem in two dimensions.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.170
So let's see what
we have here.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.070
So we have this ball A and we
could maybe even think of it

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.470
as maybe what's going on on the
surface of a pool table.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.730
We have ball A and it's moving
with its 10 kilograms. So

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.070
these numbers are the
mass of the balls.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.300
This is a 10 kilogram ball and
it's moving to the right at 3

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.710
meters per second.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.720
And then it hits this ball, B,
which is a 5 kilogram ball.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.920
And then we know that ball A,
ball A kind of ricochets off

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.740
of ball B and gets set onto
this new trajectory.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.010
Now, instead of going due right,
it's going at a 30

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.250
degree angle to, I guess we
could say, horizontal.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.610
It's going in a 30 degree angle
at 2 meters per second.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.650
And the question is, what is
the velocity of ball B?

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.840
So velocity is both magnitude
and direction.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.970
So we need to figure
out essentially,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.190
what is ball B doing?

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.190
Ball B is going to be going--
We can just think about it.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.130
If you ever played pool, we
could guess that ball B is

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.055
going to go roughly
in that direction.

00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:05.990
But we need to figure out
exactly what the angle is and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.410
exactly what its velocity is.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.910
So let's do this problem.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.600
So at first you're saying, oh,
Sal, this looks confusing.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.900
You know, I know momentum
should be

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.880
conserved and all that.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.590
But now we have these vectors
and there's two dimensions and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.570
how do I do that?

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.540
And the key here is that there's
just really one more

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.710
step when you're working on it
in two dimensions or really

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.240
three dimensions or an
arbitrary number of

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.340
dimensions.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.770
When we did one dimension, you
made sure that momentum was

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.590
conserved in that
one dimension.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.070
So when you do two dimensions,
what you do is you figure out

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.800
the initial momentum in each
of the dimensions.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.270
So you break it up into the
x and y components.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.710
And then you say the final
momentum of both objects are

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.680
going to equal the initial x
momentum and are going to

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.570
equal the initial y momentum.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.980
So let's figure out the
initial x momentum.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.230
So P for momentum.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.180
 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.390
Because the m is for mass.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.660
So let's say the initial
momentum in the x direction--

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.730
And we don't have to write
initial or final because

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.080
really, the total momentum in
the x direction is always

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.729
going to be the same.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.400
So let's say what the initial--
Actually, let me

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.130
write initial just so it hits
the point home that initial

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.630
and final don't change.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.260
So the initial momentum
in the x direction.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.600
So i for initial, x-- I should
do something better than keep

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.780
writing these subscripts
--is equal to what?

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.770
Well ball B has no
initial velocity,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.280
so it has no momentum.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.600
Ball A is 10 kilograms.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.660
And what is its velocity
in the x direction?

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.590
Well all of its velocity
is in the x direction.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.980
So it's 3.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.550
I mean, this is only moving
in the x direction.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.580
So the momentum in the x
direction is 30 kilogram

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.350
meters per second.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.120
Mass times velocity, kilogram
meters per second.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.710
And what's the initial momentum
in the y direction?

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.880
 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.420
Well B isn't moving at
all, so it has no

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.480
momentum in any direction.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.390
And A, all of A's movement
is in the x direction.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.980
It's not moving at an angle
or up at all, so it has no

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.630
momentum in the y direction.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.030
So we immediately know that
after the collision, the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.590
combined momentum of both of
these balls in the x direction

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.670
has to be 30, and the combined
momentum of both of these

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.040
balls in the y direction
has to be 0.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.580
So let's figure out what A's
momentum in the x and y

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.840
directions are.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.080
So to figure out what A's
momentum is, we just have to

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.040
figure out what A's velocity in
the x and y directions are

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.720
and then multiply that
times the mass.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.240
Because mass doesn't
have any direction.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.400
So let's figure out the x and y
components of this velocity.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.860
Let's do the x component
of the vector first.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.610
So the x is just this vector.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.720
 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.450
Change colors to keep
things interesting.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.230
The y is this vector.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.710
 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.490
That is the y component.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.140
And so, what are those?

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.090
And this hopefully, is going to
be almost second nature to

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.810
you if you've been watching
all of the other videos on

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.880
Newton's laws.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.620
This is just our trigonometry
and we can write out our

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.160
SOH-CAH-TOA again.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.260
And I reassure you, this is
the hardest part of any of

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.019
these multi-dimensional trig
problems-- Multi-dimensional

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.500
physics problems, which really
are just trig problems.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.870
So if we want to figure out
the x component, so the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.880
velocity of A in the
x direction,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.740
what is it equal to?

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.240
Well this is adjacent
to the angle.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.830
We know the hypotenuse.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.592
So we know VA sub x or the
velocity of A in the x

00:04:43.592 --> 00:04:47.470
direction over the hypotenuse,
over 2 meters per second, is

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.770
equal to what?

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.520
Adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.620
Cosine.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.880
Is equal to cosine
of 30 degrees.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.720
Or the velocity of A in the x
direction is equal to 2 cosine

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.420
of 30 degrees.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.300
What's cosine of 30 degrees?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.000
It's square root of 3 over 2.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.580
This is square root
of 3 over 2.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.600
And square root of 3 over
2 times 2 is equal to

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.120
square root of 3.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.650
So this is equal to the square
root of 3 meters per second.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.045
And what is the velocity of
A in the y direction?

00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:31.100
Well hopefully, this second
nature to you as well.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.260
But since opposite over
hypotenuse is equal to the

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.730
sine of 30.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:42.370
So VA in the y direction is
equal to 2 times the sine of

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.605
30 degrees.

00:05:43.605 --> 00:05:46.730
The sine of 30 degrees is 1/2.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.330
So this is 1/2.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.360
1/2 times 2 is equal to
1 meter per second.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.490
So after the collision,
A is moving at 1

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.950
meter per second up.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.100
One meter per second in
the upwards direction.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.100
And it's moving at square root
of 3 meters per second in the

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.830
rightwards direction.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.350
So what is going to be A's
momentum in each of the

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.280
directions?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.810
Well, we figured out its
velocity, so we just multiply

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.160
each of the velocities
times the mass.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.920
So A has a mass of 10 kilograms.
And this is going

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.720
to be the final momentum.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.430
Momentum of A in the x direction
is going to equal

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.630
square root of 3 times 10.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.330
Square root of 3 is the
velocity, 10 is the mass.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:39.350
So it's 10 square roots of 3
kilogram meters per second.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:45.640
And the momentum of A in the y
direction is going to be-- and

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.450
since it's going up, we'll say
its positive --it's 1 meters

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.210
per second is the velocity
times the mass.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.860
So 10 times 1 is 10 kilogram
meter per second.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.730
So now let's figure out B.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.950
Let's do the y direction first
because they add up to 0.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.720
I'm going to switch colors.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.230
We know that the momentum
of-- and this

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.995
is after the collision.

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:12.840
The momentum of A in the y
direction plus momentum of B

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.780
in the y direction have
to equal what?

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.150
What was the initial momentum
in the y direction?

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.450
Right, it was 0.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.040
There was no movement in the
y direction initially.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.940
We know the momentum of
A in the y direction.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.760
It's 10.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.790
10 kilogram meters per second
plus the momentum of B in the

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.040
y direction is equal to 0.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.050
So solving for this, just
subtract 10 from both sides.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:41.080
So the momentum of B in the
y direction is equal to 10

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.360
kilogram meters per second.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.430
 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.700
You know the units.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.900
So if its momentum is 10 in the
y direction, what is its

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.140
velocity in the y direction?

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.810
Well, momentum is equal to
mass times velocity.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:02.520
So we know that 5 times the
velocity in the y direction--

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.660
that's its mass --is
equal to 10.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.410
10 is its momentum.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.970
So the velocity of the y
direction of B must be 2

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.570
meters per second.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.350
So there we go.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.160
We figured out B's velocity.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.110
And so let's say this is B's
velocity vector in the y

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.740
direction is-- And this is
a minus because this is

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.935
equal to minus 10.

00:08:26.935 --> 00:08:30.380
So it's going down.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.740
It was a velocity of positive
1 going up and then the

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.380
minuses carry through and this
is a velocity of minus 2

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.059
meters per second for B
in the y direction.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.340
So now let's figure
out the velocity

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.808
of B in the x direction.

00:08:42.808 --> 00:08:45.540
And I'm running out of space
and it's getting messy.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.860
But we just have to remember
that the momentum of B in

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.480
the-- The momentum of A in the
x direction, which is 10

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:02.810
square root of 3, plus momentum
of B in the x

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.770
direction has to equal what?

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.090
It has to equal the initial
momentum in the x direction,

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.240
which is 30.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.590
So to figure out the momentum
of B in the x direction, we

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.010
just subtract 10 square
root of 3 from 30.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.760
And let's do that.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:24.010
So let's figure out 3 square
root times 10 equals.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:29.630
And then subtract
that from 30.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.300
And we get let's
just say 12.7.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.380
So we know that the momentum
of B in the x direction is

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:43.420
equal to 12.7, 12.7 kilogram
meters per second.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.680
And we know the momentum, so we
just divide by the mass and

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.030
we get its velocity in
the x direction.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.950
So 12.7 divided by 5.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.630
So velocity of B in
the x direction is

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.970
12.7 divided by 5.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:04.460
12.7 divided by 5 is equal to
2.54 meters per second.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.020
So its velocity in the
x direction is

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.080
2.54 meters per second.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.250
So it's going faster
in both directions.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.970
I'm not going to figure out the
angle here because I've

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.650
actually run out of time.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.070
But if you were to add these
two vectors, you'd get an

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.340
angle something like this.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.700
And you could figure out the
angle by taking the arc tan.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.080
Well, I won't go into the--
that's a complexity right now.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.050
Actually, I'll do that in the
next video just so I won't

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.620
leave you hanging.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.660
But we know what the x and y
components of B's velocity is.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.380
See you in the next video.
