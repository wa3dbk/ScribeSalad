00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.635
Lets say you are an Ancient Philosopher who was building up mathematics who was building mathematics from the ground up

00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:13.783
And you already have a reasonable of what a negative number could or should represent and you know how to add and subtract negative numbers

00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:15.767
But now you are faced with a conundrum

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:18.501
What happens when you multiply negative numbers?

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:21.233
Either when you multiply a positive number times a negative number

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.900
Or when you multiply two negative numbers

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.167
So, for example

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:32.502
You aren't quite sure what should happen if you were to multiply (and im just picking two numbers where one is positive and one is negative)

00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:37.081
What would happen if you were to multiply 5 times negative 3

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.773
You're not quite sure about this just yet

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:43.702
You're also not quite sure what would happen if you multiply two negative numbers.

00:00:43.702 --> 00:00:48.669
So lets say negative two times negative 6

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:50.835
This is also unclear to you

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:56.569
What you do know, because you are a mathematician, is however you define this or whatever this should be

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:02.410
It should hopefully be consistant with all of the other properties of mathematics that you already know

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.233
And preferably all of the other properties of multiplication

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:08.233
That would make you feel comfortable that you are getting this right.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:11.233
and later we can think about other ways to get the intuition

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:14.608
for what these might be allowed you to actually make sense

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:18.034
but to make this make consistent with the rest of mathematics

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:21.300
that you know, you go into a little bit of a thought experiment

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.700
you say, well, what should five times

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.524
three plus negative three equal

00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:32.681
well you already have a philosophy of adding negative numbers

00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:35.551
or adding positive numbers to negative numbers, you know negative three is

00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:39.298
the opposite of three, but you add three to negative three

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:42.423
you're going to get zero, so this is going to be equal to

00:01:42.423 --> 00:01:45.520
five times zero

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.102
based on how you already thought about adding a negative number

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:54.369
to a positive, and anything times zero is going to be

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.900
zero, so this expression right over here should be zero

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.283
but you see, I want to multiply positive and negative

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:04.697
numbers to be consistent with this distributive property so

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:07.367
I should should be able to distribute this five

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:12.943
and for math to be consistent, and math should be consistent, I should

00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:16.548
get the exact same answer, so let's distribute this five so

00:02:16.548 --> 00:02:18.103
we get five times three

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:23.417
is going to write out as five times three

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:27.020
let me write this multiplication sign, not this dot

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.434
five times three, so i distributed there

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:35.925
plus five times negative three

00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:39.358
i'll do that in yellow, five times negative three

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:45.843
and this whole thing we just said should be equal to zero

00:02:45.843 --> 00:02:50.700
it should be equal to zero, well five times three

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.843
those are two positive numbers, we should know what should should be, that is going to be fifteen

00:02:54.843 --> 00:02:57.825
now we get this thing, fifteen plus

00:02:57.825 --> 00:03:01.506
times whatever five times negative three is

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:09.433
needs to be equal to zero in order to be consistent with all the other mathematics

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:12.806
that we know, well what plus fifteen is going to

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:16.498
be equal to zero, well the opposite of fifteen in order for this

00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:20.000
to be true, in order for this to be consistent with all the other mathematics we know

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.588
this right over here needs to be equal to

00:03:23.588 --> 00:03:27.690
negative fifteen until you say five times negative three

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.170
in order to be consistent with all other mathematics we know, needs to

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.433
be equal to negative fifteen. That's also consistent

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:38.251
with the intuition of adding negative three repeatedly

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.302
five times, now look above above us

00:03:41.302 --> 00:03:44.769
slightly higher so you can see ideas of multiplying

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.272
two negatives, but we can do the exact same product experiment.

00:03:48.272 --> 00:03:52.033
We want whatever this answer to be consistent with the rest of mathematics

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:53.769
that we know so we can

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.347
do the same product experiment. What would negative two times

00:03:58.347 --> 00:04:02.035
six plus negative six to be equal to.

00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:05.012
Well, six plus negative six is going to be zero.

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:09.145
Negative two times zero, anything times zero, needs to be equal to

00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:12.367
zero, but then once again, we can distribute

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:16.300
negative two times six so we get

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:23.621
negative two times six, then plus negative two times

00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:27.102
negative six plus negative two

00:04:27.102 --> 00:04:30.767
times negative six, then once again all of this is going to be

00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:34.634
equal to zero, now based on the five experiment we just

00:04:34.634 --> 00:04:37.569
did, we said "well this needs to be equal to negative twelve"

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.415
or we can view this as going to the six twice

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:44.501
left direction on the number line which gets us to negative twelve

00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:48.433
or you could say repeatedly adding negative twos

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:52.003
times six would also get you to negative twelve and now

00:04:52.003 --> 00:04:55.147
we also saw over here we want to multiply a positive and a negative

00:04:55.147 --> 00:04:58.769
we got the negative so

00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:02.501
this could be, you know, going to be equal to negative twelve

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.648
so we have negative twelve plus

00:05:05.648 --> 00:05:08.234
whatever this business is

00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:13.833
going to have to be equal to zero (repeated)

00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:17.369
in order to be consistent with all the other mathematics that we know

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:21.621
and so what plus negative twelve is going to equal to be zero

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:25.101
Well, positive twelve plus negative twelve is going to equal to zero

00:05:25.101 --> 00:05:27.835
so this needs to be equal to positive twelve in

00:05:27.835 --> 00:05:31.564
order to be consistent with all the other mathematics we know

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:35.609
so there we get the idea that this is going positive

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:39.153
twelve. I'll leave you there and I'll see

00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:42.569
if I can make a few other videos that can also give you a conceptual understanding

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.569
of why these are true
