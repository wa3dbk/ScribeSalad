00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.450
We know a little bit
about magnets now.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.020
Let's see if we can study it
further and learn a little bit

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.880
about magnetic field and
actually the effects that they

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.960
have on moving charges.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.650
And that's actually really how
we define magnetic field.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.910
So first of all, with any field
it's good to have a way

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.730
to visualize it.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.270
With the electrostatic fields
we drew field lines.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.910
So let's try to do the same
thing with magnetic fields.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.650
Let's say this is
my bar magnet.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.020
This is the north pole and
this is the south pole.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.940
Now the convention, when we're
drawing magnetic field lines,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.410
is to always start at the north
pole and go towards the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.180
south pole.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.470
And you can almost view it as
the path that a magnetic north

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.000
monopole would take.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.490
So if it starts here-- if a
magnetic north monopole, even

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.650
though as far as we know they
don't exist in nature,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.060
although they theoretically
could, but let's just say for

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.800
the sake of argument
that we do have a

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.950
magnetic north monopole.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.950
If it started out here, it would
want to run away from

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.040
this north pole and would try
to get to the south pole.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.940
So it would do something,
its path would look

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.190
something like this.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.110
If it started here, maybe
its path would look

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.360
something like this.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.460
Or if it started here, maybe
its path would look

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.240
something like this.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.280
I think you get the point.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.500
Another way to visualize it is
instead of thinking about a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.610
magnetic north monopole and the
path it would take, you

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.800
could think of, well, what if
I had a little compass here?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.290
Let me draw it in a
different color.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.140
Let's say I put the
compass here.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.625
That's not where I
want to do it.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:38.430
Let's say I do it here.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.110
The compass pointer will
actually be tangent to the

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.310
field line.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.560
So the pointer could
look something like

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.712
this at this point.

00:01:47.712 --> 00:01:50.150
It would look something
like this.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.460
And this would be the north pole
of the pointer and this

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.440
would be the south pole
of the pointer.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.740
Or you could-- that's how north
and south were defined.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.940
People had compasses, they said,
oh, this is the north

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.100
seeking pole, and it points
in that direction.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.740
But it's actually seeking
the south pole

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.580
of the larger magnet.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.949
And that's where we got into
that big confusing discussion

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.980
of that the magnetic geographic
north pole that

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.840
we're used to is actually the
south pole of the magnet that

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.340
we call Earth.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.800
And you could view the last
video on Introduction to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.160
Magnetism to get confused
about that.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.190
But I think you see
what I'm saying.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.100
North always seeks south the
same way that positive seeks

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.430
negative, and vice versa.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.870
And north runs away
from north.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.060
And really the main conceptual
difference-- although they are

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.530
kind of very different
properties-- although we will

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.830
see later they actually end up
being the same thing, that we

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.800
have something called an
electromagnetic force, once we

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.680
start learning about Maxwell's
equations and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.520
relativity and all that.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.030
But we don't have to worry
about that right now.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.090
But in classical electricity and
magnetism, they're kind of

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.660
a different force.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.070
And the main difference--
although you know, these field

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.100
lines, you can kind of view
them as being similar-- is

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.750
that magnetic forces always come
in dipoles, soon. while

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.920
you could have electrostatic
forces that are monopoles.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.110
You could have just a positive
or a negative charge.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.100
So that's fine, you say,
Sal, that's nice.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.130
You drew these field lines.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.260
And you've probably seen it
before if you've ever dropped

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.950
metal filings on top
of a magnet.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.070
They kind of arrange themselves

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.930
along these field lines.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.440
But you might say, well,
that's kind of useful.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.520
But how do we determine the
magnitude of a magnetic field

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.300
at any point?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.950
And this is where it
gets interesting.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.530
The magnitude of a magnetic
field is really determined, or

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.340
it's really defined, in terms of
the effect that it has on a

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.130
moving charge.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.580
So this is interesting.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.640
I've kind of been telling you
that we have this different

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.110
force called magnetism that
is different than the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.610
electrostatic force.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.490
But we're defining magnetism in
terms of the effect that it

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.500
has on a moving charge.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.510
And that's a bit of a clue.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.550
And we'll learn later, or
hopefully you'll learn later

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.540
as you advance in physics,
that magnetic force or a

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.200
magnetic field is nothing but an
electrostatic field moving

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.040
at a very high speed.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.160
At a relativistic speed.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Or you could almost view it as
they are the same thing, just

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.730
from different frames
of reference.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.970
I don't want to confuse
you right now.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.730
But anyway, back to what I'll
call the basic physics.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.730
So if I had to find a magnetic
field as B-- so B is a vector

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.610
and it's a magnetic field-- we
know that the force on a

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.000
moving charge could be an
electron, a proton, or some

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.190
other type of moving
charged particle.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.840
And actually, this is the basis
of how they-- you know,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.830
when you have supercolliders--
how they get the particles to

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.030
go in circles, and how they
studied them by based on how

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.110
they get deflected by
the magnetic field.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.820
But anyway, the force on a
charge is equal to the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.670
magnitude of the charge-- of
course, this could be positive

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.090
or negative-- times, and this is
where it gets interesting,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.000
the velocity of the charge
cross the magnetic field.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.460
So you take the velocity of the
charge, you could either

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.701
multiply it by the scalar first,
or you could take the

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:02.220
cross product then multiply
it by the scalar.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.790
Doesn't matter because
it's just a number,

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.990
this isn't a vector.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.220
But you essentially take the
cross product of the velocity

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.400
and the magnetic field, multiply
that times the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.090
charge, and then you get the
force vector on that particle.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.930
Now there's something that
should immediately-- if you

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.960
hopefully got a little bit of
intuition about what the cross

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.240
product was-- there's something

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.000
interesting going on here.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.760
The cross product cares about
the vectors that are

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.750
perpendicular to each other.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.450
So for example, if the
velocity is exactly

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.450
perpendicular to the magnetic
field, then we'll

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.290
actually get a number.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.900
If they're parallel, then the
magnetic field has no impact

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.180
on the charge.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.340
That's one interesting thing.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.680
And then the other interesting
thing is when you take the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.850
cross product of two vectors,
the result is perpendicular to

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.630
both of these vectors.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.380
So that's interesting.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.040
A magnetic field, in order to
have an effect on a charge,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.080
has to be perpendicular
to its you velocity.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.830
And then the force on it is
going to be perpendicular to

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.460
both the velocity of the charge
and the magnetic field.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.100
I know I'm confusing you at
this point, so let's play

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.680
around with it and
do some problems.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.900
But before that, let's figure
out what the units of the

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.700
magnetic field are.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.910
So we know that the cross
product is the same thing as--

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.970
so let's say, what's the
magnitude of the force?

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.790
The magnitude of the
force is equal to?

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.580
Well, the magnitude of the
charge-- this is just a scalar

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.380
quantity, so it's still just
the charge-- times the

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.650
magnitude of the velocity times
the magnitude of the

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.310
field times the sine of the
angle between them.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.230
This is the definition of a
cross product and then we

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.050
could put-- if we wanted the
actual force vector, we can

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.200
just multiply this times the
vector we get using the

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.720
right-hand rule.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.080
We'll do that in a second.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.230
Anyway we're just focused
on units.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.350
Sine of theta has no units so
we can ignore it for this

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.100
discussion.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.140
We're just trying to figure
out the units of

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.370
the magnetic field.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:06.160
So force is newtons-- so we
could say newtons equals--

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.350
charge is coulombs, velocity is
meters per second, and then

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.910
this is times the-- I don't know
what we'll call this--

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.040
the B units.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.662
We'll call it unit sub B.

00:07:22.662 --> 00:07:23.300
So let's see.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.780
If we divide both sides by
coulombs and meters per

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.930
second, we get newtons
per coulomb.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.890
And then if we divide by meters
per second, that's the

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.850
same thing as multiplying
by seconds per meter.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.800
Equals the magnetic
field units.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.380
So the magnetic field in SI
terms, is defined as newton

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.080
seconds per coulomb meter.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.920
And that might seem a little
disjointed, and they've come

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.970
up with a brilliant name.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.660
And it's named after a deserving
fellow, and that's

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.910
Nikolai Tesla.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:01.400
And so the one newton second
per coulomb meter is

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.210
equal to one tesla.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.150
And I'm actually running out of
time in this video, because

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.650
I want to do a whole
problem here.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.390
But I just want you to sit and
think about it for a second.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.120
Even though in life we're used
to dealing with magnets as we

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.200
have these magnets-- and they're
fundamentally maybe

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.260
different than what at least we
imagine electricity to be--

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.570
but the magnitude or actually
the units of magnetism is

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.840
actually defined in terms of the
effect that it would have

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.100
on a moving charge.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.840
And that's why the unit-- one
tesla, or a tesla-- is defined

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.450
as a newton second
per coulomb.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.530
So the electrostatic charge
per coulomb meter.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.600
Well, I'll leave you
now in this video.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.810
Maybe you can sit
and ponder that.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.010
But it'll make a little bit
more sense when we do some

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.940
actual problems with
some actual

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.240
numbers in the next video.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.490
