00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.850
We're on problem 61.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.170
It says the point minus 3,
2 lies on a circle whose

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.990
equation is x plus 3 squared
plus y plus 1 squared is equal

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.270
to r squared.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.080
Which of the following must be
the radius of the circle?

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.100
So the way to think about it
is, is that this point

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.770
satisfies this equation.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.800
Any point on the equation will
satisfy both sides of this

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.500
equality sign.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290
So all we have to do is
substitute the x and the y

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.850
here and see what r squared
has to be equal to.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.110
So let's do that.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.080
If we substitute the
minus 3 in for x.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.100
You get minus 3, I just
substituted for the x.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.280
Plus 3 squared plus,
now y, y is 2.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.370
2 plus 1 squared is equal
to r squared.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.120
Minus 3 plus 3, that's just 0.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.410
0 squared is 0.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.180
And then 2 plus 1 squared.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.040
So 3 squared is equal
to r squared.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.080
You could say r squared is equal
to 9 and then r is equal

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.060
to 3 because you can't have
a negative radius.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.925
We see immediately that
r is equal to 3.

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:19.020
So all you have to
do is substitute

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.920
the x and the y values.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.410
Because any point that satisfies
this equality is on

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.490
the circle, defined
by this equation.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.460
They say this point is on the
circle, so you just have to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.620
substitute them in and
just solve for r.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.390
Problem 62.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.380
Looks like we're going to
do some trigonometry.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.860
In the figure, below if sine
of x is equal to 5 over 13

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.570
what are the cosine of x
and the tangent of x?

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.370
And I don't know if you've seen
the basic trigonometry

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.190
videos, you might want to.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.450
But a good mnemonic for
memorizing sine, cosine and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.700
tangent is SOHCAHTOA.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.630
And that means SOH is sine is
equal to to opposite over

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.970
hypotenuse.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.770
Cosine is equal to adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.750
And I'll tell you what these
mean in a second.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.760
And tangent, you might have
guessed, is equal to opposite

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.250
over adjacent.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.270
So what does that mean?

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.590
What is all of this mnemonic?

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.810
So just you might want to
remember SOHCAHTOA.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.550
Then you could break
it down like that.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.550
So if I took the sine
of this angle.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.350
That means the opposite side
of this angle over the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.860
hypotenuse is equal to the
sine of this angle.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.170
Let's call this the opposite.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.530
This is the hypotenuse.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.310
This is the adjacent side.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.650
Because it's adjacent
to the angle.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.660
This one is opposite,
hypotenuse, adjacent.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.080
So the sine of x is equal to,
we know from our mnemonic

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.760
SOHCAHTOA, opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.300
And they tell us that that
is equal to 5/13.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.610
So opposite over hypotenuse
is equal to 5/13.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.970
Now we know that that's just
the ratio between the two.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.700
So we don't know.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.990
This could be 10, this
could be 26.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.010
This could be 1 and this
could be 13/5.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.730
Who knows.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.040
That actually doesn't matter.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.670
That's what's neat about
trigonometry.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.585
It's all about the ratio.

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:32.160
So let's just assume
that this is 5.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.050
That the opposite
is equal to 5.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.430
And the hypotenuse
is equal to 13.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.960
Let me pick a different color.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.390
This is a little nauseating.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.860
All right.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.120
So if the opposite soon. is 5
and the hypotenuse is 13, what

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.590
would the adjacent
be equal to?

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.910
We could use the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.700
So we could say the
adjacent squared.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.620
A squared plus the
opposite squared.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.850
So plus 5 squared, plus 25.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.940
Is equal to 13 squared.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.090
13 squared is 169.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.870
If you subtract 25 from both
sides of this equation, you

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.900
get a squared is equal to 144.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.320
A is equal to 12.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.040
We don't know that a is
definitely equal to 12.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.920
But we know that the ratio
of the opposite to

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.579
adjacent is 5 to 12.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.710
Because we just assumed that
the opposite is 5.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.890
Anyway, so they want to know
what are cosine of x and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.040
tangent of x.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.960
So CAH.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.520
SOHCAHTOA.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:38.770
Cosine of x is equal to the
adjacent over the hypotenuse.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.500
The adjacent is 12.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.710
Hypotenuse is 13.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.720
So it's equal to 12/13.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.460
That's the cosine of x.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.140
And the tangent of x is equal
to opposite over adjacent.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.590
TOA, opposite over adjacent.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.430
So opposite is 4,
adjacent is 12.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.080
Equal to 5/12.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.290
And let's see what
choice that is.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.110
That's choice A, cosine
of x is 12/13.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.550
Tangent of x is 5/12.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.530
Next question.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.140
Looks like they want us to learn
a lot of trigonometry

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.760
and geometry.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.540
Which is good.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.040
This is getting you warmed
up for the trig.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.810
In the figure below, sine
of A is equal to 0.7.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.520
So let's call this angle a.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.680
They say what is the
length of AC?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.480
So we want to know that.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.970
Let's call that x.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.330
So SOHCAHTOA.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:39.410
SOH tells us that sine of some
angle, let's call that theta,

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.220
is equal to the opposite
over the hypotenuse.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:52.090
So sine of A, in this example,
is going to be equal to the

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:59.930
opposite, 21, over the
hypotenuse, over x.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.710
And they tell us that the sine
of A is equal to 0.7.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.080
So now we can just solve this
equation for x and we're done.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.410
Let's see.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.980
So if you multiply x times
both sides, you get 21 is

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.670
equal to 0.7x.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.240
And you divide both
sides by 0.7.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.000
You get 21/0.7 is equal to x.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.510
21 divided by 7 is 3.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.740
So 21 divided by 0.7 is 30.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.730
So x is equal to 30.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.540
And that's length AC.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.170
That's choice C.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.030
Next question.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.360
64.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.910
Approximately how many feet
tall is the street light?

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.580
OK, so we can use some
trigonometry here.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.440
So if we know this angle, and
they give us the all of the

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.940
trig ratios for that angle,
we're trying to

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.130
figure out the height.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:10.700
So if I write SOHCAHTOA, what
are we trying to figure?

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.360
So they gave us the adjacent.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.110
This is adjacent to the angle,
it's right beside it.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.250
The height that we're
trying to figure

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.500
out, this is the opposite.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.620
So if we can have a trig you
function that deals with the

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.470
opposite and the adjacent.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.310
Well that's tangent.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.120
TOA.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.020
Tangent of any angle
is equal to the

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.660
opposite over the adjacnet.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:42.030
In this case, tangent of 40
degrees is going to be equal

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.940
to the opposite, the opposite is
h, that's what we're trying

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.080
to solve for, over
the adjacent.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.780
The adjacent is 20 feet.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.120
OK, tangent of 40 degrees isn't
something that most

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.330
people have memorized, that's OK
because they gave it to us.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.140
Tangent of 40 degrees is 0.84.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.850
So we get 0.84 is
equal to h/20.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:15.760
So we can multiply both sides of
that by 20 and we get h is

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.710
equal to 20 times 0.84.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:39.490
And that is equal to 16.8.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.740
And that is choice C.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.900
Problem 65.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.570
Right triangle ABC is
pictured below.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:56.320
Which equation gives the
correct value for BC?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.200
So this is what they want
us to figure out.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.100
This is BC right there.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.970
OK, let's read them.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.710
Let me write SOHCAHTOA, I
actually do this a lot.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:18.070
OK, so they're saying that the
sine of 32 degrees is equal to

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.230
BC over 8.2.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.970
Is that right?

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.290
Sine is opposite over
hypotenuse.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.550
BC is definitely the opposite.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.760
8.2 is not the hypotenuse,
10.6 is the hypotenuse.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.780
So they're doing, this
is the adjacent.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.030
So this is wrong.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.890
So this should be a tangent.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.590
Tangent of 32 is equal
to BC over 8.2.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.740
This is the adjacent side,
adjacent to 32 degrees.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.580
That's the opposite, and
that's the hypotenuse.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.750
So that's not right.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.190
Choice B, cosine of 32.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.160
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:00.210
So cosine of 32 should
be 8.2/10.6.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.870
So this should be an 8.2 here.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.980
So this isn't right.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.550
OK, so the next one, tangent
of 58 degrees.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.050
Where are they getting
that 58?

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.940
Well, they know that this is
32, this is 90, so this is

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.600
going to be 180 minus
32 minus 90.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.300
Because the angles in a triangle
add up to 180.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.670
So this angle right
here is 58.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.390
And now if we use that angle,
we have to relabel opposite

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.190
and adjacent and all that.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.770
So from this angle's point
of view, tangent is

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.420
opposite over adjacent.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.040
So if we write the tangent of
58 is equal to the opposite

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.820
side, should be equal
to 8.2 over its

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.800
adjacent side, over BC.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.190
This is adjacent
to this angle.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.080
It was opposite this
angle, but BC is

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.760
adjacent to this angle.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.040
So that's what they wrote.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.770
So choice C is correct.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.630
And we're done.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.850
I'll see you in the
next video.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.180
Well we're not done with
the whole thing.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.180
I'm done with this video.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.430
