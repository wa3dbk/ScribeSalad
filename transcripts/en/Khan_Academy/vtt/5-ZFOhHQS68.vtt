00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:02.909
Human beings have always observed that if you have

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.862
an object that is moving,

00:00:05.862 --> 00:00:08.434
so this is a moving object,

00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:10.830
traveling to the right here,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.800
that it seems to stop on its own.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.211
That if you do nothing to this moving object,

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:19.500
on its own, this object is going to come to a stop.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.784
It is going to come to rest.

00:00:23.215 --> 00:00:24.537
And on the other side of things,

00:00:24.537 --> 00:00:26.213
if you want to keep an object moving,

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:28.477
you have to keep applying a force to it.

00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:30.334
We've never in our everyday experience

00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:31.628
seen an object that just keeps moving

00:00:31.643 --> 00:00:34.841
on and on forever without anyone acting on it.

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:37.063
It seems like something will always stop.

00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:39.756
And this is why, for most of human history,

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:42.245
probably pre-history, but we definitely know the ancient Greeks

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:45.643
all the way until the early 1600s,

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:49.641
so for at least 2000 years,

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:54.553
the assumption was "objects have a natural tendency to stop."

00:00:54.553 --> 00:01:02.248
Objects ... have ... tendency ... to come to rest or to stop.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:07.003
And if you want to keep them moving,

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:17.326
you have to apply some type of a net force to it.

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:21.784
And once again, this is completly consistent with

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:23.230
everyday human experience,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.925
this is what we've all experienced our entire lives.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:30.364
But then these gentlemen show up in the 1600s,

00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:34.188
and you might be surprised to see three gentlemen here,

00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:36.663
because this is about Newton's first law of motion.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.775
And, indeed, one of these gentlemen is

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:40.434
Sir Isaac Newton.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.899
That's Newton right over there [middle].

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.514
But these other two guys get at least as much credit for it

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:46.746
because they actually described really what

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:48.114
Newton's first Law describes,

00:01:48.114 --> 00:01:49.745
and they did it before Newton.

00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:51.436
This is Galileo.

00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:56.033
And this is Rene Descartes.

00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:58.649
And they describe it in different ways,

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.548
and Newton frankly gets the credit for it

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:02.766
because he really encapsulates into a broader framework

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:05.016
with his other Laws, and the Laws of Gravitation,

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:07.968
which was really the basics of classical mechanics,

00:02:07.968 --> 00:02:11.114
and seem to describe, at least until the 20th Century,

00:02:11.114 --> 00:02:14.413
most of how reality actually worked.

00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:17.381
And their big insight, and it was very unintuitive at the time,

00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:19.965
{so now we come to the 1600s}

00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.215
Is that these three gentlemen said,

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:23.097
maybe it works the other way.

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:36.828
Maybe objects have a tendency to maintain their velocity, their speed and their direction.

00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:41.706
And if their speed is zero, they'll maintain that restfulness.

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:46.093
Unless they're acted upon by an unbalanced force.

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:00.582
So the completly opposite way of thinking.

00:03:00.582 --> 00:03:03.831
For over 2000 years, objects tend to stop on their own,

00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:05.914
if you want to keep the movement, apply a force.

00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:07.332
These guys say,

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:10.087
Objects have a tendency to maintain their motion forever

00:03:10.087 --> 00:03:13.093
and the only way that you're going to stop them is

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:16.115
if you act on it, or accelerate them, or change their velocity,

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:17.949
so either their speed or direction some way,

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:21.617
is to act on them with an unbalanced force.

00:03:21.617 --> 00:03:22.560
But you might be saying,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.051
Hey, come on Sal, what's going on?

00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:25.206
You just went through this,

00:03:25.206 --> 00:03:26.532
you said for most of most of human history,

00:03:26.532 --> 00:03:28.164
including my own personal history,

00:03:28.164 --> 00:03:29.826
this is what I observed [top right].

00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:32.863
How can these guys say that this thing has a tendency to

00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:34.333
go on forever?

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:36.635
This seems to break down.

00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:37.783
And their big insight was,

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:40.498
well, maybe these things don't have, by themselves,

00:03:40.498 --> 00:03:42.968
a tendency to stop, but because of interactions

00:03:42.968 --> 00:03:45.516
with their environment, forces are being generated

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:47.865
that are acting against their motion.

00:03:47.865 --> 00:03:50.600
So when you think you're leaving this thing alone,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.234
there is actualy a net force that is trying to stop it.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.750
And in this particular example over here,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.134
the net force is the force of friction.

00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:04.386
It's the interaction between the block and the ground.

00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:07.135
So, when you think you're leaving this thing alone,

00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:10.851
you actually have a net force going against its motion,

00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:13.100
which is the force of friction.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.359
And these guys realize that,

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.251
because they said,

00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:17.388
look, if it was an innate property of the block,

00:04:17.388 --> 00:04:18.719
regardless of the environment,

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:20.684
it should kind of always come to a stop

00:04:20.684 --> 00:04:22.437
in maybe a similar way.

00:04:22.437 --> 00:04:25.251
But they saw, if you made this surface a little bit smoother

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.486
this thing would travel further and further.

00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:31.060
Maybe if you eliminated this friction,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.352
if you made this surface completely friction-less,

00:04:33.352 --> 00:04:36.312
completely smooth, this thing indeed would travel forever.

00:04:36.312 --> 00:04:38.902
And they didn't have the luxury of launching satellites,

00:04:38.902 --> 00:04:40.787
and doing things in deep space,

00:04:40.787 --> 00:04:44.769
so it was a very, very unintuitive thought experiment.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:46.584
And you might say, what about this other thing,

00:04:46.584 --> 00:04:48.011
what happens when I am applying the force?

00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:49.492
Becuase in my everyday life,

00:04:49.492 --> 00:04:52.008
If I want to drag my TV set across the room

00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:53.791
I apply a force to it.

00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:55.442
And what these guys would tell you

00:04:55.442 --> 00:04:56.298
is all you were doing,

00:04:56.298 --> 00:04:58.644
if you were keeping the velocity of that TV constant,

00:04:58.644 --> 00:05:03.425
all you were doing was counteracting this net negative force.

00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:06.410
So if this was a TV dragging across your carpet,

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.575
this is the force of friction acting against the motion

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:10.811
of the object,

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:14.541
and so you are essentially just balancing it when you push it.

00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:15.791
If you balance it perfectly,

00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:17.791
you will be able to maintain it's velocity.

00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:19.175
If you want to accelerate it,

00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:24.599
you will have to apply even more force in the direction you are actually pushing it.

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:25.199
Many thanks to Sal! :)
