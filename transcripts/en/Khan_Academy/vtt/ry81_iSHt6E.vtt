00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.920
In the last video we figured
out the mean, variance and

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.340
standard deviation for our
Bernoulli Distribution with

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.340
specific numbers.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.120
What I want to do in this video
is to generalize it.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.080
To figure out really the
formulas for the mean and the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.180
variance of a Bernoulli
Distribution if we don't have

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.120
the actual numbers.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.790
If we just know that the
probability of success is p

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.950
and the probability a failure
is 1 minus p.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:31.700
So let's look at this, let's
look at a population where the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.660
probability of success-- we'll
define success as 1-- as

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.450
having a probability of p, and
the probability of failure,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.720
the probability of failure
is 1 minus p.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.420
Whatever this might be.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.690
And obviously, if you add these
two up, if you view them

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.170
as percentages, these are
going to add up to 100%.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.850
Or if you add up these
two values, they are

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.980
going to add to 1.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.230
And that needs to be the case
because these are the only two

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.800
possibilities that can occur.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.150
If this is 60% chance of success
there has to be a 40%

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.890
chance of failure.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.940
70% chance of success, 30%
chance of failure.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.030
Now with this definition of
this-- and this is the most

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.180
general definition of a
Bernoulli Distribution.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.980
It's really exactly what we did
in the last video, I now

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.490
want to calculate the expected
value, which is the same thing

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.180
as the mean of this
distribution, and I also want

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.780
to calculate the variance, which
is the same thing as the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.420
expected squared distance of
a value from the mean.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.940
So let's do that.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.970
So what is the mean over here?

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.310
What is going to be the mean?

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.840
Well that's just the probability
weighted sum of

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.610
the values that this
could take on.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:01.010
So there is a 1 minus p
probability that we get

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.670
failure, that we get 0.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.570
So there's 1 minus
p probability of

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.320
getting 0, so times 0.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.680
And then there is a p
probability of getting 1,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.500
plus p times 1.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.820
Well this is pretty
easy to calculate.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.310
0 times anything is 0.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.840
So that cancels out.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.645
And then p times 1 is
just going to be p.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.280
So pretty straightforward.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.120
The mean, the expected value
of this distribution, is p.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.480
And p might be here
or something.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.480
So once again it's a value that
you cannot actually take

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.950
on in this distribution,
which is interesting.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.380
But it is the expected value.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.030
Now what is going to
be the variance?

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.680
What is the variance of
this distribution?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.890
Remember, that is the weighted
sum of the squared distances

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.400
from the mean.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.200
Now what's the probability
that we get a 0?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.120
We already figured that out.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.040
There's a 1 minus p probability
that we get a 0.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.680
So that is the probability
part.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.860
And what is the squared distance
from 0 to our mean?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.815
Well the squared distance from
0 to our mean-- let me write

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:19.350
it over here-- it's going to be
0, that's the value we're

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.470
taking on-- let me do that in
blue since I already wrote the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.050
0-- 0 minus our mean-- let
me do this in a new

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.060
color-- minus our mean.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.370
That's too similar
to that orange.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.070
Let me do the mean in white.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:42.090
0 minus our mean, which is p
plus the probability that we

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.000
get a 1, which is just p-- this
is the squared distance,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.970
let me be very careful.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.030
It's the probability weighted
sum of the squared distances

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.210
from the mean.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.470
Now what's the distance-- now
we've got a 1-- and what's the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.460
difference between
1 and the mean?

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.630
It's 1 minus our mean, which
is going to be p over here.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.630
And we're going to want to
square this as well.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.350
This right here is going
to be the variance.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.640
Now let's actually
work this out.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.100
So this is going to be
equal to 1 minus p.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.110
Now 0 minus p is going
to be negative p.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.360
If you square it you're just
going to get p squared.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.340
So it's going to be p squared.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:31.390
Then plus p times-- what's
1 minus p squared?

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:38.570
1 minus p squared is going to be
1 squared, which is just 1,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.020
minus 2 times the
product of this.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.710
So this is going to be minus
2p right over here.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.830
And then plus negative
p squared.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.070
So plus p squared
just like that.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.650
And now let's multiply
everything out.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.950
This is going to be, this term
right over here is going to be

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.070
p squared minus p
to the third.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.300
And then this term over here,
this whole thing over here, is

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.420
going to be plus
p times 1 is p.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.840
p times negative 2p is
negative 2p squared.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.460
And then p times p squared
is p to the third.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.710
Now we can simplify these.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.290
p to the third cancels out
with p to the third.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.740
And then we have p squared
minus 2p squared.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.900
So this right here becomes,
you have this p right over

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.100
here, so this is equal to p.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.800
And then when you add p squared
to negative 2p squared

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.820
you're left with negative p
squared minus p squared.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.910
And if you want to factor a p
out of this, this is going to

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.590
be equal to p times, if you take
p divided p you get a 1,

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.380
p square divided by p is p.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.480
So p times 1 minus p, which is
a pretty neat, clean formula.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.250
So our variance is p
times 1 minus p.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.060
And if we want to take it to the
next level and figure out

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.080
the standard deviation, the
standard deviation is just the

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.270
square root of the variance,
which is equal to the square

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.890
root of p times 1 minus p.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.560
And we could even verify that
this actually works for the

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.500
example that we did up here.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.880
Our mean is p, the probability
of success.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.280
We see that indeed it
was, it was 0.6.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.280
And we know that our variance is
essentially the probability

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.140
of success times the probability
of failure.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.620
That's our variance
right over there.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.290
The probability of success
in this example was 0.6,

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.070
probability of failure
was 0.4.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.290
You multiply the two, you get
0.24, which is exactly what we

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.540
got in the last example.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.440
And if you take its square
root for the standard

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.810
deviation, which is what we
do right here, it's 0.49.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.230
So hopefully you found that
helpful, and we're going to

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.210
build on this later on in some
of our inferential statistics.
