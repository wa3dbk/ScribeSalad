00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.590
We're now going to learn a
little bit about gravity.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.590
And just so you know, gravity is
something that, especially

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.620
in introductory physics or
even reasonably advanced

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.600
physics, we can learn how to
calculate it, we can learn how

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.650
to realize what are the
important variables in it, but

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.050
it's something that's really
not well understood.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.940
Even once you learn general
relativity, if you do get

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.880
there, I have to say, you can
kind of say, oh, well, it's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.120
the warping of space time and
all of this, but it's hard to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.190
get an intuition of why two
objects, just because they

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.690
have this thing called
mass, they are

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.640
attracted to each other.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.170
It's really, at least to me,
a little bit mystical.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.240
But with that said, let's learn
to deal with gravity.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.140
And we'll do that learning
Newton's Law of Gravity, and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.620
this works for most purposes.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.640
So Newton's Law of Gravity says
that the force between

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.140
two masses, and that's the
gravitational force, is equal

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.990
to the gravitational constant G
times the mass of the first

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.500
object times the mass of the
second object divided by the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.890
distance between the two
objects squared.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.860
So that's simple enough.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.320
So let's play around with this,
and see if we can get

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.490
some results that look
reasonably familiar to us.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.120
So let's use this formula
to figure out what the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.070
acceleration, the gravitational
acceleration, is

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.120
at the surface of the Earth.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.130
So let's draw the Earth,
just so we know what

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.380
we're talking about.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.630
So that's my Earth.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.060
And let's say we want to figure
out the gravitational

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.260
acceleration on Sal.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.510
That's me.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.770
And so how do we apply this
equation to figure out how

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.490
much I'm accelerating down
towards the center of Earth or

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.950
the Earth's center of mass?

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.890
The force is equal to-- so
what's this big G thing?

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.010
The G is the universal
gravitational constant.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.330
Although, as far as I know, and
I'm not an expert on this,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.620
I actually think its measurement
can change.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.390
It's not truly, truly a
constant, or I guess when on

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.840
different scales, it can be
a little bit different.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.700
But for our purposes, it is a
constant, and the constant in

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.520
most physics classes, is this:
6.67 times 10 to the negative

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.546
11th meters cubed per kilogram
seconds squared.

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:27.470
I know these units are crazy,
but all you have to realize is

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.005
these are just the units needed,
that when you multiply

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:33.040
it times a mass and a mass
divided by a distance squared,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.930
you get Newtons, or kilogram
meters per second squared.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.360
So we won't worry so much about
the units right now.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.610
Just realize that you're going
to have to work with meters in

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.420
kilograms seconds.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.620
So let's just write
that number down.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.440
I'll change colors to
keep it interesting.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.080
6.67 times 10 to the negative
11th, and we want to know the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.190
acceleration on Sal, so
m1 is the mass of Sal.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.490
And I don't feel like revealing
my mass in this

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.240
video, so I'll just leave
it as a variable.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.430
And then what's the mass 2?

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.950
It's the mass of Earth.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.820
And I wrote that here.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.250
I looked it up on Wikipedia.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.410
This is the mass of Earth.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.890
So I multiply it times the
mass of Earth, times 5.97

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.670
times 10 to the 24th kilograms--
weighs a little

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.700
bit, not weighs, is a little
bit more massive than Sal--

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.900
divided by the distance
squared.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.420
Now, you might say, well, what's
the distance between

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.990
someone standing on the
Earth and the Earth?

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.080
Well, it's zero because they're
touching the Earth.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.130
But it's important to realize
that the distance between the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.570
two objects, especially when
we're talking about the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.910
universal law of gravitation, is
the distance between their

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.310
center of masses.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.290
For all general purposes, my
center of mass, maybe it's

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.610
like three feet above
the ground, because

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.500
I'm not that tall.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.510
It's probably a little bit lower
than that, actually.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.760
Anyway, my center of mass might
be three feet above the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.380
ground, and where's Earth's
center of mass?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.330
Well, it's at the center of
Earth, so we have to know the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.800
radius of Earth, right?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.120
So the radius of Earth is--
I also looked it up on

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.290
Wikipedia-- 6,371 kilometers.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.490
How many meters is that?

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.100
It's 6 million meters, right?

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.470
And then, you know, the extra
meter to get to my center of

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.079
mass, we can ignore for now,
because it would be .001, so

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:16.970
we'll ignore that for now.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.120
So it's 6-- and soon.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.290
I'll write it in scientific
notation since everything else

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.230
is in scientific notation--
6.371 times 10 to the sixth

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.860
meters, right?

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.610
6,000 kilometers is
6 million meters.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.660
So let's write that down.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.580
So the distance is going
to be 6.37 times 10

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.470
to the sixth meters.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.430
We have to square that.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.560
Remember, it's distance
squared.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.830
So let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.670
Let's just multiply those top
numbers first. Force is equal

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.910
to-- let's bring the
variable out.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.550
Mass of Sal times-- let's
do this top part.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:17.470
So we have 6.67 times 5.97
is equal to 39.82.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.670
And I just multiplied this times
this, so now I have to

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.160
multiply the 10's.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.590
So 10 to the negative 11th times
10 to the negative 24th.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.065
We can just add the exponents.

00:05:25.065 --> 00:05:26.850
They have the same base.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.360
So what's 24 minus 11?

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.030
It's 10 to the 13th, right?

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.610
And then what does the
denominator look like?

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.510
It's going to be the 6.37
squared times 10

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.270
to the sixth squared.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.010
So it's going to be-- whatever
this is is going to be like 37

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.900
or something-- times-- what's
10 to the sixth squared?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.650
It's 10 to the 12th, right?

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.120
10 to the 12th.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.586
So let's figure out what
6.37 squared is.

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:56.434
This little calculator I have
doesn't have squared, so I

00:05:56.434 --> 00:06:09.650
have to-- so it's 40.58.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.740
And so simplifying it, the force
is equal to the mass of

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:31.990
Sal times-- let's divide, 39.82
divided by 40.58 is

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:38.290
equal to 9.81.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.130
That's just this divided
by this.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.770
And then 10 to the 13th divided
by 10 to the 12th.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.200
Actually no, this isn't 9.81.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.150
Sorry, it's 0.981.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.700
0.981, and then 10 to the 13th
divided by 10 to the 12th is

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.560
just 10, right?

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.160
10 to the first, times 10,
so what's 0.981 times 10?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.710
Well, the force is equal to 9.81
times the mass of Sal.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.550
And where does this get us?

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.780
How can we figure out the
acceleration right now?

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.220
Well, force is just mass times
acceleration, right?

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.800
So that's also going to just be
equal to the acceleration

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.790
of gravity-- that's supposed to
be a small g there-- times

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.310
the mass of Sal, right?

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.265
So we know the gravitational
force is 9.81 times the mass

00:07:25.265 --> 00:07:27.570
of Sal, and we also know that
that's the same thing as the

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.760
acceleration of gravity
times the mass of Sal.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.840
We can divide both sides by the
mass of Sal, and we have

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.390
the acceleration of gravity.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.820
And if we had used the units the
whole way, you would have

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.470
seen that it is kilograms meters
per second squared.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.880
And we have just shown that, at
least based on the numbers

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.090
that they've given in Wikipedia,
the acceleration of

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.170
gravity on the surface of the
Earth is almost exactly what

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.450
we've been using in all the
projectile motion problems.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.290
It's 9.8 meters per
second squared.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.570
That's exciting.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.830
So let's do another quick
problem with gravity, because

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.570
I've got two minutes.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.390
Let's say there's another
planet called the

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.380
planet Small Earth.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:15.760
And let's say the radius of
Small Earth is equal to 1/2

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.380
the radius of Earth and the mass
of Small Earth is equal

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.280
to 1/2 the mass of Earth.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.750
So what's the pull of gravity
on any object, say same

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.170
object, on this?

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.880
How much smaller would
it be on this planet?

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.952
Well, actually let me save
that to the next video,

00:08:33.952 --> 00:08:34.789
because I hate being rushed.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.500
So I'll see you
