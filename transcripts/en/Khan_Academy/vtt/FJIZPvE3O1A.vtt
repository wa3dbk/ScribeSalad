00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.790
We're on problem 71.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.830
It says, what is the value of
x in the triangle below?

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.360
OK, so we can pull out the
Pythagorean theorem here.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.390
Although, you might recognize
that if these two sides are

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.480
the same, then these
two base angles are

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.630
going to be the same.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.080
And if those base angles are
the same, then you have 90

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.045
degrees to go between those two
angles, so they're going

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:24.110
to have to be 45.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.360
Because they're the same.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.080
So this is a 45, 45,
90 triangle.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.430
And if you haven't already,
you'll eventually memorize how

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.735
the sides of a 45, 45, 90 relate
to its hypotenuse.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:36.980
But you don't have
to memorize.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.710
You can prove it here.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.480
Sometimes it's just faster
on standardized tests

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.530
and things like that.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.370
So what does the Pythagorean
theorem tell us?

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.600
It tells us that this side
squared, so let's say x

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.660
squared, plus this side squared,
plus x squared is

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.370
equal to the hypotenuse
squared.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.890
Is equal to 10 squared,
which is 100.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.980
So we get 2x squared
is equal to 100.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.380
x squared is equal to 50.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.480
Dividing both sides by 2.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.830
And then what does
this turn into?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.270
So we can say x is equal to
the square root of 50.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.140
Is there anything that we can do
here to simplify it at all.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.060
Let me think.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.090
Oh sure, 50 is 25 times 2.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.150
So that's equal to the square
root of 25 times the

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.490
square root of 2.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.760
Which is equal to 5 times
the square root of 2.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.210
Choice B.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.910
Problem 72.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.670
What is the value
of x in inches?

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.690
OK, a couple of problems ago, we
saw a 30, 60, 90 triangle,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.770
this is another one.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.060
30 degrees, 90 degrees, they
have to add up to 180, this

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.310
one is equal to 60 degrees.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.340
And I did that big convoluted
drawing where I flipped it and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.790
all of that.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.950
I think this is a good time to
just to memorize the sides of

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.000
a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.360
Because that's something that
one needs to know in life.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.500
It's surprisingly useful.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.830
Especially once you start taking
standardized tests or

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.650
do trigonometry.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.440
So I'll just give you
the general rule.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.350
So let me just draw another
one right here.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.280
Let's say this is my other
30, 60, 90 triangle.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.800
This is clearly the hypotenuse
up here.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.930
This is, I call it the 30 degree
side, it's opposite the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.420
30 degree angle, or it's
the shortest side.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.290
So the general rule is, if this
side right here is x.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.670
Then the hypotenuse
is going to be 2x.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.820
And we saw that in that
previous video.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.700
And then you can actually use
the Pythagorean theorem here

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.400
to solve for this last side.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.450
You really just need to memorize
that the hypotenuse

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.760
is twice the shortest side.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.570
So this case, what's
the shortest side?

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.160
It's opposite the
30 degree side.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.010
So it's 7.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.300
So the hypotenuse would be
twice that, which is 14.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.990
And you could use the
Pythagorean theorem to

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.270
figure out x now.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.140
Or you could just memorize that
the middle side, I guess

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.940
you could say, or the long
non-hypotenuse side, or the 60

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.660
degree side, the side opposite
the 60 degree angle, that's

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.120
equal to the square root of
3 times the short side.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.900
So in this case, x is the square
root of 3 times 7.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.910
So x is equal to 7 times
the square root of 3.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.190
And don't take my word for it.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.220
You could take my word for
that this is double that.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.280
And we proved that in a
couple of videos ago.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.690
But you could do the Pythagorean
theorem here.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.200
You could say that 7 squared,
which is 49 , plus x squared

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.490
is going to be equal to the
hypotenuse squared.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:52.490
14 squared is 196.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.090
Subtract 49 from both sides.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:08.990
You get x squared is equal to
196 minus 50 would be 157, is

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.390
that right?

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.330
Let me make sure I got it.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.200
14 times 14.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.370
4 times 4 is 16.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.730
56.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.670
140, right.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.500
196.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.270
And if you were to subtract 49
from that, this is an 8, this

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.060
is 16, we have a 7.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.280
Sorry, 147.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.530
It's a good thing
I checked that.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.050
All right.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.520
So x is equal to the
square root of 147.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.490
147 is 49 times 3.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.300
It's equal to the square
root of 49 times 3.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.270
Well that's just equal to the
square root of 49 times the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.720
square root of 3.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.270
Which is equal to 7 root 3.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.510
Which is what we got.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.650
But it might be easier to just
memorize that the side

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.660
opposite the 60 degree side, is
going to be the square root

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.380
3 times the short side.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.630
And the short side is going
to be half the hypotenuse.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.190
Anyway, the more practice
you do, the more

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.840
it will make sense.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.860
OK, a square is circumscribed
about a circle.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.320
What is the ratio
of the circle to

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.480
the area of the square?

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.850
Let me draw the circle
and the square.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.220
Well, I think that's
close enough.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.910
We know the square is on
the outside because

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.190
it's about the circle.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.510
What is the ratio of the area
of the circle to the area of

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.120
the square?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.270
So let's say this is
the center of the

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.940
circle right there.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.112
This is its radius.

00:06:05.112 --> 00:06:07.250
Let's call that r.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.910
Well what's the area of the
square going to be?

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.540
If that's the radius, this
is also the radius.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.550
So one side of this square up
here, is going to be 2r.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.040
So this side is also
going to be 2r.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.960
It's a square, all the
sides are the same.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.600
So they want to know the ratio
of the area of the circle to

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.850
the area of the square.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.390
The area of the square
is just 2r times 2r.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.355
Which is 4r squared.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.310
Area of the circle is
just pi r squared.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.530
You hopefully learned the
formula for area of a circle.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.940
Divide the numerator and the
denominator by r squared.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.760
You're left with pi/4.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.060
That's choice D.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.330
Problem 75.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.170
In the circle below, AB and CD
are chords intersecting at E.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.950
Fair enough.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:26.620
If AE is equal to 5, BE is
equal to 12, what is

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.130
the value of DE?

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.380
CE is equal to 6.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.290
What is the value of DE.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.260
Let's call that x.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.950
Now, I'm not going to prove it
here, just for saving time.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.470
But there's a neat property
of chords within a circle.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.970
That if I have two chords
intersecting a circle, it

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.970
turns out that the two segments
when you multiply

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.720
them times each other, are
always going to be equal to

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.790
the same thing.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:03.560
So in this case, 5 times 12.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:10.390
So the two segments of chord
AB, so 5 times 12.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.510
That's going to be equal to
these two segments multiplied

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.760
by each other.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.290
It's going to be equal
to x times 6.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.900
So you get 60 is equal to 6x.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.350
Divide both sides by 6, you
get x is equal to 10.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.700
And that is choice C.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.530
That might be a fun thing for
you to think about after this

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.600
video of why that is.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.720
And maybe you want to play
around with chords and prove

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.080
to yourself that that's
always the case.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.289
At least that it
makes intuition

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.250
for you, makes sense.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.280
RB is tangent to a circle.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.910
Tangent means that it just
touches the outside of the

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.810
circle right there at
only one point.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.300
And it's actually perpendicular
to the radius at

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.870
that point.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.510
So this is the radius
of that point.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.920
The center is at A.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.100
This is a radius.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.740
And it's tangent at point B, so
it's perpendicular to the

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.260
radius at that point.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.240
BD is a diameter,
OK, fair enough.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.775
Well A is the center, so
that's kind of obvious.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.070
So they want to know what is
the measure of angle CBR.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.040
So they want to know what
this angle is equal to.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.360
Well, I kind of did
it inadvertently.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.310
We know that when a line is
tangent to a circle, it's

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.900
perpendicular to the radius
at that point.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.790
So this whole angle
is 90 degrees.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.330
So the angle that we're
trying to figure out,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.410
let's call that x.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.030
That's the complement to 25.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.460
x plus 25 is equal to 90.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:56.750
Subtract 25 from both sides.
x is equal to 65 degrees.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.545
And that is choice B.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.770
OK, I'll see you in
the next video.
