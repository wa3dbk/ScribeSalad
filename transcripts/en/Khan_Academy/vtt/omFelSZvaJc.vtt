00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.920
I thought I would do another
example of the partial quotient

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.370
method for long division,
so that it actually

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.619
has some positives to it, it
actually is kind of fun to do.

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:10.660
So let's say I want to do
something really hairy,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.160
like 291 divided into--
let me just throw

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.861
some digits over
here-- 390-- actually,

00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:21.610
let's throw another
digit right over here.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.050
So this is, how
many times does 291

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.440
go into-- what is
this-- 9,873,952?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.770
And to just kind of
get our bearings,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.029
we know what 291 times 1 is.

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.820
That's pretty easy.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.590
291 times 1 is clearly just 291.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.270
We know what 291 times 10 is.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.252
That's clearly 2,910.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:47.550
Now let's get some stuff in
between here that will help us

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.840
as we try to approximate
how many times 291 goes

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.380
into this crazy thing over here.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.270
So let's just pick.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.730
And in the last example,
I picked 2 and 5.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.602
You could just pick
3 and 6 if you want.

00:00:58.602 --> 00:00:59.560
You could pick 2 and 7.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.560
You could pick
whatever you want.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.250
You could even just do 1, one
of them, one of the above.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.700
But let's just say 291 times--
let's try 3 out-- 291 times 3.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.260
So I could do this in my head.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.110
Or just make sure I
don't make a mistake,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.520
let me do it right over here.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.480
So 291 times 3 is--
1 times 3 is 3.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.950
9 times 3 is 27.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.700
2 times 3 is 6.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.390
6 plus 2 is 8.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.220
So this is equal to 873.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.010
It's actually strange that
873 showed up over there.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.410
Maybe my brain is doing strange
things in the background.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.159
But anyway, that has
actually no relevance

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.580
to the actual solution
of this problem.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.146
And let's also try 291 times 6.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.270
Let's figure out what that is.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.110
So 291 times 6, it's
actually just going

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.330
to be this thing times 2.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.660
But I'll just calculate it.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.120
291 times 6-- 1 times 6 is 6.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.330
9 times 6 is 54.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.720
2 times 6 is 12, plus 5 is 17.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.889
So it's 1,746.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.850
And you might say,
Sal, why did you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.210
go through the trouble of
figuring out this and this?

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.280
And I'm just using these
as some approximation tools

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.380
when we try to figure out
how many times 291 goes

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.895
into this whole crazy mess.

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:23.340
So first of all, let's just
look at this whole thing.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.785
This is 9,873,000.

00:02:25.785 --> 00:02:28.720
So let's just say, how
many times does 291

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.180
go into 9 million?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.720
So 291 times 3 would be 873.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.700
We want to have a bunch
of zeros after the 873.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.550
So think of it this way--
and I'm picking 873,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.910
because its leading digit is
as close to the 9 as possible.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.420
But it's definitely
lower than the 9.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.070
So you say, OK,
873-- and I'm going

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.060
to have one, two, three,
four zeros behind it.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.086
So 291 times 3 will give me 873.

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:02.460
But I have to
multiply it times 3

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.830
with one, two, three,
four zeros to get

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.940
this number, 8.73 million.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.640
So I have to multiply
it by 30,000.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.500
But I got that straight from
this idea, that 291 times 3

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.320
is 873.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.930
So let's subtract
this right over here.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.880
Let's subtract this,
2 minus 0 is 2.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.170
5, 9, 3, 7 minus 3 is 4.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.750
8 minus 7 is 1.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.260
9 minus 8 is 1.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.870
So now we're left
with 1,143,952.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.190
So which of these just
gets us right under that?

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.105
So let's see.

00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:43.830
Let's see.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.750
If we want to go to-- we
can't go straight to 1,746,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.410
that will be too big over here.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.300
We might want to do 873 again.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.590
But this time, we're
going to do it 873,000.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.460
That is equal to 3-- and then
you have one, two, three zeros,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.110
so one, two, three.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.330
3 times 291 is 873.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.240
3,000 is 873,000.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.910
Let me write this a
little bit neater.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:19.620
My handwriting is-- so this is
going to be 3,000 times 291.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.750
And just let me make sure.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.959
This is a 2 right over here.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.310
2 minus 0 is 2.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.110
And then you subtract again.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.630
2 minus 0 is 2.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.370
5 minus 0 is 5.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.850
9 minus 0 is 9.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.390
3 minus 3 is 0.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.460
And then you have 4 minus 7.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.040
So the way I like
to do it when I

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.730
have to start
regrouping and borrowing

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.810
is making sure I
go from the left.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.030
So this 1, I could
borrow from there,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.310
so that this becomes an 11.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.280
And then the 4, I can
borrow 1 from here,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.400
so that becomes a 10.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.160
And then this becomes a 14.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.090
So 14 minus 7 is 7.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.480
10 minus 8 is 2.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.435
So I'm down to 270,952.

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:04.464
So what's right below that?

00:05:04.464 --> 00:05:06.130
So it seems that we
can get pretty close

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.310
if we do 291 times 6,
so if you do a 1,746

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.240
and then add two zeros to it.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.590
This is going to be
times 6 with two zeros,

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.290
so this is times 600.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.561
Once again, you subtract.

00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:24.810
And let's say I'm only using
the sixes and the threes,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.180
because I figured those
out ahead of time,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.763
so I didn't have to
do any extra math.

00:05:27.763 --> 00:05:29.690
So 2 minus 0 is 2.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.400
5 minus 0 is 5.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.240
9 minus 6 is 3.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.360
0 minus 4-- well,
there's a couple

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.320
of ways you could
think about doing this.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.840
You could borrow from here.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.030
That will become a 6.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.450
This becomes a 10.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.640
10 minus 4 is 6.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.160
Now this one's lower, so
it has to borrow as well.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.950
Make this into a 16.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.107
16 minus 7-- and I have multiple
videos on how to borrow,

00:05:53.107 --> 00:05:54.440
if I'm doing that part too fast.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.440
But the idea here is to
show you a different way

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.170
of long division.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.690
So 16 minus 7 is 9.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.710
So now we're at 96,352.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.530
And once again, it
looks like the 873

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.070
is about as close as we can get.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.090
So let me put a 873 over
here with two zeros.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.990
So that would literally
be 291 times 3

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.960
with two zeros times 300.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.870
And so once again, we
want to subtract here.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.860
2 minus 0-- you
get a 2, a 5, a 0.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.180
Make this a 16.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.020
Make this an 8.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.400
16 minus 7 is 9.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.760
And then we have to
get close to 9,052.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.020
Once again, that 873, those
digits look pretty good, 873.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.780
We have to multiply
3 and then 10,

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.950
so this is going to be
times 30 right over here.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.720
We subtract again.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.130
2 minus 0 is 2.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.460
5 minus 3 is 2.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.337
And then you have
90 minus 87 is 3.

00:06:52.337 --> 00:06:54.670
I'm doing the subtraction a
little fast, just so that we

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.690
can get the general idea.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.820
Then we have to go into 322.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.853
And how can we
get close to that?

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:03.311
Well, actually, 291 is
pretty darn close to that.

00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:06.260
So you go into it one time.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.710
1 times 291 is 291.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.990
2 minus 1 is 1.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.070
32 minus 29 is 3.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.730
So you have a remainder of 31.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.714
291 cannot go into 31 any
more, so that's our remainder.

00:07:19.714 --> 00:07:21.130
But how many times
did it actually

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.080
go into this big,
beastly number?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.114
This 9,873,952?

00:07:26.114 --> 00:07:27.530
Well there, we
just have to add up

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.960
all of these right over here.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.890
30 plus 3,000-- we can even do
it in our head-- 30 plus 3,000

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.636
is 33,000.

00:07:34.636 --> 00:07:46.330
33,600, 33,900,
33,931, and we are

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.380
done, assuming I haven't
made some silly mistake.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.275
291 goes into this thing 33,931
times with a remainder of 31.
