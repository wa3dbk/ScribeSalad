00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.960
We're asked to represent the
inequality y is greater than 5

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.790
on a number line and on
the coordinate plane.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.300
Let's do the number
line first.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.970
Let me just draw out
a number line.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.420
That's my number line, all
the possible values of y.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.560
Let's make that 0 on
the number line.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.000
We could obviously go into
negative numbers, but we're

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.750
going to be greater than
5, so I'll focus on

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.620
the positive side.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:31.940
So let's say that's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, and then 6, 7, so

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.000
forth and so on.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.350
This number line represents y,
and y is going to be greater

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.160
than 5, not greater
than or equal to.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.790
So we're not going to be
including 5 in the numbers

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.240
that can be y.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.790
So we're not going to include
5, so we're going to do an

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.530
open circle around 5, and all
of the other values greater

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.470
than 5 will be included.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.990
So if there was a greater than
or equal to sign, we would

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.830
have filled it in, but since
it's just greater than, we're

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.330
not including the 5.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.360
So we've represented it
on the number line.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.900
Let's do the same thing on
the coordinate plane.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.010
Let me draw a coordinate
plane here.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.620
I'm just using the standard
convention.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.760
That is my y-axis right there.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.540
And then the horizontal axis,
I'll just assume is my x-axis.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.740
Let me draw some y values,
positive y values.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.910
That is 5 right there, and you
go 6, 7, you can just keep

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.180
going into larger and
larger numbers.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.250
And we want y to be greater than
5, so it's not going to

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.770
be greater than or equal to.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.920
So we're not going
to include 5.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.170
So at 5, at y is equal to 5,
we will draw a dotted line.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.310
That shows that we're not
including y is equal to 5, but

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.750
we want include all of the other
values greater than 5.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.580
So that we will shade in.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.540
So here we have shaded in all of
the values greater than 5.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.070
If it was greater than or equal
to 5, we would have

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.590
drawn a bold line over here.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.610
So no matter what x is, no
matter what x we pick, y is

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.310
going to be greater than 5.
