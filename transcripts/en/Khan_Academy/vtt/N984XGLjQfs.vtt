00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.310
In the last video, we came up
with a 95% confidence interval

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.610
for the mean weight loss between
the low-fat group and

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.950
the control group.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.280
In this video, I actually want
to do a hypothesis test,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.220
really to test if this data
makes us believe that the

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.590
low-fat diet actually does
anything at all.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.980
And to do that let's set up
our null and alternative

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.380
hypotheses.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.610
So our null hypothesis
should be that this

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.560
low-fat diet does nothing.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.280
And if the low-fat diet does
nothing, that means that the

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.330
population mean on our low-fat
diet minus the population mean

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.690
on our control should
be equal to zero.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.810
And this is a completely
equivalent statement to saying

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.760
that the mean of the sampling
distribution of our low-fat

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.150
diet minus the mean of the
sampling distribution of our

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.780
control should be
equal to zero.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.970
And that's because we've seen
this multiple times.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.570
The mean of your sampling
distribution is going to be

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.700
the same thing as your
population mean.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.470
So this is the same
thing is that.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.940
That is the same
thing is that.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.580
Or, another way of saying it is,
if we think about the mean

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.870
of the distribution of the
difference of the sample

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.420
means, and we focused on this
in the last video, that that

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.580
should be equal to zero.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.480
Because this thing right over
here is the same thing as that

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.400
right over there.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.380
So that is our null
hypothesis.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.530
And our alternative hypothesis,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.420
I'll write over here.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.295
It's just that it actually
does do something.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.960
And let's say that it actually
has an improvement.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.270
So that would mean that we
have more weight loss.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.390
So if we have the mean of Group
One, the population mean

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.570
of Group One minus the
population mean of Group Two

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.350
should be greater then zero.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.050
So this is going to be a one
tailed distribution.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.460
Or another way we can view it,
is that the mean of the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.470
difference of the distributions,
x1 minus x2 is

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.270
going to be greater then zero.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.360
These are equivalent
statements.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.160
Because we know that this is the
same thing as this, which

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.920
is the same thing as this,
which is what I

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.380
wrote right over here.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.200
Now, to do any type of
hypothesis test, we have to

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.825
decide on a level
of significance.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.580
What we're going to do is, we're
going to assume that our

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.390
null hypothesis is correct.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.200
And then with that assumption
that the null hypothesis is

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.110
correct, we're going to see
what is the probability of

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.330
getting this sample data
right over here.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.570
And if that probability is below
some threshold, we will

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.090
reject the null hypothesis in
favor of the alternative

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.050
hypothesis.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.150
Now, that probability threshold,
and we've seen this

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.390
before, is called the
significance level, sometimes

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.560
called alpha.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.340
And here, we're going to decide
for a significance

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.960
level of 95%.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.150
Or another way to think about
it, assuming that the null

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.770
hypothesis is correct, we want
there to be no more than a 5%

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.410
chance of getting this
result here.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.240
Or no more than a 5% chance of
incorrectly rejecting the null

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.170
hypothesis when it
is actually true.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.470
Or that would be a
type one error.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.290
So if there's less than a 5%
probability of this happening,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.450
we're going to reject
the null hypothesis.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.130
Less than a 5% probability given
the null hypothesis is

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.480
true, then we're going to reject
the null hypothesis in

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.630
favor of the alternative.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.990
So let's think about this.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.960
So we have the null
hypothesis.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.330
Let me draw a distribution
over here.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:01.180
The null hypothesis says that
the mean of the differences of

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.470
the sampling distributions
should be equal to zero.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.550
Now, in that situation, what
is going to be our critical

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.510
region here?

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.110
Well, we need a result, so
we're going to need some

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.959
critical value here.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:28.010
Because this isn't a
normalized normal

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.180
distribution.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.070
But there's some critical
value here.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.880
The hardest thing is statistics
is getting the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.760
wording right.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.440
There's some critical value here
that the probability of

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.750
getting a sample from this
distribution above that value

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.000
is only 5%.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.940
So we just need to figure out
what this critical value is.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.490
And if our value is larger than
that critical value, then

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.300
we can reject the
null hypothesis.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.050
Because that means the
probability of getting this is

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.460
less than 5%.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.550
We could reject the null
hypothesis and go with the

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.860
alternative hypothesis.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.760
Remember, once again, we can
use Z-scores, and we can

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.510
assume this is a normal
distribution because our

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.280
sample size is large for either
of those samples.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.700
We have a sample size of 100.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.660
And to figure that out, the
first step, if we just look at

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:33.240
a normalized normal distribution
like this, what

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.650
is your critical Z value?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.340
We're getting a result
above that Z value,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.960
only has a 5% chance.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.080
So this is actually
cumulative.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.280
So this whole area right
over here is

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.310
going to be 95% chance.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.760
We can just look
at the Z table.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.660
We're looking for 95% percent.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.390
We're looking at the
one tailed case.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.150
So let's look for 95%.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.550
This is the closest thing.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.090
We want to err on the side of
being a little bit maybe to

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.210
the right of this.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.040
So let's say 95.05
is pretty good.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.150
So that's 1.65.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.100
So this critical Z value
is equal to 1.65.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.940
Or another way to view it is,
this distance right here is

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.490
going to be 1.65 standard
deviations.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.530
I know my writing
is really small.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.160
I'm just saying the standard
deviation of that

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.220
distribution.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.290
So what is the standard
deviation of that

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.750
distribution?

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.750
We actually calculated it in
the last video, and I'll

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.080
recalculate it here.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.340
The standard deviation of our
distribution of the difference

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.330
of the sample means is going to
be equal to the square root

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.320
of the variance of our
first population.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.820
Now, the variance of our first
population, we don't know it.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.500
But we could estimate it with
our sample standard deviation.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.540
If you take your sample standard
deviation, 4.67 and

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.940
you square it, you get
your sample variance.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.320
And so this is the variance.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.430
This is our best estimate
of the variance of the

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.330
population.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.510
And we want to divide that
by the sample size.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.310
And then plus our best estimate
of the variance of

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.560
the population of group two,
which is 4.04 squared.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.410
The sample standard deviation
of group two squared.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.670
That gives us variance
divided by 100.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.440
I did before in the last. Maybe
it's still sitting on my

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.190
calculator.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.610
Yes, it's still sitting
on the calculator.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.930
It's this quantity
right up here.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.300
4.67 squared divided
by 100 plus 4.04

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.150
squared divided by 100.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.510
So it's 0.617.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:58.060
So this right here is
going to be 0.617.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.410
So this distance right
here, is going to

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.750
be 1.65 times 0.617.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.550
So let's figure out
what that is.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:17.090
So let's take 0.617
times 1.65.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:23.470
So it's 1.02.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:28.300
This distance right
here is 1.02.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:35.990
So what this tells us is, if
we assume that the diet

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:42.630
actually does nothing, there's a
only a 5% chance of having a

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:48.130
difference between the means of
these two samples to have a

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.360
difference of more than 1.02.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.330
There's only a 5%
chance of that.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:58.540
Well, the mean that we
actually got is 1.91.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.580
So that's sitting out
here someplace.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.860
So it definitely falls in
this critical region.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.540
The probability of getting this,
assuming that the null

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.890
hypothesis is correct,
is less than 5%.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:17.400
So it's smaller probability than
our significance level.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.650
Actually, let me
be very clear.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.860
The significance level,
this alpha right

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.890
here, needs to be 5%.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.760
Not the 95%.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.870
I think I might have
said here.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.330
But I wrote down the
wrong number there.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.670
I subtracted it from
one by accident.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.650
Probably in my head.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.740
But anyway, the significance
level is 5%.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.270
The probability given that the
null hypothesis is true, the

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.070
probability of getting the
result that we got, the

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.950
probability of getting that
difference, is less than our

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.030
significance level.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.080
It is less than 5%.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.730
So based on the rules that we
set out for ourselves of

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:58.140
having a significance level of
5%, we will reject the null

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.830
hypothesis in favor of the
alternative that the diet

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.380
actually does make you
lose more weight.
