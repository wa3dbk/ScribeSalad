00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.820
Determine whether
30/45 and 54/81

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.090
are equivalent fractions.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.039
Well, the easiest way I can
think of doing this is to put

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.040
both of these fractions into
lowest possible terms, and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.460
then if they're the same
fraction, then they're

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.460
equivalent.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:21.510
So 30/45, what's the largest
factor of both 30 and 45?

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.850
15 will go into 30.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.070
It'll also go into 45.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.030
So this is the same thing.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:32.310
30 is 2 times 15 and
45 is 3 times 15.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.170
So we can divide both the
numerator and the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.810
denominator by 15.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.640
So if we divide both the
numerator and the denominator

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.690
by 15, what happens?

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.740
Well, this 15 divided by 15,
they cancel out, this 15

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.520
divided by 15 cancel out, and
we'll just be left with 2/3.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.490
So 30/45 is the same
thing as 2/3.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.880
It's equivalent to 2/3.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.550
2/3 is in lowest possible terms,
or simplified form,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.770
however you want to
think about it.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:12.210
Now, let's try to do 54/81.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.320
Now, let's see.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.020
Nothing really jumps
out at me.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.580
Let's see, 9 is divisible
into both of these.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.840
We could write 54 as being 6
times 9, and 81 is the same

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.870
thing as 9 times 9.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.470
You can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 9.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.970
So we could divide both
of them by 9.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.530
9 divided by 9 is 1, 9 divided
by 9 is 1, so we get this as

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.900
being equal to 6/9.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.170
Now, let's see.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.590
6 is the same thing
as 2 times 3.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.610
9 is the same thing
as 3 times 3.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.280
We could just cancel these 3's
out, or you could imagine this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.530
is the same thing as dividing
both the numerator and the

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.880
denominator by 3, or multiplying
both the numerator

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.380
and the denominator by 1/3.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.930
These are all equivalent.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.400
I could write divide by
3 or multiply by 1/3.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.832
Actually, let me write
divide by 3.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.860
Let me write divide
by 3 for now.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.440
I don't want to assume you
know how to multiply

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.070
fractions, because we're going
to learn that in the future.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.900
So we're going to divide by 3.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.830
3 divided by 3 is just 1.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.530
3 divided by 3 is 1, and
you're left with 2/3.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.305
So both of these fractions, when
you simplify them, when

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:25.470
you put them in simplified form,
both end up being 2/3,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.350
so they are equivalent
fractions.
