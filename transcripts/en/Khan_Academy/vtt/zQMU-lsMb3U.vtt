00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.110
Welcome to the presentation
on dividing fractions.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.490
Let's get started.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.640
So before I give you the
intuition-- actually, I might

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.340
do that in a different module--
I'm just going to show you the

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.740
mechanics of how you
divide a fraction.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.740
And it turns out that
it's actually not much

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.030
more difficult than
multiplying fractions.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.410
If I were to ask you, 1/2
divided by 1/2, whenever you

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.110
divide by a fraction, or
actually, when you divide by

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.960
any number, it's the same thing
as multiplying by its inverse.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.670
So 1/2 divided by 1/2 is
equal to 1/2 times 2/1.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.990
We just inverted--
inverse-- the second 1/2.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.630
And we know from the
multiplication module, 1/2

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.110
times 2/1, well, that's
just equal to 2/2,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.560
or it's equal to 1.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.020
And that makes sense because,
actually, any number divided

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.750
by itself is equal to 1.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.220
1/2 divided by 1/2 is 1, just
like 5 divided by 5 is 1, just

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.240
like 100 divided by 100 is 1.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.850
And this isn't a new principal.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.970
Actually, you were
always doing it.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.000
Think about it this way:
What is 2 divided by 2?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.290
Well, you know that's 1.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.560
But isn't this also the
same thing as 2 times the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.210
inverse of 2, which is 1?

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.950
I'll show it to you.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.990
Actually, let me give you a
couple more examples to show

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.340
that dividing fractions really
isn't a new concept, this whole

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.840
notion of multiplying
by the inverse.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.540
If I were to tell you
what is 12 divided by 4?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.650
Well, we know the answer to
this, but I'm going to show

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:50.640
you that this is the same
thing as 12 times 1/4.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.230
12/1 times 1/4 4 is
12/4, which is 3.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.480
And 12/4 is really just another
way of writing 12 divided by 4,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.535
so it's kind of a long way of
getting to the same point.

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:04.990
But I just wanted to show you
that what we're doing in this

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.970
module is nothing new than
what we've always been doing

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.320
when we divide by a number.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.360
Division is the same thing.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.310
Dividing by a number is the
same thing as multiplying by

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.960
the inverse of that number.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.880
And just as a review, an
inverse, if I have a number

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.070
A, the inverse-- inv, short
for inverse-- is 1 over A.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:36.290
So the inverse of 2/3 is 3/2,
or the inverse of 5, because 5

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.670
is the same thing as 5/1,
so the inverse is 1/5.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.000
We're just flipping it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.320
We're switching the
numerator and denominator.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.475
So let's do some fraction
division problems.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.340
What is 2/3 divided by 5/6?

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:05.970
Well, we know that this is the
same thing as 2/3 times 6/5,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.230
and that's equal to 12/15.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.570
We can divide the numerator and
denominator by 3, that's 4/5.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:22.900
What is 7/8 divided by 1/4?

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.520
Well, that's the same
thing as 7/8 times 4/1.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.820
Remember, I just
flipped this 1/4.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.840
Divide by 1/4 is the same
thing as multiplying by 4/1.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.230
That's all you've got to do.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.990
And then we could use a little
shortcut we learned in the

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.480
multiplication module.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.950
8 divided by 4 is 2.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.800
4 divided by 4 is 1.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.450
So that equals 7/2.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.900
Or if you wanted to write that
as a mixed number, this is, of

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.200
course, an improper fraction.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.440
Improper fractions have
a numerator larger

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.830
than the denominator.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.670
If you wanted to write that as
a mixed number, 2 goes into 7

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.680
three times with a remainder
of 1, so that's 3 and a half.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.440
You can write it either way.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.990
I tend to keep it this
way because it's

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.800
easier to deal with.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.130
Let's do a ton of more
problems, or at least as many

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.830
more as we can do in the
next four or five minutes.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:23.850
What's negative 2/3
divided by 5/2?

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.110
Once again, that's the same
thing as minus 2/3-- whoops--

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.850
as minus 2/3 times what?

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.110
It's times the inverse of
5/2, which is 2/5, and

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.630
that equals minus 4/15.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.300
What is 3/2 divided by 1/6?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.850
Well, that's just the same
thing as 3/2 times 6/1,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.000
which equals 3 and 1.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.610
We just divided the 6 by 2 and
the 2 by 2, so that equals 9.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.280
I think you might
be getting it now.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.950
Let's see, let's
do a couple more.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.290
And, of course, you can always
pause, and look at this whole

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.420
presentation again, so you can
get confused all over again.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:27.240
Let's see, let's do minus
5/7 divided by 10/3.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.880
Well, this is the same thing
as minus 5/7 times 3/10.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.420
I just multiplied
by the inverse.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.120
That's all I keep doing
over and over again.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.180
Minus 5 times 3.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.610
Minus 15.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.350
7 times 10 is 70.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.900
If we divide the numerator
and the denominator by

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.050
5, we get minus 3/14.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.500
We could have also
just done it here.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.890
We could have done 5, 2,
and we would have gotten

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.510
minus 3/14 as well.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.420
Let's do one or two
more problems.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.630
I think you kind of
get it, though.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.500
Let's say 1/2
divided by minus 3.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.965
Ah-ha!

00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:17.940
So what happens when you take a
fraction and you divide it by

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.730
a whole number or an integer?

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.970
Well, we know any whole number
can be written as a fraction.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:29.010
This is the same thing as
1/2 divided by minus 3/1.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.870
And dividing by a fraction is
the same thing as multiplying

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.430
by it's inverse.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.150
So the inverse of negative 3/1
is negative 1/3, and this

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.200
equals negative 1/6.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.040
Let's do it the other way.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.880
What if I had negative
3 divided by 1/2?

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.500
Same thing.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:00.370
Negative 3 is the same thing as
minus 3/1 divided by 1/2, which

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:07.940
is the same thing as minus 3/1
times 2/1, which is equal to

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.010
minus 6/1, which
equals minus 6.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.350
Now, let me give you a
little bit of intuition

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.730
of why this works.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.240
Let's say I said 2
divided by 1/3.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.650
Well, we know that this
is equal to 2/1 times

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.120
3/1, which equals 6.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.700
So how does 2, 1/3,
and 6 relate?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.690
Well, let's look
at it this way.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.930
If I had two pieces of pizza.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.660
I have two pieces of pizza.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.520
Here's my two pieces
of pizza right.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.530
Two right here.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.050
So I have two pieces of pizza,
and I'm going to divide

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.080
them into thirds.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.600
So I'm going to divide
each pizza into a third.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.860
I'll draw the little
Mercedes sign.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.050
So I'm dividing each pizza
into a third, right?

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.210
How many pieces do I have?

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.925
Let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:08:02.925 --> 00:08:04.800
I have 6 pieces.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.140
So you might want to sit and
ponder that for a little bit,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.850
but I think it might make a
little bit of sense to you.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.190
Let's do one more just
to tire your brain.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:25.750
If I had negative 7/2 divided
by 4/9-- let's pick a negative

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.580
4/9-- well, that's the same
thing as minus 7/2 times

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.720
minus 9/4, right?

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.950
I just multiplied by the
inverse of negative 4/9.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.220
9 times 7 is equal to--
negative 7 times negative

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:47.800
9 is positive 63,
and 2 times 4 is 8.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.460
Hopefully, I think you have a
good idea of how to divide by

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.960
a fraction now, and you can
try out the dividing

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.310
fractions modules.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.890
Have fun!
