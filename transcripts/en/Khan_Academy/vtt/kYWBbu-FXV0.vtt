00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.250
We're on problem 107.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.550
Any decimal that has only a
finite number of non-zero

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.340
digits is a terminating
decimal.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.360
For example, 24-- in the example
they give us-- 24,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.620
0.82, and 5.096.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.570
So they're saying if you just
have a finite number of these

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.250
non-zero things, at some point
you have to end, and just have

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.350
zeroes just left over.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.680
So that's what they mean by
a terminating decimal.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:44.290
If r and s are positive
integers, and the ratio r

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:54.210
divided by s is expressed as a
decimal, is r divided by s a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.460
terminating decimal?

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.880
So essentially it wouldn't
work if r and n--

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.910
that this is 1/3.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.700
That's not going to work.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.610
Because you'll have
0.3 forever.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.830
So they're saying, does
it at some point end?

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.900
This is interesting.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.740
So statement 1 tells us that
90 is less than r which is

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.040
less than 100.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.295
That statement by itself
doesn't help me.

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:32.550
Now let's say that r was--
let me think of a good r.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.230
Let's say r was 93.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.930
If r is equal to 93 and then s
is equal to-- well, let's just

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.290
say that s, for the sake of
argument, is 3 times r.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.180
Actually, I don't have
to pick an r.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.520
Whatever r is, I can just pick
an s to be 3 times r.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.600
And I'm not going to get
a terminating decimal.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.590
On the other hand, if I pick
s to be 2 times r, then I'm

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.650
going to have a terminating
decimal.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.325
So statement 1 by itself
isn't going to help me.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.140
I hope you understand that.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.850
I can pick any s to make
it terminating

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.360
or not at this point.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.310
No matter whether
r is constrained

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.330
between 90 and 100.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.903
Statement 2 tells us that
s is equal to 4b.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.820
Now, this is interesting
to me.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.910
So where did this b come
from all of a sudden?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.280
Any decimal that has only a
finite number of non-zero

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.990
digits is a terminating
decimal.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.460
If r and s are integers and the
ratio s is equal to 4b.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.610
Where did this come from?

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.660
Let me look it up.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.400
What is this?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.300
I think this is a typo.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.080
Because where did b come
from all of a sudden?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.940
Oh, yeah, when I look at
the solution they say

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.650
s is equal to 4.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.900
So that's definitely a typo.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.320
4b.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.180
s is equal to 4.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.510
OK that makes a lot
more sense.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.380
All right, so if s
is equal to 4.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.670
Pretty much any number, when
you divide any number by 4,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.350
you're going to have a
terminating decimal.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.720
It's either going to be
divisible by 4 or it's going

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.750
to be-- the worst case, if you
have 1 divided by 4, that

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.390
equals 0.25.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.750
5 So no matter what, when you
divide something by 4, you're

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.460
always going to have a
terminating decimal.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.240
It's never going to
repeat forever.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.560
I mean you can try it out with
every-- no matter what number

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.770
you divide, if you view it as
a fraction, or kind of your

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.600
fourth grade remainder problems,
the remainder is

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.920
either going to be 1, 2 or 3.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.450
If the remainder is 1, the
decimal is going to be 0.25.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.120
If the remainder is 2, the
decimal is going to be 0.5.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.080
And if the remainder is 3, the
decimal is going to be 0.75.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.600
In any case, as long as
s equals 4, you have a

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.810
terminating decimal.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.010
So statement 2 alone is
sufficient and statement 1

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.980
really doesn't tell us much.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.600
And I'm annoyed that they
had that b typo there.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.340
Next problem.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.470
108.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.850
OK, they've drawn a triangle
right there.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.565
Let me see if I can
draw it properly.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.800
There you go.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.600
And let me label it.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.660
This is B.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.550
That's A.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.490
That's C.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.460
This is y degrees.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.030
And this is D and this
is x degrees.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.140
In the figure above, what is
the value of x plus y?

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.970
So x degrees plus y degrees.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.850
x plus y is equal to what?

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.480
So they don't tell
us anything else.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.050
They don't tell us if this is
an equilateral triangle.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.320
They don't tell us that these
angles are equal.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.230
They don't tell us
it's symmetrical.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.640
They don't tell us anything
about this triangle so far.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.570
So statement number 1 tells
us that x is equal to 70.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.710
Well, just by x equalling 70,
that still doesn't help me.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.640
I still don't know
what y can be.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.390
I mean, you could draw this
interior triangle in a bunch

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.950
of different ways and you could
see that the angle could

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.820
change depending on how much you
lift up D or compress D.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.350
This y angle can change
irrespective of what x is.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.220
So x is equal to 70 does not
in any way give me any

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.980
information on what y is.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.090
Statement 2.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:50.050
Triangle ABC and triangle
ADC are both isosceles.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:57.310
So isosceles actually doesn't
mean necessarily that those

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.650
two sides are the same.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.940
I mean, that kind of tends
to be someone's immediate

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.030
assumption, when we
say isosceles.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.480
Oh maybe that side is
equal to that side.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.980
But no, it just means that two
of the sides are the same.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.120
So, likewise on this triangle.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.150
Although you can, at least,
here-- can I make an argument?

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.630
No, you can't make an argument
which two sides are going to

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.490
be the same.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.430
So, even if you assumed that
both of those sides are the

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.710
same, you're still not going
to-- because you don't know.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.445
My gut instinct would be to say,
oh, that side's the same

00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:29.020
as that side.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.030
But no, I can't make
that assumption.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.980
Because it could be that this
side is equal to that side.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.090
That would still make
it isosceles.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.690
And this side is kind of viewed
as like the base side.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.140
And it's a very big
difference.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.300
Because if these are the two
equal sides, and if this is x,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.050
this is going to be x.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.060
But then if I take the other
scenario, where if these are

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.720
two sides and if this is x, then
both of these are really

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.490
be 180 minus x divided
by 2, right?

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.720
Because this would be-- The
bottom line is, this still

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.460
doesn't get me anywhere.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.600
Even if I know that this
is 70 degrees.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.120
So I'm going to go with, E,
not enough information to

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.470
solve this problem.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:10.950
109.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.385
Are positive integers p and
q both greater than n?

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.030
They told us positive
integers.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.460
OK.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.290
They say p minus q is
greater than n.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.710
Well I'll give you a case right
now where that doesn't

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.420
satisfy this.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:41.480
What if p is equal to 10,
q is equal to 1, and

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.610
n is equal to 2.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.540
Then 10 minus 1 is 9 is
definitely greater than 2.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.990
But look, q is not
greater than 2.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.270
1 is not greater than 2.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.700
So q wouldn't be
greater than n.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:00.760
Or I could say, it could
be, 110 and 108.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.420
Would equal-- and when you
subtracted you'd get 2.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.100
And in this case q
is bigger than 2.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.130
So this doesn't give me
enough information.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.800
I can think of two combinations

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.150
of p's q's and n's.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.110
One that says that q is not
greater than n and one that

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.150
says that q is greater than n.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.200
So one, by itself,
isn't enough.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.450
Statement 2.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.465
q is greater than p.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.409
That still doesn't help me.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:39.799
Both of these statement actually
cannot be true

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.549
simultaneously.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.299
Because if these are both
positive integers, which they

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:49.640
told us-- well, greater
than n.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.510
Both greater than n.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.190
They didn't tell us

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.770
necessarily that n is positive.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.200
So n doesn't have
to be positive.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.590
My logic for statement
1 still holds.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:05.660
But let's see, if q is greater
than p, this by itself doesn't

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.210
help me much.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.050
Because I can think of a similar
combination to this.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:17.130
I can say q is equal to 10, p
is equal to 9, and I could

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.970
make n is equal to 2.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:24.680
Or I could say n
is equal to 15.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.780
This in no way constrains
what n is.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.540
So it, by itself, doesn't
solve it.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.280
But what if we were to
use both constraints.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.520
This is the interesting case.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.500
What if we were to say that p
minus q is greater than n.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.430
And q is greater than p.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.520
So, we know that both p
and q are positive.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.420
They told us that in the
problem statement.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:55.620
If p and q are both positive,
and q is greater than p, this

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.780
is going to end up becoming
a negative number.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.000
These are both positive.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.800
And this is the larger of the
two positive numbers based on

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.110
the second constraint.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.500
So this is going to be
a negative number.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.050
And so if a negative number is
greater than n, then we can be

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.810
sure, we can be positive,
that both p and q are

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.530
greater than n.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.700
Because they told us that
p and q are positive.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.620
So actually both of
these statements

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.310
imply that n is negative.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.700
Because we have a negative
number here being

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.880
greater than n.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.460
And if n is negative, then both
p and q are definitely

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.410
greater than n.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.520
So both statements combined
are sufficient

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.640
to answer this question.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.760
And the answer is
actually true.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.000
I'll see you in the
next video.
