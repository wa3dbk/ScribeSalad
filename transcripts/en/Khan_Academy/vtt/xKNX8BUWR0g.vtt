00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.080
In this video I want to
introduce you to some

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.460
terminology that will be useful
in our discussion of

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.140
functions and invertibility.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.970
And this is, in general,
terminology that you'll

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.476
probably see in your
mathematical careers.

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:17.160
So let's say I have a function
f, and it is a mapping from

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.420
the set x to the set y.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.630
We've drawn this diagram many
times, but it never hurts to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.310
draw it again.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.490
So that is my set
x or my domain.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.750
And then this is the set y over
here, or the co-domain.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.370
Remember the co-domain is the
set that you're mapping to.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.430
You don't necessarily have to
map to every element of the

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.940
set, or none of the elements
of the set.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.240
This is just all of the
elements, the set that you

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.820
might map elements in
your co-domain to.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.670
So let's see.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.280
If I have some element there, f
will map it to some element

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.970
in y in my co-domain.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.490
So the first idea, or term, I
want to introduce you to, is

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.720
the idea of a function
being surjective.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.960
And sometimes this
is called onto.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.590
And a function is surjective or
onto, if for every element

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.750
in your co-domain-- so let me
write it this way, if for

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:34.560
every, let's say y, that is a
member of my co-domain, there

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.250
exists-- that's the little
shorthand notation for exists

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:48.510
--there exists at least
one x that's a

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.090
member of x, such that.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.560
And I can write such
that, like that.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.570
Actually, let me just
write the word out.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.710
Such that f of x
is equal to y.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.320
So it's essentially saying, you
can pick any y here, and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.050
every y here is being mapped
to by at least one of

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.790
the x's over here.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.660
So, for example, actually let
me draw a simpler example

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.270
instead of drawing
these blurbs.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.130
Let's say that I have
a set y that

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.990
literally looks like this.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.540
Let's say that a set y-- I'll
draw it very --and let's say

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.170
it has four elements.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.660
It has the elements
a, b, c, and d.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.760
This is my set y right there.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.020
And let's say my set
x looks like that.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.190
And let's say it has the
elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.140
Now, in order for my function f
to be surjective or onto, it

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.750
means that every one of these
guys have to be able

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.550
to be mapped to.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.560
So what does that mean?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.880
If every one of these
guys, let me

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.140
just draw some examples.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.510
Let's say that this
guy maps to that.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.980
Let's say that this
guy maps to that.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.500
Let's say that this
guy maps to that.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.270
And let's say, let me draw a
fifth one right here, let's

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.440
say that both of these guys
right here map to d.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.650
So f of 4 is d and
f of 5 is d.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.110
This is an example of a
surjective function.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.270
So these are the mappings
of f right here.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.990
This function right here
is onto or surjective.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.740
Why is that?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.120
Because every element here
is being mapped to.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.580
Now, let me give you an example
of a function that is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.870
not surjective.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.000
Let me add some more
elements to y.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.690
Let's say element y has another
element here called e.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.980
Now, all of a sudden, this
is not surjective.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.360
And why is that?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.380
Because there's some element
in y that is not

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.860
being mapped to.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.770
If I tell you that f is a
surjective function, it means

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.400
if you take, essentially, if you
map all of these values,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.220
everything here is being mapped
to by at least one

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.220
element here.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.839
So you could have it, everything
could be kind of a

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.870
one-to-one mapping.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.190
And I'll define that a little
bit better in the future.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.630
So it could just be like
that, and like that.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.920
And you could even have, it's
at least one, so you could

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.480
even have two things in here
mapping to one thing in here.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.230
But the main requirement
is that everything here

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.090
does get mapped to.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.840
Another way to think about it,
is that if you take the image.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.600
So surjective function--
let me write this here.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.020
Let me write it this way --so if
I say that f is surjective

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.100
or onto, these are equivalent
terms, that means that the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.560
image of f.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.660
Remember the image was, all
of the values that f

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.360
actually maps to.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.125
So that means that the image
of f is equal to y.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.460
Now, we learned before, that
your image doesn't have to

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.930
equal your co-domain.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.680
But if you have a surjective
or an onto function, your

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.590
image is going to equal
your co-domain.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.990
Everything in your co-domain
gets mapped to.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.450
Actually, another word
for image is range.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:33.030
You could also say that your
range of f is equal to y.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.070
Remember the difference-- and
I drew this distinction when

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.270
we first talked about functions
--the distinction

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.560
between a co-domain and a range,
a co-domain is the set

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.680
that you can map to.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.360
You don't have to map
to everything.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.510
The range is a subset of
your co-domain that you

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.970
actually do map to.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.840
If you were to evaluate the
function at all of these

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.130
points, the points that you
actually map to is your range.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.540
And that's also called
your image.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.340
And the word image
is used more in a

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.440
linear algebra context.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.600
But if your image or your
range is equal to your

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.140
co-domain, if everything in your
co-domain does get mapped

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.730
to, then you're dealing
with a surjective

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.230
function or an onto function.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.490
Now, the next term I want to
introduce you to is the idea

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.905
of an injective function.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:34.820
And this is sometimes called
a one-to-one function.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.950
So let me draw my domain
and co-domain again.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.250
So let's say that that
is my domain

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.930
and this is my co-domain.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.520
So this is x and this is y.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.960
If I say that f is injective
or one-to-one, that implies

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.410
that for every value that is
mapped to-- so let me write it

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.800
this way --for every value that
is mapped to-- so let's

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.020
say, I'll say it a couple of
different ways --there is at

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.320
most one x that maps to it.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.320
Or another way to say it is that
for any y that's a member

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.550
of y-- let me write it this
way --for any y that is a

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:31.850
member y, there is at most one--
let me write most in

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:40.840
capital --at most one x, such
that f of x is equal to y.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.830
There might be no x's
that map to it.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.270
So for example, you could have
a little member of y right

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.720
here that just never
gets mapped to.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.820
Everyone else in y gets mapped
to, but that guy

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.740
never gets mapped to.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.020
So this would be a case
where we don't have

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.660
a surjective function.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.640
This is not onto because this
guy, he's a member of the

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.580
co-domain, but he's not
a member of the

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.610
image or the range.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.140
He doesn't get mapped to.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.400
But this would still be an
injective function as long as

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.830
every x gets mapped
to a unique y.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.250
Now, how can a function not be
injective or one-to-one?

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.210
And I think you get the idea
when someone says one-to-one.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:24.680
Well, if two x's here get mapped
to the same y, or three

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.110
get mapped to the same y, this
would mean that we're not

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:36.254
dealing with an injective or
a one-to-one function.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.179
So that's all it means.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.750
Let me draw another
example here.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.400
Let's actually go back to
this example right here.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.080
When I added this e here, we
said this is not surjective

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.640
anymore because every one
of these guys is not

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.100
being mapped to.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.170
Is this an injective function?

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.310
Well, no, because I have f of 5
and f of 4 both mapped to d.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.090
So this is what breaks its
one-to-one-ness or its

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.490
injectiveness.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.910
This is what breaks it's
surjectiveness.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.840
Now if I wanted to make this a
surjective and an injective

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.300
function, I would delete that
mapping and I would change f

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.920
of 5 to be e.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.580
Now everything is one-to-one.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.890
I don't have the mapping from
two elements of x, going to

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.750
the same element of y anymore.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.340
And everything in y now
gets mapped to.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.630
So this is both onto
and one-to-one.
