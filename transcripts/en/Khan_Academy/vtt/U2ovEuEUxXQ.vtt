00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.650
Welcome to my presentation
on equivalent fractions.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.000
So equivalent fractions
are, essentially what

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.560
they sound like.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.640
They're two fractions that
although they use different

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.260
numbers, they actually
represent the same thing.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.930
Let me show you an example.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.306
Let's say I had
the fraction 1/2.

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:21.060
Why isn't it writing.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.480
Let me make sure I get
the right color here.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.930
Let's say I had
the fraction 1/2.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.960
So graphically, if we to draw
that, if I had a pie and I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.030
would have cut it
into two pieces.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.590
That's the denominator
there, 2.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.420
And then if I were to eat
1 of the 2 pieces I would

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.240
have eaten 1/2 of this pie.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.150
Makes sense.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.170
Nothing too complicated there.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.900
Well, what if instead of
dividing the pie into two

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.040
pieces, let me just draw
that same pie again.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.030
Instead of dividing it in two
pieces, what if I divided

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.200
that pie into 4 pieces?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.870
So here in the denominator I
have a possibility of-- total

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.680
of 4 pieces in the pie.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.030
And instead of eating one
piece, this time I actually

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.135
ate 2 of the 4 pieces.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.450
Or I ate 2/4 of the pie.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.240
Well if we look at these two
pictures, we can see that

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.230
I've eaten the same
amount of the pie.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.780
So these fractions
are the same thing.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.170
If someone told you that they
ate 1/2 of a pie or if they

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.410
told you that they ate 2/4 of a
pie, it turns out of that they

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.640
ate the same amount of pie.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.490
So that's why we're saying
those two fractions

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.460
are equivalent.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.820
Another way, if we actually
had-- let's do another one.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.770
Let's say-- and that pie is
quite ugly, but let's assume

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.550
it's the same type of pie.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.250
Let's say we divided
that pie into 8 pieces.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.840
And now, instead of eating 2
we ate 4 of those 8 pieces.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.360
So we ate 4 out of 8 pieces.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.140
Well, we still ended up eating
the same amount of the pie.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.080
We ate half of the pie.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.790
So we see that 1/2 will equal
2/4, and that equals 4/8.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.320
Now do you see a pattern here
if we just look at the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.540
numerical relationships
between 1/2, 2/4, and 4/8?

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.640
Well, to go from 1/2 to 2/4 we
multiply the denominator-- the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.310
denominator just as review is
the number on the bottom

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.170
of the fraction.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.020
We multiply the
denominator by 2.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.370
And when you multiply the
denominator by 2, we also

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.250
multiply the numerator by 2.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.360
We did the same thing here.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.540
And that makes sense because
well, if I double the number of

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.640
pieces in the pie, then I have
to eat twice as many pieces to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.700
eat the same amount of pie.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.390
Let's do some more examples
of equivalent fractions

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.740
and hopefully it'll
hit the point home.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.020
Let me erase this.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.645
Why isn't it letting me erase?

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.470
Let me use the regular mouse.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.620
OK, good.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.750
Sorry for that.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.985
So let's say I had
the fraction 3/5.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.850
Well, by the same principle,
as long as we multiply the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.250
numerator and the denominator
by the same numbers, we'll

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.740
get an equivalent fraction.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.230
So if we multiply the numerator
times 7 and the denominator

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:46.820
times 7, we'll get 21-- because
3 times 7 is 21-- over 35.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.790
And so 3/5 and 21/35 are
equivalent fractions.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.880
And we essentially, and I don't
know if you already know how to

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.830
multiply fractions, but all we
did is we multiplied 3/5

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.460
times 7/7 to get 21/35.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.480
And if you look at this, what
we're doing here isn't magic.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.090
7/7, well what's 7/7?

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.700
If I had 7 pieces in a pie
and I were to eat 7 of

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.850
them; I ate the whole pie.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.160
So 7/7, this is the
same thing as 1.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.620
So all we've essentially
said is well, 3/5 and we

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.970
multiplied it times 1.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.470
Which is the same thing as 7/7.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.490
Oh boy, this thing
is messing up.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.660
And that's how we got 21/35.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.180
So it's interesting.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.090
All we did is multiply the
number by 1 and we know

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.690
that any number times 1
is still that number.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.940
And all we did is we figured
out a different way

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:54.150
of writing 21/35.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.930
Let's start with
a fraction 5/12.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.070
And I wanted to write that with
the denominator-- let's say I

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.290
wanted to write that with
the denominator 36.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.050
Well, to go from 12 to 36, what
do we have to multiply by?

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.530
Well 12 goes into
36 three times.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.830
So if we multiply the
denominator by 3, we also have

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.450
to multiply the numerator by 3.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.215
Times 3.

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:27.080
We get 15.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.890
So we get 15/36 is the
same thing as 5/12.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.380
And just going to our original
example, all that's saying

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.300
is, if I had a pie with 12
pieces and I ate 5 of them.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.140
Let's say I did that.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.990
And then you had a pie, the
same size pie, you had a

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.740
pie with 36 pieces and
you ate 15 of them.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.540
Then we actually ate the
same amount of pie.
