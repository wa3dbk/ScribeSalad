00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.890
Let's talk about a concept
that probably confuses

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.790
chemistry students the
most on some level.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.210
But on some level it's also one
of the simplest concepts.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.160
And that's the idea of a mole,
which in chemistry is

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.930
different than the thing digging
up your backyard, or

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.060
the thing you want to get
removed from your left eye.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.740
A mole in chemistry
is just a number.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.410
It's just a number, and
the number is 6.02

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.980
times 10 to the 23.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.540
So it's a very huge number.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.490
And this is also called
Avogadro's number.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.740
Maybe I will do a video
on Avogadro.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.600
But that's all you
need to know.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.160
A mole is just a number.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.980
There are kind of
more Byzantine

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.090
definitions of a mole.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.570
This actually is not-- actually,
let me copy and

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.160
paste it from Wikipedia.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.190
This is Wikipedia's definition
of a mole.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.760
And you hopefully at the end of
this video you'll see that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.650
they're equivalent.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.870
But if you're just getting
exposed to the concept, this

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.490
to me, it's just not
an easy concept.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.550
Basically, a "a mole is defined
as the amount of

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.420
substance of a system that
contains as many elemental

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.860
entities as there are atoms in
12 grams of carbon 12." Well,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.650
I just told you that a mole is
6.02 times 10 to the 23.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.640
So if you just take the
last part, atoms in 12

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.920
grams of carbon 12.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:40.310
So that means that there are 1
mole of carbon 12-- let me

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.100
write it like that--
carbon 12.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:57.550
There are 1 mole of carbon 12
atoms in 12 grams of carbon.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.670
And so that's why a
mole is useful.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.890
So I could have just instead
of writing 1 mole, I could

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.880
have replaced this as there's
6.02 times 10 to the 23 carbon

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.050
atoms, carbon 12 atoms in
12 grams of carbon.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.180
How do you figure that out?

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.640
Or I guess, what else
does this mean?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.690
I mean, we just added in carbon,
they said it's the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.070
amount of substance of any
molecule, if you convert

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.210
between atomic mass
units and grams.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.050
This I find very confusing.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.610
How can we apply this
in other places?

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.020
So the first thing to realize
is a mole is just a way of

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.080
translating between grams
and atomic mass units.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.800
One carbon 12 atom is what?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.700
What's its mass number?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.050
It's 12.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.860
That's why it's called carbon
12 instead of carbon 14.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.130
So its mass is 12 atomic
mass units.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.060
So if you have something that
has a mass of 12 atomic mass

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.990
units and you have a mole of
them, or you have 6.02 times

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.850
10 to the twenty three of
them, all of those atoms

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.840
combined will have a
mass of 12 grams.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:10.020
So another way to think about
it is 1 gram is equal to 1

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.000
mole of atomic mass units.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.550
I'll write amu's like that.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.690
Or you can write 1 gram is equal
to 6.02 times 10 to the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.220
23 atomic mass units.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.390
And the reason why this is
useful-- and it's kind of

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.540
addressed in this Wikipedia
definition there-- is it helps

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.140
us translate between the atomic
world-- where we deal

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.050
with atomic mass units and we
deal with, oh, we've got an

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.960
extra neutron now, let's add
one to our atomic mass

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.540
number-- and translating between
that atomic world and

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.540
our everyday world where
we deal in grams.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.490
And just so you know, a
gram is still a pretty

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.400
small amount of mass.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.340
It's 1/1,000 of a kilogram.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.210
A kilogram is about 2 pounds.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.590
So this is about 1/500
of a pound.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.470
So this is not much.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.570
So there's a ton of atoms in a
very small amount of-- in 1

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.100
gram of carbon, or at least in
12 grams of carbon, you have a

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.070
ton of atoms. You have 6.02
times 10 to the 23.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.670
And just to hit the point home,
I probably should have

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.730
talked about this in the atom.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.610
This is a huge number.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.770
To maybe visualize it, if you
think of-- I was told that in

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.600
the diameter of a hair, if this
is a hair and this is

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.750
diameter of the hair, if you
go this way there 1 million

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.130
carbon atoms. 1 million
carbon atoms that way.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:43.660
Or if you were to take an apple
and you were to try to

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.170
figure out what fraction, if
you were to make one of the

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.020
atoms of an apple-- and
obviously, an apple has a

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.795
bunch of different types of
atoms in it-- but if you were

00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:55.980
to take one of the atoms and
make it the size of the apple,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.690
then the apple would be
the size of the earth.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.190
So an apple atom is
to an apple as an

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.310
apple is to the earth.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.810
So these are obviously-- it's
hard for us to even process

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.070
things of this size.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.170
When you just have one gram of--
well, let's say you have

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.480
1 gram of hydrogen.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.880
1 gram of hydrogen.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.540
If you have 1 gram of hydrogen,
that means you have

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.400
1 mole of hydrogen.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.760
How do I know that?

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.070
Because hydrogen's atomic
mass number is 1.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.690
So in general, if you just take
any element-- so what is

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.715
the mass of, let me just pick,
1 mole of aluminum?

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.270
So if I were to take 6.02 times
10 to the 23 aluminum

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.240
atoms, what is the mass
of that collection?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.780
Well, each of them have an
atomic mass number of 13.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:08.280
So it's 13 amu's-- I don't
have to put the s there--

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.340
times six point-- well, I won't

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.200
write that way, actually.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.620
That'll probably just
confuse you.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.810
The easy way to think about is
if you have a mole of an atom,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.360
you take its mass-- I was taking
its atomic number,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.280
that's not good-- you take
its mass number.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.310
In this case let's
say it's 27.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.490
So we're dealing with
aluminum 27.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.760
You take its mass number, and if
you have 1 mole of it, then

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.810
the mass of that will
be 27 grams.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.340
So that literally, when you have
one mole of an atom it's

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.090
a direct translation between its
mass number and grams. 1

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.520
mole of iron, let's say iron
56-- there's obviously many

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.450
isotopes or iron-- let's say
we're dealing with iron 56.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.380
You normally don't hear it like
that, but let's say we're

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.790
dealing with the isotope
of iron that has a

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.610
mass number of 56.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:12.070
So if I have 1 mole of this, 1
mole of this atom right here,

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.170
that's going to have a mass of--
the math isn't difficult

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:23.180
here-- 56 grams. And if you
think about it, how many

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.170
atomic mass units is this?

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.850
Well, this is 56 atomic
mass units per atom.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.815
Then you have a mole of those,
so you have 6.02 times 10 to

00:07:33.815 --> 00:07:37.830
the 23 times 56 atomic
mass units.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.700
And then you divide it by
the number of atomic

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.950
mass units per gram.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.390
And you end up with 56 grams.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.330
But the easy way to think about
it is you just take

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.280
whatever the mass number is.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.100
If you have silicon, if you have
a mole of silicon, a mole

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.150
of silicon will have a mass--
I don't want to say weight

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.750
because this should apply to
any planet-- of 28 grams.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.325
What about 2 moles of silicon?

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.230
And I'll write its
mass number.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.950
Let's say silicon has
a mass number of 28.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.720
Two moles of silicon.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.010
Well, 1 more would have a mass
of 28 grams, so 2 moles is

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:23.570
going to have a mass
of 56 grams.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:30.100
If I were to say, let's say I
had 4 moles of oxygen, which

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.059
has a mass number of 16.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.140
What is the mass of that?

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.659
This is a huge number of oxygen
atoms-- what would be

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.000
the mass of that?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.750
Well, it would be 4 times-- 1
mole of oxygen would have a

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:52.960
mass of 16 grams, so 4
moles has 64 grams.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.660
It's confusing because we're not
used to using a word like

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.490
moles as a number, but all
it is is a number.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.480
And the easy way to think
about is that it lets us

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.640
translate between this atomic
mass unit number and grams.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.530
And you say, well, how do
I get that many grams?

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.610
Well, I have to have 6.02 times
10 to the 23 carbon

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.760
atoms for that collection of
carbon to have a mass of 12

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.360
grams. That's all
that mole means.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.445
It's just a number.

00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:21.740
And I encourage you to kind of
play around with a lot of what

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.800
we talked about.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.140
Because it's super important to
have the intuition behind

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.780
moles, otherwise you'll get
confused later on when we

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.470
start getting into energies
in terms of it requires

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.330
kilojoules per mole, and what is
the energy of this reaction

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.310
and all that type of stuff.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.970
So just really try to make sure
you digest this as well

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:38.530
as possible.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.290
And let me know if you don't
and I'll maybe make another

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.590
video on this because
it's so important.
