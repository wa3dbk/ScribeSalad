00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
Before we move on to other
functions, let's also take the

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.090
partial derivative of our
function here, f of xy, or the

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.000
partial derivative of
z with respect to y.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.520
So let's do it in magenta.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.310
So the partial derivative
of z with respect to y.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.220
Well, now we're saying how much
does z change with respect

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.570
y if x is constant.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.560
So this x squared we
treat as a constant now.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.513
So the derivative of a
constant with respect to

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:32.500
y is 0, so ignore it.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.650
Now this xy term.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.140
The way we're doing it
now is, y is a variable,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.520
x is a constant.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.040
So what is the derivative
of, I don't know, 5y

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.920
with respect to y?

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.680
Well it's 5.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.930
So the derivative of xy with
respect to y is just x.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.650
And what's the derivative of
y squared with respect to y?

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.430
Well it's just 2y.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.520
So you can see it's
quite symmetric.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.900
The partial of z with respect
to x is 2x plus y, the

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.380
partial of z with respect
to y is x plus 2y.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.280
That's because this equation
is pretty symmetric.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.330
The x's and the y's kind
of do the same thing.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.900
Now, we picked the point x is
equal to 0.2 y is equal to 0.3.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.140
Actually let me erase this,
because I picked a different

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.110
point where I graph, and I
graphed it ahead of time

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.600
just to save time.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.870
So I don't think I have
to include this anymore.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:35.560
So what I did, I picked
the point x is equal to

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.760
0.3, y is equal to 0.3.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.510
And when x is equal to
0.3, y is equal to 0.3,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.310
what is z equal to?

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.970
Let's see, 0.3 squared is
0.09, 0.3 times 0.3 0.09.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.130
So it's z is equal
to 0.27, right?

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.860
Just substitute 0.3
in for x and y.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.020
z is equal to 0.27.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.700
So what is the partial
of z with respect

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.080
to x at that point?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.190
Or we could write, f
sub x at the point y.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.990
x is equal to 0.3,
y is equal to 0.3.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.450
It equals, we figured that,
let's see 2 times 0.3 is 0.6,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.870
plus 0.3, that's equal to 0.9.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.720
So the slope in the x direction
at that point is 0.9.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.300
And if we take the partial with
respect to y at that same

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.440
point, 0.3 plus 0.6,
that's also equal to 0.9.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.160
Let's see if we can
visualize this.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.330
Let me bring in my graph.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.880
There we go.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.880
So this is, this surface once
again is the surface of z is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.430
equal to x squared plus
xy plus y squared.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.320
And this box is kind of the
domain, and the x and y

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.590
dimensions that I define.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.040
Kind of, I bounded it because
it starts to increase really

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.130
fast, and you wouldn't be able
to see all this interesting

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.100
stuff that happens closer in.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.190
But this, what I did, so this
vertical line, I just wanted

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.160
to show you that when x is
equal to 0.3, y is equal

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.770
to 0.3, z is equal to 0.7.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.740
So that just kind of helps show
you that, ok, that shows what

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.950
point we're working with.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.620
And then these two lines, this
is, if you think about it, this

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.080
is the line where y
is constant, right?

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.810
So this is the slope in the
z, or as the surface changes

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.580
with respect to x at
this point, right?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.005
This is the tangent
line relative to x.

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:37.520
So you could kind of view
it as, if you hold y

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.220
constant, here's a tangent
line at that point.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.420
And if you hold x constant,
here's a tangent

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.510
line at that point.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.870
And like I said in the last
video, you can actually have

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.980
infinite tangent lines.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.300
You have to pick the direction
that you want to go in the xy

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.390
plane, and then you could
plot a tangent line.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.790
And so that's why we did
partial derivatives

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.440
to begin with.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.470
Actually, this is pretty cool.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:08.890
We can actually take, we can
actually zoom in on this.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.230
Zoom it a little bit more.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.460
I want to zoom in on the
part that is interesting,

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.660
let me translate this.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.960
So that's the part
that's interesting.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.830
And now let me rotate it.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.120
So you can actually rotate.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.652
So this is the tangent.

00:04:24.652 --> 00:04:28.140
This shows that the partial
of the function with respect

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.790
to y, the slope is 0.9.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.640
And this line shows that the
partial of the slope, or the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.135
partial the function, sorry the
partial of z, or the partial of

00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:41.560
the function with respect to
x is 0.9, at this point.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.790
At the point x is 0.3, y is
0.3, right? x is 0.3, y is

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.830
0.3, z is equal to 0.27.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.960
And we can rotate it just
to get more intuition.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.690
I think it's, the graphing
thing looks a little

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.460
bit funny sometimes.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.810
But you see that both
of those lines are

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.960
tangent at that point.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.807
And in fact, two lines define a
plane, and the plane that's

00:05:05.807 --> 00:05:09.960
defined by those two lines, or
any of the two tangent lines to

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.230
that point, defines a tangent
plane to the surface.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.290
So a does have only one tangent
plane, but within a tangent

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.990
plane, there are an infinite
number of tangent lines.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.380
Well anyway, that's the
fun with graphing.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.500
Now let's just chug through a
bunch of partial derivative

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.680
problems just so that you get
used to the mathematics of it.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.420
Delete that.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.340
Let's do some that might
confuse you, so you

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.720
see how to do them.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.040
Let's say that f of xy,
and I'm confining it

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.630
to three dimensions.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.360
Although we can do it more.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.700
Actually, maybe I'll do it more
dimensions now that we're not

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.180
going to try to visualize it.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:59.550
Let's say it's x sine
of x, cosine of y.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.160
So let's take the partial
of f with respect to x.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.080
This is still going to be
a function of x and y.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.200
So we treat y like a constant
So cosine of a constant, this

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.820
is just going to be a constant.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.110
So we can almost ignore that.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.220
We could put that out front.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.740
We could say that it's going
to be cosine of y times the

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.930
derivative of this
with respect to x.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.690
So you could say, cosine
of y, it's just a number.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.725
This cosine of y could
just be, I don't know,

00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:28.200
5 or pi, or whatever.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.380
Cosine of y.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.680
And then, because when you take
the derivative the constant

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.140
just comes out of
the derivative.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.940
And then we would take the
derivative of the x's.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.410
So the derivative of the
first term with respect

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.780
to x, well that's just 1.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.795
Times the second expression.

00:06:39.795 --> 00:06:44.250
So sine of x, I'm just doing
the product rule here.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.820
Plus the derivative of
the second expression,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.000
that's cosine of x.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.720
Cosine of x is the derivative
of the second expression, times

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.460
the first expression, times x.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.570
So If we wanted to expand it
all out, the partial of f

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.380
with respect to x, this is
the function of x and y.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:17.910
It equals sine of x, cosine of
y, plus, let's put this x out

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.690
front, just so we change the
order. x, cosine of

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.270
x, cosine of y.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.120
Not too difficult.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.740
You just have to realize
that anything with

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.890
the y is a constant.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.540
So let's reverse it.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.260
Well, not reverse it.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.080
Let's take the partial
now in the y direction.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.760
How much does f change
in the y direction if

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.350
we hold x constant.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.170
So the partial of f with
respect to y, still a

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.080
function of x and y.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.790
The derivative in
that direction is a

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.930
function of x and y.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.550
So now x is a constant.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.560
So this actually becomes
pretty straightforward.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.170
This whole x, sine of x,
if x is some number, 5,

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.080
this is just a constant.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.750
So we can just write
that out front.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.420
So that's just x, sine of x.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.770
I know it's hard for you to get
used to saying that, oh, x sine

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.020
of x, that's just a
constant number.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.240
Because you're so used to
taking the derivative

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.950
with respect to x.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.290
And that's the hardest
part about doing these

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.430
partial derivatives.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.950
But anyway, this is
just a constant term.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.290
And now we just take
the derivative of this

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.690
with respect to y.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.610
The derivative of cosine
of y with respect to

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.190
y is minus sine of y.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:21.950
I'll do that in yellow.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.730
Minus sine of y.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.770
I just want to put
the minus out front.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.000
Minus sine of y.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.030
There you have it.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.260
Let's do another one.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.050
And actually I'm going
to add more variables.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.200
Let's say that, I don't know,
just so you get used to

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.260
the different notation.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:54.780
x is equal to a squared times,
I don't know, a squared times b

00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:00.360
to the third, times
c to the 1/2 power.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.250
Now what is the partial
derivative of x

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.560
with respect to a?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.300
Well everything else
is just a constant.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.440
What's the partial of a
squared with respect to a?

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.050
Well it's 2a.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.060
So it'll just be 2a
times the constants.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.580
Times b to the third,
c to the 1/2.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.010
I can actually get rid of
my parentheses there.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.420
What's the partial derivative
with respect to b?

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.260
Ah, sorry, what's the partial
of x with respect to b?

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.360
Well now, a squared and c to
the 1/2 are just constants.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.170
We can just write that. a
squared, c to the 1/2.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.710
And now we just take the
derivative with respect to b.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:41.850
Well that's 3b squared.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.160
Times 3b squared.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.390
If I just want to rearrange
it, that's 3a squared, b

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.410
squared, c to the 1/2 power.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.160
Not too difficult.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.640
You just have to keep in mind
what's constant and what's not.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.290
And then finally, the partial
of x with respect to c.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.480
a squared, b to the third,
those are both constants.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.560
a squared, b to the third
times derivative of

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.960
this with respect to c.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.120
1/2 c to the minus 1/2.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.510
Or we could rewrite this as
a squared, b to the third,

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.710
over 2 square root of c.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.770
Just a little bit of
algebraic manipulation.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.560
Anyway, I will see you
in the next video.
