00:00:00.931 --> 00:00:02.913
- [Voiceover] So here I'm
gonna talk about the gradient.

00:00:02.913 --> 00:00:05.040
And in this video, I'm only gonna describe

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.314
how you compute the gradient,

00:00:06.314 --> 00:00:07.614
and in the next couple ones

00:00:07.614 --> 00:00:09.705
I'm gonna give the
geometric interpretation.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:10.823
And I hate doing this,

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:11.889
I hate showing the computation

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.097
before the geometric intuition

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:15.929
since usually it should
go the other way around,

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.637
but the gradient is one
of those weird things

00:00:17.637 --> 00:00:19.732
where the way that you compute it

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:22.383
actually seems kind of
unrelated to the intuition

00:00:22.383 --> 00:00:23.117
and you'll see that.

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:25.028
We'll connect them in the next few videos.

00:00:25.028 --> 00:00:26.209
But to do that, we need to know

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:28.167
what both of them actually are.

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:30.002
So on the computation side of things,

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.164
let's say you have some sort of function.

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.236
And I'm just gonna make it
a two-variable function.

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:39.110
And let's say it's f of x, y,
equals x-squared sine of y.

00:00:40.977 --> 00:00:42.857
The gradient is a way of packing together

00:00:42.857 --> 00:00:45.908
all the partial derivative
information of a function.

00:00:45.908 --> 00:00:48.070
So let's just start by computing
the partial derivatives

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.972
of this guy.

00:00:48.972 --> 00:00:52.619
So partial of f with respect to x

00:00:53.972 --> 00:00:54.830
is equal to,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.071
so we look at this and we
consider x the variable

00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:58.659
and y the constant.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.424
Well in that case sine
of y is also a constant.

00:01:01.424 --> 00:01:03.211
As far as x is concerned,

00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:05.414
the derivative of x is 2x

00:01:05.414 --> 00:01:06.793
so we see that this will

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:10.177
be 2x times that constant sine of y,

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:13.148
sine of y.

00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:14.905
Whereas the partial derivative

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:16.492
with respect to y.

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:19.949
Now we look up here

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:22.380
and we say x is considered a constant

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.643
so x-squared is also considered a constant

00:01:24.643 --> 00:01:26.959
so this is just a
constant times sine of y,

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.533
so that's gonna equal

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:32.464
that same constant times the cosine of y,

00:01:32.464 --> 00:01:34.328
which is the derivative of sine.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.069
So now what the gradient does

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.154
is it just puts both of these together

00:01:39.154 --> 00:01:40.132
in a vector.

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:44.445
And specifically, maybe
I'll change colors here,

00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:48.127
you denote it with a little
upside-down triangle.

00:01:48.127 --> 00:01:49.958
The name of that symbol is nabla,

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.871
but you often just pronounce it del,

00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:54.273
you'd say del f or gradient of f.

00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:57.215
And what this equals

00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:59.120
is a vector

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.041
that has those two
partial derivatives in it.

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:02.422
So the first one is the partial derivative

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:03.651
with respect to x,

00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:06.083
to x times sine of y.

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:11.045
And the bottom one, partial
derivative with respect to y

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:14.558
X-squared cosine of y.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.432
And notice, maybe I should emphasize,

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:23.242
this is actually a vector-valued function.

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:28.050
So maybe I'll give it a
little bit more room here

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.047
and emphasize that it's got an x and a y.

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:33.907
This is a function that takes in

00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:35.767
a point in two-dimensional space

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:38.371
and outputs a two-dimensional vector.

00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:40.616
So you could also imagine doing this

00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:42.552
with three different variables.

00:02:42.552 --> 00:02:44.350
Then you would have three
partial derivatives,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.076
and a three-dimensional output.

00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:49.467
And the way you might
write this more generally

00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:52.012
is we could go down here
and say the gradient

00:02:52.012 --> 00:02:53.807
of any function

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:57.952
is equal to a vector with
its partial derivatives.

00:02:57.952 --> 00:03:01.126
Partial of f with respect to x,

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:05.604
and partial of f with respect to y.

00:03:05.604 --> 00:03:09.060
And in some sense, we call
these partial derivatives.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.311
I like to think as the
gradient as the full derivative

00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:12.977
cuz it kind of captures
all of the information

00:03:12.977 --> 00:03:14.324
that you need.

00:03:14.324 --> 00:03:15.825
So a very helpful mnemonic device

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.388
with the gradient is to
think about this triangle,

00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:21.158
this nabla symbol as being a vector

00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:25.151
full of partial derivative operators.

00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:28.465
And by operator, I just mean like partial

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:29.644
with respect to x,

00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:31.267
something where you
could give it a function,

00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:32.660
and it gives you another function.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.649
So you give this guy the function f

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.516
and it gives you this expression,

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.790
this multi-variable function as a result.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.595
So the nabla symbol is this vector full

00:03:41.595 --> 00:03:44.229
of different partial derivative operators.

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.749
And in this case it might
just be two of them,

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:47.932
and this is kind of a weird thing

00:03:47.932 --> 00:03:49.233
because it's like what,

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:51.140
this is a vector, it's
got like operators in it,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.529
that's not what I thought vectors do.

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:54.844
But you can kind of see where it's going.

00:03:54.844 --> 00:03:55.907
It's really just,

00:03:55.907 --> 00:03:57.899
you can think of it as a memory trick,

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.464
but in some sense it's a
little bit deeper than that.

00:04:00.464 --> 00:04:02.609
And really when you take this triangle

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.325
and you say ok let's take this triangle

00:04:04.325 --> 00:04:07.168
and you can kind of imagine
multiplying it by f,

00:04:07.168 --> 00:04:09.280
really it's like an operator
taking in this function

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.476
and it's gonna give you another function.

00:04:11.476 --> 00:04:13.105
It's like you take this
triangle and you put an f

00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:15.221
in front of it, and you can imagine,

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.337
like this part gets
multipled, quote unquote

00:04:17.337 --> 00:04:19.741
multiplied with f, this
part gets quote unquote

00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:21.410
multiplied with f but
really you're just saying

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.168
you take the partial
derivative with respect to x

00:04:24.168 --> 00:04:26.073
and then with y, and on and on.

00:04:26.073 --> 00:04:27.178
And the reason for doing this,

00:04:27.178 --> 00:04:29.536
this symbol comes up a
lot in other contexts.

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:31.775
There are two other operators
that you're gonna learn about

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:33.613
called the divergence and the curl.

00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:34.507
We'll get to those later,

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:35.572
all in due time.

00:04:35.572 --> 00:04:37.083
But it's useful to think about this

00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:40.296
vector-ish thing of partial derivatives.

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:42.898
And I mean one weird thing about it,

00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:45.869
you could say ok so this
nabla symbol is a vector

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.050
of partial derivative operators.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.923
What's its dimension?

00:04:48.923 --> 00:04:51.584
And it's like how many
dimensions do you got?

00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:53.521
Because if you had a
three-dimensional function

00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:55.032
that would mean that you should treat this

00:04:55.032 --> 00:04:57.840
like it's got three different
operators as part of it.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.708
And you know I'd kinda,
finish this off down here,

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:03.864
and if you had something
that was 100-dimensional

00:05:03.864 --> 00:05:06.513
it would have 100
different operators in it

00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:07.489
and that's fine.

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:08.426
It's really just again,

00:05:08.426 --> 00:05:10.136
kind of a memory trick.

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:13.438
So with that, that's how
you compute the gradient.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:14.241
Not too much too it,

00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:15.673
it's pretty much just partial derivatives,

00:05:15.673 --> 00:05:17.213
but you smack em into a vector

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:19.292
where it gets fun and
where it gets interesting

00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:21.612
is with the geometric interpretation.

00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:22.875
I'll get to that in
the next couple videos.

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:24.949
It's also a super important tool

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.232
for something called the
directional derivative.

00:05:27.232 --> 00:05:29.483
So you've got a lot of fun stuff ahead.
