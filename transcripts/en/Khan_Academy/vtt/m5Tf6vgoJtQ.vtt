00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.910
Let's do a couple of word
problems dealing with

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.940
exponential growth and decay.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.930
So this first problem, suppose a
radioactive substance decays

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.130
at a rate of 3.5% per hour.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.400
What percent of the substance
is left after 6 hours?

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.970
So let's make a little table
here, to just imagine

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.700
what's going on.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.940
And then we'll try to come
up with a formula for, in

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.210
general, how much is
left after n hours.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.980
So let's say hours that
have passed by,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.240
and percentage left.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.880
So after 0 hours, what
percent is left?

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.710
Well, it hasn't decayed yet,
so we have 100% left.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.570
After 1 hour, what's happened?

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.200
It decays at a rate
of 3.5% per hour.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.140
So 3.5% is gone.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.220
Or another way to think
about it is 0.965.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.860
Remember, if you take 1 minus
3.5%, or if you take 100%

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.390
minus 3.5%-- this is how much
we're losing every hour-- that

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.360
equals 96.5%.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.360
So each hour we're going
to have 96.5% of

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.720
the previous hour.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.840
So in hour 1, we're going to
have 96.5% of hour 0, or 0.965

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.970
times 100, times hour 0.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.325
Now, what happens in hour 2?

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.540
Well, we're going to have 96.5%
of the previous hour.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.120
We will have lost 3.5%, which
means that we have 96.5% of

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.190
the previous hour.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:59.870
So it'll be 0.965 times this,
times 0.965 times 100.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.660
I think you see where this
is going, in general.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.510
So in the first hour, we
have 0.965 to the first

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.780
power, times 100.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.759
In the zeroth hour, we have
0.965 to the zeroth power.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.730
We don't see it, but there's
a 1 there, times 100.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.110
In the second hour, 0.965 to the
second power, times 100.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.040
So in general, in the nth hour--
let me do this in a

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.860
nice bold color-- in the nth
hour, we're going to have

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.850
0.965 to the nth power,
times 100 left of

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.130
our radioactive substance.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.100
And oftentimes you'll see
it written this way.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.380
You have your initial amount
times your common ratio, 0.965

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.450
to the nth power.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.500
This is how much you're going
to have left after n hours.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.820
Well, now we can answer
the question.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.310
After 6 hours how much are
we going to have left?

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.860
Well, we're going to have
100 times 0.965 to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.520
the sixth power left.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.150
And we could use a calculator
to figure out what that is.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.000
Let's use our trusty
calculator.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.880
So we have 100 times 0.965 to
the sixth power, which is

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.820
equal to 80.75.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.080
This is all in percentages.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.220
So it's 80.75% of our
original substance.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.646
Let's do another one of these.

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:41.570
So we have, Nadia owns a chain
of fast food restaurants that

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.360
operated 200 stores in 1999.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.500
If the rate of increase is--
oh actually, there's a typo

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.670
here, it should be 8%-- the
rate of increase is 8%

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.760
annually, how many
stores does the

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.450
restaurant operate in 2007?

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.400
So let's think about
the same thing.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.860
So let's say years after 1999.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.019
And let's talk about how many
stores Nadia is operating, her

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.820
fast food chain.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.950
So 1999 itself is 0
years after 1999.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.710
And she is operating
200 stores.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.620
Then in 2000, which is 1 year
after 1999, how many is she

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.040
going to be operating?

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.190
Well, she grows at the
rate of 8% annually.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.060
So she'll be operating all the
stores that she had before

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.210
plus 8% of the store
she had before.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.980
So 1.08 times the number of
stores she had before.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.660
And you're going to see, the
common ratio here is 1.08.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.380
If you're growing by 8%,
that's equivalent to

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.460
multiplying by 1.08.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.740
Let me make that clear.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.290
200 plus 0.08, times 200.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.040
Well, this is just 1 times
200 plus 0.08, times 200.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.700
That's 1.08 times 200.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.920
Then in 2001, what's going on?

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.310
This is now 2 years after 1999,
and you're going to grow

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.230
8% from this number.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.330
You're going to multiply
1.08 times that number,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.510
times 1.08 times 200.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.060
I think you get the general
gist. If, after n years after

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.550
1999, it's going to be 1.08--
let me write it this way.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:54.660
It's going to be 200 times
1.08 to the nth power.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.200
After 2 years, 1.08 squared.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.370
1 year, 1.08 to the
first power.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.960
0 years, this is the same thing
as a 1 times 200, which

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.870
is 1.08 to the zeroth power.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.620
So they're asking us, how many
stores does the restaurant

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.550
operate in 2007?

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.320
Well, 2007 is 8 years
after 1999.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.090
So here n is equal to 8.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.110
So let us substitute
n is equal to 8.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.180
The answer to our question will
be 200 times 1.08 to the

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.410
eighth power.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.000
Let's get our calculator
out and calculate it.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.570
So we want to figure
out 200 times 1.08

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.090
to the eighth power.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.840
She's going to be operating 370
restaurants, and she'll be

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.250
in the process of opening
a few more.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:58.050
So if we round it down, she's
going to be operating 370

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.900
restaurants.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.255
So 8% growth might not look like
something that's so fast

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:04.910
or that exciting.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.430
But in under a decade, in only 8
years, she would have gotten

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.390
her restaurant chain from
200 to 370 restaurants.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.020
So over 8 years, you see that
the compounding growth by 8%

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.440
actually ends up being
quite dramatic.
