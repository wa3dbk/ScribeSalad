00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.360
Welcome back.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.680
In the last video, I told you
that pressure times volume is

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.370
a constant.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.660
That if you increase the
pressure-- or if you increase

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.380
the volume, you're going to
decrease the pressure.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.250
Hopefully, you got an
intuitive sense why.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.150
Or likewise, if you squeezed the
balloon, or the box, and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.100
there are no openings there,
then the pressure within the

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.540
box would increase.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.340
With that said, let's see if we
can do a couple of fairly

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.995
typical problems that
you'll see.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.299
So let's say that I have
a box, or a balloon, or

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.775
something, and it has a volume,
and so let me call

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:36.025
this the initial volume.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.540
My initial volume is 50 cubic
meters, and my initial

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.730
pressure is 500 pascals.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.620
Just so you remember,
what's a pascal?

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.655
That's 500 newtons
per meter cubed.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.260
I take that box, or balloon, or
whatever, and I compress it

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.770
down to 20 meters cubed.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.020
So I compress it, so I squeeze
it-- that was the first

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.340
example that I gave last time.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.620
It was the same container,
and I squeeze it down

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.720
to 20 meters cubed.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.540
What's going to be
the new pressure?

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.500
You should immediately have an
intuition-- what happens when

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.610
you squeeze a balloon?

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.180
It becomes harder to do it.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.550
What's going to be
the new pressure?

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.690
It's definitely going to be
higher-- when you decrease the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.470
volume, the pressure increases
are inversely related.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.670
The pressure's going to go up,
and let's see if we can

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.930
calculate it.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.250
We know that P1 times v1 is
equal to some constant, and

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.540
since we have no aggregate
change in energy-- I'm just

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.970
telling you that the box is
squeezed, I'm not telling you

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.010
whether it did any work, or
anything like that-- the same

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.620
constant is going to be equal to
the new pressure times the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.840
new volume, which is equal
to P2 times V2.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.620
You could just have the general
relationship: P1 times

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.000
V1 is equal to P2 times V2,
assuming that no work was

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.830
done, and there was no exchange
of energy from

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.240
outside of the system.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.650
In most of these cases, when you
see this on an exam, that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.350
is the case.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:44.140
The old pressure was 500 pascals
times 50 meters cubed.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.960
One thing to keep in mind,
because this equivalence is

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.430
not equal, and we're not saying
it has to equal some

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.280
necessary absolute number--
for example, we don't know

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.160
exactly what this K is, although
we could figure it

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.270
out right now-- as long as
you're using one unit for

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.070
pressure on this side, and one
unit for volume on this side,

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.330
you just have to use
the same units.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.620
We could have done this same
exact problem the exact same

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.460
way, if instead of meters cubed,
they said liters, as

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.430
long as we had liters here.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.120
You just have to make sure
you're using the same units on

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.090
both sides.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.860
In this case, we have 500
pascals as the pressure, and

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.950
the volume is 50 meters cubed.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.260
That's going to be equal to the
new pressure, P2, times

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.840
the new volume, 20
meters cubed.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.090
Let's see what we can do: we can
divide both sides by 10,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.880
so we can take the 10 out of
there, and we could divide

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.440
both sides by 2, so that
becomes a 250.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.520
We we get 250 times 5 is equal
to P2, and so P2 is equal to

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.680
1250 pascals, and if we kept
with the units, you

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.620
would have seen that.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.590
When I decreased the volume
by roughly 60%, I have the

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.950
pressure actually increased by
2 1/2, so that gels with what

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.519
we talked about before.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.500
Let's add another variable into
this mix-- let's talk

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.120
about temperature.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.450
Like pressure, volume, work, and
a lot of concepts that we

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.780
talk about in physics,
temperature is something that

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.545
you probably are at least
reasonably familiar with.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.260
How do you view temperature?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.390
A high temperature means
something is hot, and a low

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.590
temperature means something is
cold, and I think that also

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.690
gives you intuition that a
higher temperature object has

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.940
more energy.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.380
The sun has more energy than an
ice cube-- I think that's

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.350
fair enough.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.620
I think you also have the sense
that-- what would have

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.830
more energy?

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:33.890
A 100 degree cup of tea, or a
100 degree barrel of tea.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.950
I want to make them equivalent
in terms of

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.440
what they're holding.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.400
I think you have a sense.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.450
Even though they're the same
temperature, they're both

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.390
pretty warm-- let's say this
is 100 degrees Celsius, so

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.800
they're both boiling-- that the
barrel, because there's

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.070
more of it, is going to
have more energy.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.090
It's equally hot, and there's
just more molecules there.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.620
That's what temperature is.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:04.200
Temperature, in general, is a
measure roughly equal to some

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.440
constant times the kinetic
energy-- the average kinetic

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.950
energy-- per molecule.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.720
So the average kinetic energy
of the system divided by the

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.570
total number of molecules we
have. Another way we could

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.690
talk about is, temperature is

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.230
essentially energy per molecule.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.600
So something that has a lot of
molecules, where N is the

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.160
number of molecules.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.270
Another way we could view this
is that the kinetic energy of

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.840
the system is going to be
equal to the number of

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.170
molecules times the
temperature.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.960
This is just a constant-- times
1 over K, but we don't

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.430
even know what this is, so we
could say that's still a

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.910
constant-- so the kinetic energy
of the system is going

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:03.680
to be equal to some constant
times the number of particles

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.170
times temperature.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.300
We don't know what this
is, and we're going to

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.710
figure this out later.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.410
This is another interesting
concept.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:17.780
We said that pressure times
volume is proportional to the

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.710
kinetic energy of the system--
the aggregate, if you take all

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.080
of the molecules and combine
their kinetic energies.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.230
These aren't the same K's-- I
could put another constant

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.960
here and call that K1.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:36.280
And we also know that the
kinetic energy of the system

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:44.980
is equal to some other constant
times the number of

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.700
molecules I have times
the temperature.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.010
If you think about it, you could
also say that this is

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.480
proportional to this, and this
is proportional to this.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.900
You could say that pressure
times volume is proportional

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.890
to the number-- and these are
all different proportional

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.540
constants, and we'll figure
out this exact constant

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.630
later-- so we could say that
pressure times volume is

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.460
proportional to molecules we
have, times temperature.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.080
And we said that we can
view temperature

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.580
as energy per molecule.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.940
Another way we could say is
that if this constant is

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.230
constant, which is by
definition, and the number of

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:29.090
molecules is constant-- we
have PV over temperature.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.380
Pressure times volume over
temperature is going to be

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.620
equal to something times the
number of molecules, so we

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.880
could say that's some other
constant, like k4.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.370
This is another interesting
thing to think about: we said

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.320
pressure times volume is equal
to pressure times volume, and

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.980
now we added temperature
into the mix.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:56.880
We could say P1 times V1
over T1 is equal to P2

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.010
times V2 over T2.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.050
Does this make sense to you?

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:11.120
What happens if I have another
box, and I have my particles

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.370
bouncing around like always.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.080
I have some volume, and some
amount of pressure-- what

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.730
happens when the temperature
goes up?

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.720
What am I saying?

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.990
I'm saying that the average
kinetic energy per molecule is

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.270
going to go up, so they're going
to bounce against the

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.390
walls more.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.930
If they bounce against the walls
more, the pressure's

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.290
going to go up, assuming
volume stays flat.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.420
Another way you could think
about it-- let's say the

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:50.890
temperature goes up, and the
pressure stays flat.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.730
So what did I have to do?

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.380
I just said if the temperature
goes up, the average kinetic

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.230
energy of each molecule--
they'll bounce more.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.390
In order to make them bounce
against the sides of the walls

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.170
as often, I'd have to
increase the volume.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.520
If you hold pressure constant,
the only way you can do that

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.620
is by increasing the volume
while you increase the

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.840
temperature.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.230
Let's keep this in mind, and we
will use this to solve some

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.010
pretty typical problems
in the next video.
