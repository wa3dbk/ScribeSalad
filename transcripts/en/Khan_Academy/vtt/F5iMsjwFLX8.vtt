00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.790
Simplify 3 times the square
root of 200x to the third.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.130
So a good place to start,
let's factor out 200.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.170
So if I'm just focusing on the
200 here, 200 is 2 times 100.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.390
And 100 is a perfect square.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.950
It's 10 times 10.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.910
And then if we were to factor
x to the third, that's the

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.695
same thing as x squared
times x.

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:26.060
So let's write that out.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.080
So let me just rewrite.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.210
This whole thing is equal to 3
times the square root-- I'll

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.480
write it all under one big
radical sign right now-- of 2

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.890
times 100 times x
squared times x.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.610
Stretch the radical sign.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.490
So the x squared times x,
that is x to the third.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.070
And then the 200
is 2 times 100.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.370
Now, we can you think of this
as all of these numbers, the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.860
product of all these numbers to
the 1/2 power or taking the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.320
square root of the product,
that's like taking the square

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.130
root of-- or that's equivalent
to-- taking the square root of

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.090
each of these terms. So this
is going to be equal to 3

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.240
times the square root of 2 times
the square root of 100

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.370
times the square root of
x squared times the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.620
square root of x.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.200
These terms right there
in blue, that's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.000
these terms right there.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.200
The terms in orange, that's
those terms right over there.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.170
Now, several of these are not
too hard to evaluate.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.370
So we have our 3 out front.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.410
So this is going to
be equal to 3.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.990
And then let me mark off the
terms. Let's do this one the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.460
first.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.030
What's the square root of 100?

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.880
Or the principal root of 100?

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.890
The positive square root.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.580
Well it's 10.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.160
10 times 10 is 100.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.950
It's going to be 3 times 10.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.570
That's that term right there.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.570
And then, what is the square
root of x squared?

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.790
Well it's just x. x times
x is x squared.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.840
So times x.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.130
And then we have to deal-- so
we've dealt with that, we've

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.390
dealt with that, we've
dealt with that.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.940
And then we have these two
terms right here where we

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.080
can't take the square roots.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.320
So we could say times the square
root of 2 times the

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.100
square root of x.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.180
So this term right here times
the square root of 2.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.860
And then, finally, out here
times the square root of x.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.990
So if we want to simplify this
fully, we'd get 3 times 10

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.540
times x, which is 30x.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.090
And then we could actually
merge these.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.960
The square root of 2 times
the square root of x.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.950
That's the same thing as
the square root of 2x.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.890
So we could say times the
square root of 2x.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.980
And we have simplified this
as far as it can go.
