00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.960
In the last video, we divided
100 into 99.061, and we did it

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.770
the manual way.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.510
We did it the long
division way.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.690
In this video, I just want to
show you a quick shortcut

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.900
because we're dividing something
by a power of ten.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.690
If I have 99.061, if I multiply
by a power of ten,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.080
I'm going to make the
number bigger.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.770
Every time I multiply by 10, the
decimal would shift to the

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.250
right by one spot.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.320
So we could say, 99.061
times 10 is going

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.770
to be equal to 990.61.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.060
Notice we just moved
the decimal over to

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.670
the right by one.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.590
If I were to do-- I'll just
arbitrarily switch colors--

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.670
99.061 divided by 10, we're
going to shift the decimal in

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.830
the other direction.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.600
This is going to be 9.9061.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.180
So when we divide by 100, we're
dividing by 10 twice.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.340
We're shifting to
the left twice.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:17.150
So if we start with 99.061
divided by 100-- let me just

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.760
write it like this.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.960
We've already written
the problem.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.570
If we want to divide this by
100, moving it one spot to the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.340
left will divide it by 10, and
then moving another spot to

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.930
the left will divide
it by 10 again.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:41.400
So 99.061 divided by 100 is
going to be equal to 0.99061.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.560
We're just going to shift the
decimal to the left by two.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.920
And we might want to put a
leading zero here, just so it

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.220
makes it a little bit
easier to read.
