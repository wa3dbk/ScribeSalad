00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.980
Now I think is a good time
to add some notation and

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.560
techniques to our Laplace
Transform tool kit.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.430
So the first thing I want to
introduce is just kind of a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.270
quick way of doing something.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.490
And that is, if I had the
Laplace Transform, let's say I

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.540
want to take the Laplace
Transform of the second

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.540
derivative of y.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.690
Well, we proved several videos
ago that if I wanted to take

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.830
the Laplace Transform of the
first derivative of y, that is

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:41.060
equal to s times the Laplace
Transform of y minus y of 0.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.970
And we used this property in the
last couple of videos to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.170
actually figure out the Laplace
Transform of the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.630
second derivative.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.780
Because if you just, you know,
if you say this is y prime,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.640
this is the anti-derivative
of it, then you could just

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.260
pattern match.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.220
You could say, well, the Laplace
Transform of y prime

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.050
prime, that's just equal to s
times the Laplace Transform of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.800
y prime minus y prime of 0.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.960
This is the derivative of this,
just like this is the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.430
derivative of this.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.900
I'll draw a line here just so
you don't get confused.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.410
So the Laplace Transform of y
prime prime is this thing.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.580
And now we can use this, which
we proved several videos ago,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.740
to resubstitute it and get it
in terms of the Laplace

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.120
Transform of y.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.470
So we can expand this part.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.800
The Laplace Transform of the
derivative of y, that's just

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:39.770
equal to s times the Laplace
Transform of y minus y of 0.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.370
And then we have the
outside, right?

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.290
We have s minus y prime of 0.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.180
And then when you expand it all
out, and we've done this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.700
before, you get s squared times
the Laplace Transform of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.550
y minus s times y of 0
minus y prime of 0.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.170
Now there's something
interesting to note here, and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.300
if you learn this it'll
make it a lot faster.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.250
You won't have to go through
all of this and risk making

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.980
careless mistakes when you have
scarce time and paper on

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.050
your test. Just notice that
when you take the Laplace

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.400
Transform of the second
derivative, what do we end up?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.150
We end up with s
squared, right?

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.940
This was the second
derivative.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.600
So I end up with s squared times
the Laplace Transform of

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.420
y, minus s times y of 0 minus
1 times y prime of 0.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.710
So every term, we started with s
squared, and then every term

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.590
we lower the degree of s one,
and then everything except the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.370
first term is a negative sign.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.830
And then we started with the
Laplace Transform of y, and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.360
then you can almost view the
Laplace Transform as a kind of

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.390
integral, so we kind of take
the derivatives, so

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.700
then you get y.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.550
And then you take
the derivative

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.810
again, you get y prime.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.380
And of course every other
term is negative.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.790
And these aren't the
actual functions.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.600
These are those functions
evaluated at 0.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.710
But that's a good way to help
you, hopefully, remember how

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.250
to do these.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.000
And once you get the hang of it,
you can take the Laplace

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.260
Transform of any arbitrary
function very, very quickly.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.640
Or any arbitrary derivatives.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.550
So let's say we wanted to take
the Laplace Transform of, I

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.950
don't know, this should hit
the point home, the fourth

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.290
derivative of y.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.380
That 4 in parentheses means
the fourth derivative.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.450
I could have drawn four prime
marks, but either way.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.430
So what is this equal to?

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.620
If we use this technique and
substitute it, we're bound to

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.130
make some form of careless
mistake or other, and it would

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.040
take us forever and it would
waste a lot of paper.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.940
But now we see the pattern, and
so we can just say, well,

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.540
the Laplace Transform of this,
in terms of the Laplace

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.020
Transform of y, right, that's
what we want to get to, is

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:48.250
going to be s to the fourth
times the Laplace Transform of

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.160
y-- now every other term is
going to have a minus in front

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.600
of it-- minus-- lower the
degree on the s--

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.880
minus s to the third.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.060
And then you could kind of say,
let's take the, you know,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.210
so form of derivative, so you
get y of 0-- it's not a real

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.480
derivative.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.215
The Laplace Transform really
isn't the anti-derivative of y

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:11.500
of 0, but anyway, I think
you get the idea.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.260
And then we lower the degree on
s again, minus s squared,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.450
take the derivative.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.820
And of course these
aren't functions.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.350
But we're evaluating the
derivative of that

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.110
function now of 0.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.350
So y prime of 0, minus-- now we
lower the degree one more--

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:37.450
minus s, times-- this is an s--
times y prime prime of 0.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.670
We have one more term.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.520
Lower the degree on the
s one more time.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.980
Then you get s to the
0, which is just 1.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.560
So minus-- and 1 is a
coefficient-- and then you

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.281
have y, the third derivative
of y-- let me scroll over a

00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:52.330
little bit-- the third
derivative of y

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.430
evaluated at 0.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.860
So I think you see
the pattern now.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.460
And this is a much faster way
of evaluating the Laplace

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.990
Transform of an arbitrary
derivative of y, as opposed to

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.090
keep going through that pattern
over and over again.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.500
Another thing I want to
introduce you to is just a

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.850
notational savings.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.990
And it's just something that
you'll see, so you might as

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.330
well get used to it.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.790
And it actually saves time over,
you know, keep writing

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.820
this curly L in this bracket.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.110
If I have the Laplace Transform
of y of t, I can

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.330
write as, and people tend to
write it as-- well, it's going

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.000
to be a function of s, and what
they use is a capital Y

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.720
to denote the function of s.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.910
It makes sense, because normally
when we're doing

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.880
antiderivatives, you just take--
you know, when you

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.660
learn the fundamental theorem
of calculus, you learn that

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.620
the integral of f with respect
to dx, you know, from 0 to x,

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.580
is equal to capital F of x.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.080
So it's kind of borrowing that
notation, because this

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.550
function of s is kind of
an integral of y of t.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.210
The Laplace Transform, to some
degree, is like a special type

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.210
of integral where you have a
little exponential function in

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.800
there to mess around with
things a little bit.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.830
Anyway, I just wanted you to
get used to this notation.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.410
When you see capital Y of s,
that's the same thing as a

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.190
Laplace Transform of y of t.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.820
And you might also
see it this way.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:36.250
The Laplace Transform of f of t
is equal to capital F of s.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.140
And the clue that tells you that
this isn't just a normal

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.950
antiderivative, is the fact that
they're using that s as

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.110
the independent variable.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.620
Because in general, s represents
the frequency

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.250
domain, and if people were to
use s with just a general

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.350
antiderivative, people
would get confused,

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.350
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.520
Anyway, I'm trying to think
whether I have time to teach

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.480
you more fascinating concepts
of Laplace Transform.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.260
Well, sure, I think we do.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.586
So my next question for you--
and now we'll teach you a

00:07:04.586 --> 00:07:06.660
couple more properties, and
this'll be helpful in taking

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:13.750
Laplace Transforms. What is the
Laplace Transform of e to

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.160
the at times f of t?

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.170
Fascinating.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.140
Well, let's just should go back
to our definition of the

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.700
Laplace Transform.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:30.880
It is the integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus st

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.310
times whatever we have between
the curly brackets.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:43.980
So, with the curly brackets we
have e to the at f of t dt.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.550
And now we can add
these exponents.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.630
We have a similar base, so
this is equal to what?

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:53.660
This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.440
And let's see, I want to write
it as, I could write it minus

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.680
s plus a, but I'm going to write
it as minus s minus a t.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.790
And you could expand this out.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.490
It becomes minus s plus a, which
is exactly what we have

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:12.280
here, times f of t dt.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.190
Now let me show you something.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:24.300
if I were to just take the
Laplace Transform of f of t,

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.320
that is equal to some
function of s.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.390
Whatever we essentially have
right here for s, it becomes

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.440
some function of that.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.900
So this is interesting.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.820
This is some function of s.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.309
Here, all we did to go
from-- well actually

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:43.080
let me rewrite this.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:49.590
The Laplace, which is equal to
0 to infinity e to the minus

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:55.380
st f of t dt.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.640
The Laplace Transform of just f
of t is equal to this, which

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.260
is some function of s.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.200
Well, the Laplace Transform of
e to the at, times f of t, it

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.800
equals this.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.510
And what's the difference
between this and this?

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.770
What's the difference
between the two?

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.910
Well, it's not much.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:19.430
Here, wherever I have an s,
I have an s minus a here.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.350
So if this is a function of s,
what's this going to be?

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.150
It's going to be that
same function.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.220
Whatever the Laplace Transform
of f was, it's going to be

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.450
that same function, but instead
of s, it's going to be

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:33.510
a function of s minus a.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.540
And once again, how
did I get that?

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.200
Well I said the Laplace
Transform of f is a function

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.940
of s, and it's equal to this.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.420
Well if I just replace an s with
an s minus a, I get this,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.390
which is a function
of s minus a.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.680
Which was the Laplace Transform
of e to the

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.490
at times f of t.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.360
Maybe that's a little
confusing.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.920
Let me show you an example.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:03.390
Let's just take the Laplace
Transform of cosine of 2t.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:08.720
We've shown is equal to-- well
I'll write the notation-- it's

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.865
equal to some function of s.

00:10:10.865 --> 00:10:15.110
And that function of s is
s over s squared plus 4.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.940
We've shown that already.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:25.120
And so the Laplace Transform of
e to the, I don't know, 3t

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.820
times cosine of 2t, is going
to be equal to the same

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.970
function, but instead of
s, it's going to be a

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.760
function of s minus a.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:46.170
So s minus 3, which is equal
to s minus 3 over s minus 3

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:52.220
squared plus 4.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.320
Notice, when you just multiply
something by this, either the

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.230
3t and then or either the at,
you take the Laplace Transform

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.690
of it, you just-- it's the
same thing as the Laplace

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.010
Transform of this function, but
everywhere where you had

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.840
an s, you replace it with
an s minus this a.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.870
Anyway, I hope I didn't
confuse you too much

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:09.600
with that last part.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.970
I think my power adaptor
actually just went on.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.210
I hope the video keeps
recording.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.540
I'll see you in the next one.
