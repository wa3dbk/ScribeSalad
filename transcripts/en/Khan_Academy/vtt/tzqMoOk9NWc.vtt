00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:04.810
Let's say that you´re the owner of some type of copyrighted material-

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.267
maybe it's a movie, maybe it's music of some kind-

00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:10.918
and you observe that there is a site that is operating

00:00:10.918 --> 00:00:14.025
outside of the United States and that site-at least in your mind-

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:20.000
seems to be infringing on your copyright by US law.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.933
So this is the site in question - and you're saying that it is doing illegal things, at least by US standards.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.867
The problem is that there's nothing you can do -

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:34.200
it's operating outside of US soil and outside of US laws.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.800
You can even go to the government, even if the government wanted to do something about it,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.267
it really couldn't. Because once again, it's outside the US jurisdiction.

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:45.800
The purpose of SOPA-and it seems fairly benign at first-

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.600
is to give some tools to these actors to stop this.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.667
The problem-and we´ll see that it's quite a large problem-

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.667
is that it gives tools to these actors to do much more than just stopping illegal activity;

00:00:56.667 --> 00:01:00.867
it allows them essentially to go on, to some degree, a kind of a witch hunt

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:04.867
for anyone that might even have a whiff of enabling this type of activity.

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:07.867
-it won´t even just be for foreign sites.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.200
So let's write this down, so SOPA stands for:

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.533
Stop Online Piracy Act -

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.200
and it sounds pretty reasonable -

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.600
and this is the version of the bill that's coming from the House of Representatives.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.133
The one from the Senate, that's slightly different

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.267
but they have the same intent, is PIPA [Protect IP Act].

00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:26.067
And what it does is, if you can´t go after this site itself

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:30.467
maybe you can go after sites that is somehow benefiting this site.

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:32.933
And those sites are inside the United States.

00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:36.400
So this is outside, this is inside the United States.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.600
So things that are doing that might include search engines.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.133
So search engines like Google or Bing.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.933
They obviously link to this site over here. You might have ad networks -

00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:53.533
so sites that allow this site over here to display ads and to get revenue from them -

00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.867
that are benefiting this site over here.

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:58.733
You might have payment sites like PayPal

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:04.133
or credit card processors that this site uses to collect revenue.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:09.600
And, maybe most importantly, you have things like the DNS servers within the US

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.467
that associate this site's domain name with the actual servers.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:17.133
And I wont get too technical about it, but when you type in

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:22.533
something like www.shady.foreign

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:24.800
, and once again, we´re gonna see that this site might

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.267
not even have to be shady or foreign-

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:29.200
but when you type something like that in -

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.800
there´re servers in the United states that associate that with these servers

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.067
that might be operated outside the United States - that associate this text with a number

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:42.867
that points to this website, that points to this website's servers.

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:44.800
So these are all things within the United States -

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.667
that to some degree this site is dependent on.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.800
So what SOPA does is, it allows these actors here -

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.267
the ones that are obviously concerned with enforcing their copyrights -

00:02:56.267 --> 00:03:01.333
to issue court orders and notices to these actors right over here

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:05.000
that essentially compels them, very strongly, to immediately

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.533
cut off ties with this illegal site - or what they think is an illegal site.

00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:16.333
Now that might seem reasonable to you, except for the fact that

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:19.600
it's kind of a "shoot first and think later" type of policy.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.533
The basic way it works is, you presume guilt until this guy

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:26.467
somehow tries to prove his innocence and we´ll see

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:29.133
this guy isn't necessarily outside the US.

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:31.667
It might even be completely legal, or what I would consider

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.667
completely legal sites inside the US.

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.267
Essentially as soon as this allegation is made and either a court order

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:42.000
or a notice is payed, these enablers have to cut off ties to this site -

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.467
and you can imagine that if these cut off ties to this site,

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:48.800
- this sites´ business - whatever it might be - whether illegal or legal,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.333
immediately gets obliterated, especially this one here

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.200
including search engines, ad networks and payments.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.267
And if they don´t comply then these guys are going to start having a legal battle.

00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:02.067
So these guys are not only going to have to comply-and that by itself is hard-

00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:04.800
but if they don´t comply, then they themselves are going to be in trouble.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.333
Now it gets really obviously creepy, when you start

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.867
going into - so when you think of this - you´re like

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:13.667
okay, so maybe we can work around this a little bit.

00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:16.800
But it gets creepy when you even know this is the spirit of the legislation,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.067
when you actually read the wording of the legislation-

00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:21.200
and obviously that's what matters, not the name or the intent-

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.533
But actually how it's worded-I mean, the way it's worded

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:27.600
- it´s pretty clear that its intent is to go after much more

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.267
than just a site that's explicitly selling illegal pharmaceuticals or

00:04:31.267 --> 00:04:37.631
allowing people to download movies or, or videos or music

00:04:37.662 --> 00:04:40.425
that these owners don´t have access to.

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:43.518
When you read the wording, it's pretty clear that they want to be able

00:04:43.564 --> 00:04:47.000
to shut down anything that is in any way associating with itself -

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.200
or in any way enabling it.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.333
And you see it in the wording. So this is actually section 1.0.3 of the SOPA legislation

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:59.267
- and this is how they define a site that is dedicated to theft of US property.

00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:03.333
So an internet site is dedicated to theft of US property if -

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.864
and, so you know, it's useable by people in the United States -

00:05:05.864 --> 00:05:10.200
and this is interesting: It´s "primarily designed or operated for the purpose of,"

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.200
"has only limited purpose or use other than,"

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.800
"or is marketed by its operator or another acting in concert"

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.133
"with that operator for use in, offering goods or services in a manner"

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:22.867
"that engages in, enables, or facilitates" - now this is interesting -

00:05:22.867 --> 00:05:26.800
enables or facilitates all of these violations.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.333
And these are the violations that would be illegal:

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:31.333
You´re selling things that you can´t sell,

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:34.200
you´re infringing on other people´s copyright.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.533
And it might seem harmless, this "enables, or facilitates", until you think about

00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:40.600
what that could encapsulate.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.200
If I have a site, like this, I am part of a site: Khan Academy

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.600
Let´s say someone puts a message on Khan Academy

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.267
and from Khan Academy they link to a site that actually is really illegal

00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:56.815
and that is really shady and they link to it in the message boards.

00:05:56.831 --> 00:06:01.000
Well, under this am I enabling, is Khan Academy enabling or facilitating?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.667
And if that's the case, then Khan Academy - by this definition -

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:08.702
would be considered to be a site that is dedicated to theft of US property.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.400
And there are much bigger players than just Khan Academy,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.067
that can be thrown into this bucket, players like YouTube or Vimeo or any site.

00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:19.800
Or even a news site, that allows people to put comments,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.338
or allows people to put images, things like Flickr.

00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:26.800
That maybe had - in some way - their users infringing on the copyright

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.400
now all of the sudden the whole site - based on this definition - the entire site

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.800
can be defined as a site dedicated to theft of US property.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.533
By this definition YouTube could be that, if it's viewed in kind of

00:06:38.533 --> 00:06:41.267
enabling or facilitating.

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:43.667
Khan Academy, any news site could be viewed like that.

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:45.200
Vimeo could be viewed that way,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.067
a photo sharing site could be viewed like that.

00:06:47.067 --> 00:06:49.267
People might take a photo or something that they don´t have the copyright

00:06:49.267 --> 00:06:52.000
and upload an image and all the sudden - by this definition -

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.133
based on just a sense that that's being violated,

00:06:57.133 --> 00:07:00.467
they won´t just be able to shut down these illegal sites;

00:07:00.467 --> 00:07:03.600
they would be able to shut down things like YouTube, or Vimeo,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.200
or even things like CNN.com, if someone puts a message

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.533
or an image, that they think is somehow violating.

00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:14.333
And so it's not just going-right now the methodology is,

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:17.600
if there is some content on YouTube or Vimeo or some other site,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.533
that they feel is infringing on their copyright,

00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:22.800
there are laws, where they contact YouTube directly,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.267
they point them to the content, that seems to be infringing

00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:30.067
and YouTube, or Vimeo, or whoever will take down that content.

00:07:30.067 --> 00:07:32.667
But what this allows them to do is shoot first and think later:

00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:35.000
"Oh, look: You´re enabling that"; if they could convince some court

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.733
to give a court order, they can start giving notice to these players right over here

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:44.200
to cut off ties with major - what I would consider very legal sites -

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.841
like YouTube or Vimeo or CNN.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.633
It´s really almost any site that allows people to upload things onto it,

00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:55.267
or put links on it, which is almost - Facebook is another one -

00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:59.200
anything that has user generated content.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.000
On just a whim they could take down the entire site -

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.800
not just take down that user generated content -

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.133
they could, on just convincing one judge, or convincing just any of these,

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:10.133
they could cut off ties with Facebook.

00:08:10.133 --> 00:08:13.733
Not even making Facebook.com point to Facebook anymore.

00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:17.333
CNN - they could just completely take down these sites on a whim.

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.533
And it gets worse than that, because you would say:

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:21.467
"well, look, if they can take this down on a whim and, you know,"

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:23.600
"maybe they kind of thought it was, but they didn't do their homework"

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.133
"and then they realize that it wasn't copyright infringement,"

00:08:26.133 --> 00:08:29.800
"couldn't these guys sue back?"-although, already, the damage would have been done,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.431
these sites would have been taken down;

00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:33.400
they would have lost millions or billions of dollars;

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.067
millions, or tens or hundreds of millions, of users would not be able to access these things

00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:39.052
and this would also be true for Wikipedia,

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:43.533
if someone uploaded something that wasn't completely, 100%, vetted,

00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:48.867
they could take down the entire site, not just that content.

00:08:48.867 --> 00:08:50.421
And you say: "Okay, that's bad enough!"

00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:53.667
"But couldn't these people say: `Hey, look, you wrongfully took us down,`"

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:56.467
"`we´re going to sue you now`". Well to see that they can´t and

00:08:56.467 --> 00:08:59.600
to see how one-sided this legislation is, notice:

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.267
The threshold for being able to sued back, if you kind of

00:09:03.267 --> 00:09:07.333
misrepresented a violation - the only way you´re kind of held

00:09:07.333 --> 00:09:12.133
accountable is if you knowingly, materially misrepresented the violation.

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:16.600
So, if the copyright holder just says: "Oh, I think someone on YouTube"-you know-

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.867
"I feel pretty good that someone on YouTube is violating"

00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:22.533
and that YouTube is enabling a violation and, therefore, YouTube

00:09:22.533 --> 00:09:26.600
is a site dedicated to theft of US property and it later on

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.333
it finds out that it wasn't, it was fair use or maybe that person

00:09:30.333 --> 00:09:32.133
actually did have the copyright to it,

00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:34.200
they can´t be sued, because they said: "Oh, I just thought it was";

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.933
they weren't knowingly materially misrepresenting themselves.

00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:43.800
So even if it ends up not even being a violation, these guys

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.267
could take the site down. Maybe some small producers actually

00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:49.133
secured the rights, put it up on YouTube and then,

00:09:49.133 --> 00:09:52.200
all of the sudden, these guys take down all of YouTube based on

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.867
not actually knowing what they are talking about.

00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:59.133
And there can´t even be a counter suit in that case, based on the law.

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:02.533
And it gets even creepier than that, because to be considered this

00:10:02.533 --> 00:10:06.200
you don´t even just have to enable or facilitate - which is almost anything-

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.667
one could argue a computer is enabling or facilitating this on some level.

00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:15.867
But you are considered to be a site dedicated to theft of US property,

00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:18.800
even if you do nothing illegal, even if you don´t enable anything illegal,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.333
but if you just take actions that make it difficult for authorities to confirm

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:28.333
that you´re doing something illegal. So if you view this in the physical world:

00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:31.800
obviously, some people are doing illegal things in their homes

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.733
and, obviously, some people lock their doors to keep people out of their homes.

00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:38.333
And maybe people are doing illegal things, it would even be

00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:40.769
more likely to lock their doors and close their shutters.

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:43.733
What this would do-and this would do it in the virtual sense-

00:10:43.733 --> 00:10:48.467
is say: "Look! Just by taking the deliberate action of closing your shutters"

00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:51.067
"and looking your doors, which makes it hard for federal agents to confirm"

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:56.800
"that you´re doing illegal things - just by doing that - that itself is an illegal act".

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.333
This is maybe one of the creepiest and draconian Intrusions of privacy,

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:03.533
that I have actually heard of,

00:11:03.533 --> 00:11:06.000
that was even attempted to be passed into law.

00:11:06.000 --> 99:59:59.999
So if I were you - just as a kind of a privacy and liberty loving American - I´d be worried.
