00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.030
In the last video, we had a ten kilogram mass

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.640
sitting on top of an inclined plane at a 30 degree angle

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.220
And in order to figure out what would happen to this block

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.020
we broke down the force of gravity on this block into

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.860
the components that are parallel to the surface of the plane

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.010
and perpendicular to the surface of the plane

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.200
and for a perpendicular component, we got 49 times the square root of 3 N downwards

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.950
That's 98 times this quantity over here, downwards

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.850
But we said look! We don't see this block of ice accelerating downwards into this wedge

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.630
because the wedge is supporting it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.540
So there must be a counteracting force that the wedge is exerting on the block

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.990
And that counteracting force is the normal force of the wedge on the block of ice

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.450
And that is exactly opposite to the force of gravity in this direction

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.240
The normal force of gravity is the normal force of the wedge

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.690
And these completely balance each other out in that normal, perpendicular direction

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.620
And that is why this block is not accelerating either in that direction

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.220
or in this direction over here

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.740
But the one component of the force of gravity that did not seem to have any offset

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.320
(at least the way we set up the problem in the last video)

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.400
is the force/component that is parallel to the surface of the plane

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.910
And we figured that out to be 49N, it was

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.750
essentially the weight of the block times the sin of this angle

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.020
And we said look, if there is no other forces

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.710
then it would be accelerated in this direction

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.870
And to figure out the rate of acceleration

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.030
you take the force in that direction divided by the mass of the block

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.880
and you would get 4.9 m/s^2

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.970
Now let's say that wasn't happening. Let's say that you were to look at this system

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.620
right over here and the block was just stationary

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.460
And now, for the sake of argument, let's assume it is not ice on ice

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.100
Let's assume that they are both made out of wood

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.300
And now all of a sudden we have a situation where the block is stationary

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.480
If it is stationary, what is necessarily the case?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.310
Well we already determined that if it is not accelerating in this normal direction

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.490
there must be zero net forces on it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.420
But if it is stationary as a whole

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.920
then there must be zero net forces in the parallel component too

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.890
So there must be some force counteracting this 49 N that wants to take it down the slope

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.110
So there must be some force counteracting

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.920
the component of gravity that wants to accelerate it down the slope

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.870
And the question is what is this force? We're dealing with a situation now

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.880
where we're dealing with a stationary block, a block that is not accelerating

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.370
So what is that force?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.430
I think you know from experience maybe what is the difference between

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.000
a block of wood on top of wood and a block of ice on top of ice

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.130
A block of ice on top of ice is much more slippery; there is no friction

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.320
between ice and ice, but there is friction between wood and wood

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.520
To make it a little bit more tangible, maybe we'd put some sandpaper on the surface over here

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.070
And then it becomes a little bit clearer. The force

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.530
that is keeping this block from sliding down in this situation is the force of friction

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.690
and the force of friction will always act in a direction opposite

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.090
to the motion if there was not any friction

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:44.230
or the potential acceleration if there was not any action

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.400
So what is the force of friction in this case?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.460
Well, this block is completely stationary. It's not accelerating down the ramp

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:06.810
The force of friction over here is going to be 49 N, upwards, up the ramp

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.820
Now I want think about, this is something that can be determined experimentally

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.860
as long as you have some way of measuring force, you can do this experimentally

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.090
But the interesting question here is

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.320
how much do I have to push on this block

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.140
until it starts to move down the ramp? How much do I have to push on it?

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.330
Let's say you are able to experimentally determine

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:55.230
that if you can apply another 1 N on this

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.930
then all of a sudden, I can at least get the box to start accelerating down

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.080
Not the rate which it would do naturally, but I can just start to nudge it down

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.550
if I give it another push of one N in the parallel direction

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.590
So what is the total force--so exactly one N

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.740
So the total force at this point that's acting on it in order to just start to budge it

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.780
I'll call this the budging force

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.600
Remember here isn't a traditional class

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.940
F sub B for the budging force

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.790
The budging force is in the parallel direction

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.820
If I'm applying 1 N in this direction and it already has 49 N due to

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.920
the component of gravity in this direction, then my budging force is 50 N

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.170
And so an interesting thing that you can determine

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.890
based on the materials that are coming in contact with each other is

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.080
just how much force you need to just start to overcome friction

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.620
In this case, it's the budging force. That's a term that I made up

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.860
And the interesting ratio which tends to hold for given materials pretty well

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.770
is the ratio between the amount of force just to budge it

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.810
and the amount of force between the two objects

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.130
between how much force they are exerting on each other

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:17.620
And in this case, the amount of force that is being exerted by this, by the wedge on the block

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.090
is the normal force, is 49 sqrt of 3

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.080
Maybe I should say the magnitude of the budging force

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.100
over the magnitude of the force that is putting these two things in contact

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.970
In this case, it is 49 square root of 3 N

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:43.270
Over the magnitude of the normal force, and that is 49 sqrt of 3

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.410
We call this the coefficient of static friction

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.690
We're gonna use this a little bit more deeply in other problems

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.010
but it tends to hold true for different materials so that

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.560
in the future if you have a different mass, you have a different incline

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.920
but you have the same materials

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.270
given the normal force, you can figure out the budging force

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.580
You can figure out exactly how much force you need to put

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.870
if you know this, which you usually figure out experimentally

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.240
So what would be the value in this case? You have 50 N over 49 square root of 3 N

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.240
Let's get the calculator out

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:31.840
So I have 50 divided by 40 times the square root of 3

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.430
Gives me .72--I'll just round to two significant digits--0.72

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.570
This is 0.72

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:52.210
And then you can use this information. This is the coefficient of static friction

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.330
We call it the coefficient of static friction because

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:02.470
this deals with the ratio of the force of friction relative to the normal force

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.130
I guess the force just to overcome the force of friction, just kind of get right over that

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:12.330
the most friction that can be applied by kind of the abrasiveness of the 2 things

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.510
when the object is stationary

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.890
I'll do a whole video on how this is different

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.830
when an object is stationary to when it's moving

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.430
A lot of times, they're very very very close, but for certain materials

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.160
you have a very--at least, a noticeably different coefficient

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.280
of friction when the object is stationery as opposed to when it is moving

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.730
So I'll leave you there. In the next few videos, we'll use coefficient of friction

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.270
or calculate coefficient of friction to do some more problems
