00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:05.042
Now that we're comfortable with the "why" of why we do something to both sides of an equation,

00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:07.678
let's see if we can apply it to some equations to solve for

00:00:07.678 --> 00:00:16.544
an unknown variable. So let's say that you have x plus seven is equal to ten, and I want to solve for x.

00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:20.329
All its saying is something plus seven is equal to ten, and you might be able to figure that out in your head,

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.873
but if you want to do it a little bit more systematically, you're like well just

00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:26.781
all I want on the left hand side is an x. Well if all I want on the left hand side is an x

00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:33.023
I'd want to get rid of the seven. I want to subtract seven from the left-hand side, but if I want to maintain an equality

00:00:33.023 --> 00:00:38.729
here, whatever I do to the left-hand side I also have to do to the right-hand side going back to our scales

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:43.677
that's so that we can keep our scale balanced, so that we can say that the left is still equal to the right.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:50.564
And so what we're going to be left with is x and then the sevens cancel out

00:00:50.564 --> 00:00:56.493
is equal to ten minus seven is equal to three. So that unknown is three,

00:00:56.493 --> 00:01:01.562
and you can verify it, three plus seven is indeed equal to ten.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:10.749
Let's try one more. Let's say we have a minus five is equal to negative two.

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:15.395
So this is a little bit more interesting since we have all of these negative numbers here, but we can use

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:19.727
the exact same logic. We just want an a over here on the left-hand side

00:01:19.727 --> 00:01:23.023
so we have to get rid of this negative five somehow.

00:01:23.023 --> 00:01:26.244
Well the best way of getting rid of a negative 5 is to add five to it.

00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:30.630
So I'll do that. So I will add five to the left-hand side.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.311
But if I want the left-hand side to stay equal to the right-hand side,

00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:36.348
whatever I do to the left I have to do the right.

00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:40.193
So I'm going to have to add five on the right-hand side as well,

00:01:40.193 --> 00:01:48.755
and so on the left-hand side I'm left with a, and then the negative five and the positive five cancel out

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:53.179
and on the right hand side, and they're going to stay equal because I did the same thing to both sides,

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.424
we have negative two plus five which is equal to three.

00:01:57.424 --> 00:02:02.362
So a is equal to three. Once again you can verify it.

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:06.362
Three minus five is indeed equal to negative two.
