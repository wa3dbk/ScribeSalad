00:00:00.813 --> 00:00:10.533
Solve for x, 5x - 3 is less than 12 "and" 4x plus 1 is greater than 25.

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.867
So let's just solve for X in each of these constraints and keep in mind

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:16.867
that any x has to satisfy both of them

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:18.867
because it's an "and" over here

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:20.600
so first we have this 5 x

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.308
minus 3 is less than 12

00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:25.738
so if we want to isolate the x

00:00:25.738 --> 00:00:28.036
we can get rid of this negative 3

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:29.200
here by adding 3 to both sides

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.467
so let's add 3 to both sides of this inequality.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:38.000
The left-hand side, we're just left with a 5x, the minus 3 and the plus 3 cancel out.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.113
5x is less than 12 plus 3 is 15.

00:00:42.113 --> 00:00:44.600
Now we can divide both sides by positive 5,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.467
that won't swap the inequality since 5 is positive.

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:50.600
So we divide both sides by positive 5

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.046
and we are left with just from this constraint

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:57.041
that x is less than 15 over 5, which is 3.

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:59.333
So that constraint over here.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.667
But we have the second constraint as well.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:05.600
We have this one, we have 4x plus 1

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.964
is greater than 25.

00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:11.800
So very similarly we can subtract one from both sides

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.467
to get rid of that one on the left-hand side.

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:17.667
And we get 4x, the ones cancel out.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:22.267
is greater than 25 minus one is 24.

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:25.000
Divide both sides by positive 4

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.810
Don't have to do anything to the inequality since

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.323
it's a positive number.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.667
And we get x is greater than

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.600
24 over 4 is 6.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.800
And remember there was that "and" over here.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.800
We have this "and".

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.533
So x has to be less than 3 "and" x has to be greater than 6.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.585
So already your brain might be realizing

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:51.600
that this is a little bit strange.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.333
This first constraint says that x needs to be less than 3

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.933
so this is 3 on the number line.

00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:00.867
We're saying x has to be less than 3

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:05.000
so it has to be in this shaded area right over there.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.569
This second constraint says that x has to be

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:08.882
greater than 6.

00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:11.698
So if this is 6 over here, it says that x has to greater than 6.

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.200
It can't even include 6.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.200
And since we have this "and" here.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.467
The only x-es that are a solution for this compound inequality

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:21.333
are the ones that satisfy both.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.133
The ones that are in the overlap

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:24.667
of their solution set.

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:26.267
But when you look at it right over here it's clear that

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:27.800
there is no overlap.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.133
There is no x that is both greater than 6 "and" less than 3.

00:02:33.133 --> 99:59:59.999
So in this situation we have no solution.
