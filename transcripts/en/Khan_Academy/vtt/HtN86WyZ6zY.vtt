00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:07.110
A cliff diver dives off of a
cliff 85 feet above the water.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.850
If the diver's initial vertical
velocity is negative

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.480
5 feet per second-- so he's
going downward, so they tell

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.700
us right here-- 5 feet per
second downward, and the

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.680
acceleration of gravity is
negative 32 feet per second

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.660
squared, or 32 feet per second
downward-- so that means after

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.110
every second, you're going 32
feet per second faster in the

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.620
downward direction-- how long is
the diver in the air before

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.170
entering the water?

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.400
So let's just set a variable t
to be what we want to solve

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.640
for, which is how long is
the diver in the air?

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.165
Let me just write
time in the air.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.490
And we have the initial velocity
of the diver right

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.330
here, the initial vertical
velocity, and that's what we

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.860
care about.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.710
We just care about what's going
on in the up and down

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.390
direction, the vertical
direction.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.415
So our initial velocity is
negative 5 feet per second.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.660
Now, what's going to be his
velocity right when he hits

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.910
the water, right when
he enters the water?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.393
What's going to be his
final velocity?

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.580
He's going to start at negative
5 feet per second, so

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.780
it's going to be negative 5 feet
per second, that's his

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.970
initial velocity.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.000
And every second that goes by,
he's going to be going

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.680
negative 32 feet per second
faster after every second.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.970
He's accelerating downward
at that rate.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.780
So if you multiply the
acceleration times time,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.540
that's how much his velocity
is increased.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:59.960
So it's going to be his initial
velocity minus 32 feet

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.940
per second squared.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.660
That's the acceleration times
time-- times the time that

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.440
he's in the air, times this t.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.660
Obviously, this will be in
seconds, so we have 1 second

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.580
over seconds squared.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.290
You'll just have a second in
the denominator, so you'll

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.210
have feet per second and
feet per second.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.260
The units all work out.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.310
But hopefully this
makes sense.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.880
He's starting off at moving
downward at 5 feet per second.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.330
The negative is telling you the
direction is downward, so

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.330
he's moving downward at
5 feet per second.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.070
So after 1 second,
he'll be going 37

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.520
feet per second downward.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.040
After 2 seconds, he'll be
going-- what, 32 times 2 is

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.430
64, plus 9-- 69 feet per
second downwards.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.270
So this is his final velocity.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.880
So what's his average
velocity?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.320
If his initial velocity is
negative 5 feet per second,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.410
his final velocity is this.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.360
It's a linear relation.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.270
At every second that goes by,
it's linearly increasing, or

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.650
decreasing, if you want to view
it as a negative number.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.810
So the average velocity is just
going to be the average

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.030
of these two values.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.910
We're really just learning a lot
of physics here, but this

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.500
will set us up with a nice
quadratic equation that we can

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.000
use the quadratic formula for.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.230
So our average velocity is going
to be the average of

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.360
those two velocities.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.780
So it's going to be-- and I'll
skip the units right now--

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:29.760
it's going to be negative 5
minus 5, minus 32t, all of

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.890
that over 2.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.550
I'm just averaging
these two things.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.845
That's my initial velocity.

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:34.985
This is my final velocity.

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:37.080
I'm just taking the average
of the two.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.110
So this is going to
be equal to what?

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.470
This is negative 10 minus 32t
over 2, which is equal to

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.380
negative 5 minus 16t.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.960
I'm just dividing
everything by 2.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.100
So this is my average
velocity.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.450
Now, we can just apply our
simple distance is equal to

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.700
rate times time.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.180
Now, what's the distance
that he's

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.940
traveling in this situation?

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.140
Well, he's diving off of a cliff
85 feet above the water,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.510
so the distance that
he's going to be

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.019
traveling is 85 feet.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.519
He starts 85 feet above the
water, but the distance he'll

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.800
travel, he's going to
go 85 feet down.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.790
So the distance he's going to
travel is negative 85 feet.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.310
We use negative for down,
we use positive for up.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.790
Everything in this problem is

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.500
happening in the down direction.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.040
So negative 85 feet is
going to be equal

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.250
to the average velocity.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.820
But we just figured out
the average velocity.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.780
It's this thing right here.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.020
That's our average velocity.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.170
So it's going to be-- let me do
it in another color; let me

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.630
do it in this blue-- our
average velocity is

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.880
negative 5 minus 16t.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.410
That's our average velocity,
velocity average.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.650
And then we want to multiply
that times time.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.940
This is our velocity, our
rate-- I'm mixing up the

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.050
colors-- this is our rate, and
then we want to multiply it by

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.240
times, so rate times time is
equal to distance travelled.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.450
Let's solve for t.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.160
And we'll skip the units for
now, just because that'll kind

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.500
of get in the way of
maybe the learning.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.010
So we have negative 85 is equal
to-- when we distribute

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:32.370
this t, we get negative
5t minus 16t squared.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.810
And now we can add 85 to both
sides of this equation.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.500
Let's add 85 to both sides.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.520
And we are left with
0 is equal to--

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.790
let's rearrange this.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:54.210
So we'll a negative 16t squared
minus 5t, plus 85.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.990
So this, essentially,
is the equation.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.340
If we solve for t, we'll know
how long he's been in the air,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.040
because we've used all of
the other constraints.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.340
So this is a straight up
quadratic equation, so we

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.810
could use the quadratic
formula here.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.320
So it's going to
be negative b.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.300
Now what's b?

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.400
b here is negative 5, so
negative b, which is negative

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.250
negative 5, plus or minus the
square root of b squared.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.500
Negative 5 squared is 25 minus
4, times a, which is negative

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.730
16, times c, which is 85.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:41.070
All of that over 2 times a. a
is negative 16, so 2 times

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.110
that is negative 32.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.470
So the time is equal to positive
5, right, negative

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.720
negative 5 is positive 5, plus
or minus the square root of--

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.250
we probably want to take out
our calculator for this.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.560
Let's see, let's
evaluate this.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.640
So we have a negative and a
negative, so those two are

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.380
going to cancel-- let
put my calculator

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.550
aside right for a second.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.310
So we have negative out here,
and then we have a negative,

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.930
so these two are going
to cancel out.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.590
So it's going to be 25 plus
4, times 16, times 85.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.000
So let's figure out
what that is.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.450
So if we have 25 plus-- I'll put
some parentheses here-- 4

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:33.330
times 16, times 85 is equal
to-- so we got 25 plus 4,

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.630
times 16, times 85--
is equal to 5,465.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.120
And we could take the
square root of this.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:47.440
So let's just take the square
root of it, and we have 73.9.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.400
So let's just stick with 73.9.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.860
So this is going to be equal
to-- let me delete this right

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.790
here-- this is going to be equal
to, we already figured

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.380
out what the square root is, we
just evaluated it-- let me

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.870
delete that right there-- this
is going to be equal to plus

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:10.730
or minus 73.9, all of that
over negative 32.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.670
Now, we can add 73.9, and we
can subtract 73.9, but what

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.850
happens if we subtract 73.9?

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.020
Well, actually, let's think
about this carefully.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.960
Let's do both of these.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.010
Let's just go through them.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.740
So the two combinations, so the
two possibilities for t,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:32.730
is we have 5 plus 73.9, which
is 78.9, all of that over

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.020
negative 32.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.659
That's one possibility for t.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.420
The other one is 5 minus 73.9.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.530
And let's see, what's
73.9 minus 5?

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:48.560
It is negative 68.9.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.360
73 minus 5 is 68, swap the
negatives, so it's negative

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.680
68.9 over negative 32.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.610
In this case, the negatives
cancel out.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.040
So which of these-- can we
use both of these times?

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.500
Well, this right here is going
to be a negative number, and

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.520
we don't want a negative time.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.280
It's definitely a positive
amount of time

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:09.900
that he's in the air.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.620
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.360
negative time, are we
going back in time?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.100
Who knows?

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.490
So we can't even use that.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.406
So the time in the air is going
to be this, it's going

00:09:16.406 --> 00:09:22.690
to be 68.9 divided by 32, so
let's figure out what that is.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:32.380
So it's 68.9 divided by 32
is equal to 2.15 seconds.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:40.240
So his time in the air is going
to be 2.15 seconds.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.820
And we're done.
