00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.510
Jayda takes 3 hours to deliver
189 newspapers

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.840
on her paper route.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.080
What is the rate per
hour at which she

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.040
delivers the newspaper?

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.610
So this first sentence tells us
that she delivers, or she

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:26.180
takes, 3 hours to deliver
189 newspapers.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.840
So you have 3 hours for
every 189 newspapers.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.970
That's what the first
sentence told us.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.660
But we want to figure out the
rate per hour, or the

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.380
newspapers per hour, so we can
really just flip this rate

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.960
right here.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:51.460
So if we were to just flip it,
we would have 189 newspapers

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.950
for every 3 hours, which is
really the same information.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.610
We're just flipping what's in
the numerator and what's in

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.860
the denominator.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.340
Now we want to write it in as
simple as possible form, and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.940
let's see if this top number
is divisible by 3.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.240
1 plus 8 is 9, plus 9 is 18.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.810
So that is divisible by 3.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.120
So let's divide this numerator
and this denominator by 3 to

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.500
simplify things.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.930
So if you divide 189 by 3.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.300
Let's do it over on the
side right here.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.450
3 goes into 189.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.500
3 goes and 18 six times.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.600
6 times 3 is 18.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.720
Subtract.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.190
Bring down the 9.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.220
18 minus 18 was nothing.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.380
3 goes into 9 exactly
three times.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.150
3 times 3 is 9, no remainder.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.880
So if you divide 189 by 3, you
get 63, and if you divide 3 by

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.390
3, you're going to get 1.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.710
You have to divide both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.440
by the same number.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.490
So now we have 63 newspapers
for every 1 hour.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.070
Or we could write this as 63
over 1 newspapers per hour.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.280
Or we could write this as 63,
because 63 over 1 is the same

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:30.230
thing as 63 newspapers
per hour.
