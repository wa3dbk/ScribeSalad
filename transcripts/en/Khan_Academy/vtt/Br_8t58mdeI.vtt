00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.890
Let's see if we can prove to
ourselves some more reasonably

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.415
interesting transpose
properties.

00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:10.660
So let's define some matrix C,
that's equal to the sum of two

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.280
other matrices, A and B.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.040
And so any entry in C, I can
denote with a lowercase cij.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.830
So if I want the ith row in jth
column it would be cij,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.880
and so each of its entries are
going to be the sum of the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.300
corresponding columns that
are matrices A and B.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.140
So our ij entry in C is going to
be equal to the ij entry in

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.450
A, plus the ij entry in B.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.470
That's our definition
of matrix addition.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.710
You just get the corresponding
entry in the same row and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.130
column, add them up, and you get
your entry in the same row

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.400
and column, and your new
matrix is the sum

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.140
of the other two.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.610
Now, let's think a little bit
about the transposes of these

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.790
guys right here.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.130
So, if A looks like this.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.310
I won't draw all
of the entries.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.540
It takes forever.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.100
But each of its entries are
ij, just like that.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.210
Let's say that A transpose
looks like this.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.230
Each of its entries, we would
call it, that's if you've got

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.790
that same entry, we're going
to call it a-prime ij.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.220
And these things aren't probably
going to be the same.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.350
There's some chance they are,
but they're probably not going

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.650
to be the same.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.810
But that its ijth entry.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.930
In the ith row, jth column.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.490
In A transpose.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.900
Now, the fact that this is the
transpose of that means that

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.800
everything that's in some row
and column here is going to be

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.160
in that column and row over
here, that the rows and

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.580
columns get switched.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.330
So we know that we could write
that a-prime ij, we're going

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.560
to have the same entry
that was in aji.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.220
Maybe aji is over here.
aji is over here.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.230
So, this thing over here, which
is in the same position

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.940
as this one, is going to be
equal to this guy over here if

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.820
you switched the rows
and columns.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.060
I think you can accept that.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.630
And you can make the same
argument for B.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.820
Let me actually draw it out.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.070
So if I make B transpose.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.960
The entry in the ith row and
jth column, I'll call it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.380
b-prime ij.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.090
Just like that.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.450
Just like I did for A.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.750
So we could say that b-prime ij
is equal to, you take the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.300
matrix B, what's going to be
the entry that's in the jth

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.920
row and ith column.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.290
These are, you could
almost say, the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.060
definition of the transpose.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.910
If I'm in the third row and
second column now, it's going

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.970
to be what was in the second
row and third column.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.790
Fair enough.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.980
So we already have what
cij is equal to.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.610
What's the transpose of cij
going to be equal to?

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.850
Let me write that down.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.370
So C transpose, let me
write it over here.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.620
Write C transpose is equal to.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.780
I'll use the same notation.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.100
The prime means that
we're taking

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.380
entries in the transpose.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.970
So C transpose is just going to
be a bunch of entries, ij.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.105
And I'll put a little prime
there showing that that's

00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:13.440
entries in the matrix
of the transpose,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.620
and not in C itself.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.440
And we know that c-prime
ij is equal to cji.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.430
Nothing new at all.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.480
We've just expressed kind
of the definition of the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.970
transpose for these
three matrices.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.230
Now what is cji equal to?

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.220
So let's focus on this
a little bit.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.100
What is cji equal to?

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.480
We know that cij is equal to a
sub ij plus b sub ij, so if

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.320
you swap them around, this is
going to be equal to, you just

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.050
swap the j's and the i's.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.990
a sub ji plus b sub ji.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.280
I just used this information
here-- you could almost view

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.420
it as this assumption or
this definition-- to go

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.370
from this to this.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.480
If I had an x and a y here, I'd
have an x and a y here,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.860
and a x and a y here.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.640
I have a j and an i here, so I
have a j and an i there, and a

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.880
j and an i right there.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.740
Now what are these?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.620
What are these equal to?

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.870
This is equal to.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.829
This guy right here is equal
to-- we do it in the green--

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:26.560
the same entry for the
transpose of a at ij.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.800
And this is equal to the
same entry for the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.330
transpose of b at ij.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.020
Now, what is this telling us?

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.030
It's telling us that the
transpose of C, which is the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.660
same thing is A plus B, so it's
saying that A plus B, A

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.050
plus B transpose is the same
thing as C transpose.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.320
Let me write that.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.350
C transpose is the same thing
as A plus B transpose.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.030
So these are the entries in A
plus B transpose right here.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.410
And what is this over here?

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.670
What are these?

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.740
These are the entries
right there.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.260
We do the equal sign
over here.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.320
What are these?

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.370
These are the entries in A
transpose plus B transpose.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.490
Right?

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.600
These are the entries
in A transpose.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.620
These are the entries
in B transpose.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.150
If you take the sum of the two,
you're just adding up the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.000
corresponding entries.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.870
So that's straightforward to
show that if you take the sum

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.610
of two matrices and then
transpose it, it's equivalent

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.540
to transposing them first, and
then taking their sum.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.920
Which is a reasonably
neat outcome.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.510
Let's do one more and I think
we'll finish up all of our

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.190
major transpose properties.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.360
Let's say that A inverse-- this
is going to be a slightly

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.380
different take on things.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.130
We're still going to
take the transpose.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:51.760
So if we know that A inverse
is the inverse of A, that

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.410
means that A times A inverse
is equal to the identity

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.360
matrix, assuming that these
are n-by-n matrices.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.430
So it's the n-dimensional
identity matrix.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.730
And that A inverse times A is
also going to be equal to the

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.250
identity matrix.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.790
Now, let's take the
transpose of both

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.990
sides of this equation.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.910
I'll do them both
simultaneously.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.540
So if you take the transpose of
both sides of the equation,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.880
you get A times A inverse
transpose is equal to the

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.950
identity matrix transpose.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.560
And what's the transpose
of the identity matrix?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.180
Let's draw it out.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.490
The identity matrix
looks like this.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.800
You have just ones all the
way down the diagonal and

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.050
everything else is 0.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.480
Right, and you could view this
as i 1, 1 i 2, 2 all the way

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.710
down to i n, n.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.285
Everything else is 0.

00:06:48.285 --> 00:06:50.040
So when you take the transpose,
you're just

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.430
swapping out the
zeroes, right?

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.800
These guys don't change.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.090
The diagonal does not change
when you take the transpose.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.570
So the transpose of the identity
matrix is equal to

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.820
the identity matrix.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.490
And so we can apply that
same thing here.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.750
Let's take the transpose
for this statement.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.870
So we know that A inverse times
A transpose is equal to

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.090
the identity matrix transpose,
which is equal to

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.960
the identity matrix.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.610
And then we know what happens
when you take the

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.960
transpose of a product.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.190
It's equal to the
product of the

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.720
transposes in reverse order.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.050
So this thing right here we
can rewrite as A inverse

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.450
transpose times A transpose,
which is going to be equal to

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.540
the identity matrix.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.550
You could do the same
thing over here.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.930
This thing is going to be equal
to A transpose times A

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.310
inverse transpose, which is also
going to be equal to the

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.880
identity matrix.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.830
Now, this is an interesting
statement.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:55.340
The fact that, if I have this
guy right here, times the

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.510
transpose of A is equal to the
identity matrix, and the

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.885
transpose of A times that same
guy is equal to identity

00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:11.650
matrix, implies that A inverse
transpose is the

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.150
inverse of A transpose.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.800
Or another way of writing that
is if I take A transpose, and

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.510
if I take its inverse, that is
going to be equal to this guy.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.925
It's going to be equal to
A inverse transpose.

00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:31.840
So, another neat outcome dealing
with transposes.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.760
If you take the inverse of the
transpose, it's the same thing

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.159
as the transpose
of the inverse.
