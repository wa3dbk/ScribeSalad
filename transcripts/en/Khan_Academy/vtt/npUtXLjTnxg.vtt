00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.940
We're told that the radius of a
sphere can be measured using

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.760
the formula r is equal to the
cube root of 3 times v,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.970
divided by 4pi, where v is
equal to the volume.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:13.660
That's interesting.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.760
Normally you have it expressed
the other way, volume as a

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.230
function of radius.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.120
Here they have radius as
a function of volume.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.680
If the radius of a sphere is 6
inches-- so they're giving us

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.730
the radius; they're saying
it's 6 inches.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.010
So they're giving us that right

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.460
there-- what is its volume?

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.180
So we have 6 inches--
everything's in inches-- is

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.820
equal to the cube root of 3
times the volume-- that's what

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.000
we need to solve for--
divided by 4pi.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.240
A good first step to get rid of
this cube root, is take the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.620
cube of both sides or raise both
sides of this equation to

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.820
the third power.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.630
Let's see, it's 6 inches, you
raise it to the third power.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.850
You have the cube root
of 3v over 4pi.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.810
Raise it to the third power.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.830
And so the left-hand side of
this equation becomes what?

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.200
6 times 6 is 36.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.610
36 times 6 is 180,
plus 36 is 216.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.620
So you have 216.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.603
And you had 6 inches here-- now
that you're cubing it, it

00:01:14.603 --> 00:01:17.770
would actually now become 216
cubic inches, or inches

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.630
cubed-- is equal to-- if you
take the 3v divided by 4pi,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.480
the cube root is essentially
taking it to the 1/3 power.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.720
Then take that to
the third power.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.260
They unwind each other.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.600
So this just becomes
3v over 4pi.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.670
Now, to solve for volume, we can
just multiply both sides

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.500
of this equation times the
inverse of its coefficient,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.660
times 4pi over 3.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.840
Times-- let me scroll to the
leftt-- times 4pi over 3.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.160
Let me make sure you can
see what I'm writing.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.240
And the whole reason why I'm
multiplying by 4pi over 3 is

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.960
so that it cancels out
with the 3 over 4pi.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.700
And you have your 4pi cancels
out with a 4pi, and then you

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.330
have your 3 canceling
out with a 3.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.160
And then you have, your volume
is going to be equal to 4pi

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.630
times 216 over 3.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.050
We could write it this way.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:24.070
216 times 4pi over 3.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.350
And we could simplify this.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.360
216, the digits add up to--
2 plus 1, plus 6 is 9.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.610
So it will be divisible by 3.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.880
That's a fast way to test
whether something's

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.350
divisible by 3.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.450
So let's see what it is.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.240
3 goes into 216.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.110
3 goes into 21 seven times.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.290
7 times 3 is 21.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.370
Bring down the 6.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.890
You have no remainder,
so bring down the 6.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.260
3 goes into 6 two times.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.070
2 times 3 is 6.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.300
No remainder, so it's 72.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.950
So 216 divided by 3 is 72.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.210
So it's 72 times 4pi is
equal to the volume.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.120
It's going to be cubic inches.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.690
So 4 times 72.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.140
4 times 70 is 280.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.430
And then you have 4 times
2, which is 8.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.170
So it'll be 288pi
cubic inches.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.870
That's our volume.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.460
And we're done.
