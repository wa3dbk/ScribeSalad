00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820
what i want to do in this video is to provide ourselves with a rigorous definition

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.460
of what it means to take the limit of a sequence as n approaches infinity

00:00:09.844 --> 00:00:15.508
and what we'll see is actually very similar to the definition of any

00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:22.182
function as a limit approaches infinity and this is because the sequences really can be just viewed

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:25.732
as a function of their indices, so let's say

00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:30.302
let me draw an arbitrary sequence right over here

00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:33.240
so actually let me draw like this just to make it clear

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.504
but the limit is approaching so let me draw a sequence

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:39.573
let me draw a sequence that is jumping around

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:43.966
little bit, so lets say when n=1, a(1) is there,

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:50.802
when n = 2, a(2) is there, when n = 3, a(3) is over there

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:59.004
when n=4, a(4) is over here, when n=5 a(5) is over here

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:04.049
and it looks like is n is so this is 1 2 3 4 5

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:08.071
so it looks like that as n gets bigger and bigger and bigger

00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:13.539
a(n) seems to be approaching, seems to be approaching some value

00:01:14.277 --> 00:01:18.373
it seems to be getting closer and closer, seems to be converging

00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:23.264
to some value L right over here. What we need to do is come up with a definition of

00:01:23.264 --> 00:01:27.363
what is it really mean to converge to L.

00:01:27.363 --> 00:01:33.486
So let's say for any, so we're gonna say that you converge to L for any,

00:01:33.486 --> 00:01:37.454
for any ε &gt; 0, for any positive epsilon, you can,

00:01:37.877 --> 00:01:44.819
you can come up, you can get or you can, there is

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:52.835
let me rewrite it this way, for any positive epsilon there is a positive,

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:57.989
positive M, capital M, such that,

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:07.578
such that if, if, lower case n is greater than capital M,

00:02:07.578 --> 00:02:17.269
then the distance between a(n) and our limit, this L right over here

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.286
the distance between those two points is less than epsilon.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:25.199
If you can do this for any epsilon, for any epsilon,

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:30.117
greater than 0, there is a positive M, such that if n is greater than M,

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:33.669
the distance between a(n) and our limit is less than epsilon

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.288
then we can say, then we can say

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:43.193
that the limit of a(n) as n approaches infinity is equal to L and

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:51.286
we can say that a(n) converges, converges, converges to L.

00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:56.500
So let's, let's, let's parse this, so here I was making the claim

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.786
that a(n) is approaching this L right over here,

00:02:58.786 --> 00:03:01.388
I tried to draw it as a horizontal line.

00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:05.794
This definition of the of what it means to converge for sequence to converge

00:03:05.794 --> 00:03:09.045
says look for any epsilon greater than zero.

00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:14.795
So let me pick an epsilon greater than zero, so I am gonna go to L plus epsilon,

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:17.939
actually let me do it right over here, L, so see this is L plus epsilon

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:24.353
and let's say this is right here this is L minus epsilon.

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:28.657
So let me draw those two bounds, right over here.

00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:32.568
And so I picked an epsilon here so for any,

00:03:32.568 --> 00:03:38.831
for any arbitrary epsilon, any arbitrary positive epsilon I pick, we can find a positive

00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:43.277
M, we can find a positive M, so that as long as,

00:03:43.277 --> 00:03:45.755
so let's say that is our M right over there.

00:03:45.755 --> 00:03:50.881
So that as long as our n is greater than our M, then our a(n)

00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:55.932
our a(n) is within epsilon of L, so being within the epsilon,

00:03:55.932 --> 00:03:59.747
being within epsilon of L is essentially being in this range.

00:03:59.747 --> 00:04:04.839
This right over here is just saying, look that the distance between a(n) and L is less than epsilon,

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:09.618
so that would be any of these, anything that is in this, between L minus epsilon and L plus epsilon.

00:04:09.618 --> 00:04:15.292
The distance between that and our limit is going to be less than epsilon.

00:04:15.292 --> 00:04:16.992
And we see right over here, at least visually,

00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:20.978
if we pick M there and if you can take an n that's larger than that M,

00:04:20.978 --> 00:04:26.019
if you pick an N that's larger than M, if M is equal to 3, a(n) seems to be

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:30.843
close enough. If M is 4, a(n) is even getting closer. It's within our epsilon.

00:04:30.843 --> 00:04:36.559
So if we can say, if we can say that it is true, for any epsilon that we pick, then we can say,

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:41.528
we can say that the limit exists, that a(n) converges to L.

00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:45.528
In the next video we will use this definition to actually prove that a sequence converges.
