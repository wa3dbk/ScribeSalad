00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.670
We're on problem 154.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.550
An empty pool being filled with
water at a constant rate

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.026
takes 8 hours to fill to
3/5 of its capacity.

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:22.380
So you could say you can fill
3/5 of a pool every 8 hours,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.000
which is just another way of
saying that you can fill,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.610
let's see, 3/5 divided by 8 is
3 over-- what's 5 times 8?

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.792
3/40 pools per hour.

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:35.990
I have a feeling that they're
just going to ask us something

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.140
along just the rate
of the fill.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.160
So then they say, how much
more time will it take to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.690
finish filling the pool?

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.200
Oh, well, this actually is
a little bit easier.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.170
So if it takes 8 hours to fill
the pool to 3/5 of capacity,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.860
how many hours will it take to
finish filling the pool?

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.360
So how many hours will it take
to fill it essentially what?

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.170
What's left?

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.475
2/5, right?

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:03.900
To fill it 2/5 more.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.130
So this is going to be the same
thing as 8/3 is equal to

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.870
x/2, And you could do that by
dividing both sides of this

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.270
equation by 5, right?

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.400
And you get a 5 in the
denominator in both places,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.100
which cancels out.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.440
And this is easy, 8/3 as x/2 so
you have 16 is equal to 3x.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.380
And then you get x is equal
to 5 1/3 hours.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.510
That's 5 hours and 20 minutes,
because a third of an hour is

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.680
20 minutes.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.350
And that is choice B.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.220
Problem 155.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.220
A positive number x is
multiplied by 2 and this

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.980
product is then divided by 3.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.470
And they told us
x was positive.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.460
If the positive square root
of the result of these two

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:12.380
operations equals x, what
is the value of x?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.180
Let's solve this.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.520
Let's square both sides of this,
so we get 2x/3 is equal

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.060
to x squared.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.170
And then multiply both sides by
3, you get 2x is equal to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.550
3x squared.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.950
And they tell us that
x is positive.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.920
Well, first of all, that tells
us that x does not equal 0.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.760
They tell us that x
is greater than 0.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.290
So let's see, let's divide
both sides of

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.770
this equation by x.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.410
Well, there's a couple of ways
we could think about it.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.200
Maybe the easiest way-- yeah,
let's just divide both sides

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.960
of this equation by x, and we
can do that because we know

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.430
that x cannot equal 0 and you
get 2 is equal to 3x.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.480
And then divide both sides by 3,
you get x is equal to 2/3,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.820
and that's choice D.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.160
I was thinking about saying,
oh, well, let's subtract 2x

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.840
from both sides.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.310
You get 3x squared minus
2x is equal to 0.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.540
You could factor out an x, and
then you get 3x minus 2 times

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.140
x is equal to 0.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.050
And that would tell you that
either 3x minus 2 is equal to

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.070
0, which would give you that
answer, or x is equal to 0.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.260
but?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.630
X can't equal 0, because they
told us that x is positive.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.930
But anyway, it gets you
the same answer, 2/3.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.960
Next question.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.030
Problem 156.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:42.760
A tank contains 10,000 gallons
of a solution that is 5%

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.400
sodium chloride by volume.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.960
What is that?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.530
NaCl?

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.770
This isn't chemistry.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.940
Let's see, 2,500 gallons of
water evaporate from the tank.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.770
The remaining solution will be
approximately what percent

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.010
sodium chloride?

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.345
So they're essentially saying,
well, if water evaporates, the

00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:11.650
salt in the solution doesn't
go away, right?

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.800
The salt doesn't evaporate
with the water.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:22.110
So if we're 5% sodium chloride,
what's 5% of 10,000?

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:33.580
5% of 100 is 5, 5% of 1,000 is
50, 5% of 10,000 is 500.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.560
I guess you could
say there's 500

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.810
gallons of sodium chloride.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.290
If we lose 2,500 gallons of the
water, now the percentage

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.435
of sodium chloride is still
500, but it's going

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:52.180
to be 500 over what?

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.970
We don't have 10,00 gallons
of water anymore.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.000
We have 10,000 gallons of water
minus 2,500 gallons of

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.270
water, so we have 7,500
gallons of water.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:08.120
Let's see, that's equal to 5/75,
which is equal to 1/15,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.380
and what is that as
a percentage?

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.550
15 goes into 100 6 times?

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.060
It's not 7.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.440
Yeah, 6 times.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.380
6 times 5 is 30.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.620
6 times 1 is 6 plus 90.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.500
And then I have a
10, so it keeps

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.410
going on, 0.0666 repeating.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.060
So it's 6 and 2/3 percentages,
or 6 point-- well, let's see,

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.660
they have choice-- yeah,
choice D looks right.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.490
6.67% if you round this.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.930
It just keeps repeating
with 6.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.035
So that is choice D.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.360
Problem 157.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:59.160
If x plus 5y is equal to 16 and
x is equal to minus 3y,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.340
then what does y equal?

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.830
So let's just substitute
this over here.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.950
So we get minus 3y plus
5y is equal to 16.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.980
Add those together, you get
2y is equal to 16, or

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.470
y is equal to 8.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.610
And that is choice E.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.720
Problem 158.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.580
A committee is composed of w
women and m men, so w and m.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.510
If 3 women and 2 men are added
to the committee and if one

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.450
person is selected at random
from the enlarged committee,

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.790
then the probability that a
woman is selected can be

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.960
represented as?

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.910
OK, the probability of a woman
being selected is essentially

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.000
the fraction of the population
that are women.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.840
So how many women are there?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.900
There's going to be
w plus 3 women.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.400
And what's the total
population?

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.320
There's w plus 3 women, and
then there's m plus 2 men.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.720
So this is the probability we
select a woman, and then we

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.930
can just simplify this a bit.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:15.750
That equals w plus 3 over
w plus m plus 5.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.710
And that is choice E.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:27.020
Problem 159.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:37.360
If the product of the integers
w, x, y, and z is 70.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.630
So let me just write that, w,
x, y, z is equal to 770.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:50.550
And if 1 is less than w, which
is less than x, which is less

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:59.410
than y, which is less than z,
what is the value of w plus z?

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.620
Ok, this is interesting.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.270
So they're telling us that
these are integers.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:09.230
We have four integers, and
they're all greater than 1.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.120
Let's see if we can do a prime
factorization of 770, because

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.770
I have a feeling that that is
what it's going to come down

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.380
to, if we just look at
the factors of 770.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.940
So let's see, that's
equal to 7.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.050
7 times 11 is 77.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.320
7 times 11 times 10, right?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.710
7 times 11 times 10 is 770.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.179
110.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.184
And then 10 is-- so that's equal
to 7 times 11 times--

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.010
let's see, what's 10?

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:45.450
10 we can rewrite
it as 2 times 5.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.540
So that's its prime
factorization.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.300
And lo and behold, we have
exactly four numbers, and

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:50.920
let's put them in order.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.430
So that equals 2 times
5 times 7 times 11.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.980
And so this is what w, x, y,
and z have to be because

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.810
they're different numbers.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.520
They're all greater than 1,
and they're all integers.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.330
So let's see, they want to know
w plus z, so w plus z is

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.340
2 plus 11 is 13, and
that's choice B.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.680
And looks like we have time
even for another one.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.910
Let's do this one.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.690
The figure above shows
a circular flowerbed.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.160
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.430
So that's the outside and then
they drew the inside.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:42.324
So if I do it like-- oh,
I didn't do a good job.

00:09:42.324 --> 00:09:44.230
Let me see if I can
draw the inside,

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.770
maybe if I put it there.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.270
It's not showing up
the way I want to.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.700
Let me move it around
a little bit.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.400
Let me just erase it and try
to draw it one more time.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.350
Well, I think you
get the idea.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:10.620
And they tell us that the
distance from the center to

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.315
here is 8 feet.

00:10:13.315 --> 00:10:16.070
The figure above shows a
circular flowerbed with it's

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.230
center at 0 and surrounded
by a circular path

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.590
that is 5 feet wide.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:20.662
So this is 5.

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.030
That is 3 feet wide.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.840
I'm having trouble reading.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.920
3 feet wide.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.700
What is the area of the
path in square feet?

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.570
So it's essentially the area of
this outside circle minus

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.260
the area of this
inside circle.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.800
That would be the area
of this path.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.700
So what's the area of
the outside circle?

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.310
Well, the area of the outside
circle, you go 8 to get to

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.470
this edge, then you
have 3 more.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:49.130
So its radius is 8 plus 3 is 11,
so the area of the outside

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.750
is equal to pi times
11 squared.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.145
And what's the area
of the inside?

00:10:53.145 --> 00:10:56.910
The area of the inside is equal
to pi times the inside

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.080
radius times 64 squared.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.400
So the area of our path is
going to be area of the

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.590
outside minus the area of
the inside, which is

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.500
equal to 121 pi.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.710
That's 11 squared times pi
minus-- oh, sorry, it's 8

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.620
squared, which is 64.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.810
I should have written
8 squared there, so

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.420
that's minus 64 pi.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.350
And that is equal to--
what's 121 minus 64?

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:31.990
121 minus 64 is-- let's see,
we have 21 plus 36, that's

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:38.040
equal to 57 pi, and
that is choice D.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.880
See you in the next video.
