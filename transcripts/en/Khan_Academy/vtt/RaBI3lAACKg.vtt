00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.545
We touched on this in the video
on resonance, but I want

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:06.666
to devote an entire video
to aromatic compounds.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.440
And one of the big mysteries in
chemistry is why they were

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.170
named aromatic compounds.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.820
Because you know it clearly
comes from the word aroma.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.370
So one would think maybe all of
these compounds smell good,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.150
or smell bad, or don't
smell at all.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060
But actually it turns out
that a lot of them don't

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.130
even smell at all.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.260
So it's a little bit
of a mystery.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.800
Some people think that they
have some relation, the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.590
gentleman who named them, saw
that they had some chemical

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.210
relation to things that did
smell, so that he named them

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.250
aromatic compounds.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.210
So it is a bit of a mystery.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.520
In general, the most common
aromatic compound-- and really

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.210
this is like 99% of the time
what you're going to see in

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.150
chemistry class as an aromatic
compound-- is either benzene

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.580
or a molecule derived
from benzene.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.720
Let me draw benzene
right here.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.510
So benzene is normally
drawn like this.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.640
So it's a six carbon ring.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.710
And it has three double bonds.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.490
It has three double
bonds like that.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.170
And we learned in the resonance
video, that this

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.170
isn't actually the only
configuration for benzene.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.130
It could just as likely be
in this configuration.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.300
That this electron up here, this
electron up here, might

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.940
move there.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.680
This electron might
move over there.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.190
And then this electron might
move over there.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.670
Let me clear that up, so you
don't make it too confusing.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.140
So it could just as likely
be in this configuration.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.490
It could just as likely be in
this configuration right here,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.690
where the double bonds are on
the other bonds that aren't

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.170
double bonded over here.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.260
So it could just as easily
be over there.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.470
And we learned in the resonance
video that the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.040
reality is that it's actually
in between.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.600
And sometimes it's
drawn like this.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.240
It's going back and forth
between these configurations.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.620
But the reality-- and
you'll sometimes see

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.850
it drawn like this.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.930
You'll sometimes see it drawn
like this, with just a circle

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.450
in between, in the middle of the
hexane ring, I guess you

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.020
could say, or the
benzene ring.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.350
Which is showing that the
electrons, those pi electrons,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.880
those electrons that form the
double bond are actually just,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.300
they're going back and
forth between this.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.630
They're just spreading around
the entire ring.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.350
And what makes aromatic
compounds interesting is

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.340
because these pi electrons can
spread around the entire ring,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.750
it's actually a much more stable
configuration, or a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.460
much more stable molecule, than
what you would predict if

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.800
you just looked at one of these
two configurations.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.670
Another way that it's
often drawn looks

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.600
something like this.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.490
And I'm just doing it in yellow,
just to have something

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.640
in a different color.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.830
Sometimes you'll just see
this, that you know, is

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.160
someplace in between
that and that.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.050
So you'll have a dotted line
there, dotted line, dotted

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.210
line, dotted line, dotted
line, dotted line.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.740
This is the most common kind of
short hand for showing both

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.770
benzene and for showing that
it's experiencing this

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.860
resonance, that you have
this conjugated

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.540
system of pi electrons.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.540
And I'll help you visualize
that in a second.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.990
But you also might see
something like this.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.640
It can go back and forth, and
everything in between, between

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.220
these two configurations.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.330
Now just to visualize
what's going on.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.970
Because you'll sometimes hear
people talk about conjugated

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.470
system of pi electrons.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.080
I want to actually think about,
help a little bit more

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.010
visualizing what the molecule
might look like in three

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.260
dimensions.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.410
So that is the six carbon
ring right there.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.500
So it's carbon, carbon, carbon,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.760
carbon, carbon, carbon.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.780
And then each of these carbons
is bonded to three other

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.850
atoms. It's bonded
to 1, 2 carbons.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.710
And it's also bonded
to a hydrogen.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.220
So let me draw the
hydrogens here.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.750
They're also bonded
to hydrogen.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.940
So this one will have a
hydrogen over here.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.850
This will have a hydrogen
over here.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.910
That will have a hydrogen
over there.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.000
That one has a hydrogen
over there.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.110
Hydrogen and hydrogen
right over there.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.990
So if we talk about
hybridization, we have three

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.630
hybridized orbitals.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.910
This is sp2 hybridization.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.709
And each of these have a
leftover pi orbital that has

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.709
not been hybridized.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.070
It's not directly bound to, or
that does not have a sigma

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.720
bond to another atom.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.270
So you have these pi orbitals.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.070
You know, these pi orbitals
look like these dumbbells.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.280
So you have a pi orbital
over here.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.600
You have a pi orbital here.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.750
Pi orbital over here.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.570
Pi orbital over there.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.950
You have another pi orbital
over there.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.000
Pi orbital and pi orbital.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.850
And you know, pi orbital, I drew
them like this, because

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.030
if I drew them bigger
than that, the

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.430
diagram would get messy.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.830
But in general, whenever you
have double bonds, like this

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.360
double bond.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.070
Let's say that this carbon--
let me change colors, so we

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.000
know what we're focused on.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.450
So let's say this sigma bond
right over there, let's say

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.110
that sigma bond right over
there, is this sigma bond.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.360
Actually let me do another
one, just so

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.810
it's easier to see.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.000
Let's say that this sigma bond
right over here is this sigma

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.790
bond, between these
two carbons.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.290
This double bond, the double
bond in blue, this one, or in

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.020
purple right over there,
that's due to these

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.180
overlapping pi orbitals.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.750
That carbon's pi orbitals and
that carbon's pi orbitals

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.470
overlapping.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.580
I haven't drawn them
overlapping, but-- well,

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.980
actually an electron
can really show up.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.310
It's all probabilistic anyway.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.390
But I could draw them big
enough, they would overlap,

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.640
and these electrons would
form that extra pi bond.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.090
What happens in a conjugated
system of pi electrons.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.940
Let me write that down.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.770
It's just a very fancy word.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:54.598
Conjugated system
of pi electrons.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.350
These guys, at we see,
they could be

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.710
bonded with each other.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.910
These guys could overlap.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.720
So there could be an overlap
going on over here.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.120
Or we could flip into this
configuration, where this guy

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.280
would overlap with this
guy over here.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.610
And the reality is that these pi
electrons will actually be

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.300
able to float around the ring.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.210
They'd actually be able to float
around all of these pi

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.270
orbitals right over there.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.980
They'd actually be able to
float around the ring.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.300
So that's what people are really
talking about when they

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.480
talk about aromatic compounds,
or aromaticity.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.070
That because of this, this is
a more stable compound.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.920
The most typical one that you're
going to see is a six

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.470
carbon chain with three double
bonds, benzene, or things

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.670
derived from them.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.490
But there actually are
more general ones.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.080
In general, you're going to see
anything that has 4n plus

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:57.120
2 pi electrons in a cycle is
going to have aromaticity.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.190
Or is going to be an
aromatic compound.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.190
Let's just confirm this
actually makes it.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.140
Each of these guys over here
have one pi electron, even

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.880
though this looks
like two bonds.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.750
Remember, this is one pi orbital
right over here.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.410
And you have one electron that's
going to be in this

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.430
entire pi orbital.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.350
So this has one pi electron,
two, three, four, five, six.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.940
Another way to think about it,
each of these double bonds

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.620
involves two pi electrons.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.190
So one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.450
So that follows what is
called Huckel's rule.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.070
I think there's two
dots above the u.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.880
Huckel's rule, maybe.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.600
That follows Huckel's rule.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.750
Because if you said n is
equal to 1, 4 times 1

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.390
is 4 plus 2 is 6.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.210
So 6 pi electrons work.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.190
If n was 2, you'd have 4 times
2 plus 2, which is 10.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.650
So if you had 10 pi electrons,
it would also work.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.660
So a molecule that looks
like this-- let me see

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.310
if I can draw it.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.920
A molecule that looks like
this would also work.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:13.750
So if you have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:19.640
eight, nine, ten, ten carbons.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.275
And then you had five
double bonds.

00:08:21.275 --> 00:08:27.760
So, one, two, three,
four, five.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.350
Just like that.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.290
You could imagine, these
guys could flip around.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.840
But this would also be
an aromatic compound.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.770
This has 10 pi electrons.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.870
Each of the carbons have
a pi electron.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.730
Or you could count the
pi electrons on each

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.909
end of these pi bonds.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:47.800
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.980
Now this is one thing that
I always wonder.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.470
It's like OK, it worked
with six.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.030
It worked with 10.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.750
But what about eight?

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.760
It seems like with eight, maybe
these electrons, these

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.210
double bonds, could flip
around just as easily.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.540
So what if I had, what if
I had-- or even four.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.860
What if I had a molecule
that looked like this?

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.410
What if I had a molecule
that looked like this?

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.770
Or a molecule that looked like
a stop sign-- so one, two,

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.280
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight-- that had double bonds

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.270
that alternated like this.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.230
You might say, hey,
maybe those also

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.300
are aromatic compounds.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.500
Those also experience
aromaticity.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.010
Because couldn't this guy jump
around here, then that guy

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.420
over there, and the electrons
cycle around.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.200
Or this guy jump over, these
electrons move there.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.010
Those move there.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:31.830
Those move there.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.210
And those move there.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:39.290
And it turns out that in these
compounds, the electrons do

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.780
not, the pi electrons do not
stabilize the system.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.860
But this is actually less
stable than if it

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.360
was not in a cycle.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.210
So actually this is-- these
right here, that don't follow

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.310
the 4n plus 2.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.360
So 4n plus 2, you're talking
about 6, 10, 14 pi electrons.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.270
Which usually means
14 carbons, or 10

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.290
carbons, or six carbons.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.090
The ones that don't follow them
but are still cyclical,

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.150
and still have these alternating
bonds, these are

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.400
called anti-aromatic.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.630
And are actually
very unstable.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.240
These are very, very unstable
and are more likely to break

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.690
into a non-cycle.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.490
Anyway, hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.
