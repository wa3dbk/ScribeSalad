00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.370
 

00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.130
I think we're now ready to learn
a little bit about the

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.570
dark reactions.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.300
But just to remember where we
are in this whole scheme of

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.750
photosynthesis, photons came
in and excited electrons in

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.520
chlorophyll in the
light reactions.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.500
and as those photons went to
lower and lower energy

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.250
states-- we saw it over here
in the last video-- as they

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.860
went to lower and lower energy
states, and all of this was

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.130
going on in the thylakoid
membrane right over here.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.920
You can imagine-- Let me do
it in a different color.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.980
You can imagine it occurring
right here.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.619
As they went into lower and
lower energy states, two

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.360
things happened.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.470
One, the release of energy was
able to pump the hydrogens

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.640
across this membrane.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.800
And then when you had a high
concentration of hydrogens

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.380
here, those went back through
the ATP synthase and drove

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.350
that motor to produce ATP.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.440
And then the final electron
acceptor, or hydrogen

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.840
acceptor, depending on how
you want to view it.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.540
The whole hydrogen atom
was NAD plus.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.575
So the two byproducts, or the
two byproducts that we're

00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:03.550
going to continue using in
photosynthesis from our light

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.540
cycle, from our light
reactions I guess.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.780
I shouldn't call it the light
cycle-- were-- I wrote it up

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.290
here-- ATP and NADPH.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.040
And then the byproduct was that
we needed the electron to

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.950
replace that first
excited electron.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.730
So we take it away from water.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.740
And so we also produce oxygen,
which is a very valuable

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.420
byproduct of this reaction.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.960
But now that we have this ATP
and this NADPH, we're ready to

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.690
proceed into the
dark reactions.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.190
And I want to highlight again,
even though it's called the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.280
dark reactions it doesn't mean
that it happens at night.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.510
It actually happens at the same
time as light reactions.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.970
It occurs while the
sun is out.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.470
The reason why they call it
the dark reactions is that

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.860
they're light independent.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.640
They don't require photons.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.920
They only require ATP, NADPH,
and carbon dioxide.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.660
So let's understand what's
going on here

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.350
a little bit better.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.910
So let me go down to
where I have some

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.290
clean space down here.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.735
So we had our light reactions.

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:08.639
 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.190
And they produced-- I just
reviewed this-- produced some

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.870
ATP and produced
some and NADPH.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.880
And now we're going to take some
carbon dioxide from the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.130
atmosphere.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.160
 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.080
And all of this will go into
the-- I'll call it the light

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.170
independent reactions.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.710
Because dark reactions
is misleading.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:45.010
So the light independent
reactions, the actual

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.270
mechanism is called
the Calvin Cycle.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.110
And that's what this video
is really about.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.380
It goes into the Calvin Cycle
and out pops-- whether you

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.180
want to call it PGAL-- we talked
about it in the first

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.440
video-- or G3P.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.350
This is glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.890
This is phosphoglyceraldehyde
They are the exact same

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.420
molecule, just different
names.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.970
And you can imagine it as
a 3-carbon chain with a

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.260
phosphate group.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.160
And then this can then be used
to build other carbohydrates.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.640
You put two of these together
you can get a glucose.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.950
You might remember in the first
stage of glycolysis, or

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.730
the first time we cut a glucose
molecule we ended up

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.490
with two phosphoglyceraldehyde
molecules.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.970
Glucose has six carbons.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.990
This has three.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.350
Let's study the Calvin
Cycle in just a

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.120
little bit more detail.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:51.420
So let's say exiting the light
reactions, let's say we have--

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.000
well let's start off with
six carbon dioxides.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.780
So this is independent of
the light reactions.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.560
And I'll show you why I'm
using these numbers.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.570
I don't have to use these
exact numbers.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.450
So let's say I start
off with six CO2s.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.760
And I could write a CO2 because
we really care about

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.760
what's happening
to the carbon.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.320
We can just write it as a single
carbon that has two

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.000
oxygens on it, which
I could draw.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.150
But I'm not going to draw
them right now.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.600
Because I want to really
show you what

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.090
happens to the carbons.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.490
Maybe I should draw this
in this yellow.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.920
Just to show you only
the carbons.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.370
I'm not showing you the
oxygens on here.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:30.170
And what happens is the CO2,
the six CO2s, essentially

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.240
react with-- and I'll talk a
little bit about this reaction

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.850
in a second-- they react with
six molecules-- and this is

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.640
going to look a little bit
strange to you-- of this

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.100
molecule, you could
call it RuBP.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.630
That's short for ribulose
biphosphate.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.000
Sometimes called ribulose-1
5-bisphosphate.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.430
And the reason why it's called
that is because it's a

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.630
5-carbon molecule.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.710
So, three, four five.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.840
And it has a phosphate on
the 1 and 5 carbon.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.830
So it's ribulose bisphosphate.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.400
Or sometimes, ribulosee-1-- let
me write this-- that's the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.906
first carbon.

00:05:14.906 --> 00:05:16.460
5-bisphosphate.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.850
We have two phosphates.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.710
So that's ribulose-1
5-bisphosphate.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.760
Fancy name, but it's just
a 5-carbon chain with 2

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.950
phosphates on it.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.570
These two react together.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.500
And this is a simplification.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.800
These two react together.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.780
There's a lot more going on
here, but I want you to get

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.960
the big picture.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:45.430
to form, 12 molecules of PGAL,
of phosphoglyceraldehyde or

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:53.340
glyceraldihyde 3-phosphate of
PGAL, which you can view as

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:01.000
a-- it has three carbons and
then it has a phosphate group.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.300
And just to make sure we're
accounting for our carbons

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.560
properly, let's think
about what happens.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.780
We have 12 of these guys.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.520
You can think of it that
we have-- 12 times

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.510
3-- we have 36 carbons.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.510
Now did we start with
36 carbons?

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.440
Well we have 6 times 5 carbons.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.260
That's 30.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.640
Plus another 6 here.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.060
So, yes.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.580
We have 36 carbons.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.260
They react with each other
to form this PGAL.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.690
The bonds or the electrons in
this molecule are in a higher

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.020
energy state than the electrons
in this molecule.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.900
So we have to add energy
in order for

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.420
this reaction to happen.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.480
This won't happen
spontaneously.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.620
And the energy for this
reaction, if we use the

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.160
numbers 6 and 6 here, the energy
from this reaction is

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:51.890
going to come from 12 ATPs-- you
could imagine 2 ATPs for

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.040
every carbon and every ribulose

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:02.990
bisphosphate; and 12 NADPHs.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.900
I don't want to get you confused
with-- it's very

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.220
similar to NADH, but I don't
want to get you confused with

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.560
what goes on in respiration.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:17.100
And then these leave as 12 ADPs
plus 12 phosphate groups.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:25.460
And then you're going to have
plus 12 NADP pluses.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.970
And the reason why this is a
source of energy is because

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.420
the electrons in NADPH, or you
could say the hydrogen with

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.320
the electron in NADPH, is at
a higher energy state.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.290
So as it goes to lower
energy state, it

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.680
helps drive a reaction.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.360
And of course ATPs, when they
lose their phosphate groups,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.372
those electrons are in a very
high energy state, they enter

00:07:42.372 --> 00:07:45.550
a lower energy state, help drive
a reaction, help put

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.010
energy into a reaction.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.630
So then we have these
12 PGALs.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.150
Now the reason why it's called
a Calvin Cycle-- as you can

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.680
imagine-- we studied
the Kreb Cycle.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.140
Cycles start reusing things.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.960
The reason why it's called the
Calvin Cycle is because we do

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.570
reuse, actually, most
of these PGALs.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:12.660
So of the 12 PGALs, we're going
to use 10 of them to--

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.400
let me actually do
it this way.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.780
So we're going to
have 10 PGALs.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.320
10 phosphoglyceraldehydes 10
PGALs we're going to use to

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.150
recreate the ribulose
bisphosphate.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.440
And the counting works.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.530
Because we have ten 3-carbon
molecules.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.910
That's 30 carbons.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.200
Then we have six 5-carbon
molecules.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.309
30 carbons.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.580
But this, once again, is
going to take energy.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.520
This is going to take the
energy from six ATPs.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.590
So you're going to have six ATPs
essentially losing their

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.260
phosphate group.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.740
The electrons enter
lower energy

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.482
states, drive reactions.

00:08:49.482 --> 00:08:54.660
And you're going to have six
ADPs plus six phosphate groups

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.000
that get released.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.590
And so you see it as a cycle.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.050
But the question is, well
gee I used all of these.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.250
What do I get out of it?

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.410
Well I only used 10
out of the 12.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.895
So I have 2 PGALs left.

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:09.280
 

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.700
And these can then be used--
and the reason why I used 6

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.920
and 6 is so that
I get 12 here.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.150
And I get 2 here.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.790
And the reason why I have 2 here
is because 2 PGALs can be

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.900
used to make a glucose.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.860
Which is a 6-carbon molecule.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:31.010
It's formula, we've seen
it before, is C6H12O6.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.140
But it's important to remember
that it doesn't have to just

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.660
be glucose.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.770
It can then go off and generate
longer chained

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.400
carbohydrates and starches,
anything that

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.140
has a carbon backbone.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.180
So this is it.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.350
This is the dark reaction.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.310
We were able to take the
byproducts of the light

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.130
reactions, the ATP and the
NADHs-- there's some more ATP

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.670
there-- and use it
to fix carbon.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.700
This is called carbon
fixation.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.060
When you take carbon in a
gaseous form and you put it

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.890
into a solid structure, that
is called carbon fixation.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.170
So through this Calvin Cycle we
were able to fix carbon and

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.200
the energy comes from these
molecules generated from the

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.280
light reaction.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.720
And of course, it's called a
cycle because we generate

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.160
these PGALs, some of them can
be used to actually produce

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.580
glucose or other carbohydrates
while most of them continue on

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.250
to be recycled into ribulose
bisphosphate, which once again

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.920
reacts with carbon dioxide.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.970
And then you get this cycle
happening over and over again.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.060
Now we said it doesn't
happen in a vacuum.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.040
Actually if you want to know the
actual location where this

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.510
is occurring, this is all
occurring in the stroma.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.770
And the fluid inside the
chloroplast but outside of

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:43.950
your thylacoid.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.130
So in your stroma, this is where
your light independent

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.850
reactions are actually
occurring.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.640
And it's not just happening with
the ADP and the NADPH.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.600
There's actually a fairly decent
sized enzyme or protein

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.560
that's facilitating it.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.790
That's allowing the carbon
dioxide to bond at certain

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.900
points and the ribulose
bisphosphate and the ATP to

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.440
react at certain points, to
essentially drive these two

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.380
guys to react together.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:15.560
And that enzyme, sometimes it's
called RuBisCo, I'll tell

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.870
you why it's called RuBisCo.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.000
So this is RuBisCo.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.690
So rub-- let me get the
capitalization right--

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:29.950
ribulose bisphosphate rub--
bis-- co-- carboxylase.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.040
And this is what
it looks like.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.490
So it's a pretty big protein
enzyme molecule.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.710
You can imagine that you have
your ribulose bisphosphate

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.070
bonding at one point.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.690
You have your carbon dioxide
bonding at another point.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.120
I don't know what
points they are.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.550
ATP bonds at another point.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.640
It reacts.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.400
That makes this thing twist and
turn in certain ways to

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.590
make the ribulose bisphosphate
react with the carbon dioxide.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.460
NADPH might be reacting
at other parts.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.040
And that's what facilitates
this entire Calvin Cycle.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.600
And you might-- I told you over
here-- that this R U B P,

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.410
this is ribulose-1
5-bisphophate.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:16.800
This RuBisCo, this is short for
ribulose-1 5-bisphophate

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.290
carboxylase.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.880
I won't write it all out;
you could look it up.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.260
But it's just telling you, it's
an enzyme that's used to

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.040
react carbon and ribulose-1
5-bisphophate.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.900
But now we're done.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.750
We're done with photosynthesis.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:36.070
We were able to start off with
photons and water to produce

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.100
ATP and NADPH because we had
those excited electrons, we

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.610
had the whole chemiosmosis to
drive the-- that allowed the

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.840
ATP synthase to produce ATP.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.660
NADPH was the final
electron acceptor.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.020
These are then used as the fuel
in the Calvin Cycle, in

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:54.990
the dark reaction.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.820
Which is badly named, it should
be called the light

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.650
independent reaction.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.270
Because it actually does
happen in the light.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.070
You take your fuel from the
light reactions with some

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.840
carbon dioxide and you can fix
it using your-- I like to call

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.090
it-- the RuBisCo enzyme
in the Calvin Cycle.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.210
And you end up with your
phosphoglyceraldehyde which

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.000
could also be called your
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.860
which can then be used to
generate glucose, which we all

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.400
use to eat and fuel
our bodies.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.780
Or we learn in cellular
respiration, that can then be

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.550
converted into ATP
when we need it.
