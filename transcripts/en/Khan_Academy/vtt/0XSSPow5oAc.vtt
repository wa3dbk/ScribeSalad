00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.350
In the last video we learned a
little bit about what a chiral

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.730
molecule or what a chiral carbon
or a chiral atom is.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.850
What I want to do in this video
is go through a bunch of

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.920
examples and see if we can
identify if there are any

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.770
chiral atoms and to also
see if we're dealing

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.590
with a chiral molecule.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.840
So let's look at our
examples here.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.330
So here I have, what is this?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.580
This is chlorocyclopentane.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.680
So the first question is do
we have any chiral atoms?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.580
And when we look at our
definition that we thought of

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.160
chiral atoms, it all comes from
this notion of handedness

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.320
and not being able to be
superimposable on your mirror

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.040
image, but we said that they're
usually carbons bonded

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.770
to four different groups.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.160
Let's see, do we have any
carbons here bonded to four

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.000
different groups?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.350
Well, all the CH2's, they're
bonded to another CH2

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.320
and then two H'2.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.090
I could draw it like
this: H and H.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.500
So they're bonded to two of
the same group, so none of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.580
these CH2's are good candidates
for being a chiral

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.500
center or chiral carbon.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.160
They're both bonded to-- or all
of them are bonded to two

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.620
hydrogens and two other very
similar-looking CH2 groups,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.720
although you have to look
at the entire group

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.480
that it's bonded to.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.970
But they're all definitely
bonded to two hydrogens, so

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.660
it's not four different
groups.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.240
If we look at this CH
right here, we could

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.510
separate it out like this.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.510
We could separate the H out like
this, and so since it's

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.740
bonded to a hydrogen.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.540
This carbon is bonded to a
chlorine, and then it's bonded

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.340
to-- well, it's not clear when
you look at it right from the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.960
get-go whether this group is
different than this group.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.840
But if you go around, if you
were to split it half-way like

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.940
this, or maybe another better
way to think about is if you

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.050
were to go around this molecule
in that direction,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.800
the counterclockwise direction,
you would encounter

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.895
a CH2 group, and then you
encounter a CH2 group, and

00:01:57.895 --> 00:01:59.510
then you would encounter a
third, and then you would

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.360
encounter a fourth CH2 group,
then you would come back to

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.190
where you were before.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.180
So you would encounter four
CH2's and then you'd come back

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.320
to where you were before.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.330
If you go in this direction,
what happens?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.200
You encounter one, two, three,
four CH2's and you come back

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.780
to where you were before.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.950
So all of this, this bottom
group, depending on how far

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.480
you want to extend it, and this
top group, are really the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.490
same group.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:36.650
So this is not a chiral center
or not a chiral carbon.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.690
It's not bonded to four
different groups.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.610
And this is also not a chiral
molecule, because it does not

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.820
have a chiral center.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.970
And to see that it's not a
chiral molecule-- let me see

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.610
if I can backtrack this
back to the way I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.060
wrote it right before.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.980
So you see that it's not
a chiral molecule.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.540
There's a couple of ways you
could think about it.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.170
The easiest way, or the way my
brain likes to think about it,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.180
is just to think about
its mirror image.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.720
Its mirror image will
look like this.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.340
So if that's the mirror, you
would have a chlorine.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:19.460
Then you have a CH, CH2, CH2,
and you have a CH2, CH2, and

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.300
then you complete your
cyclopentane.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.470
Now, in this situation, is there
any way to rotate this

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.630
to get this over there?

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.400
Well, if you just took this
molecule right here and you

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.000
just rotated it 180 degrees,
what would it look like?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.880
Well, maybe a little over--
yeah, well, not quite 180

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.550
degrees, but if you were to
rotate it so that the chlorine

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.430
goes about that far, you would
get this exact molecule.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.430
You would get something.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.750
It would look a little
bit different.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.040
It would look like this.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.040
Let me see if I can
do it justice.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.350
It would look like this.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.680
You would have a CH2.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.420
So let me let me do it up
here where I have a

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.290
little bit more space.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:13.310
If I were to rotate this about
that far, I would get a CH.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.890
You get the chlorine and then
you have your CH2, and then

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:28.380
you have another CH2, CH2,
and then you would

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.760
have your CH2 up there.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.540
If you were to rotate this all
the way around, or actually

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.200
this is almost exactly
180 degrees, it

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.050
would look like this.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.570
And the only difference between
this and this is just

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.870
how we drew this bond here.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.850
I could have easily, instead
of drawing that bond like

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.010
that, I could draw it facing
up like that, and these are

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.130
the exact same molecule.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:53.100
So this molecule is
also not chiral.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.600
So let's go to this
one over here.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.510
So what is this?

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.915
This is a
bromochlorofluoromethane, just

00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:04.930
to practice our naming
a little bit.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.670
But it's very clear that
we are bonded to

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:07.750
four different groups.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.500
All of the different groups, or
the atoms in this case that

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.510
are bonded to this carbon, are
different, so this carbon is a

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.760
chiral center.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.900
And it should also be pretty
clear that it is

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.260
also a chiral molecule.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.010
If you were to take its mirror
image, and this is very

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.900
similar to the example we did
in the first video on

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.530
chirality, but its mirror image
will look like this.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.360
You have the bromine
on the right now.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.970
The hydrogen is still in
back, and you have the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.040
fluorine above it.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.220
No matter how you try to rotate
this thing, if you try

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.690
to get the bromine all the way
over there, all the way to

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.770
that position, then the hydrogen
would be in this

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.790
position and the chlorine would
be in that position.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.580
And no matter how you try to
flip this around or rotate it

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.040
or shift it, you will never be
able superimpose this molecule

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.210
on that molecule right there.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.400
So that is a chiral center and
this is a chiral molecule.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.000
And there's a word for
these two versions.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.770
We're going to go into the
naming of them later on.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.850
It's a little bit
more involved.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.720
We'll have a whole separate
video on it.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.500
But these two versions of
bromochlorofluoromethane, they

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.900
sometimes have different
chemical properties.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.150
And these are called
enantiomers.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:34.500
And enantiomers are just
the mirror images.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.500
Each enantiomer is a mirror
image of each other, but they

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.750
are stereoisomers.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.600
This is all just terminology.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.450
Stereoisomers.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.570
You're familiar with the word
isomer, and isomer just means

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.570
that you have the same atoms
in your molecule.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.800
But then you have different
types of isomers.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.360
You have constitutional
isomers that say, OK,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.410
different things are connected
to different things.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.510
Stereoisomers, the same
things are all

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.520
connected to the same things.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.370
You have a carbon connected to
only a fluorine, a chlorine

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.980
connected to the carbon, a
hydrogen connected to the

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.840
carbon, a bromine connected
to the carbon.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.500
So all of the same things are
connected to the same things,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.930
but they're a three-dimensional

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.860
configuration.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.620
That's where we're dealing
with the stereo part.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.300
Stereochemistry is the study
of three-dimensional

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.450
chemistry, as essentially
understanding the actual

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.390
three-dimensional structure
of things.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.140
So stereoisomers mean that we
have the same constituents,

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.460
the same atoms. They
have the same

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.530
connections to each other.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.140
Bromine is still connected
to carbon, which is still

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.980
connected to hydrogen.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.160
That's all true over here.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.830
But their three-dimensional

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.210
orientation is still different.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.900
And in this case where they
are mirror images of each

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.880
other, we call them
enantiomers.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.640
And I should probably make
one clarification.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.160
In the last few videos, I've
been a little bit, you know,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.720
sometimes I'll say configuration
and sometimes I

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.860
use the word conformation.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.200
So sometimes I'll use the word
configuration and sometimes I

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.200
use the word conformation, and
I actually should be a little

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.650
bit more, or I should have been
a little bit more exact

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:14.380
about these.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.770
When you're talking about a
configuration, you're actually

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.310
talking about a different
structure.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.205
To go from one configuration to
another configuration, you

00:08:21.205 --> 00:08:23.150
would actually have to
break bonds and kind

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.940
of reassemble them.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.320
So these are different
configurations.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.000
Because in order for them to be
able to be the same thing,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.010
you would have to swap maybe the
bromine and the hydrogen

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.679
in there where they are relative
to the carbon, so

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.450
these are different
configurations.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.940
Confirmations are really just
different shapes or different

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.880
orientations of the
same molecule.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.840
So when we talked about
cyclohexane being in a boat,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.590
so this is cyclohexane being
in a boat conformation, or

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.910
this is cyclohexane being in a
chair conformation, it's the

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.170
exact same molecule with the
exact same connections.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.340
We didn't detach any bonds
or reattach any bonds.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.100
They just flipped around
a little bit.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.720
So these are two different
conformations.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.820
These are two different
configurations.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.090
To go from one configuration
to another, you have to

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.940
rearrange bonds.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.630
Now let's look at this
molecule over here.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:19.210
Can we identify any
stereocenters or chiral

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.860
carbons or chiral atoms?

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.520
And you have this carbon
right here.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.130
Let's see, this carbon right
here is bonded to a chlorine,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.700
a hydrogen, a bromine, and
then another carbon.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.880
So this is bonded to four
different things, so this is a

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.940
chiral carbon.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.000
Sometimes they put a little
asterisk there.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.390
If we look at this carbon right
here you can-- well,

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.340
it's bonded to a fluorine and
another carbon, but it's

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.790
bonded to two hydrogens,
so it's not chiral.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.100
It has two of the same things
that it's bonded to.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.390
You can even see a little axis
of symmetry through it.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.840
If you look at that, you can
kind of flip it over, and it's

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.860
going to be the same thing.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.820
But this one right here, that
is a chiral center.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.900
That is a chiral center, or
chiral carbon, or chiral atom,

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.550
or a symmetric carbon.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.350
You'll see it used in
different ways.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.120
And because this molecule has
got that chiral center, you'll

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.930
see that if you were to take its
mirror image, it would be

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.000
an enantiomer.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.560
This is not superimposable
on its mirror image.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.690
We could even try to draw it.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.880
And just so you know, you don't
always have to do the

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.660
mirror image on the
right side.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.210
We can draw the mirror image
on the left side.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.720
So if we want to draw
its mirror image, it

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.490
would look like this.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:28.420
You would have a fluorine,
carbon, carbon, chlorine.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.180
You have your two hydrogens,
and then you would have a

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.020
hydrogen here, and then you
would have your bromine here.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.890
No matter what you try to do, if
you try to flip this around

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.670
or whatever, you will never be
able superimpose this on top

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.670
of this, so these
are enantiomers.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.450
These are both stereoisomers
relative to each other.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.270
And either of these, regardless
of which one you

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.520
pick, are chiral molecules.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.740
I'm over the time that I
normally want to go in the

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.360
video, so in the next video
I'll do even more.
