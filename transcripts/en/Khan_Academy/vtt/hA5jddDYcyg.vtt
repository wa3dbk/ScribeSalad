00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.150
We know that when we have some
substance in a liquid state,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.790
it has enough kinetic energy for
the molecules to move past

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.530
each other, but still not
enough energy for the

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.100
molecules to completely move
away from each other.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.530
So, for example, this
is a liquid.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.960
Maybe they're moving
in that direction.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.590
These guys are moving a little
bit slower in that direction

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.490
so there's a bit of this flow
going on, but still there are

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.540
bonds between them.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.060
They kind of switch between
different molecules, but they

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.380
want to stay close
to each other.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.330
There are these little bonds
between them and they want to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.940
stay close.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.260
If you increase the average
kinetic energy enough, or

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.470
essentially increase the
temperature enough and then

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.810
overcome the heat of fusion, we
know that, all of a sudden,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.740
even these bonds aren't strong
enough to even keep them

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.850
close, and the molecules
separate and they get into a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.560
gaseous phase.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.050
And there they have a lot of
kinetic energy, and they're

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.320
bouncing around, and they take
the shape of their container.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.090
But there's an interesting
thing to think about.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.709
Temperature is average
kinetic energy.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.160
Which implies, and it's true,
that all of the molecules do

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.940
not have the same
kinetic energy.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.330
Let's say even they did.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.310
Then these guys would bump into
this guy, and you could

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.430
think of them as billiard balls,
and they transfer all

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.550
of the momentum to this guy.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.290
Now this guy has a ton
of kinetic energy.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.870
These guys have a lot less.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.050
This guy has a ton.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.050
These guys have a lot less.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.380
There's a huge distribution
of kinetic energy.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.640
If you look at the surface
atoms or the surface

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.490
molecules, and I care about the
surface molecules because

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.450
those are the first ones
to vaporize or-- I

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.270
shouldn't jump the gun.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.340
They're the ones capable of
leaving if they had enough

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.720
kinetic energy.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.730
If I were to draw a distribution
of the surface

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.240
molecules-- let me draw
a little graph here.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.820
So in this dimension, I have
kinetic energy, and on this

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.150
dimension, this is just a
relative concentration.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.720
And this is just my best
estimate, but it should give

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.200
you the idea.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.000
So there's some average
kinetic energy at some

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.360
temperature, right?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.780
This is the average
kinetic energy.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.650
And then the kinetic energy of
all the parts, it's going to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.090
be a distribution around that,
so maybe it looks something

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.770
like this: a bell curve.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.200
You could watch the statistics
videos to learn more about the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.870
normal distribution, but
I think the normal

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.515
distribution-- this is supposed
to be a normal, so it

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:40.470
just gets smaller and smaller
as you go there.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.820
And so at any given time,
although the average is here,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.970
there's some molecules
that have a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.560
very low kinetic energy.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.590
They're moving slowly or maybe
they have-- well, let's just

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.960
say they're moving slowly.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.510
And at any given time, you have
some molecules that have

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.770
a very high kinetic energy,
maybe just because of the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.950
random bumps that it gets
from other molecules.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.520
It's accrued a lot of velocity
or at least a lot of momentum.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.740
So the question arises,
are any of these

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.680
molecules fast enough?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.820
Do they have enough kinetic
energy to escape?

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.690
And so there is some
kinetic energy.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.520
I'll draw some threshold here,
where if you have more than

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.710
that amount of kinetic energy,
you actually have enough to

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.970
escape if you are
surface atom.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.520
Now, there could be a dude down
here who has a ton of

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.050
kinetic energy.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.760
But in order for him to escape,
he'd have to bump

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.760
through all these other liquid
molecules on the way out, so

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.230
it's a very-- in fact, he
probably won't escape.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.540
It's the surface atoms that we
care about because those are

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.360
the ones that are interfacing
directly with

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.310
the pressure outside.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.530
So let's say this is
the gas outside.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.520
It's going to be much
less dense.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.800
It doesn't have to be, but
let's assume it is.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.420
These are the guys that kind
of can escape into the air

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.150
above it, if we assume that
there's some air above it.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.530
So at any given time, there's
some fraction of the particles

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.470
or the molecules that
can escape.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.670
So you're next question is, hey,
well, doesn't that mean

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.470
that they will be vaporized or
they will turn into gas?

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.600
And yes, it does.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.480
So at any given time,
you have some

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.440
molecules that are escaping.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.970
Those molecules-- what it's
called is evaporation.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.350
This isn't a foreign
concept to you.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.510
If you leave water outside, it
will evaporate, even though

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.600
outside, hopefully, in your
place, is below the boiling

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.950
temperature, or the normal
boiling temperature of water.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.090
The normal boiling point is
just the boiling point at

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.560
atmospheric pressure.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.070
If you just leave water out,
over time, it will evaporate.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.460
What happens is some of these
molecules that have unusually

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.820
high kinetic energy do escape.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.990
They do escape, and if you have
your pot or pan outside

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.606
or, even better, outside of your
house, what happens is

00:04:48.606 --> 00:04:51.840
they escape, and then
the wind blows.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.000
The wind will blow and then
blow these guys away.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.010
And then a few more will escape,
the wind blows and

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.940
blows them all away.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.330
And a few more escape, and
the wind blows and blows

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.440
them all the way.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.810
So over time, you'll end up with
an empty pan that once

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.050
held water.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.020
Now, the question is
what happens if you

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.210
have a closed system?

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.200
Well, we've all done that
experiment, either on purpose

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.980
or inadvertently, leaving
something outside and seeing

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.010
that the water will evaporate.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.450
What happens in a closed system
where there isn't wind

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.100
to blow away?

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.780
So let me just draw--
there you go.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.920
Let's say a closed system, and I
have-- it doesn't have to be

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.060
water, but I have some
liquid down here.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.350
And there's some pressure
from the air above it.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.020
Let's just say it was at
atmospheric pressure.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.780
It doesn't have to be.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.710
So there's some air and
the air has some

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.990
kinetic energy over here.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.200
So, of course, do the
water molecules.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.280
And some of them start
to evaporate.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.490
So some of the water molecules
that are up here in the

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.010
distribution, they have enough
energy to escape, so they

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.890
start hanging out with the
air molecules, right?

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.050
Now something interesting
happens.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.285
This is the distribution
of the molecules

00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:11.570
in the liquid state.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.350
Well, there's also a
distribution of the kinetic

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.080
energies of the molecules
in the gaseous state.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.650
Just like different things are
bumping into each other and

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.410
gaining and losing kinetic
energy down here, the same

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.570
thing is happening up here.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.150
So maybe this guy has a lot of
kinetic energy, but he bumps

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.530
into stuff and he loses it.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.070
And then he'll come back down.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.940
So there's some set
of molecules.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.220
I'll do it in another
set of blue.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.450
These are still the water-- or
whatever the fluid we're

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.000
talking about-- that come back
from the vapor state back into

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.250
the liquid state.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.440
And so what happens is, there's
always a bit of

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.670
evaporation and there's always
a bit of condensation because

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.470
you always have this

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.600
distribution of kinetic energies.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.850
At any given moment in time,
out of the vapor above the

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.055
liquid, some of the vapor loses
its kinetic energy and

00:06:58.055 --> 00:06:59.560
then it goes back into
the liquid state.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.060
Some of the surface liquid gains
kinetic energy by random

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.050
bumps and whatever else and
goes into the vapor state.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.700
And the vapor state will
continue to happen until you

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.790
get to some type
of equilibrium.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.770
And when you get that
equilibrium, we're at some

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.920
pressure up here.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.520
So let me see, some pressure.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.530
And the pressure is caused by
these vapor particles over

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:30.970
here, and that pressure is
called the vapor pressure.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.270
I want to make sure you
understand this.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.130
So the vapor pressure is the
pressure created, and this is

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:45.770
at a given temperature for
a given molecule, right?

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.460
Every molecule or every type
of substance will have a

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.810
different vapor pressure at
different temperatures, and

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.720
obviously every different type
of substance will also have

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.130
different vapor pressures.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.920
For a given temperature and
a given molecule, it's the

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.860
pressure at which you have a
pressure created by the vapor

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.010
molecules where you have
an equilibrium.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.310
Where you have just as many
things vaporizing as things

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.120
going back into the
liquid state.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.310
And we learned before that the
more pressure you have, the

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.780
harder it is to vaporize
even more, right?

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.530
We learned in the phase state
things that if you are at 100

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.190
degrees at ultra-high pressure,
and you were dealing

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.410
with water, you would still
be in the liquid state.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.290
So the vapor creates some
pressure and it'll keep

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.240
happening, depending
on how badly this

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.320
liquid wants to evaporate.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.630
But it keeps vaporizing until
the point that you have just

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.309
as much-- I guess you could kind
of view it as density up

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:38.780
here, but I don't want to
think-- you have just as many

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.919
molecules here converting into
this state as molecules here

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.789
converting into this state.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.420
So just to get an intuition of
what vapor pressure is or how

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.750
it goes with different
molecules, molecules that

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:59.930
really want to evaporate-- and
so why would a molecule want

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.350
to evaporate?

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.350
It could have high kinetic
energy, so this would be at a

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.530
high temperature.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:11.690
It could have low intermolecular
forces, right?

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.620
It could be molecular.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.250
Obviously, the noble gases
have very low molecular

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:22.200
forces, but in general, most
hydrocarbons or gasoline or

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.480
methane or all of these things,
they really want to

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.570
evaporate because they have
much lower intermolecular

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.330
forces than, say, water.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.110
Or they could just be
light molecules.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.550
You could look at the physics
lectures, but kinetic energy

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.320
it's a function of mass
and velocity.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.830
So you could have a pretty
respectable kinetic energy

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.880
because you have a high mass
and a low velocity.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.480
So if you have a light mass and
the same kinetic energy,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.905
you're more likely to have
a higher velocity.

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:52.150
You could watch the kinetic
energy videos for that.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.010
But something that wants to
evaporate, a lot of its

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.240
molecules-- let me do it
in a different color.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.860
Something that wants to
evaporate really bad, a lot

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.130
more of its molecules will have
to enter into this vapor

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.890
state in order for the
equilibrium to be reached.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.370
Let me do it all in
the same color.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.810
So the pressure created by its
evaporated molecules is going

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.900
to be higher for it to get to
that equilibrium state, so it

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.395
has high vapor pressure.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.540
And on the other side, if you're
at a low temperature or

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.160
you have strong intermolecular
forces or you have a heavy

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.450
molecule, then you're going to
have a low vapor pressure.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:50.490
For example, iron has a very
low vapor pressure because

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.220
it's not vaporizing while--
let me think of something.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.450
Carbon dioxide has
a relatively much

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.620
higher vapor pressure.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.460
Much more of carbon dioxide
is going to evaporate

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.300
when you have it.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.770
Well, I really shouldn't use
that because you're going

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.140
straight from the liquid to the
solid state, but I think

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.110
you get the idea.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.060
And something that has a high
vapor pressure, that wants to

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:15.120
evaporate really bad, we say
it has a high volatility.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.620
You've probably heard
that word before.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.390
So, for example, gasoline has a
higher-- it's more volatile

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.060
than water, and that's why it
evaporates, and it also has a

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.230
higher vapor pressure.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.780
Because if you were to put it
in a closed container, more

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:39.170
gasoline at the same temperature
and the same

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.120
atmospheric pressure, will enter
into the vapor state.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.990
And so that vapor state will
generate more pressure to

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:53.330
offset the natural inclination
of the gasoline to want to

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.750
escape than in the
case with water.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.340
Now, an interesting thing
happens when this vapor

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.700
pressure is equal to the
atmospheric pressure.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.990
So right now, this is our closed
container and you have

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.370
the atmosphere here at
a certain pressure.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.790
Let's say until now, we've
assumed that the atmosphere

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.540
was at a higher pressure, for
the most part keeping these

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.010
molecules contained.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.440
Maybe some atmosphere molecules
are coming in here,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.740
and maybe some of the vapor
molecules are escaping a bit,

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.820
but it's keeping it contained
because this is at a higher

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.020
pressure out here than
this vapor pressure.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.490
And of course the pressure right
here, at the surface of

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.700
the molecule, is going to be the
combination of the partial

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.900
pressure due to the few
atmospheric molecules that

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.060
come in, plus the
vapor pressure.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.480
But once that vapor pressure
becomes equal to that

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.060
atmospheric pressure, so it can
press out with the same

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.020
amount of force-- you can kind
of view it as force per area--

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.260
so then the molecules
can start to escape.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.490
It can push the atmosphere
back.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.600
And so you start having
a gap here.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.530
You start having a vacuum.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.410
I don't want to use exactly
a vacuum, but since the

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.610
molecules escaped, more and more
of these molecules can

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.280
start going out.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.560
And at that point, you've
reached the boiling point of

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.580
the substance when the vapor
pressure is equal to the

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.250
atmospheric pressure.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.760
Just to get a sense of what all
of this means, let's look

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.300
at the vapor pressure
for water.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.540
This is water right here, H2O.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.640
I should do that in black.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:31.190
And so you see at 760-- so
atmospheric pressure, we're in

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.185
torr now, but that's just a
different-- 760 torr is equal

00:13:35.185 --> 00:13:38.310
to 1 atmosphere, so that's
about right.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.610
That's about right there,
so it's 1 atmosphere.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:46.140
So at atmospheric pressure,
the vapor pressure at 100

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.520
degrees Celsius for water-- the
vapor is at 100 degrees

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.370
Celsius for water.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.330
Or I guess another way to put
it, at 100 degrees Celsius,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:14:00.260
you have 760 torr of vapor
pressure, which is exactly the

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.820
atmospheric pressure, or 1
atmosphere, at sea level.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.070
So at 100 degrees, vapor
pressure is equal to

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.185
atmospheric, or sea
level atmospheric.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.500
And so you're going to boil,
which we all know is true.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.970
And then at lower temperatures,
your vapor

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.850
pressure is going to
be lower than the

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.370
atmospheric pressure, right?

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.780
Let's see, here it looks
like 300 something.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.650
But then what happens?

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.590
If you lowered the atmospheric
pressure enough, if you were

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.370
to pump air out of the
container, or whatever, low

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.950
enough, so if you brought the
atmospheric pressure down to

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.620
this vapor pressure, then again,
you will have boiling.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.390
And we saw that in the phase
change diagrams, that you can

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.480
boil something at a lower
temperature if you lower the

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.710
atmospheric pressure.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.660
And that's because you're
lowering the atmospheric

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.070
pressure to the vapor pressure
of the substance.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.360
And here's a comparative
chart, and this is

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:56.790
interesting.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.670
You see this is kind of an
exponential increase with

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.270
temperature of vapor pressure.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.760
And that's because, if you think
about that distribution

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.850
we did before, this is at
one kinetic energy.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.660
If you increase the amount of
kinetic energy, then your

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.100
distribution will
look like this.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.620
The temperature has gone up.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.770
And now you have a
lot, lot more.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:17.650
It's not just linear.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.890
You have a lot more particles
that can now escape and have

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.620
the kinetic energy
to evaporate.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.720
And you can see it's this
exponential increase as you

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.030
increase the temperature.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.060
Now, here's another chart.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.990
You say, hey, where's that
exponential increase going?

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.990
That's because this is
a logarithmic chart.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.880
You can see the scale.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.110
It increases exponentially as
opposed to linearly, so it

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.530
goes from 0.1 to 10, so equal
distances are actually up by a

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.010
factor of 10, so that's
why you don't see

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.600
that logarithmic move.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.860
But these are just for
different substances.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.390
Propane, you see at any given--
so let's go at like a

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.160
decent temperature.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.472
Let's go 20 degrees Celsius.

00:15:56.472 --> 00:16:02.940
At 20 Celsius, propane has the
highest vapor pressure.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:08.310
So this is 1 atmosphere, so
propane will actually

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.615
evaporate, will actually boil
at 20 degrees Celsius.

00:16:11.615 --> 00:16:13.440
It will actually completely
boil and go

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.520
into the gaseous state.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.410
Because its vapor pressure
is so much higher than

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.470
atmospheric pressure, if we're
assuming we're at sea level.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.910
And you could do that for
different molecules.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.730
Methyl chloride is
the next one.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.430
It's a slightly lower
vapor pressure,

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.250
but still very volatile.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.660
It would still definitely boil
and turn into the gaseous

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.390
state at 20 degrees Celsius if
we're at sea level because sea

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.330
level is right there.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.150
Let's see, at sea level, if you
wanted to keep something--

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.750
so sea level is this pressure--
if you wanted to

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.010
keep let's say, methyl
chloride.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.980
If you wanted to keep methyl
chloride in the liquid state,

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.170
or in equilibrium with the
liquid state instead of

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.580
boiling, you would have
to be at least at

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.240
around-- what is this?

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.010
Minus 25 degrees Celsius
in order for that.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.430
Propane, even at minus 25
degrees is still in the

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.290
gaseous state because its vapor

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.480
pressure is still higher.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.140
And then, of course, if you
have butane, for example.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:17.720
Butane I think is what they put
in lighters, but butane

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.550
will be in the liquid state as
long as you're at around

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.720
roughly 0 degrees.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.560
In a lighter, you might say,
oh, it's in a liquid state.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.140
They probably increase the
pressure so the pressure in

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.680
the lighter is probably
something higher.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.930
Maybe it's at 2 atmospheres or
something, so that the butane

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.940
at room temperature will stay
in the liquid state.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:36.220
Who knows?

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.160
I don't know what the pressure
is in there.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.930
This is just an interesting
chart to look at, that there's

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.690
actually a bunch of different
vapor pressures.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.870
You can see at atmospheric
pressure what's likely to be a

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.060
gas or a liquid at different
temperatures, and then you

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.310
could see at different
temperatures, which are the

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.440
things that are most volatile
and how much do you have to

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.000
increase or decrease the
pressure to evaporate

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.280
something or to boil it.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.820
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.260
Vapor pressure is something that
we encounter every day,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.660
and I'll see you in
the next video.
