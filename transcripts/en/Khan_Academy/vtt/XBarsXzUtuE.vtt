00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.560
A microbiologist has 1,256
microbes growing in culture.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.880
When he checks again after
fifteen minutes, there are

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.100
2,283 microbes in the same
culture, so they're growing

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.790
pretty fast. Estimate the
difference between the number

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.720
of microbes at each check by
rounding each number to the

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.330
nearest ten.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.830
So what they want us to do,
they want us to round each

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.470
number to the nearest ten, and
then with the rounded numbers,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.890
find the difference between
the two checks.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.940
So let's round each
of these numbers.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.910
So we started with
1,256 microbes.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.000
So how do we round this
to the nearest ten?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.590
That's what they
want us to do.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.140
So you look at the tens place.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.750
The tens place is that
5 right there.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.390
So if we round it up,
it would go to a 6.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.230
If we round it down, it
would stay at a 5.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.970
If we round it up,
this would be 60.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.400
If we round it down,
this will be 50.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.730
And the rule for rounding is
you look at the place one

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.310
below that.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.680
You go to the ones place in this
case, and you see if that

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.990
is 5 or more, or 5 or
greater, and it is.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.420
It's 6, which is definitely
5 or greater, so we

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.270
want to round up.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.200
So we want to round up, and
we're rounding up to the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.950
nearest ten.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.690
So this will be go from 56
to 60, so it'll be 1,260.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.380
We've rounded up.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.720
Now, when we wait fifteen
minutes, we check and we see

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.640
that there are 2,283 microbes.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.400
Once again, let's look
at the tens place.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.600
That's the 8 right there.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.250
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.580
That is the 8 right there.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.380
And you look at the place
one below that.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.860
If that's 5 or greater,
you round up.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.480
Otherwise, you round down.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.170
This right here, 3 is
less than 5 so you

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.919
want to round down.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.350
We want to round down, so we're
going to be left with

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.840
2,200, and instead of 83, we're
just going to have 80.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.010
2,280.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.800
Now, they want us to estimate
the difference between the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.830
number of microbes at each check
by rounding each number

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.070
to the nearest ten, so
we've done that part.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.640
We've rounded each number
to the nearest ten.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.330
Now we have to find
the difference.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.460
So let's subtract the first
check from the second check.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.980
That's how we get a
positive number.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.080
So let's do that.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.030
So if we subtract this 1,260--
let me just copy and paste it.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.280
So we want to subtract this--
copy it and paste it.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.730
We want to subtract that from
the 2,280 to figure out the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.900
difference.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.270
So we're going to
subtract here.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.020
Let me put the subtraction
sign, and let's do some

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.730
subtraction.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.900
So you go first to
the ones place.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.270
0 minus 0.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.590
Well, that's just
going to be 0.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.100
8 minus 6 in the tens place,
it's really 80 minus 60.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.035
That's going to be 2, but since
it's in the tens place,

00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:12.960
it's 20, or you could just
do 80 minus 60 is 20, so

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.640
everything makes sense so far.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.010
2 minus 2 is 0, and then
2 minus 1 is 1.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.010
So when we rounded each number
to the nearest ten and then

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.780
took the difference, our
estimated difference is 1,020.
