00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.325
This is Steve and this is Steve's uncle
and Steve is in a bit of a bind.

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:09.809
Not only does he not have any money
but he also owes Michael,

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.353
who is not depicted here.

00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:16.088
He owes Michael $3. So he actually
has a negative net worth.

00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:18.724
Steve has a net worth of -3.

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:23.664
Steve's uncle cares about Steve
and feels bad that he doesn't even have

00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:25.894
a 0 net worth;
he has a negative net worth!

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:29.413
And so Steve's uncle wants to at least
take away some of this pain.

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:34.812
He at least wants to get Steve back
to a neutral net worth, a 0 net worth.

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:42.600
So he decides to take away
Steve's negative net worth.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.568
He wants to take away that -3.

00:00:45.648 --> 00:00:51.703
What happens if you take away that -3?
Well, that should get you back to 0.

00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:54.200
If you take away anything...
if you have something

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.707
and you take it away,
it should go back to 0.

00:00:56.707 --> 00:01:01.218
Similarly if you owe people things
and that owing people things

00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:03.969
is taken away, it also gets back to 0.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.713
And another way to think about it is
how Steve's uncle would actually

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:11.767
take that liability,
take that debt away from Steve.

00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:16.493
Well, the easiest way he could do it
if Steve is starting at -3 net worth

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:22.684
is for his uncle to give Steve $3,
so that he(Steve) can get back

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:24.675
to a net worth of 0.

00:01:24.675 --> 00:01:27.716
So hopefully, that makes it
a little bit clearer,

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.059
that this and this
are intuitively equivalent.
