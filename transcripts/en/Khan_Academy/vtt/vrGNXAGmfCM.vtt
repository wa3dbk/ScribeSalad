00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.758
Lets think about what would happen inside of China.

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:09.107
If the government would allow its currency to completely float against the dollar,

00:00:09.107 --> 00:00:12.522
so, we know that the by-product would be its currency would strengthen.

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:16.000
So far, they are artificially weakening it. So, you would have a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.050
[stronger yuan] and you would have a [weaker dollar]. I want to be clear

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.990
that the Chinese government actually has been allowing yuan to slowly strengthen against the dollar,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.030
but it'€™s keeping maintaining a peg. We want to just think about

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.990
what would happen if it's completely float.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.030
Now, the obvious by-product of this that we know kept the currency weak that favors its exports.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.522
It would allow the exports to be cheaper, creating demand for the exports.

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:45.990
Now, they allowed their currency to strengthen.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.348
Then their exports would be more expensive than the other countries. So, it would [decrease demand for exports].

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, with fewer exports, fewer production perhaps in their factories now.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:09.080
This, obviously, would [slow down the Chinese economy]. Now, this we have to be careful here.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.050
When we say slowdown, just that doesn't mean that they necessarily fall into a recession.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.010
They have been growing at high single digits to low double digits for many many many years now.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.040
When we talk about slowing down, they might slow down to may be 4 to 5% growth,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.649
which is still super fast by any other nation's standards.

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.060
We have also seen that there is ton of inflation in China.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.040
And, to some degree, it kind of hints that the Chinese consumer is ready to take up the slack from foreign consumers.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.030
So, may not even slow down as we might first think.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.030
That brings up the first unambiguous positive behind allowing the currency to strengthen.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.030
If they would actually stop printing the Yuan, and start buying other currencies.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:01.251
It would actually [slow down inflation]. And, we know that we are dangerously close to kind of inflationary spiral.

00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:04.813
They have been reporting 5 to 6% of inflation.

00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:07.357
The reality might be closer to 10%.

00:02:07.357 --> 00:02:11.911
And, the inflation is actually going to be mitigated not just from the fact that you have lesser yuan running around,

00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:14.260
and the economy is slowing down.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.491
But, it is also because Yuan is strengthening. When it is stronger, it allows them to buy imports more cheaply.

00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:24.589
For the Chinese, perhaps the most important import is import of commodities.

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:26.308
And, most important of the commodities is Oil.

00:02:26.308 --> 00:02:31.000
So, the price of Oil would go down.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.645
Now, the bigger question that is harder to answer is what happens to Chinese manufacturing in general?

00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:41.070
Lot of the people the argument why China is able to build its manufacturing basis is that

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.030
they have this weak currency. That has allowed them to build ecosystems, get to scale in its factories.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.060
Will the manufacturing then go back to US or Europe?

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.060
My gut is that it would not go back to US or Europe. Because, any thing that requires huge amount of scale

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.990
and huge amount of labor is going to be very hard for the Chinese - to compete with Chinese,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.050
even if the currency was stronger. I think at that point of time, China has to worry about other developing nations

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.090
may be India, may be Latin America. While they have labor advantages relative to China

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.030
and if they were able to have same kind of efficiencies in the infrastructure and in the same scale

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.020
then they would be able to give them a run for their money.

00:03:22.030 --> 99:59:59.999
