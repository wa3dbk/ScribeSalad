00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.570
In this video I'm going to do a
bunch of examples of finding

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.170
the equations of lines in
slope-intercept form.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.610
Just as a bit of a review, that
means equations of lines

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:17.050
in the form of y is equal to mx
plus b where m is the slope

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.200
and b is the y-intercept.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.870
So let's just do a bunch of
these problems. So here they

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.900
tell us that a line has a slope
of negative 5, so m is

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.740
equal to negative 5.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.290
And it has a y-intercept of 6.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.300
So b is equal to 6.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.985
So this is pretty
straightforward.

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:41.530
The equation of this line
is y is equal to

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.550
negative 5x plus 6.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.570
That wasn't too bad.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.570
Let's do this next
one over here.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.300
The line has a slope of negative
1 and contains the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.320
point 4/5 comma 0.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.600
So they're telling us the slope,
slope of negative 1.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.230
So we know that m is equal to
negative 1, but we're not 100%

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.190
sure about where the y-intercept
is just yet.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.510
So we know that this equation
is going to be of the form y

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.300
is equal to the slope negative
1x plus b, where b is the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.460
y-intercept.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.650
Now, we can use this coordinate
information, the

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.870
fact that it contains this
point, we can use that

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.590
information to solve for b.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.530
The fact that the line contains
this point means that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.690
the value x is equal to 4/5, y
is equal to 0 must satisfy

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.265
this equation.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:43.120
So let's substitute those in.
y is equal to 0 when x is

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.090
equal to 4/5.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.170
So 0 is equal to negative
1 times 4/5 plus b.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.810
I'll scroll down a little bit.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.110
So let's see, we get a 0 is
equal to negative 4/5 plus b.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.040
We can add 4/5 to both sides
of this equation.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.250
So we get add a 4/5 there.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.320
We could add a 4/5 to
that side as well.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.100
The whole reason I did that is
so that cancels out with that.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.130
You get b is equal to 4/5.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.180
So we now have the equation
of the line.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.040
y is equal to negative 1 times
x, which we write as negative

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.500
x, plus b, which is 4/5,
just like that.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.480
Now we have this one.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.580
The line contains the point
2 comma 6 and 5 comma 0.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.540
So they haven't given us the
slope or the y-intercept

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.030
explicitly.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.350
But we could figure out both
of them from these

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.650
coordinates.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.270
So the first thing we can do
is figure out the slope.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.750
So we know that the slope m is
equal to change in y over

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.100
change in x, which is equal to--
What is the change in y?

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.490
Let's start with this
one right here.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.985
So we do 6 minus 0.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.070
Let me do it this way.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.410
So that's a 6-- I want to make
it color-coded-- minus 0.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.340
So 6 minus 0, that's
our change in y.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:24.190
Our change in x is 2
minus 2 minus 5.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.320
The reason why I color-coded
it is I wanted to show you

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.890
when I used this y term first,
I used the 6 up here, that I

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.380
have to use this x term
first as well.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.730
So I wanted to show you, this
is the coordinate 2 comma 6.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.590
This is the coordinate
5 comma 0.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.650
I couldn't have swapped
the 2 and the 5 then.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.030
Then I would have gotten the
negative of the answer.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.080
But what do we get here?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.210
This is equal to
6 minus 0 is 6.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.770
2 minus 5 is negative 3.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.910
So this becomes negative 6
over 3, which is the same

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.310
thing as negative 2.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.250
So that's our slope.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.920
So, so far we know that the line
must be, y is equal to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.580
the slope-- I'll do that in
orange-- negative 2 times x

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.160
plus our y-intercept.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.779
Now we can do exactly what we
did in the last problem.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.579
We can use one of these
points to solve for b.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.029
We can use either one.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.920
Both of these are on the line,
so both of these must satisfy

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.900
this equation.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.800
I'll use the 5 comma 0 because
it's always nice when

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.020
you have a 0 there.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.820
The math is a little
bit easier.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.510
So let's put the 5
comma 0 there.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.900
So y is equal to 0 when
x is equal to 5.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.820
So y is equal to 0 when you have
negative 2 times 5, when

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.700
x is equal to 5 plus b.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.650
So you get 0 is equal
to -10 plus b.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.820
If you add 10 to both sides of
this equation, let's add 10 to

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.680
both sides, these
two cancel out.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.970
You get b is equal to
10 plus 0 or 10.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.420
So you get b is equal to 10.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.935
Now we know the equation
for the line.

00:05:07.935 --> 00:05:14.110
The equation is y-- let me do it
in a new color-- y is equal

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:22.280
to negative 2x plus b plus 10.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.470
We are done.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.720
Let's do another one of these.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.270
All right, the line contains
the points 3 comma 5 and

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.890
negative 3 comma 0.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.380
Just like the last problem, we
start by figuring out the

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.380
slope, which we will call m.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.830
It's the same thing as the rise
over the run, which is

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.190
the same thing as the change
in y over the change in x.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.070
If you were doing this for your
homework, you wouldn't

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.870
have to write all this.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.920
I just want to make sure that
you understand that these are

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.150
all the same things.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.520
Then what is our change in
y over our change in x?

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.280
This is equal to, let's start
with the side first. It's just

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.980
to show you I could pick
either of these points.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:14.050
So let's say it's 0 minus
5 just like that.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.000
So I'm using this coordinate
first. I'm kind of viewing it

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.770
as the endpoint.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.420
Remember when I first learned
this, I would always be

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.160
tempted to do the x
in the numerator.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.990
No, you use the y's
in the numerator.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.470
So that's the second
of the coordinates.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:38.435
That is going to be over
negative 3 minus 3.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.370
This is the coordinate
negative 3, 0.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.420
This is the coordinate 3, 5.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.980
We're subtracting that.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.310
So what are we going to get?

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.570
This is going to be equal to--
I'll do it in a neutral

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.210
color-- this is going to be
equal to the numerator is

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:02.010
negative 5 over negative 3
minus 3 is negative 6.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.650
So the negatives cancel out.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.930
You get 5/6.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.700
So we know that the equation is
going to be of the form y

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:15.560
is equal to 5/6 x plus b.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.600
Now we can substitute one of
these coordinates in for b.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.440
So let's do.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.310
I always like to use the one
that has the 0 in it.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:33.270
So y is a zero when x is
negative 3 plus b.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.810
So all I did is I substituted
negative 3 for x, 0 for y.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.860
I know I can do that because
this is on the line.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.040
This must satisfy the equation
of the line.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.600
Let's solve for b.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.990
So we get zero is equal to, well
if we divide negative 3

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.830
by 3, that becomes a 1.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.890
If you divide 6 by 3,
that becomes a 2.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:02.380
So it becomes negative
5/2 plus b.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.280
We could add 5/2 to both
sides of the equation,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.630
plus 5/2, plus 5/2.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.850
I like to change my notation
just so you get

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.520
familiar with both.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.800
So the equation becomes 5/2 is
equal to-- that's a 0-- is

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.600
equal to b.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.090
b is 5/2.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:31.940
So the equation of our line is
y is equal to 5/6 x plus b,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:37.820
which we just figured out
is 5/2, plus 5/2.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.710
We are done.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.280
Let's do another one.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.500
We have a graph here.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.300
Let's figure out the equation
of this graph.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.900
This is actually, on some level,
a little bit easier.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.740
What's the slope?

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.250
Slope is change in y
over change it x.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.310
So let's see what happens.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.900
When we move in x, when our
change in x is 1, so that is

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.940
our change in x.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.850
So change in x is 1.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.130
I'm just deciding to change
my x by 1, increment by 1.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.900
What is the change in y?

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.390
It looks like y changes
exactly by 4.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.980
It looks like my delta y, my
change in y, is equal to 4

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.690
when my delta x is equal to 1.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.340
So change in y over change in
x, change in y is 4 when

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.220
change in x is 1.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.380
So the slope is equal to 4.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.190
Now what's its y-intercept?

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.720
Well here we can just
look at the graph.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.260
It looks like it intersects
y-axis at y is equal to

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.600
negative 6, or at the
point 0, negative 6.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.180
So we know that b is equal
to negative 6.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.875
So we know the equation
of the line.

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:56.630
The equation of the line is y is
equal to the slope times x

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.030
plus the y-intercept.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.850
I should write that.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:07.840
So minus 6, that is plus
negative 6 So that is the

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.800
equation of our line.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.980
Let's do one more of these.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.170
So they tell us that f of
1.5 is negative 3, f of

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.750
negative 1 is 2.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.970
What is that?

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.830
Well, all this is just a fancy
way of telling you that the

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:30.530
point when x is 1.5, when you
put 1.5 into the function, the

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.490
function evaluates
as negative 3.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.750
So this tells us that the
coordinate 1.5, negative 3 is

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.270
on the line.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.960
Then this tells us that the
point when x is negative 1, f

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.420
of x is equal to 2.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.540
This is just a fancy way of
saying that both of these two

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.400
points are on the line,
nothing unusual.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.380
I think the point of this
problem is to get you familiar

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.870
with function notation, for you
to not get intimidated if

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.970
you see something like this.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.540
If you evaluate the function
at 1.5, you get negative 3.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.440
So that's the coordinate if
you imagine that y is

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.020
equal to f of x.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.950
So this would be the
y-coordinate.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.250
It would be equal to negative
3 when x is 1.5.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.840
Anyway, I've said it
multiple times.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.280
Let's figure out the
slope of this line.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:20.020
The slope which is change in y
over change in x is equal to,

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:27.460
let's start with 2 minus this
guy, negative 3-- these are

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:32.880
the y-values-- over, all
of that over, negative

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:40.140
1 minus this guy.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.330
Let me write it this way,
negative 1 minus

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:48.440
that guy, minus 1.5.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.340
I do the colors because I want
to show you that the negative

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.060
1 and the 2 are both coming from
this, that's why I use

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.500
both of them first. If I used
these guys first, I would have

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.495
to use both the x and the y
first. If I use the 2 first, I

00:12:00.495 --> 00:12:02.080
have to use the negative
1 first. That's why I'm

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.390
color-coding it.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.360
So this is going to be equal
to 2 minus negative 3.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.370
That's the same thing
as 2 plus 3.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.620
So that is 5.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.040
Negative 1 minus 1.5
is negative 2.5.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.770
5 divided by 2.5
is equal to 2.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.250
So the slope of this
line is negative 2.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.130
Actually I'll take a little
aside to show you it doesn't

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.480
matter what order
I do this in.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.180
If I use this coordinate first,
then I have to use that

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.140
coordinate first. Let's
do it the other way.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:54.180
If I did it as negative 3
minus 2 over 1.5 minus

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.810
negative 1, this should be minus
the 2 over 1.5 minus the

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.060
negative 1.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.780
This should give me
the same answer.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.130
This is equal to what?

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:12.860
Negative 3 minus 2 is negative
5 over 1.5 minus negative 1.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.520
That's 1.5 plus 1.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.610
That's over 2.5.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.840
So once again, this is
equal the negative 2.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.340
So I just wanted to show you,
it doesn't matter which one

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.090
you pick as the starting or
the endpoint, as long as

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.980
you're consistent.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.650
If this is the starting y,
this is the starting x.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.370
If this is the finishing
y, this has to be

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.500
the finishing x.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.100
But anyway, we know that the
slope is negative 2.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.540
So we know the equation is y is
equal to negative 2x plus

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.170
some y-intercept.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.720
Let's use one of these
coordinates.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.430
I'll use this one since it
doesn't have a decimal in it.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.450
So we know that y
is equal to 2.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:52.630
So y is equal to 2 when x
is equal to negative 1.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.290
Of course you have
your plus b.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:02.710
So 2 is equal to negative 2
times negative 1 is 2 plus b.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.390
If you subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation, minus

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.370
2, minus 2, you're subtracting
it from both sides of this

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.480
equation, you're going to get
0 on the left-hand side is

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.520
equal to b.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.670
So b is 0.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.430
So the equation of our
line is just y is

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.680
equal to negative 2x.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.870
Actually if you wanted to write
it in function notation,

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:28.190
it would be that f of x is
equal to negative 2x.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.810
I kind of just assumed that
y is equal to f of x.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.420
But this is really
the equation.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.990
They never mentioned y's here.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.890
So you could just write f of x
is equal to 2x right here.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.190
Each of these coordinates
are the coordinates

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.610
of x and f of x.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.960
So you could even view the
definition of slope as change

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.320
in f of x over change in x.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.090
These are all equivalent ways
of viewing the same thing.
