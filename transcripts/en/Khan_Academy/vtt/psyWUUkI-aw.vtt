00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.920
If x is a whole number, what
other sets does x belong to?

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.060
And we saw a couple of videos
ago that I mentioned that the

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.070
notion of the set of
whole numbers is

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.750
a little bit ambiguous.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.560
Sometimes whole number means
non-negative integers.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.940
And sometimes it means
all integers.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.340
But in this context, and I
actually looked at what the

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.700
writers of this question are
looking for and the standards

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.590
that they care about.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.320
So from their point of view,
when they refer to whole

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.500
numbers, they're referring
to non-negative integers.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.310
So they're referring to 0, 1,
2, 3, so on and so forth.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.700
And I also looked at what they
referred to-- And remember,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.800
this is just according to the
writers of this question.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.070
This isn't according to how
everyone views these things.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.600
But they view natural numbers as
just the positive numbers.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.500
I told you two videos ago that
some people view natural

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.650
numbers as just the positive,
but some people include 0 as a

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.350
natural number.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.730
But in this context it's just
the positive integers.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.330
I shouldn't have said positive
numbers, I should have said

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.390
positive integers.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.120
It obviously doesn't
include the numbers

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.640
in between the integers.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.180
So natural are there the numbers
in this context.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.100
You'll see other contexts where
this would be described

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.930
as natural.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.430
In this context the natural
numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, so on

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.110
and so forth.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.430
And of course, there's no
ambiguity about what integers

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.480
are; everyone agrees on that.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.910
Integers are-- you know, you
could go arbitrarily negative

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.790
and then negative 3, negative
2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.160
And you can just keep going
in the positive direction.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.350
So if x is a whole number, when
they say whole numbers

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.160
they mean it is non-negative.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.410
What other sets does
x belong to?

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.050
Well, if it's a whole number,
it's anyone of these numbers.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.320
And all of these numbers
are also integers.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.690
The set of whole numbers, by the
convention they're using,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.830
is this set right here.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.240
It is a subset of integers.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.470
So we know that x is
also an integer.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.780
x is also a member
of integers.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.280
That means a member,
a member of a set.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.370
x is also a member
of integers.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.750
But it will not be a member of
natural numbers, or at least

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.560
the way that they've
defined it.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.610
Because x could be 0.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.010
0 is considered a whole number,
but if x were 0, it

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.560
would not be a member of
the natural numbers.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.780
So we can't say it's natural.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.920
All we can say is, that it's
definitely integers, it's

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.860
definitely rational.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.850
Because any whole number, you
can just divide it by 1 and

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.735
represent it as a fraction.

00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:45.210
So x is a member of rationals.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.710
And of course, it's also a
member of the real, which is

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.960
the broadest set that
we know of.
