00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.475
We're asked to subtract.

00:00:01.475 --> 00:00:04.900
And we have the
problem 68 minus 42.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.790
And what I want
to do here is one,

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.050
just show you how I
would do this problem,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.520
and then talk a little bit
about why it actually works.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.800
So if I have 68 minus
42, one way to do it--

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.670
and this is probably
the most typical way--

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.690
is to write the number you're
subtracting from on top,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.650
and write the number that you're
subtracting from that number

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.410
below that.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.200
So we're going to
have 68 minus 42.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.050
And the thing you really
want to make sure you do

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.340
is that you want to align
it according to place.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.930
So the 2 is below the 8.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.610
They're both in the ones place.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.085
And the 4 is below the 6.

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:38.526
They're both in the tens place.

00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:40.400
And later in this video,
it should be clear--

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.100
or I'll hopefully
make it clear--

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.700
why that's a good thing to do.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.460
So then we go to the ones
place, and we see an 8.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.630
And from that, we're
going to subtract a 2.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.217
So 8 minus 2 is 6.

00:00:52.217 --> 00:00:53.300
I'll write that over here.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.880
Let me write that over here.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.920
8 minus 2 is 6.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180
8 minus 2 is equal to 6.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.505
And then we go to
the tens place.

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:05.177
We have 6 minus 4.

00:01:05.177 --> 00:01:06.760
And since they're
[? in ?] tens place,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.580
this is really 60 minus 40.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.520
But 6 minus 4 is 2.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.437
6 minus 4 is equal to 2.

00:01:15.437 --> 00:01:17.020
And since these are
in the tens place,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.424
this is really saying 60
minus 40 is equal to 20.

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:21.590
And I'll make that a little
bit clearer in a second.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.810
So we're actually done here.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.411
68 minus 42 is equal to 26.

00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:27.910
And you can check
that for yourself.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.510
If you add 26 plus
42, you should get 68.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.960
Or if you subtract 26 from
68, you should get 42.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.270
So I encourage you do that in
your own time after this video.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.272
Verify that 42 plus
26 is equal to 68.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:50.900
And also verify what 68
minus 26 is equal to.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.880
And you should see
that it is equal to 42.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.134
So these are two things for
you to check on your own.

00:01:56.134 --> 00:01:58.050
Now, the last thing I
want to do in this video

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.190
is just to explain in
a little bit more depth

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.800
why this actually works.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.272
And at least in my mind,
I like to visualize 68.

00:02:05.272 --> 00:02:06.980
You won't have to
write it out like this,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.240
but it's one way to
make sure you really

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.573
understand what's going on here.

00:02:09.573 --> 00:02:15.440
68 is the same thing as
60 plus 8, or 60 and 8.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.600
And from that, we're
subtracting 42.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.070
But 42 is the same
thing as 40 plus 2.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.760
So we're subtracting 40,
and we're subtracting 2.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.980
We're subtracting 42.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.370
We're subtracting 40 and 2.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.780
And so you could view this as
really two separate problems.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.072
In the ones place,
you have an 8 minus 2.

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:36.905
And that's is exactly
what we did over here.

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:38.240
You have a 6.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.460
And then in the tens place,
you have a 60 minus 40,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.270
which is 20.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.810
So you end up with 20 plus 6.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.840
And you know that that's
the same exact thing as 26.
