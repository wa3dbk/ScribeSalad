00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.450
In the last video we talked
about different ways to

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.920
represent the central tendency
or the average of a data set.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.690
What we're going to do in this
video is to expand that a

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.170
little bit to understand
how spread apart

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.830
the data is as well.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.200
So let's just think about
this a little bit.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:27.780
Let's say I have negative
10, 0, 10, 20 and 30.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.090
Let's say that's one data
set right there.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.290
And let's say the other data
set is 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.640
Now let's calculate the
arithmetic mean for both of

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.880
these data sets.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.690
So let's calculate the mean.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.270
And when you go further on in
statistics, you're going to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.130
understand the difference
between a

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.780
population and a sample.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.830
We're assuming that
this is the entire

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.050
population of our data.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.240
So we're going to be dealing
with the population mean.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.000
We're going to be dealing
with, as you see, the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.420
population measures
of dispersion.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.890
I know these are all
fancy words.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.950
In the future, you're not going
to have all of the data.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.810
You're just going to have some
samples of it, and you're

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.420
going to try to estimate
things for the entire

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.790
population.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.370
So I don't want you to worry too
much about that just now.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.170
But if you are going to go
further in statistics, I just

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.910
want to make that
clarification.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.690
Now, the population mean, or
the arithmetic mean of this

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.790
data set right here, it is
negative 10 plus 0 plus 10

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.730
plus 20 plus 30 over-- we have
five data points-- over 5.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.530
And what is this equal to?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.620
That negative 10 cancels out
with that 10, 20 plus 30 is 50

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.290
divided by 5, it's
equal to 10.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.720
Now, what's the mean
of this data set?

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:56.470
8 plus 9 plus 10 plus 11 plus
12, all of that over 5.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.160
And the way we could think about
it, 8 plus 12 is 20, 9

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.770
plus 11 is another 20, so
that's 40, and then

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.890
we have a 50 there.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.710
Add another 10.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.690
So this, once again, is
going to be 50 over 5.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.380
So this has the exact same
population means.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.440
Or if you don't want to worry
about the word population or

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.830
sample and all of that, both
of these data sets have the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.690
exact same arithmetic mean.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.360
When you average all these
numbers and divide by 5 or

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.570
when you take the sum of these
numbers and divide by 5, you

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.950
get 10, some of these numbers
and divide by 5,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.390
you get 10 as well.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.310
But clearly, these sets of
numbers are different.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.810
You know, if you just looked at
this number, you'd say, oh,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.270
maybe these sets are very
similar to each other.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.760
But when you look at these two
data sets, one thing might pop

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.710
out at you.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.790
All of these numbers are
very close to 10.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.300
I mean, the furthest number
here is two away from 10.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.120
12 is only two away from 10.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.840
Here, these numbers are
further away from 10.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.990
Even the closer ones are still
10 away and these guys are 20

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.920
away from 10.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.660
So this right here, this data
set right here is more

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.160
disperse, right?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.730
These guys are further away from
our mean than these guys

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.610
are from this mean.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.630
So let's think about different
ways we can measure

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.840
dispersion, or how far
away we are from

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.070
the center, on average.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.130
Now one way, this is
kind of the most

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.170
simple way, is the range.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.840
And you won't see it used too
often, but it's kind of a very

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.850
simple way of understanding how
far is the spread between

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.850
the largest and the
smallest number.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.760
You literally take the largest
number, which is 30 in our

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.020
example, and from that, you
subtract the smallest number.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.280
So 30 minus negative 10, which
is equal to 40, which tells us

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.530
that the difference between the
largest and the smallest

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.830
number is 40, so we have a range
of 40 for this data set.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.570
Here, the range is the largest
number, 12, minus the smallest

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.840
number, which is 8, which
is equal to 4.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.150
So here range is actually
a pretty good measure of

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.990
dispersion.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.370
We say, OK, both of these
guys have a mean of 10.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.620
But when I look at the range,
this guy has a much larger

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.660
range, so that tells me this
is a more disperse set.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.360
But range is always not going to
tell you the whole picture.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.820
You might have two data sets
with the exact same range

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.840
where still, based on how things
are bunched up, it

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.230
could still have very different
distributions of

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.180
where the numbers lie.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.150
Now, the one that you'll
see used most often

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.400
is called the variance.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.390
Actually, we're going
to see the standard

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.390
deviation in this video.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.960
That's probably what's used most
often, but it has a very

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.040
close relationship
to the variance.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.466
So the symbol for the variance--
and we're going to

00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:49.180
deal with the population
variance.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.470
Once again, we're assuming that
this is all of the data

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.650
for our whole population, that
we're not just sampling,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.630
taking a subset, of the data.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.730
So the variance, its symbol is
literally this sigma, this

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.020
Greek letter, squared.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.260
That is the symbol
for variance.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.540
And we'll see that the sigma
letter actually is the symbol

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.260
for standard deviation.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.670
And that is for a reason.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.630
But anyway, the definition of
a variance is you literally

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.890
take each of these data points,
find the difference

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.580
between those data points and
your mean, square them, and

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.560
then take the average
of those squares.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.840
I know that sounds very
complicated, but when I

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.620
actually calculate it, you're
going to see it's not too bad.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.680
So remember, the mean
here is 10.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.210
So I take the first
data point.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.470
Let me do it over here.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.700
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.360
So I take the first
data point.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.680
Negative 10.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.150
From that, I'm going to subtract
our mean and I'm

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.840
going to square that.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.210
So I just found the difference
from that first data point to

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.580
the mean and squared it.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.820
And that's essentially
to make it positive.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.950
Plus the second data point, 0
minus 10, minus the mean--

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.050
this is the mean; this is that
10 right there-- squared plus

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.590
10 minus 10 squared-- that's
the middle 10 right there--

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.110
plus 20 minus 10-- that's
the 20-- squared

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.770
plus 30 minus 10 squared.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.630
So this is the squared
differences between each

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.280
number and the mean.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.490
This is the mean right there.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.960
I'm finding the difference
between every data point and

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.200
the mean, squaring them, summing
them up, and then

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.020
dividing by that number
of data points.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.170
So I'm taking the average
of these numbers,

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.920
of the squared distances.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.060
So when you say it kind of
verbally, it sounds very

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.520
complicated.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.820
But you're taking each number.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.570
What's the difference between
that, the mean, square it,

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.790
take the average of those.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.320
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, divided by 5.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.950
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.580
Negative 10 minus 10
is negative 20.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.460
Negative 20 squared is 400.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.780
0 minus 10 is negative 10
squared is 100, so plus 100.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.740
10 minus 10 squared, that's just
0 squared, which is 0.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.740
Plus 20 minus 10 is 10
squared, is 100.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.030
Plus 30 minus 10, which
is 20, squared is 400.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.750
All of that over 5.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.870
And what do we have here?

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.460
400 plus 100 is 500, plus
another 500 is 1000.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.930
It's equal to 1000/5, which
is equal to 200.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:42.520
So in this situation, our
variance is going to be 200.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.250
That's our measure of
dispersion there.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.850
And let's compare it to this
data set over here.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.720
Let's compare it to the
variance of this

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.420
less-dispersed data set.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.680
So let me scroll over a little
bit so we have some real

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.930
estate, although I'm
running out.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.370
Maybe I could scroll up here.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.200
There you go.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.740
Let me calculate the variance
of this data set.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.210
So we already know its mean.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.990
So its variance of this data set
is going to be equal to 8

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:21.340
minus 10 squared plus 9 minus
10 squared plus 10 minus 10

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:26.470
squared plus 11 minus 10-- let
me scroll up a little bit--

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.640
squared plus 12 minus
10 squared.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.059
Remember, that 10 is just the
mean that we calculated.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.850
You have to calculate the mean
first. Divided by-- we have 1,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.630
2, 3, 4, 5 squared
differences.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.679
So this is going to be equal
to-- 8 minus 10 is negative 2

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.760
squared, is positive 4.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.090
9 minus 10 is negative 1
squared, is positive 1.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.800
10 minus 10 is 0 squared.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.050
You still get 0.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.730
11 minus 10 is 1.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.380
Square it, you get 1.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.710
12 minus 10 is 2.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.930
Square it, you get 4.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.960
And what is this equal to?

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.100
All of that over 5.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.390
This is 10/5.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:09.160
So this is going to be--all
right, this is 10/5, which is

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.350
equal to 2.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.420
So the variance here-- let me
make sure I got that right.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.480
Yes, we have 10/5.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.970
So the variance of this
less-dispersed data set is a

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.820
lot smaller.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:26.150
The variance of this data set
right here is only 2.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.630
So that gave you a sense.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.540
That tells you, look, this is
definitely a less-dispersed

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.300
data set then that there.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.780
Now, the problem with the
variance is you're taking

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.680
these numbers, you're taking
the difference between them

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.390
and the mean, then you're
squaring it.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.910
It kind of gives you a bit of
an arbitrary number, and if

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.460
you're dealing with
units, let's say

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.160
if these are distances.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.700
So this is negative 10 meters, 0
meters, 10 meters, this is 8

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.110
meters, so on and so forth, then
when you square it, you

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.250
get your variance in terms
of meters squared.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.740
It's kind of an odd
set of units.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.550
So what people like to do is
talk in terms of standard

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:20.770
deviation, which is just the
square root of the variance,

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.510
or the square root
of sigma squared.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.470
And the symbol for the standard

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.200
deviation is just sigma.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.990
So now that we've figured out
the variance, it's very easy

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.250
to figure out the standard
deviation of both of these

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:33.720
characters.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.390
The standard deviation of this
first one up here, of this

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:42.660
first data set, is going to
be the square root of 200.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.300
The square root of
200 is what?

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.780
The square root of
2 times 100.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.480
This is equal to 10
square roots of 2.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.210
That's that first data set.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:58.410
Now the standard deviation of
the second data set is just

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.820
going to be the square root of
its variance, which is just 2.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:08.300
So the second data set has 1/10
the standard deviation as

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.170
this first data set.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.540
This is 10 roots of 2, this
is just the root of 2.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:18.935
So this is 10 times the
standard deviation.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.480
And this, hopefully, will make
a little bit more sense.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:29.960
Let's think about it.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.160
This has 10 times more the
standard deviation than this.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.480
And let's remember how
we calculated it.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.330
Variance, we just took each
data point, how far it was

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.680
away from the mean,
squared that, took

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.020
the average of those.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.490
Then we took the square root,
really just to make the units

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.260
look nice, but the end result
is we said that that first

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.850
data set has 10 times the
standard deviation as the

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.290
second data set.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.980
So let's look at the
two data sets.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:07.170
This has 10 times the standard
deviation, which makes sense

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.790
intuitively, right?

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.210
I mean, they both have a 10 in
here, but each of these guys,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.520
9 is only one away from
the 10, 0 is 10 away

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.640
from the 10, 10 less.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.860
8 is only two away.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.990
This guy is 20 away.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.770
So it's 10 times, on average,
further away.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.410
So the standard deviation, at
least in my sense, is giving a

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.090
much better sense of how far
away, on average, we

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.960
are from the mean.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.560
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.
