00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.977
LEBRON: Some reason Miami can be hot. I'm told the humidity makes it hotter

00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:06.602
Why is this?

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.999
KHAN: Excellent question LeBron.

00:00:09.014 --> 00:00:14.105
Let's first think about what people are talking about when they even say "humidity"

00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:17.833
And there's a couple of ways to think about humidity, but typically when you are the weatherman

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:21.985
or in everyday talk people say "Hey it's really humid out there." or "It's high humidity."

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:28.942
They're talking about relative humidity, and it's usually indicated by a percentage

00:00:28.942 --> 00:00:33.466
Let's just think about what the different percentages of relative humidity mean.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.365
So right over here, we have 0%.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.864
So right over here, we have 0% relative humidity.

00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:45.821
and over at the extreme other hand, you have 100% relative humidity.

00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:53.858
at any given point, the air is some place between 0% humidity and 100% relative humidity.

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:59.778
at 0% relative humidity is essentially saying that there is no water vapor in the air

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:03.942
or non-measurable amount of water vapor in the air.

00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:10.435
As we go to this molecular view of what it might look like little water droplet maybe on our surface of our skin

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:15.869
So just to be clear, these are the skin molecules - not even skin cells, which will be the actual skin molecules.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.015
Let's just simplified them as brown circles.

00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:25.488
And this right over here - this is the actual water molecules.

00:01:25.488 --> 00:01:29.461
So these are water molecules

00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:33.677
And maybe is a drop of sweat, or little water that got dropped on our skin

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:37.893
and it is in liquid state

00:01:37.893 --> 00:01:41.088
you have this hydrogen bond between the molecules that are super strong

00:01:41.088 --> 00:01:46.513
so allows these molecules to slide pass each other and that's why liquid flows the way it does.

00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:51.182
And we've already talked about why sweat makes you cooler but warm up you a little bit.
