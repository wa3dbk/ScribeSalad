00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.170
In the last video, we started
with these parametric

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.860
equations: x is equal to
3 cosine of t and y is

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.440
equal to 2 sine of t.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.630
And doing a little bit of
algebra, we were able to remove

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.410
the parameter and turn it into
an equation that we normally

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.590
associate with an ellipse.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:25.340
We got x squared over 9 plus y
squared over 4 is equal to 1.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.370
And we graphed it.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.320
And I'll do that.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.860
Actually I have it from the
previous-- We graphed it and

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.270
we got something that looked
like that right there.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.460
And we said well why
don't we always just

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.300
represent it like this?

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.030
Well this right here-- this
equation just in terms

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.740
of x and y --it just
represents the shape.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.510
It doesn't represent the actual
path that-- Let's say that t

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.480
represents an object's point--
an object's position at

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.370
some place and time.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.300
And we went over that.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.450
And as time progressed,
we went around the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.380
ellipse, in that case.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.400
And as time goes forward, we
kept going around this ellipse.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.540
But this begs the question: is
this the only set of parametric

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.870
equations that, when we do a
little bit of algebra,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.890
gives this path?

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.660
Can we think of another set
that gives-- that would

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.350
also, when you do the
algebra, get here?

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.250
And I think we can.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.820
So let's try a couple.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.050
I mean, we could do a
whole bunch of them.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.500
Actually, maybe we'll do a
whole bunch of them, just to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.380
see that there-- And what
you'll see is that there's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.550
actually an infinite number
of parametric equations

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.690
that have this path.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:38.180
So one could be x is
equal to 3 cosine of 2t.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.830
And the other one is y
is equal 2 sine of 2t.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.370
Like we did in the last video,
let's solve for cosine of 2t

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.320
and solve for sine of 2t.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.660
So we just have to divide both
sides of-- Well, both sides

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.960
of this top equation by 3.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.700
You get x over 3 is
equal to cosine of 2t.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.770
Divide both sides of
this equation by 2.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.680
You get y over 2 is
equal to sine of 2t.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.100
And we'll use the same trig
identities we did before.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.910
When we did this problem, we
said that sine squared of t

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.290
plus cosine squared
of t is equal to 1.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.020
Well if that's true,
so is this true.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.440
Let me see.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.820
If that's true, then we can
also say that sine squared

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.140
of 2t plus cosine squared
of 2t is equal to 1.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.100
In fact, sine squared of
anything here plus cosine

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.210
squared of anything, as long as
it's the same anything as we

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.300
put here-- I can't have a 2t
here and a 3t here, but if this

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.805
is a 2 and this is a 2 --then
that's always going

00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:49.640
to be equal to 1.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.620
You can just fill in the black.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.170
Because this is always going
to be the same angle.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.815
So if this is true, we can then
just take this and substitute

00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:03.745
it in for cosine of 2t and take
the y over 2 and substitute

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:05.740
it in for sine of 2t.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.770
And we get the sine of 2t
squared becomes y over 2

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.010
squared plus cosine of
2t is x over 3 squared.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.780
It equals 1.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.750
And that is exactly what
we had to begin with.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.170
That is the same thing as x
squared over 9-- I'm just

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.680
switching the order here --plus
y squared over 4 is equal to 1.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.600
So both of these parametric
equations, both sets of

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.830
parametric equations have
the exact same path.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.920
So how are they different?

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.010
Let's see.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.650
If we were to take-- So in
the previous video, we

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.550
took this yellow one.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.880
Actually I rewrote it here.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.370
And we did a little table
and we plotted the points

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.600
that it hits as you
go around the circle.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.470
So let's do the same
thing for our new set.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.000
So just since I lost it, let me
write the two equations here.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.870
It was x is equal to 3
cosine of 2t and y is

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.520
equal to 2 sine of 2t.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.495
Let me make a little table.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.576
There we go.

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:23.334
And we're going to have a t.

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:26.430
And we're going to
have an x and a y.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.460
And let's pick the
same values of t.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.780
0 pi over 2 and pi.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.860
When t is 0, cosine
of 2 times 0.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.450
That's cosine of 0, which
is one, times 3, it's 3.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.340
When t is equal to pi over
2, 2 times pi over 2 is pi.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.400
Cosine of pi over 2 is minus 1.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.180
Minus 1 times 3 is minus 3.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.600
When t is equal to pi, cosine
of 2 times pi is 2 pi.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.850
Cosine of 2 pi is the same
thing as cosine of 0.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.120
So that's 1.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.330
1 times 3 is 3.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.430
And then on the y side.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.245
When t is equal to 0,
that's the same thing

00:05:07.245 --> 00:05:08.740
as sine of 2 times 0.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.480
Sine of 0 times 2 is 0.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.550
Pi over 2.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.330
Sine of 2 times pi over 2.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.070
That's the same
thing as sine of 4.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.140
That's also 0.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.720
0 times 2 is 0.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.820
And then pi.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.070
Sine of 2 pi.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.200
Well, that's also 0.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.430
So here we get a bunch of 0's.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.980
So what happened here?

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.110
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.260
So in our first situation-- So
they both-- We established that

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.325
both this set of parametric
equations and this set of

00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:42.160
parametric equations, they both
have the same overall, I guess

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.670
we could say, shape
of their path.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.340
They're both this ellipse.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.410
But what we saw in the previous
videos, when you plot these

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.780
points at time t equals
0, we were right.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.550
This point right here
is that right there.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:07.490
And then at t is equal to pi
over 2, we got right there.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.270
And then at t is equal to
pi, we got over here.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.240
And we did that to establish
that the direction of motion.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.840
If these parametric equations
really are describing some

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.960
type of motion, it would
be counterclockwise.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.860
And what happens in this
scenario-- So when t is

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.410
equal to 0, we're still
at the point 3, 0.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.900
So they at least-- At t equals
0, you can kind of view them

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.890
as starting at the same
point, if we assume we're

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.390
starting a t equals 0.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.230
You don't have to
start at t equals 0.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.740
I did that a little bit in the
last video, but you can start

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.180
at t equals minus a google
or t equals minus infinity.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.130
So you don't necessarily
have a start point.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.970
But if we assume t equals 0 as
a start point, you could say

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.810
that they both started there.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.720
Then at-- let me pick a new
color that I haven't used

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.650
yet --then at t is equal to
pi over 2-- Where are we?

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.910
We're at minus 3, 0.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.890
We get all the way-- Oh.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.330
That's the same color
I used before.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.170
Let me see this.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.490
Let me do this color.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.080
We're here.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.730
Now notice: in the first one,
when we went from t equals 0

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.340
to t equals pi over 2, we
went from here to there.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.700
We went kind of a quarter of
the way around the ellipse.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.720
But now when we went from
t equals zero to pi over

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.280
2, where did we go?

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.430
we?

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.530
Went halfway around
the ellipse.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:36.240
We went all the way from there,
all the way over there.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.550
And likewise, when we went from
t equals pi over 2 to t equals

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.320
pi with this set of parametric
equations, we went another

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.510
quarter of the ellipse.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.100
We went from there to there.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.790
But here, when we go from t
equals pi ever 2 to t equals

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.910
pi, we go all of this way.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.100
We go back to the beginning
part of our ellipse.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.450
So what you see is that this
set of parametric equations

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.565
has the exact same shape of
its path as this set of

00:08:08.565 --> 00:08:09.660
parametric equations.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.640
Except it's going around it
at twice as fast of a rate.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:19.270
For every time when t increases
by pi over 2 here, we go by--

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.210
we kind of go a quarter
way around the ellipse.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.830
But when t increases by pi
over 2 here, we go halfway

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.290
around the ellipse.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.870
So the thing to realize-- and I
know I've touched on this

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.000
before --is that even though
both of these sets of

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.780
parametric equations, when you
do the algebra, they can

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.040
kind of be converted
into this shape.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.470
You lose the information about
where our particle is as it's

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.050
rotating around the ellipse or
how fast it's rotating

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.670
around the ellipse.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.580
And that's why you need
these parametric equations.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.590
We can even set up a parametric
equation that goes in

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.120
the other direction.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.730
Instead of having these-- and I
encourage you to play with that

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.740
--but if you instead of this,
if you just put a minus

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.480
sign right here.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.500
Cosine of minus t and
2 sine of minus t.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.610
Instead of going in that
direction, it would

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.860
go in this direction.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.430
It would go in a
clockwise direction.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.750
So one thing that you've
probably been thinking from the

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.620
beginning is OK, I was able to
go from my parametric equations

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.210
to this equation of ellipse
in terms of just x and y.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.020
Can you go back the other way?

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.330
Could you go from this to this?

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.300
And, I think you might realize
now, that the answer is no.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.400
Because there's no way, just
with the information that

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.560
you're given here, to know
that you should go to this

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.230
parametric equation or this
parametric equation or any of

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.100
an infinite number of
parametric equations.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:50.540
I mean anything of the form x
is equal to 3 cosine of really

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:56.450
anything times t and y is equal
to 3 times cosine of-- As long

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.590
as it's the same anything-- I
drew the two squiggly

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.240
marks the same.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.250
--as long as these two things
are the same, then you

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.620
will have-- they'll both
converge to this shape.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.760
So if you have the shape, you
don't know what parametric

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.930
equation you can go back to.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.380
You could make up one,
but you don't know which

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.970
one it'll go back to.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.560
And just to kind of hit the
point home of kind of making

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.800
up a parametric equation.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.460
Sometimes that's asked of you.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.780
So let's just do a
very simple example.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.570
Let's start with a
normal function of x.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.440
So let's say that we have
the equation y is equal

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.990
to x squared plus x.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.690
I just made it up.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.340
And let's say that you were
asked to turn this into

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.220
a parametric equation.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.500
And this is often a very hard
thing for people because there

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.650
is not one right answer.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.260
You can turn into an arbitrary
number of parametric equations.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.540
I just may do something
really crazy and arbitrary.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.550
I could say x is equal-- When I
have y defined explicitly in

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.170
terms of x like this, I can
make x into anything

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:56.660
in terms of t.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.620
I could say it's cosine of t
minus the natural log of t.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.620
I just made that up.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.380
That's just a random thing.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.550
But then if x is this, then y
is going to be equal to-- I

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:14.300
just substitute this back in
--cosine of t minus ln of t

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:21.240
squared plus cosine
of t minus ln of t.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.800
And we're done.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.550
We just converted this into a
parametric equation or a set

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.730
of parametric equations.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:32.660
I could've also just
written x is equal to t.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.010
And then what would y equal?

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:40.310
y would be equal to
t squared plus t.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.040
You might say well what's
the difference between this

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.240
parametric equation and
this parametric equation?

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.250
Well, they're both
going to have the same

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.870
shape of their paths.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.790
It's going to be something
like a parabola.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.520
But the rate and the direction
with which they progress

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.290
on those paths will be
very very different.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.500
It's actually a very
interesting thing

00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:58.920
to think about.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.860
There are some paths that you
could take where-- Let's say

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.610
that the-- You could set
up a parametric equation.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.080
Let's say that the shape is--
You know everything we've done

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.540
so far, we've always been going
in one direction, but you could

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.350
have a-- There are scenarios--
And maybe if I have time,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.610
I'll make a video.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.410
And this isn't what-- Let's say
the shape of the path is some

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.060
type of, I dunno, let's say
it's a circle of some kind.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.240
I'm just going to--
That's not this.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.130
I'm doing a completely
different example right now.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.750
I'm just kind of-- Sometimes,
with the ellipses we had paths

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.400
that went counterclockwise and
then paths that went clockwise.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.480
You can also have paths that
kind of isolate in between,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.690
move around, move back and
forth along the thing.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.470
So there's all sorts of
parametric equations

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.580
that you can define.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.490
And you can say if t
equals from this to this,

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.330
you'll use this set of
parametric equations.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.980
If it's another set of
t's, use another one.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.450
So there's all sorts of crazy
things you can do to say what

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.510
happens as you move
along the path.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.190
So the difference-- Not that
this is the path of that.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.820
This is actually
more of a parabola.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.130
But the difference between
this and this is how you

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.000
move along the shape.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.820
Anyway, I hope you found
that vaguely useful.
