00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.970
I've got this 2 by 2 matrix A
here, and I've got this other

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.490
member of R2, this vector b.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.310
Let's figure out all of the
interesting things that we can

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.370
figure out about this matrix
and this vector.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.910
So the first thing of interest,
and this is all

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.650
going to essentially help us
visualize what we learned in

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.720
the last video, is the
null space of A.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.130
To figure out the null space
of A, we know that the null

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.730
space of A is equal to the null
space of the reduced row

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.525
echelon form of A.

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:35.350
So let's just find out the
reduced row echelon form of A.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.830
Let's say we leave the
first row the same,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.060
we get 3 minus 2.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.600
And let's replace the second row
with the second row, minus

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.750
2 times the first, so 6,
minus 2 times 3 is 0.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.630
And minus 4, minus 2
times minus 1 is 0.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.240
And then let's replace the first
row with the first row

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.950
divided by 3.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.070
So then that becomes 1 minus
2/3, and the second

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.420
row is still 0.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.700
So that's the reduced row
echelon form of A.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.820
And we want to find
its null space.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.150
So we want to find all of
the vectors that we

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.610
can multiply it by.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.150
So this is the vector x1,
x2, that is equal to

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.460
the 0 vector in R2.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.050
So the second row gives us no
information, 0 times x1, plus

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.240
0 times x2 is equal to 0.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.240
No information there.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.180
So our only constraint
is the first row.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.710
1 times x1-- let me write it
here-- so 1 times x1, plus--

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.950
let me write it this way--
minus 2/3 times x2 is

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.160
equal to that 0.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.630
Is equal to that
0 right there.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:51.470
Or we could write that x1
is equal to 2/3 x2.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.090
So if we wanted to write the
null space of A-- actually,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.490
before I write that, just to
simplify things and just to

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.030
show you that x2 isn't some
special number, let's just say

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.600
that x2 is equal to t, where
t is some real number.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.620
And then we would have x1
is equal to 2/3 times t.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.130
So the null space of our matrix,
the null space of A,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.500
is going to be equal to the set
of all x1, x2's, that are

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.480
equal to some real number
t times the vector.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.480
x2 is equal to t times 1, and
x1 is equal to 2/3 t.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.500
So 2/3, 1.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.520
Just like that.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.350
That is our null space.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.940
All of the multiples of
the vector 2/3, 1.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.910
And actually just to make this
a little bit simpler, we can

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.300
pick c, let's pick t,
sorry, let's pick t

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.620
to be equal to 3c.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.435
So then what do you have?

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:09.870
If this is equal to 3c, if you
multiply the 3 times these, we

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.500
could rewrite this as being
equal to the x1's, x2's that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.810
are equal to the scalar c, where
that is some other real

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:28.230
number, times 3 times 2/3
is 2, 3 times 1 is 3.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.700
And the whole reason why I did
that is just to write the null

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.100
space with a slightly simpler
basis vector.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.790
The one that didn't have
any fractions in it.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.490
Or we could also write that
the null space is

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.470
equal to the span.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.980
The span of the vector 2, 3.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.580
All of these statements
are equivalent.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.230
So we figured out
the null space.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.800
Maybe another interesting thing,
especially if we're

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.400
going to make this relate to
what we did in the last video,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.760
is find a solution set to the
equation Ax is equal to b.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.990
To do that, we just set up
an augmented matrix.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.970
So we set up an augmented
matrix, 3 minus 2, 6 minus 4,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.460
and we augment it
with b, 9, 18.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.290
And then we put the left-hand
side in reduced row echelon

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.589
form, and we get-- let's keep
the first row the same-- we

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.170
get 3 minus 2, and then 9.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.480
Let's replace the second row
with the second row minus 2

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.690
times the first. So we get 6
minus 2 times 3, is 0, minus 4

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.600
minus 2 times minus 2,
that's 0 as well.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.280
Minus 4 plus 4.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.380
18 minus 2 times 9, that's 18
minus 18, that's also 0.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.870
Almost there.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.660
Now let's just replace the first
row with the first row

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.150
divided by 3.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.900
So the second row is going
to stay the same.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.800
And the first row is going to
be 1 minus 2/3, and then we

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.300
get a 3 there.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.280
So if we wanted to rewrite this
is as an equation, we

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.080
would write that the matrix 1
minus 2/3, 0, 0, times the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.420
vector that's in our solution
set, x1, x2, is equal to the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.920
vector 3, 0.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.560
Or another way to say it, the
second row gives us no real

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.950
constraint, so we don't have
to pay attention to it.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.930
The first row tells us that
x1 minus 2/3, times

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.120
x2 is equal to 3.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.120
Or, that x1 is equal
to 3, plus 2/3 x2.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.320
Let's do the same
exercise here.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.790
If we say that x2 is equal
to t, then x1 is

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.570
equal to 3 plus 2/3t.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.140
Or we could say that the
solution set to Ax is equal to

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:08.450
b is equal to the set of all x1,
x2's that are equal to--

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:15.010
let's see, x1 is equal to 3 plus
2/3, so plus t times 2/3.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.770
Let's write it like that.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.300
So plus right there.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.900
And x2 is just equal to t, so
let's just go 1 times t plus,

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.660
well let's just say 0.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.330
So that's our solution
set right there.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.060
And you might immediately
recognize that it's some

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.185
particular solution plus some
scaled up version of our null

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:40.490
space right there.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.690
That's our solution set.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.620
I could do that same
substitution

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.950
that we did over here.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.990
I could say that let's replace
t with 3c, and so we could

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.980
rewrite this as being equal to--
let's rewrite it neatly--

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.750
x1, x2 is equal to the vector--
I'm going to run out

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.140
of space-- 3, 0, plus c, times--
let me scroll over a

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:14.390
little bit-- plus c, times the
vector, 3 times 2/3 is 2, 3

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.640
times 1 is 3.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.365
So it's equal to the vector 3, 0
plus some member of our null

00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:23.060
space, right?

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.410
The null space was the span
of 2, 3, or all the scalar

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.380
multiples of our null space.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.060
And this is where c is
any real number.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.540
So that's our solution set.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.140
That's our null space.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.160
Now, one other thing that might
be of interest, just

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.540
because it's the orthogonal
complement to the null space,

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.540
and this relates to what we were
doing in the last video,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.970
is what the row space of A is.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.130
So the row space of
A is just the

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.000
column space of A transpose.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.230
This is the row space.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.540
This is the row space of A.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.700
And what is this equal to?

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:59.510
This is equal to the span
of the row vectors of A.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:09.560
So we have 3 minus 2, and
we have 6 minus 4.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.170
But this guy is just 2 times
that vector right there, so we

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.950
can just ignore it.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:23.690
So it's just the span of
the vector 3 minus 2.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.950
Now let's graph all of these.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.200
So we have the row space, we
have the solution set and we

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.040
have the null space.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.100
Let's see if we can graph it.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.190
We can make a reasonable graph
of this thing right here.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.309
So I have my vertical
axis right there.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:47.780
I have my horizontal
axis right there.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.820
Now what does the null
space look like?

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.310
It's all the multiples
of 2, 3.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:59.800
So if I go out 1, 2 and then I
go up 1, 2, 3, the vector 2, 3

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.970
looks like this in the
standard position.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.975
And the null space is all of
the multiples of this.

00:09:05.975 --> 00:09:07.890
So, all the multiples of that.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.290
So if you do all the multiples
of that, you get a line that

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.156
looks something like this.

00:09:12.156 --> 00:09:15.400
If you do all the multiples of
that vector, you get a bunch

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.740
of vectors that point to
every point on this

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.910
green line right there.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:23.440
So that right there is
the null space of A.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.250
Now what is the solution set?

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.610
The solution set is
the vector 3, 0.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.540
So it is the vector
3, 0, so 1, 2, 3.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.070
So it is the vector 3 , 0, plus

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.430
members of the null space.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.090
So if you take any of these --
let's say if you add 2, 3-- 2,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.160
3 would look like this.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.100
But you're adding any
multiple of 2, 3.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.690
So when you add all the
different multiples of 2, 3,

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.850
you get this line right here.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.020
It's shifted, essentially,
by that vector 3, 0.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.630
So this right here is
the solution set.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:04.320
So solution to Ax
is equal to b.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.350
That's the solution
set right there.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.510
Now, what's our row space?

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.520
The row space is all of
the multiples of the

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.700
vector 3 minus 2.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.610
So what does 3 minus
2 look like?

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.940
The vector 3 minus 2, we go 1,
2, 3, and then we go down 2.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:24.150
So you go 1, 2, and it's going
to look like this.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.760
That's going to look something
like this, and then if you

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.920
were to graph it and you can
see, well, it's going to look

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.230
something like-- I want to do it
relatively neatly-- so it's

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.280
going to look something
like this.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.420
Let me do it in another
color actually.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.700
It's going to look like
that right-- I can't

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.090
do it at all straight.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.850
Oh, this is horrible.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.570
Something about the bottom right
hand side of my-- that's

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.760
a pretty decent attempt.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.400
So that right there
is my row space.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.470
Because if you have 3 minus 2
you get roughly to that point,

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.840
and then you want all
of the multiples of

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.160
that vector, right?

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.450
3 minus 2, if you multiplied it
by minus 1, you would get

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.580
the vector minus 3, 2, so
it would look like this.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.160
It would be minus 3, 2.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.100
It would look like this, 1, 2,
3 and then up 2, it would be

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.820
like that, so all of the scalar

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.160
multiples of that as well.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.050
That is our column space,.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.050
And notice-- I'm sorry that is
our row space-- and notice

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.940
that our row space is orthogonal
to our null space.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.830
Now this is a nice visual
representation of everything

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.150
we can do essentially with this
matrix right here, which

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.900
is our matrix A.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.170
But in the last video, we had
a very interesting result.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.310
We had a very interesting
result.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.120
We said that if we have some
b-- let me do it in a new

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.840
color-- we found out that if we
had some b that is a member

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:05.450
of the column space of A, then
the solution with the smallest

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:10.930
length, or we can say the
smallest, or the shortest

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:28.700
solution to Ax is equal to b is
a unique member of the row

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.570
space of A.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.310
Now let's see, this is our big
takeaway from the last video.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.410
And it might have seemed
a little hard

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:38.960
to visualize before.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.900
But now that we have graphed
it all out, I think we can

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.110
visualize it.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.920
This blue line right here
is a solution set.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.510
The row space right here is this
line that's perpendicular

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.340
to the solution set.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:57.600
But notice, one of the vectors
on it is both pointing to

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.300
something, pointing to a
position on the solution set,

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.110
and it is in my row space.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.760
This vector right here, that
I'm doing in a bold green,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.870
That vector right there, we
could call that vector r,

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.220
because that vector is both a
member of my row space, right?

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.990
It points-- if you do it as a
position vector, it points to

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.300
a point on the line that
represents our row space.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.230
All of the members of our
row space point to

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.990
points on this line.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.240
But at the same time, it also
points to a point right there

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.440
that is a member of
our solution set.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.470
And notice, it is the only
vector in our row space that

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.820
points to a point that is a
member of our solution set.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.120
And if you just look at it
from a geometric point of

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.880
view, all of the other solutions
point to all of the

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.860
other points on that line.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.490
So, that's a solution right
there, this is a solution

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.850
right there, that is a
solution right there.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.300
All of the vectors that point
to things on this solution

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.790
line right there, there's
all solutions.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.940
But the very shortest one
is this green one.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.540
This green one is essentially
orthogonal to it because it's

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.080
a member of the row space.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.000
And this essentially has the
same slope as our null space.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
It's orthogonal, so it's kind of
the shortest path distance

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.800
to getting to our
solution set.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.580
And for this exact example, we
can actually figure out what

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.480
this shortest vector r is.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.280
We've got the vector 3,
0, over here, right?

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.730
The vector 3, 0 is this
vector right here.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.690
So if you take 3, 0 minus your
vector-- so let me say r.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.010
Let me write this way.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.600
Our vector r, the special
shortest solution, it's going

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.570
to be a member of our
column space.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.585
Our column space is a
span of 3 minus 2.

00:14:39.585 --> 00:14:42.180
So it's going to be equal
to some scalar

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.440
multiple of 3 minus 2.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:52.570
Now, we know that 3, 0 points
to another solution on our

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:53.750
solution set.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.970
But we know that if we take the
difference of these two

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:03.080
vectors-- if I take 3, 0 and
from that I subtract the

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.990
vector r, what do I get?

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.740
I get this vector right there.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.690
Let me do that in
another color.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.310
I get this pink vector
right there.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.300
That pink vector, it's not in a
standard position, but that

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.390
pink vector is going to be a
member of our null space.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.570
That pink vector is going to be
a member of our null space.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.130
So if I take 3, 0.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:30.770
That, minus my r, so minus c,
times 3 minus 2, right?

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.550
That's going to be this pink
vector right there.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.480
So if I were to take the dot
product, so this vector right

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.130
here-- let me make this clear;
that vector is this pink

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.700
vector right there-- that's
in my null space.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.220
I could shift it over.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.700
It's not in standard position
there, but [? I'll have to ?]

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.030
do it in the standard position,
it points to

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.450
something on my null
space line.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.700
So that's in my null space.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.980
So if I were to dot it with any
member of my row space,

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.350
it's going to be equal to 0.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.820
The row space is the orthogonal
complement of the

00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.890
null space.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.750
So let me take the dot product
of that, with some member of

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.140
my row space.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.940
Might as well just take the
basis vector for my row space.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.780
That's a member of
my row space.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.990
So if I dot it with 3-- sorry, I
don't want you to write that

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.430
as a fraction-- 3 minus 2.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.120
If I dot it with 3 minus 2,
that will be equal to 0.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.640
So let's see if we
can solve for c.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.770
So we get, let's see if we do
this, we get this inside part,

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.610
this pink vector right
there is going to

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:32.520
be 3 minus 3c, right?

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.180
And then you're going to
have 0 minus minus 2c,

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.430
so that's just 2c.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.720
So this part right here
simplifies to that.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.280
I just perform the scalar
multiplication and then the

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.360
subtraction.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.530
And then if we dot that with
my basis vector for my row

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:56.530
space, 3 minus 2, this
should be equal to 0.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.690
So what do we get?

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:03.090
We get 3 times 3, which is 9,
minus-- let me see, 3 times

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:10.140
3-- minus 3, or minus 3c times
minus 2-- let me write it this

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.700
way-- plus-- let me
do it this way.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.950
This is probably the easiest
way to do it.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.500
Sorry, I was actually
doing it wrong.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.550
This is the first entry,
so you have 3 minus

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.180
3c, times 3, right?

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.359
3 minus 3c-- the first entry
times the first entry here--

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:34.090
plus 2c, times minus
2, is equal to 0.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.930
I was performing that dot
product in a strange way.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.650
I think I got a little caught
off guard by these two terms.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.980
But anyway, the first term times
the first term, plus the

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.250
second term times
the second term.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.610
That's what our dot
product is.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:46.510
This isn't the matrix.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.320
This is just a first and a
second term right there.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.330
So then what do we have here?

00:17:51.330 --> 00:18:03.430
We have 3 times 3 is 9, minus
9c, minus 4c, is equal to 0.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.190
This is 9 minus 13c
is equal to 0.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:12.870
Or we get 13, let's see, 9
is equal to 13c, or c is

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.710
equal to 9 over 13.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.610
So just like that we've solved
for our special vector r.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:22.680
We said, hey look, if you take
this 3, 0 vector and the

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.620
difference between that and our
vector r, you're going to

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.620
get some vector, right here,
that is in our null space.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.340
And if you take the dot product
of that with some

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.140
member in our row space,
you're going to get 0.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.500
And the dot product is that
entry times that entry, plus

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.670
that entry times that entry.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.030
And so you get c is equal
to 9 over 13.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.700
So our special vector r, the
unique shortest solution to

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:54.140
the equation Ax is equal to 0,
is 9 over 13 times the vector,

00:18:54.140 --> 00:19:00.170
times our basis vector 3 minus
2, or we could write that as

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.160
27 over 13, right?

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:09.530
And then we have 3 times--
and then 2 times 9 is

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.090
minus 18 over 13.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:19.115
And that right there is our
shortest vector in our row

00:19:19.115 --> 00:19:21.520
space that satisfies
this equation.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.300
Let me write it better.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:27.230
It's the unique member of our
row space that also happens to

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.980
be the shortest solution
to Ax is equal to b.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.430
So this is an example of what
we talked about in the last

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:37.680
video, and hopefully you see
visually why this is so.
