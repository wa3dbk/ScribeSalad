00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.990
In this video we're going to do
a couple of examples that

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.180
deal with parallel and
perpendicular lines.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.960
So you have parallel, you have
perpendicular, and, of course,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.129
you have lines that are
neither parallel nor

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.950
perpendicular.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.120
And just as a bit of review,
if you've never seen this

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.510
before, parallel lines,
they never intersect.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.170
So let me draw some axes.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.810
So if those are my coordinate
axes right there, that's my

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.360
x-axis, that is my y-axis.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.070
If this is a line that I'm
drawing in magenta, a parallel

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.480
line might look something
like this.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.710
It's not the exact same
line, but they have

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.530
the exact same slope.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.150
If this moves a certain amount,
if this change in y

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.070
over change in x is a certain
amount, this change in y over

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.000
change in x is the
same amount.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.620
And that's why they
never intersect.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.030
So they have the same slope.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.290
Parallel lines have
the same slope.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.990
Perpendicular lines, depending
on how you want to view it,

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.640
they're kind of the opposite.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.610
Let's say that this
is some line.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300
A line that is perpendicular
to that will not only

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.340
intersect the line, it will
intersect it at a right angle,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.860
at a 90 degree angle.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.420
And I'm not going to prove
it for you here.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.270
I actually prove it in the
linear algebra playlist. But a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.410
perpendicular line's slope--
so let's say that this one

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.110
right here, let's say that
yellow line has a slope of m.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.940
Then this orange line, that's
perpendicular to the yellow

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.000
line, is going to have a slope
of negative 1 over m.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.310
Their slopes are going
to be the negative

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.690
inverse of each other.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.410
Now, given this information,
let's look at a bunch of lines

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.600
and figure out if they're
parallel, if they're

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.980
perpendicular, or if
they are neither.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.570
And to do that, we just have to
keep looking at the slopes.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.690
So let's see, they say one
line passes through the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.310
points, 4, negative 3,
and negative 8, 0.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.039
Another line passes through
the points, negative 1,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.670
negative 1, and negative 2, 6.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.720
So let's figure out the slopes
of each of these lines.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.680
So I'll first do this
one in pink.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.700
So this slope right here,
so line 1, so I'll

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.790
call it slope 1.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.780
Slope 1 is, let's just say it
is-- well, I'll take this as

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.590
the finishing point.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.000
So negative 3 minus 0--
remember change in y--

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.130
negative 3 minus 0, over
4 minus negative 8.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.250
So this is equal to negative 3
over-- this is the same thing

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.180
as 4 plus 8-- negative
3 over 12, which is

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.220
equal to negative 1/4.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.750
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 3.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.610
That's this line.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.760
That's the first line.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.870
Now, what about the
second line?

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.180
The slope for that second line
is, well, let's take, here,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:16.780
negative 1 minus 6, over
negative 1 minus negative 2 is

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.230
equal to-- negative 1 minus 6 is
negative 7, over negative 1

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.620
minus negative 2.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.750
That's the same thing as
negative 1 plus 2.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.250
Well, that's just 1.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.300
So the slope here
is negative 7.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.410
So here, their slopes are
neither equal-- so they're not

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.390
parallel-- nor are
they the negative

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.440
inverse of each other.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.180
So this is neither.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.020
This is neither parallel
nor perpendicular.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.350
So these two lines, they
intersect, but they're not

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.740
going to intersect at
a 90 degree angle.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.210
Let's do a couple
more of these.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.540
So I have here, once again, one
line passing through these

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.330
points, and then another line
passing through these points.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.770
So let's just look
at their slopes.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.010
So this one in the green,
what's the slope?

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.012
The slope of the green one, I'll
call that the first line.

00:04:14.012 --> 00:04:16.329
We could say, let's
see, change in y.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.030
So we could do negative 2
minus 14, over-- I did

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.120
negative 2 first, so I'll
do 1 first-- over 1

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.090
minus negative 3.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.140
So negative 2 minus
14 is negative 16.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.200
1 minus negative 3 is the
same things as 1 plus 3.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.460
That's over 4.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.000
So this is negative 4.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.610
Now, what's the slope of that
second line right there?

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.420
So we have the slope of
that second line.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:57.070
Let's say 5 minus negative 3,
that's our change in y, over

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.490
negative 2 minus 0.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.330
So this is equal to 5
minus negative 3.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.540
That's the same thing
as 5 plus 3.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.210
That's 8.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.460
And then negative 2 minus
0 is negative 2.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.700
So this is also equal
to negative 4.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.280
So these two lines
are parallel.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.660
They have the exact
same slope.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.890
And I encourage you to find the
equations of both of these

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.790
lines and graph both of these
lines, and verify for yourself

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.060
that they are indeed parallel.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.750
Let's do this one.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.210
Once again, this is just an
exercise in finding slope.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.190
So this first line
has those points.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.080
Let's figure out its slope.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.480
The slope of this first
line, one line passes

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.720
through these points.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.480
So let's see, 3 minus negative
3, that's our change in y,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.240
over 3 minus negative 6.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.000
So this is the same thing as 3
plus 3, which is 6, over 3

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.120
plus 6, which is 9.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.300
So this first line has
a slope of 2/3.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.590
What is the second
line's slope?

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.230
This was the second line there,
that's the other line

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.890
passing through these points.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.550
So the other line's slope,
let's see, we could say

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:27.340
negative 8 minus 4, over
2 minus negative 6.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.720
So what is this equal to?

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.150
Negative 8 minus 4
is negative 12.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.140
2 minus negative 6, that's the
same thing as 2 plus 6.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.610
The negatives cancel out.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.260
So it's negative 12 over 8,
which is the same thing if we

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.070
divide the numerator and the
denominator by 4, that's

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.320
negative 3/2.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.120
Notice, these guys
are the negative

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.740
inverse of each other.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.850
If I take negative 1 over 2/3,
that is equal to negative 1

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.870
times 3/2, which is equal
to negative 3/2.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.350
These guys are the negative
inverses of each other.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.300
You swap the numerator and the
denominator, make them

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.430
negative, and they become
equal to each other.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.580
So these two lines are
perpendicular.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.150
And I encourage you to find the
equations-- I already got

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.560
the slopes for you-- but find
the equations of both of these

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.090
lines, plot them, and verify
for yourself that they are

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.620
perpendicular.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.580
Let's do one more.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.890
Find the equation of a line
perpendicular to this line

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.590
that passes through the
point 2 comma 8.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.440
So this first piece of
information, that it's

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.650
perpendicular to that line right
over there, what does

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.810
that tell us?

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.330
Well, if it's perpendicular to
this line, its slope has to be

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.950
the negative inverse of 2/5.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.920
So its slope, the negative
inverse of 2/5, the inverse of

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.510
2/5 is-- let me do it in a
better color, a nicer green.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.870
If this line's slope is negative
2/5, the equation of

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.610
the line we have to figure out
that's perpendicular, its

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.970
slope is going to
be the inverse.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.180
So instead of 2/5, it's
going to be 5/2.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.580
Instead of being a negative,
it's going to be a positive.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.170
So this is a negative inverse
of negative 2/5.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:11.580
Right?

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.240
You take the negative sign
and it becomes positive.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.690
You swap the 5 and the
2, you get 5/2.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.600
So that is going to have
to be our slope.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.430
And we can actually use the
point-slope form right here.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.850
It goes through this
point right there.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.580
So let's use point-slope form.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.220
y minus this y-value, which
has to be on the line, is

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:38.880
equal to our slope, 5/2 times
x minus this x-value, the

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.220
x-value when y is equal to 8.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.740
And this is the equation of the
line in point-slope form.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.940
If you want to put it in
slope-intercept form, you can

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.960
just do a little bit of
algebra, algebraic

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.910
manipulation. y minus 8 is equal
to-- let's distribute

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:59.960
the 5/2-- so 5/2 x minus--
5/2 times 2 is just-- 5.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.570
And then add 8 to both sides.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.900
You get y is equal to 5/2x.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.635
Add 8 to negative
5, so plus 3.

00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:12.340
And we are done.
