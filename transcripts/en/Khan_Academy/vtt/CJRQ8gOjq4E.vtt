00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.190
I've pre-drawn some
molecules here.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.370
Let's see if we can use what
we know to name them.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.960
So what do we have?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.660
This first molecule right here,
I have a bunch of rings.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.950
This is a one, two, three, four,
five, six carbon ring.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.700
These are each four carbon
rings: one, two, three, four,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.790
one, two, three, four, so the
largest ring is essentially

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.530
going to be our backbone.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.450
It's going to be this six-carbon
ring right here:

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.650
one, two, three, four,
five, six carbons.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.410
That is a cyclohexane,
all double bonds.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.000
That's where we get the -ane,
six carbons hex-, it's in a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.870
cycle, cyclo-, and then
we have two of

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.740
these four-carbon rings.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.790
So four carbons, we're dealing
with the prefix

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.520
but-, but- for four.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.155
We've got two of them, so both
of these are butyl groups.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.070
But they're in a cycle,
so they're

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.810
actually cyclobutyl groups.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.740
We have two things attached
to this ring right there.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440
If we only had one thing
attached to it, you wouldn't

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.120
have to number it.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.710
But when you have two
things, you start

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.280
numbering at one of them.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.690
Let's say we start numbering
here, and you go in the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.200
direction so that the next group
has the lowest number.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.140
So in this case, you
want to go in the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.400
counterclockwise direction.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340
If we went this way, it
would be one, two,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.700
three, four, five.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.530
This guy would be a five.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.790
If we go in the
counterclockwise, it would be

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.080
one, two, three.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.160
This guy will only be a three.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.420
So this right here, we have
two cyclobutyls, so it's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.670
dicyclobutyl.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.760
We have two of them and
they are at the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.520
one and three positions.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.210
So at the one and three
position, I have two

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.110
cyclobutyls on my cyclohexane
main ring.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.880
Let's try this one right here.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.390
I have a five-carbon ring, one,
two, three, four, five

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.330
right there, and then I have a
one, two, three, four, five,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.930
six-carbon ring right there,
so this is going

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.960
to be the main ring.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.210
That is a cyclohexane.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.850
It has six carbons on them in
a cycle, all single bonds.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.930
Attached to that, I
have a cyclopentyl

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.340
group, -yl for the group.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.260
This is a cyclopentyl
group on it.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.270
We don't have to number it
because it's only one group

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.250
attached to the main ring.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.140
If there was another group, we
would have to number it like

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.310
we did up here.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.540
This is cyclopentyl.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.810
That's this part right here.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.790
Cyclopentyl attached
to cyclohexane:

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.040
cyclopentylcyclohexane.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.180
Let's try this one over here.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.630
The first thing we want to do,
there's no cycles here, but we

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.590
have to identify the
longest chain.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.040
To do that, let's just
count it out.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.110
It could be one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.520
That's not the longest chain.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.430
Maybe it's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.510
That looks like the longest
chain, so let's make that the

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.670
longest chain.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.940
Let's make that the longest
chain right over there.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.720
We want to start numbering in
the direction so we encounter

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.910
the first attached groups first.
We do want to start

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.900
numbering down here, because we
have groups attached right

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.650
on the two carbon.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.710
If we started over here, we'd
have to go pretty far until

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.040
something's attached.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.870
So we go one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.970
seven.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:42.840
eight.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.910
We know we're dealing with an
octane, all single bonds.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.190
It's not a cyclooctane.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.790
It's not in a cycle,
so we know we're

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.040
dealing with an octane.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.730
Now we just have to add
the groups to it.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.540
So what do we have here?

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.170
This right here is
just one carbon

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.170
attached to the main chain.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.780
This is another carbon attached
to the main chain.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.500
Both of these right here
are methyl groups.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.410
Meth- is for one carbon.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.890
Those are methyl groups.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:13.730
If you look at all of
them, these are

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.650
the only methyl groups.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.820
These two up here aren't methyl
groups, so we have two

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.529
methyl groups on our
entire chain, so

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.860
it's going to be dimethyl.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.940
Both of the methyl groups our
at our two position, so this

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.820
is going to be 2,2-dimethyl.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.820
This part right here is 2,2.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.970
That right there is
2,2-dimethyl.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.390
We're going to decide what order
to write it after we

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.360
figure out what these are called
because it has to be in

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.780
alphabetical order.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.140
This is 2,2-dimethyl.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.490
The whole chain is an octane.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.100
What are these over here?

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.470
How many carbons do
we have here?

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.800
One, two, three.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.670
They actually look the same.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.990
We have one, two, three here.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.070
We have one, two, three
there, so these

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.550
are both propyl groups.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.600
If we deal with common names,
this is kind of that Y shape.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.920
You could call it sec-propyl
because this carbon right here

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.480
that's attached to the main
chain is attached

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.820
to two other carbons.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.730
But the more common one, because
it forms this Y shape,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.980
is isopropyl.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.600
We have two isopropyl groups.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.970
These are both isopropyl.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.850
We would have diisopropyl.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.890
They're occurring at the four
and five positions, two

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.370
isopropyls at four and five.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.620
This is 4,5-diisopropyl.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.880
That's that group and that
group right there are

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.010
accounted for with this.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.780
Now we have to just figure out
the order that we write it in.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.360
You ignore the di- or the tri-
out front and you just look at

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.580
them in alphabetical order.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.570
We have an I for isopropyl.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.410
We have an M for methyl.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.420
Let's write the isopropyl first.
I've actually seen some

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.110
people want to go for the p, but
the main thing I ignore is

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.940
just the di- or the tri- in
front of the isopropyl.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.950
You shouldn't involve that.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.110
But everything after that,
you do involve.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.170
So I'll write the isopropyl
first. I comes before M, so

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.590
this is going to be-- if we were
going to write the whole

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:32.890
thing, this is going to be
4,5-diisopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.320
Actually, this should
be a comma here.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.570
4,5-diisopropyl-
2,2-dimethyloctane.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.580
And we're done.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.800
But this was just
the common name.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.480
You might remember that when we
deal with iso- or sec- or

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.400
tert- butyl or propyl, that's
the common name.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.840
If we want the systematic name,
we can start at where we

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.730
are attached to the main chain
and view that as one and then

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.230
make the longest chain
with that as one.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.680
And so you could say that we
have a chain there and this

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.750
would be both of these cases.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.950
So this is one, two carbons.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.530
Two carbons, we're dealing
with an ethyl.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.520
And on the first carbon, you
have a methyl attached to it.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:37.230
So you could also call each of
these groups a 1-methylethyl

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.060
instead of an isopropyl.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.550
So you can either say isopropyl
for each of these

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.470
groups or you could call each
of them a methylethyl if you

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.850
do systematic naming.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.320
We have two of these
1-methylethyl groups, just

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.560
like we had two isopropyl
groups.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.780
If you're using common naming,
you can say diisopropyl to say

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.150
you have two of these groups.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.320
When you're using systematic
naming, you don't say

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.700
di-1-methylethyl, although that
would probably would get

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.650
the point across.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.590
You use bis-.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.560
Since we have two of them,
instead of writing di-, you

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.450
write bis-.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.940
You write bis-(1-methylethyl)
That means you have two of

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.100
these things right there, and
it's still in the four and the

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.710
five position.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.410
If you look at it in
alphabetical order now,

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.180
methylethyl comes after
methyl, right?

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.610
So the order will now change.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.799
So now if you want to write it
with systematic naming, it

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.320
would be written as
2,2-dimethyl.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.950
That's these two guys.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.710
2,2-dimethylethyl, then you
would write this guy, so the

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.640
order changed for the two
groups just based on how

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.680
they're named.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:56.980
Bis-, and then over here you
have two 1-methylethyl groups.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.810
I know it's confusing, but when
you just break it down,

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.090
it actually makes a reasonable
amount of sense.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.100
You have two of these
methylethyl groups.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.170
Oh, sorry, I forgot where
they're located.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.340
So we have them at the four and
five position, so in the

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:20.810
four and five position,
we have two, so

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:27.345
bis-(1methylethyl) groups.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.220
I know it's a little daunting
now, but it all makes sense

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.470
when you break it down.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.780
And then we can just add
the octane at the end.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.590
Let me scroll over to the
right a little bit.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.430
Octane, and we're done..

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.113
Now this might seem more
confusing, but when you break

00:09:47.113 --> 00:09:47.680
it down, it makes sense.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.680
We have octane as
the backbone.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.240
We have two methyls.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.255
They're both sitting on
the two position.

00:09:54.255 --> 00:09:57.300
So you have two methyls sitting
on the two position,

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.180
and then you have two
1-methylethyl groups sitting

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.560
at the four and five
positions.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.910
So in the four and five
position, 1-methylethyl.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.230
You have an ethyl, and in the
one position you have a

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.720
methyl, so that's
all it's saying.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.870
Or another way to think about
it, just in case this doesn't

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.590
confuse you enough, you could
call it that, or you could say

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.840
4,5-diisopropyl.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.950
these two things are the same
thing: common naming,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:22.670
systematic.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.160
Hopefully, you found
that useful.
