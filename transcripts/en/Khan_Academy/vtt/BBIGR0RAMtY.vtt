00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.280
I've drawn a bunch of titration
curves here.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.220
So let's see if we can review
everything we've learned to

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.830
kind of have a more holistic
understanding of interpreting

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.760
these things.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.340
So the first thing to look at
is which of these are the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.790
titration of acids
versus bases?

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.740
And everything I've done now
is acids, but the logic for

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.700
base titration is the exact
same thing as acid.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.360
So for example, these
are acid titrations.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.970
We start with low pH's.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.290
In all of these, this
axis is pH.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.820
I should have drawn that ahead
of time before I asked you the

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.100
question, but I think you
knew that already.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.320
So before we add any of the
titrator or the reagent, in

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.490
this reaction, we're starting
with a low pH.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.940
So this is kind of our
starting point.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.310
So we have a low pH there.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.610
We have a low pH there.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.740
So these are both
clearly acids.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.670
Here, our starting point before
we start titrating at

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.680
all, it's a high pH.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.580
So both of these are bases.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.830
Let me write that down.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.080
These are clearly both bases.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.870
Base titration, and this
is an acid titration.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.700
Now, we haven't covered bases.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.820
But it's the same exact idea.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.380
In an acid titration, you start
with an acid and you add

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.030
a strong base to it to sop up
all of the acid until all of

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.110
the acid is sopped up and you
hit the equivalence point.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.630
You hit the point that all
of the acid is sopped up.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.220
And now, as you add more and
more strong base, you're

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.970
making it superbasic.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.400
So in this acid,
our equivalence

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.700
point is over here.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.170
And in this acid,
our equivalence

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.570
point is over here.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.570
This is how much solution
we had to add to sop

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.870
up all of the acid.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.630
Right there.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.060
So given what we already know,
which one's a strong acid,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.560
which one's a weak acid?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.530
Well, this one, when sopped up
all of the acid, we have a

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.090
completely neutral solution.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.010
So this must have been
a strong acid.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.900
There's nothing left.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.090
Everything has been converted to
water in its natural state.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.860
pH of 7.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.620
And we might have had some
neutral leftover conjugate

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.440
bases there.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.780
But since it was a strong acid,
those conjugate bases

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.760
don't do anything.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.780
They don't add anything
to the pH.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.389
They're not really basic.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:15.440
The chlorine in hydrogen
chloride, the chlorine ion,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.050
doesn't change the pH.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.890
So this is a strong acid.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.210
And this one, when we got to the
equivalence point-- when

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.840
we had used up all of the acid
in a solution, and then we hit

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.780
this in inflection point, where
any OH we added was

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.070
significantly increasing the
pH-- when we hit that

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.750
equivalence point, our
pH was already basic.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.030
And that's because we had all
of the conjugate base of the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.480
weak acid, which does make
the solution more basic.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.380
So this is a weak acid.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.590
And in both of these situations,
we were increasing

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.420
the concentration of OH minus.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.480
Maybe by adding sodium hydroxide
to the solution, a

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.750
strong base.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.680
Now, In these situations, we
start with a base, and we add

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.500
a strong acid to it.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.540
Maybe whatever base.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.800
We're adding hydrogen chloride,
something that will

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.240
sop up the OH.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.210
Here, we want to sop up the OH
and bring its concentration

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.800
down, until some point that we
have sopped up all of the OH.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.640
All of the base is gone.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.350
Or most of it is gone.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.530
In this situation, we're in a
completely neutral situation.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.940
So when we sopped up
all of the base,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.340
we're completely neutral.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.500
No basic conjugate bases left.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.720
So this is a strong base.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.420
And here, the titration, we're
increasing the hydrogen

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.480
solution, or the hydrogen
concentration, to

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.950
sop up all the base.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.790
Same thing here.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.000
We're sopping up all
of the base.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.040
We start over here.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.590
But over here, the inflection
point happens right over here.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.530
So we've sopped up all of its
base, but some of its

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.640
conjugate acid is still left
over, even after we've sopped

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.220
up all of its base.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.810
So we end up with a slightly
negative pH at

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.750
the equivalence point.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.600
So this is a weak base.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.470
Let me actually draw that
reaction for you.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.230
Remember, a weak base looks
something like this.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.390
Maybe its A minus is in
equilibrium-- that second

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.500
equilibrium arrow is a little
too wild for my blood-- is

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.610
equilibrium with AH.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.140
It grabs hydrogen ions from
the surrounding water.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.040
Everything is in an
aqueous solution.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.190
So after you add hydrochloric
acid to this-- remember, HcL

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.080
disassociates completely
into hydrogen ions

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.440
plus chlorine anions.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.370
If you add hydrochloric acid
to this, these things are

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.300
going to just completely
sop up these things.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.240
So we keep sopping
up those things.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.840
Our concentration of OH goes
down and down and down.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.000
And as we sop up this, our
reaction goes in that

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.560
direction because Le Chatelier's
Principle.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.030
More and more of this is
going to get formed

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.490
into this and that.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.950
Until some point, we're out
of that, and we have

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.510
a ton of this left.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.950
And so our equivalent point is
when we're out of this stuff.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.770
And when we're adding more
hydrogens, we're getting

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.080
really acidic really fast. But
we have a lot of the conjugate

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.130
acid there in the solution
already.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.330
So we're going to have an acidic
equivalence point.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.460
Now, let me give you an actual
problem, just to hit all the

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.040
points home.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.920
Because everything I've done now
has been very hand-wavey,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.500
and no numbers.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.510
So let me draw one.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.310
Let me draw a weak acid.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.170
And you'll recognize
it because you're

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.920
good at this now.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.620
But I'll deal with some
real numbers here.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.810
So let's say that's a pH of 7.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.580
We're going to titrate it.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.130
It starts off at a low pH
because it's a weak acid.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.320
And as we titrate it,
it's pH goes up.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.995
And then it hits the equivalence
point and

00:05:44.995 --> 00:05:46.470
it goes like that.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.730
The equivalence point
is right over here.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.460
And let's say our reagent
that we were

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.520
adding is sodium hydroxide.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.130
And let's say it's a
0.2 molar solution.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.630
I've been using too
round numbers.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.870
I'll use 700 milliliters of
sodium hydroxide is our

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.250
equivalence point.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.250
Right there.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.550
So the first question
is how much of our

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.220
weak acid did we have?

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.300
So what was our original

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.670
concentration of our weak acid?

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.660
This is just a general
placeholder for the acid.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.930
So original concentration
of our weak acid.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.150
Well, we must have added enough
moles of OH at the

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.600
equivalent point to cancel out
all of the moles of the weak

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.020
acid in whatever hydrogen
was out there.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.490
But the main concentration
was from the weak acid.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.780
This 700 milliliters of our
reagent must have the same

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.920
number of moles as the number
of moles of weak acid we

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.610
started off with.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.990
And let's say our solution at
the beginning was 3 liters.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.860
3 liters to begin with, before
we started titrating.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.490
Obviously, as we add reagent,
we're adding some volume to

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.000
the solution.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.580
But let's just say that
in the beginning, we

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.470
started with 3 liters.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.990
So how many moles have
we sopped up?

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.505
Well, how many moles of OH are
there in 700 milliliters of

00:07:17.505 --> 00:07:19.200
our solution?

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:32.170
Well, we know that we have 0.2
moles per liter of OH.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.450
And then we know that
we don't have--

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:39.020
times 0.7 liters, right?

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.620
700 milliliters is 0.7 liters.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.540
So how many moles have we
added to the situation?

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.780
Let's see.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.570
2 times 7 is 14.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.060
And we have 2 numbers
behind the decimal.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.660
So it's 0.14.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:57.470
So 700 milliliters of 0.2 molar
sodium hydroxide, and we

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.710
have 700 milliliters of
it, or 0.7 liters.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:06.950
We're going to have 0.14 moles
of, essentially, OH that we

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.850
put into the solution, which
means that it canceled out

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.770
completely with the same
number of moles of our

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.060
original acid.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.620
So that means that the original
concentration of our

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:29.200
acid is equal to 0.14 moles.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.110
That's how many moles we had.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.490
And we know that our original
solution before we started

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.500
titrating at all, is 3 liters.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.049
Remember, the molecules
are canceling

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.250
directly with each other.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.750
So that's why I wanted to figure
out how many actual

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.530
atoms, or molecules,
of OH did I add.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.910
Those canceled out with the
exact same number of atoms of

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.930
out weak acid.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.130
And so this is how many atoms or
molecules of our weak acid

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.690
we must have started off with.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.240
And so you divide that by the
number of liters, and then you

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.940
have your original molarity.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:05.070
So 0.14 divided by 3.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.270
0.046.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.840
So you're initial concentration
of the mystery

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.370
acid was 0.046 molar.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.550
Fair enough.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.960
Now, the other question
is, what is the pKa

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.210
of our mystery acid?

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.290
Well, we just go to the half
equivalence point.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:32.740
So we said, OK.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.830
What was the pH of
our titration

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.970
curve or of our solution?

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.300
We were at the half
equivalence point.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:46.260
So when we had only added 350
milliliters of our reagent, of

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.310
our strong base, to
the solution.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.670
So you go there, and you
say OK, the pH was 5.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.410
pH is equal to 5.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.470
And we know, from the last
video, that if you take this

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:04.440
half equivalence point, the pH
is equal to the pKa, the

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.080
negative log of our equilibrium
constant.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.800
So there.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.590
We figured out the equilibrium
constant as well.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.970
It's equal to 5.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.430
So all of this titration curve
and all of this, I'm just

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.460
showing you how experimentally,
you can take

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.340
some mystery acid or base.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.600
You add strong acid
or base to it.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.770
You plot out this curve.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.620
And then you can pinpoint some
of the properties, the

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.150
concentration of your original
acid or base.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.550
And only if you're dealing with
a weak acid or base, you

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.410
can figure out it's equilibrium
constant.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.900
Obviously, if you take a strong
acid, you say, oh, my

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.210
half equivalence
point is here.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.530
So therefore, this must be the
equilibrium or the pKa-- No.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.610
There is no equilibrium constant
for a strong acid.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.290
And there is no equilibrium
constant for a strong base,

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.180
because they're not
in equilibrium.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.910
They disassociate completely.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.460
Anyway, hopefully you have
a good understanding of

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.250
titration now.
