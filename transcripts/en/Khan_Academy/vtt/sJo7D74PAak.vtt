00:00:00.507 --> 00:00:01.360
- [Voiceover] Hey everyone.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.583
So in the last video I introduced

00:00:02.583 --> 00:00:05.109
this thing called the second
partial derivative test,

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.307
and if you have some kind
of multivariable function

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:08.971
or really just a two variable function

00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:10.639
is what this applies to, something that's

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.836
f of x, y and it outputs a number.

00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:14.300
When you're looking
for places where it has

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.863
a local maximum or a local
minimum, the first step,

00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:18.733
as I talked about a few videos ago,

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.541
is to find where the gradient equals zero

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.844
and sometimes you'll hear these called

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:24.431
critical points or stable points,

00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:26.873
but inputs where the gradient equals zero

00:00:26.873 --> 00:00:28.504
and that's really just a way of compactly

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:29.970
writing the fact that all the partial

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.923
derivatives are equal to zero.

00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:33.507
Now when you find a point like this,

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:35.665
in order to test whether
it's a local maximum

00:00:35.665 --> 00:00:37.579
or a local minimum or a saddle point

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.570
without actually looking at the graph,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.482
'cause you don't always have the ability

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:43.880
to do that at your
disposal, the first step

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.155
is to compute this long value,

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:48.437
and this is the thing I
wanna give intuition behind.

00:00:48.437 --> 00:00:50.920
Where you take all three
second partial derivatives,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.750
the second partial
derivative with respect to x,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.233
the second partial
derivative with respect to y

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:56.860
and the mixed partial derivative

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.286
where first you do it with respect to x,

00:00:58.286 --> 00:01:00.559
then you do it with respect to y.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.228
And you compute this
value where you evaluate

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.544
each one of those at your critical point

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:07.714
and you multiply the two pure
second partial derivatives

00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:09.661
and then subtract off the square

00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:11.286
of the mixed partial derivative

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:13.077
and again, I'll give intuition
for that in a reason,

00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:14.459
but right now we just kinda take it,

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.283
oh, alright, I guess
you compute this number

00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:19.285
and if that value H, if that value H

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:21.971
is greater than zero, what it tells you,

00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:24.003
what it tells you is
that you definitely have

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.273
either a maximum or a minimum.

00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:30.100
So you definitely have either
a maximum or a minimum.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.049
And then to determine which one

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.776
you just have to look at the
concavity in one direction.

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:36.520
So you'll look at the
second partial derivative

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.268
with respect to x for example,

00:01:38.268 --> 00:01:40.019
and if that was positive
that would tell you

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:41.322
when you look in the x direction

00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:43.191
there's a positive
concavity, if it was negative

00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:45.550
it would mean a negative concavity.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.054
And so that means a positive value

00:01:47.054 --> 00:01:48.353
for that second partial derivative

00:01:48.353 --> 00:01:50.505
would mean a local minimum
and a negative value

00:01:50.505 --> 00:01:52.170
would mean a local maximum.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.339
So that's what it means if this value H

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:57.257
turns out to be greater than zero.

00:01:57.257 --> 00:02:00.383
And if this value H turns
out to be less than zero,

00:02:00.383 --> 00:02:02.375
strictly less than zero,
then you definitely

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:05.208
have a saddle point, saddle point.

00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:08.498
Which is neither a maximum, nor a minimum.

00:02:08.498 --> 00:02:10.239
It's kind of like there's disagreement

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.164
in different directions over whether

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:14.389
it should be a maximum or a minimum.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.238
And if H equals zero, the
test isn't good enough.

00:02:17.238 --> 00:02:20.901
You would have to do something
else to figure it out.

00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:21.962
So why does this work?

00:02:21.962 --> 00:02:24.237
Why does this seemingly
random conglomeration

00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:26.882
of second partial
derivatives give you a test

00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:28.466
that let's you determine what type

00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:30.332
of stable point you're looking at?

00:02:30.332 --> 00:02:32.366
Well let's just understand
each term individually.

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:34.932
So this second partial
derivative with respect to x,

00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:36.760
since you're taking
both partial derivatives

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.916
with respect to x,
you're basically treating

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:41.236
the entire multivariable function as if x

00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:44.369
is the only variable and
y was just some constant.

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:45.669
So it's like you're only looking at

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.212
movement in the x direction.

00:02:47.212 --> 00:02:49.362
So in terms of a graph,
let's say we've got like,

00:02:49.362 --> 00:02:52.088
this graph here, you
can imagine slicing this

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.879
with a plane that represents movement

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.580
purely in the x direction, so that'll be

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.542
a constant y value slice,
and you take a look

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:01.473
at the curve where this
slice intersects your graph.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:02.980
And in the one that I have pictured here

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.420
it looks like it's a positive concavity.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.375
So this term right here kind
of tells you x concavity.

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:13.383
So it's kind of like the,
what is the concavity

00:03:13.383 --> 00:03:15.901
as far as the variable x is concerned.

00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:17.734
And then symmetrically, this over here,

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:19.117
when you take the partial derivative

00:03:19.117 --> 00:03:21.187
with respect to y two times in a row,

00:03:21.187 --> 00:03:22.531
it's like you're ignoring the fact

00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:24.484
that x is even a variable
and you're looking

00:03:24.484 --> 00:03:27.660
purely at what movement in
the y direction looks like.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.651
Which on the graph that
I have pictured here,

00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.845
also happens to give you kind of this

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:34.159
positive concavity parabola look,

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.073
but the point is that
the curve on the graph

00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:37.778
that results from looking at movement

00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:40.378
purely in the y direction can be analyzed

00:03:40.378 --> 00:03:42.736
just looking at this partial derivative

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:44.488
with respect to y twice in a row.

00:03:44.488 --> 00:03:48.655
So that term kind of tells
you y concavity, y concavity.

00:03:49.698 --> 00:03:51.199
Now first of all, notice what happens

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.460
if these disagree.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.573
If say, x thought there
should be positive concavity

00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:56.969
and y thought there should
be negative concavity.

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:58.754
Here, I'll write that
down, what that means.

00:03:58.754 --> 00:04:00.583
If x thinks there's positive concavity

00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:02.291
we have here some kind of positive number

00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:05.178
that I'll just write as like,
a plus sign in parenthesis.

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:07.541
And then this here, y concavity, would be

00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:09.540
some kind of negative number,
so we'll just put like,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.415
a negative sign in parenthesis.

00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:12.837
So that would mean this very first term

00:04:12.837 --> 00:04:14.707
would be a positive times a negative

00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:16.656
and that first term would be negative.

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:18.530
And now the thing that
we're subtracting off,

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.952
I'll get to the intuition behind this

00:04:19.952 --> 00:04:22.062
mixed partial derivative term in a moment,

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:24.695
but for now you can notice
that it's something squared,

00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:27.006
it's something that's
always a positive term.

00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:28.838
So you're always subtracting
off a positive term

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:31.277
which means if this
initial one is negative,

00:04:31.277 --> 00:04:34.121
the entire term H is
definitely gonna be negative,

00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:36.965
so it's gonna put you over into
this saddle point territory.

00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:38.672
Which makes sense,
because if the x direction

00:04:38.672 --> 00:04:40.910
and the y direction disagree on concavity

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.409
that should be a saddle point.

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:43.713
The quintessential example here

00:04:43.713 --> 00:04:46.556
is when you have the function f of x, y

00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:49.973
is equal to x squared minus y squared,

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:53.268
x squared minus y squared.

00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:54.451
And the graph of that, by the way,

00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:56.410
the graph of that would look like this

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.374
where, let's see, so
orienting myself here,

00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:01.204
moving in the x direction
you have kind of,

00:05:01.204 --> 00:05:03.042
positive concavity which corresponds

00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:05.484
to the positive coefficient
in front of x squared,

00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:08.904
and in the y direction it
looks like negative concavity.

00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:10.858
Corresponding to that negative coefficient

00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:12.365
in front of the y squared.

00:05:12.365 --> 00:05:14.561
So when there's disagreement among these,

00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:16.194
the test ensures that we're
gonna have a saddle point.

00:05:16.194 --> 00:05:18.476
Now what about if they agree, right,

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:21.123
what if either it's the case that x thinks

00:05:21.123 --> 00:05:22.549
there should be positive concavity

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:24.383
and y thinks there should
be positive concavity,

00:05:24.383 --> 00:05:27.187
or they both agree that there should be,

00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:29.095
you know, negative concavity.

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:30.239
In either one of these cases,

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:32.234
when you multiply them
together they're positive.

00:05:32.234 --> 00:05:34.549
So it's kind of like saying, if you look

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:36.992
purely in the x direction or
purely in the y direction,

00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:39.191
they agree, that there
should be, you know,

00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:40.576
definitely positive concavity

00:05:40.576 --> 00:05:42.041
or definitely negative concavity.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.813
So that entire first term
is going to be positive.

00:05:44.813 --> 00:05:46.200
So it's kind of like a clever way

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.320
of capturing whether
or not the x directions

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.028
and y directions agree.

00:05:50.028 --> 00:05:51.658
However, the reason that it's not enough

00:05:51.658 --> 00:05:53.365
is 'cause in either case we're still

00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:57.546
subtracting off something
that's always a positive term.

00:05:57.546 --> 00:05:59.028
So when you have this agreement

00:05:59.028 --> 00:06:00.940
between the x dicretion
and the y direction

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.852
it then turns into a battle between

00:06:02.852 --> 00:06:05.541
this x, y agreement
and whatever's going on

00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.553
with this mixed partial derivative term.

00:06:08.553 --> 00:06:10.632
And the stronger that mixed
partial derivative term,

00:06:10.632 --> 00:06:12.668
the bigger this negative number,

00:06:12.668 --> 00:06:15.146
so the more it's pulling the entire value

00:06:15.146 --> 00:06:17.183
H towards being negative.

00:06:17.183 --> 00:06:18.407
So let me see if I can give a little

00:06:18.407 --> 00:06:20.113
bit of reasoning behind why this

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:22.398
mixed partial derivative term is trying

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:25.164
to pull things towards
being a saddle point.

00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:27.688
Let's take a look at
the very simple function

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:30.688
f of x, y, is equal to x times y.

00:06:34.766 --> 00:06:36.434
So what that looks like graphically,

00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:39.501
f of x, y equal x times y, is this.

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:41.918
It looks like a saddle point.

00:06:44.063 --> 00:06:46.056
So let's go ahead and look
at it's partial derivatives.

00:06:46.056 --> 00:06:47.966
So the first partial derivatives,

00:06:47.966 --> 00:06:49.266
partial with respect to x and partial

00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:51.140
with respect to y, well when you do it

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.010
with respect to x, x
looks like a variable,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.104
y looks like a constant,
it's just that constant y.

00:06:56.104 --> 00:06:57.726
And when you do it with respect to y

00:06:57.726 --> 00:06:58.866
it goes the other way around.

00:06:58.866 --> 00:07:01.096
Y looks like the variable,
x looks like the constant

00:07:01.096 --> 00:07:03.574
so the derivative is that constant x.

00:07:03.574 --> 00:07:06.298
Now when you take the
second partial derivatives,

00:07:06.298 --> 00:07:08.373
if you do it with respect
to x twice in a row

00:07:08.373 --> 00:07:10.485
you're differentiating
this with respect to x,

00:07:10.485 --> 00:07:12.725
that looks like a
constant, so you get zero.

00:07:12.725 --> 00:07:16.256
And similarly, if you
do it with respect to y

00:07:16.256 --> 00:07:18.735
twice in a row, you're doing this

00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:21.709
and the derivative of x with respect to y,

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:23.781
x looks like a constant, goes to zero.

00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:25.208
But the important term, the one that we're

00:07:25.208 --> 00:07:27.161
getting an intuition about here,

00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:29.801
this mixed partial derivative,
first with respect to x

00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:32.528
then with respect to y, well
you can view it in two ways.

00:07:32.528 --> 00:07:35.011
Either you take the
derivative of this expression

00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:36.759
with respect to y, in which case it's one,

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:39.804
or you think of taking the
derivative of this expression

00:07:39.804 --> 00:07:42.366
with respect to x, in
which case it's also one.

00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:46.025
So it's kind of like this
function is a very pure

00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:47.731
way to take a look at what this

00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:50.372
mixed partial derivative term looks like.

00:07:50.372 --> 00:07:51.914
And the higher the coefficient here,

00:07:51.914 --> 00:07:54.964
if I had put a coefficient
of, you know, three here

00:07:54.964 --> 00:07:56.629
that would mean that the
mixed partial derivative

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:59.355
would ultimately end up being three.

00:07:59.355 --> 00:08:01.633
So notice, the reason that
this looks like a saddle

00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:03.952
isn't because the x and
y directions disagree,

00:08:03.952 --> 00:08:05.940
in fact if you take a
look at pure movement

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.850
in the x direction it just
looks like a constant.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.932
The height of the graph along this plane,

00:08:10.932 --> 00:08:13.335
along this line here is just a constant

00:08:13.335 --> 00:08:14.716
which corresponds to the fact that the

00:08:14.716 --> 00:08:16.873
second partial derivative
with respect to x

00:08:16.873 --> 00:08:18.091
is equal to zero.

00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:19.966
And then likewise, if
you cut it with a plane

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:22.244
representing a constant x value,

00:08:22.244 --> 00:08:24.277
meaning movement purely
in the y direction,

00:08:24.277 --> 00:08:26.838
the height of the graph doesn't
really change along there,

00:08:26.838 --> 00:08:28.255
it's constantly zero which corresponds

00:08:28.255 --> 00:08:31.018
to the fact that this other
partial derivative is zero.

00:08:31.018 --> 00:08:33.528
The reason that the whole
thing looks like a saddle

00:08:33.528 --> 00:08:36.289
is 'cause when you cut it
with a diagonal plane here,

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.421
a diagonal plane, it looks
like it has negative concavity.

00:08:39.421 --> 00:08:41.455
But if you were to chop it,
you know, in another direction

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:45.150
it would look like it
has positive concavity.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.848
So in fact, this xy term
is kind of like a way

00:08:48.848 --> 00:08:51.006
of capturing whether there's disagreement

00:08:51.006 --> 00:08:53.608
in the diagonal directions.

00:08:53.608 --> 00:08:55.278
And one thing that might
be surprising at first

00:08:55.278 --> 00:08:57.353
is that you only need one of these

00:08:57.353 --> 00:08:59.303
second partial derivatives in order

00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:01.052
to determine all of the information

00:09:01.052 --> 00:09:02.556
about the diagonal directions.

00:09:02.556 --> 00:09:03.936
'Cause you can imagine,
you know, maybe there's

00:09:03.936 --> 00:09:06.739
disagreement between movement
along one certain vector

00:09:06.739 --> 00:09:08.325
and movement along
another and you would have

00:09:08.325 --> 00:09:10.414
to account for infinitely many directions

00:09:10.414 --> 00:09:11.961
and look at all of them.

00:09:11.961 --> 00:09:14.201
And yet evidently, it's
the case that you only

00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:16.554
really need to take a look at this

00:09:16.554 --> 00:09:18.915
mixed partial derivative term.

00:09:18.915 --> 00:09:20.376
You know, along with the original pure

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:22.324
second partial derivatives with respect

00:09:22.324 --> 00:09:24.559
to x twice and with respect to y twice.

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:26.510
But still, looking at
only three different terms

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.624
to take into account possible disagreement

00:09:28.624 --> 00:09:30.741
in infinitely many directions actually

00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:32.569
feels like quite the surprise.

00:09:32.569 --> 00:09:35.297
And if you want the full,
rigorous justification

00:09:35.297 --> 00:09:37.092
for why this is the case, why this

00:09:37.092 --> 00:09:40.063
second partial derivative test works

00:09:40.063 --> 00:09:42.015
and kind of, an airtight argument.

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:43.792
I've put that in an
article that you can find

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.826
that kind of, goes into the dirty details

00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:47.290
for those who are interested.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.633
But if you just want the intuition,

00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:49.890
I think it's fine to think about

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.722
the fact that this
mixed partial derivative

00:09:51.722 --> 00:09:54.082
is telling you how much your function

00:09:54.082 --> 00:09:58.395
looks like the graph of f
of x, y equal x times y.

00:09:58.395 --> 00:09:59.732
Which is the graph that kind of captures

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:02.699
all of the diagonal disagreement.

00:10:02.699 --> 00:10:03.916
And then when you let that term,

00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:05.378
that mixed partial derivative term,

00:10:05.378 --> 00:10:07.131
kind of compete with the agreement

00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:08.836
between the x and y directions,

00:10:08.836 --> 00:10:10.830
you know, if they agree very strongly,

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.664
you have to subtract
off a very strong amount

00:10:12.664 --> 00:10:14.531
in order to pull it
back to being negative.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.132
So this battle back and
forth, if it's pulled

00:10:17.132 --> 00:10:19.328
to be very negative that
will give you a saddle point,

00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:21.320
if it doesn't pull hard
enough, then the agreement

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.918
between the x and y directions wins out

00:10:23.918 --> 00:10:26.760
and it's either a local
maximum or a local minimum.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.891
So hopefully that sheds
a little bit of light

00:10:29.891 --> 00:10:32.695
on why this term makes sense
and why it's a reasonable way

00:10:32.695 --> 00:10:35.788
to combine the three different
second partial derivatives

00:10:35.788 --> 00:10:37.858
available to you, and
again, if you want the full

00:10:37.858 --> 00:10:41.226
details, I've written that
up in an article form.

00:10:41.226 --> 00:10:42.724
I'll see you next video.
