00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.890
Which whole numbers will make
this statement true?

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.590
We have the statement here where
we have some brackets

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.930
are less than 7.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.920
So we just have to figure out
which whole numbers, if we put

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.900
them here, are really
less than 7.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.010
So let's draw a number line
and let's go up to 7.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.590
When we talk about whole
numbers, we're talking about

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.380
the non-negative numbers or
numbers that start at zero,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.440
and they aren't fractions.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.860
Let me draw them on
a number line.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.960
Let's say we have this number
line right here.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.850
We'll start at 0.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.350
You could go below 0.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.490
There are negative numbers, but
we're not going to concern

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.360
ourselves with them right now.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:43.720
So you have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7-- I'll go up a little

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.720
bit-- 8, 9.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.320
Now we want all of the numbers
that are less than 7.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.850
That's what that means.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.840
We could write it like this.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.630
Question mark is less than
7, and what would satisfy

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.160
question mark?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.300
The hardest thing about these
greater than or less than is

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.830
remembering what the
symbol means.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.120
We have the smaller side
pointing to the question mark,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.210
so that is the smaller number.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.590
We have the larger side of the
symbol pointing to the 7, so 7

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.940
is going to be the larger
of the two numbers.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.240
So what numbers satisfy that?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.720
Well, anything below 7.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.900
Any whole number below 7.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.290
So if we look at 7 on the number
line, what are all of

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.270
the whole numbers that are below
7, that are less than 7?

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.720
Well, we have a 6, we have 5,
we have 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.770
So you could put any of these
numbers here and the statement

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.300
would be true.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.650
You could write 0
is less than 7.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.350
That's true.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.810
You could write 3
is less than 7.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.780
That's true.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.850
You could write 6 is less than
7, and that would be true.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.050
You could not write that 8 is
less than 7, so 8 would not

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.790
satisfy this.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.500
This is not true.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.640
This is not true, so we
cannot write that.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.950
8 is greater than 7.
