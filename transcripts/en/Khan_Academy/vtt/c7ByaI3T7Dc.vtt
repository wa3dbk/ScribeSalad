00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.160
Let's have the vector valued
function r of s and t is equal

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.980
to-- well, x is going to
be a function of s and t.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.090
So we'll just write it as x of
s and t times the x unit

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:22.180
vector, or i, plus y of s and t
times the y unit factor, or j,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.240
plus x of s and t times
the z unit vector, k.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.280
So given that we have this
vector valued function, let's

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.770
define or let's think about
what it means to take the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.800
partial derivative of this
vector valued function with

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.620
respect to one of the
parameters, s or t.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.040
I think it's going to be
pretty natural, nothing

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.420
completely bizarre here.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.030
We've taken partial derivatives
of non-vector valued functions

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.850
before, where we only vary
one of the variables.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.280
We only take it with
respect to one variable.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.770
You hold the other
one constant.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.750
We're going to do the
exact same thing here.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.920
And we've taken regular
derivatives of vector

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.720
valued functions.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.120
The path in those just ended up
being the regular derivative

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.490
of each of the terms.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.180
And we're going to see, it's
going to be the same thing here

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.950
with the partial derivative.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.670
So let's define the
partial derivative of

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.970
r with respect to s.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.720
And everything I do with
respect to s, you can just swap

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.930
it with t, and you're going to
get the same exact result.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.800
I'm going to define it as being
equal to the limit as delta

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:36.240
s approaches 0 of r
of s plus delta s.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.250
Only finding the limit
with respect to a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.570
change in s comma t.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.340
We're holding t, as you can
imagine, constant for given

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.190
t, minus r of s and t.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.630
All of that over delta s.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.270
Now, if you do a little bit of
algebra here, you literally,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.980
you know-- r of s plus delta s
comma t, that's the same thing

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.310
as x of s plus delta s
t i, plus y of s plus

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.900
delta s t j, plus z.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.740
All that minus this thing.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.370
If you do a little bit of
algebra with that, and if you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.070
don't believe me, try it out.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:22.950
This is going to be equal to
the limit of delta s

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.620
approaching 0-- and I'm going
to write it small because it'd

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.120
take up a lot of space-- of x
of s plus delta s comma t minus

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.340
x of s and t, I think you
know where I'm going.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.280
This is all a little bit
monotonous to write it all

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.440
out, but never hurts.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.750
Times s or divided by delta s
times i-- and then I'll do it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.100
in different colors, so it's
less monotonous-- plus y.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.290
Where every-- those limited
delta s [? approaches ?]

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.720
0 applies to every term
I'm writing out here.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.590
y of s plus delta s comma t
minus y of s comma t, all of

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.560
that over delta s times j.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:19.240
And then finally, plus z of s
plus delta s comma t minus z of

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:27.910
s and t, all of that over delta
s times the z unit vector, k.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.890
And this all comes out
of this definition.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.990
If you literally just put s
plus delta s in place for s--

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.600
you evaluate all this, do a
little algebra-- you're going

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.500
to get the exact same thing.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.110
And this, hopefully, pops out
at you as, gee, we're just

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.590
taking the partial derivative
of each of these functions

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.480
with respect to s.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.040
And these functions right here,
this x of s and t, this is a

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.670
non-vector valued function.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.450
This y, this is also a
non-vector valued function.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.240
z is also a non-vector
valued function.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.540
When you put them all together,
it becomes a vector valued

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.410
function, because we're
multiplying the first

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.270
one times a vector.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.620
The second one times
another vector.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.210
The third one times
another vector.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.570
But independently,
these functions are

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.570
non-vector valued.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.140
So this is just the
definition of the regular

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.110
partial derivatives.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.170
Where we're taking the limit
as delta s approaches 0

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.020
in each of these cases.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.380
So this is the
exact same thing.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.530
This is equal to-- this is the
exact same thing as the partial

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:30.060
derivative of x with respect to
s times i plus the partial

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:38.000
derivative y with respect to s
times j plus the partial

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.700
derivative of z with
respect to s times k.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.160
I'm going to do one more thing
here and this is pseudo mathy,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.620
but it's going to come out--
the whole reason I'm even doing

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.650
this video, is it's going to
give us some good tools in our

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.470
tool kit for the videos that
I'm about to do on

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.190
surface integrals.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.510
So I'm going to do one thing
here that's a little pseudo

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.990
mathy, and that's really
because differentials are these

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.600
things that are very hard to
define rigorously, but I think

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.510
it'll give you the intuition
of what's going on.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.740
So this thing right here, I'm
going to say this is also equal

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.820
to-- and you're not going to
see this in any math textbook,

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.520
and hard core mathematicians
are going to kind of cringe

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.950
when they see me do this.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.160
But I like to do it because
I think it'll give you the

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.090
intuition on what's going
on when we take our

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.990
surface integrals.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.340
So I'm going to say that this
whole thing right here, that

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:36.910
that is equal to r of s plus
the differential of s-- a super

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:44.130
small change in s-- t minus r
of s and t, all of that

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.900
over that same super
small change in s.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.440
So hopefully you understand
at least why I view

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.420
things this way.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.930
When I take the limit as delta
s approaches 0, these delta s's

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.810
are going to get super
duper duper small.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.370
And in my head, that's how
I imagine differentials.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.365
When someone writes the
derivative of y with respect to

00:06:07.365 --> 00:06:12.870
x-- and let's say that they say
that that is 2-- and we've done

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.290
a little bit of math with
differentials before.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.400
You can imagine multiplying
both sides by dx, and you

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.210
could get dy is equal to 2dx.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.670
We've done this
throughout calculus.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.870
The way I imagine it is super
small change in y-- infinitely

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.830
small change in y-- is equal to
2 times-- though, you can

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.420
imagine an equally
small change in x.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.880
So it's a-- well, if you have a
super small change in x, your

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.290
change in y is going to be
still super small, but it's

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.510
going to be 2 times that.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.710
I guess that's the
best way to view it.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.310
But in general, I view
differentials as super small

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.420
changes in a variable.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.600
So with that out of the way,
and me explaining to you that

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.290
many mathematicians would
cringe at what I just wrote,

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.290
hopefully this gives you a
little-- this isn't like

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.080
some crazy thing I did.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.240
I'm just saying, oh, delta
s as delta approaches 0, I

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.640
kind of imagine that as ds.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.830
And the whole reason I did
that, is if you take this side

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.610
and that side, and multiply
both sides times this

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.690
differential ds,
then what happens?

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:23.250
The left hand side, you get the
partial of r with respect to

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.120
s is equal to this times ds.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.190
I'll do ds in maybe pink.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.770
Times ds-- this is just
a regular differential,

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.890
super small change in s.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.220
This is a kind of a partial,
with respect to s.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.740
That's going to be equal to--
well, if you multiply this side

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.230
of the equation times ds, this
guy's going to disappear.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.700
So it's going to be r of s,
plus our super small change

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:55.080
in s, t minus r of s and t.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.020
Now let me put a little
square around this.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.650
This is going to be valuable
for us in the next video.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.980
We're going to actually think
about what this means and how

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.210
to visualize this on a surface.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.380
As you can imagine, this
is a vector right here.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.260
You have 2 vector valued
functions and you're

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:09.990
taking the difference.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.440
And we're going to visualize
it in the next video.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.760
It's going to really help
us with surface integrals.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.270
By the same exact logic, we
can do everything we did

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.140
here with s, we can do
it with t, as well.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.960
So we can define the partial--
I'll draw a little-- I can

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.650
define the partial of r with
respect-- let me do it in a

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.080
different color, completely
different color.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.270
It's orange.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.580
The partial of r with respect
to t-- the definition

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.370
is just right here.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:46.750
The limit as delta t approaches
0 of r of s t plus delta

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.100
t minus r of s and t.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.770
In this situation we're
holding the s, you can

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.880
imagine, in constant.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.220
We're finding its change in
t, all of that over delta t.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.380
And the same thing falls out.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.270
This is equal to the partial of
x with respect to ti plus y

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.580
with respect to tj, plus
z with respect to tk.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.190
Same exact thing, you just kind
of swap the s's and the t's.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.740
And by that same logic,
you'd have the same

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.990
result but in terms of t.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.970
If you do this pseudo mathy
thing that I did up here, then

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:25.680
you would get the partial of r
with respect to t times a super

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.800
small change in t. dt, our
t differential, you could

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:40.360
imagine, is equal to r of st
plus dt minus r of s and t.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.010
So let's box these
two guys away.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.340
And in the next video,
we're going to actually

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.790
visualize what these mean.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.640
And sometimes, when you kind of
do a bunch of like, silly math

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.670
like this, you're always like,
all right, what is

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.240
this all about?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.110
Remember, all I did is I said,
what does it mean to take the

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.540
derivative of this with
respect to s or t?

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.970
Played around with it a little
bit, I got this result.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.220
These 2 are going to be very
valuable for us, I think, in

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.870
getting the intuition for
why surface integrals

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.450
look the way they do.
