00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:02.970
Let's do a little bit of
probability with playing cards.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.511
And for the sake of
this video, we're

00:00:04.511 --> 00:00:06.864
going to assume that our
deck has no jokers in it.

00:00:06.864 --> 00:00:08.780
You could do the same
problems with the joker,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.560
you'll just get slightly
different numbers.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.390
So with that out of
the way, let's first

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.800
just think about
how many cards we

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.210
have in a standard playing deck.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.040
So you have four
suits, and the suits

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.960
are the spades, the diamonds,
the clubs, and the hearts.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.770
You have four suits and
then in each of those suits

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.950
you have 13 different
types of cards--

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.640
and sometimes it's
called the rank.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.920
You have the ace, then you have
the two, the three, the four,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.210
the five, the six,
seven, eight, nine, ten,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.620
and then you have the Jack,
the King, and the Queen.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590
And that is 13 cards.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.890
So for each suit
you can have any

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.480
of these-- you can
have any of the suits.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.910
So you could have a Jack of
diamonds, a Jack of clubs,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.220
a Jack of spades,
or a Jack of hearts.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.970
So if you just multiply
these two things--

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.532
you could take a deck of playing
cards, take out the jokers

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:15.240
and count them-- but
if you just multiply

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.740
this you have four suits, each
of those suits have 13 types.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.120
So you're going to
have 4 times 13 cards,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.207
or you're going to have 52 cards
in a standard playing deck.

00:01:24.207 --> 00:01:25.790
Another way you could
have said, look,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.270
there's 13 of these
ranks, or types,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.120
and each of those come in four
different suits-- 13 times 4.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.237
Once again, you would
have gotten 52 cards.

00:01:33.237 --> 00:01:34.820
Now, with that of
the way, let's think

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.156
about the probabilities
of different events.

00:01:37.156 --> 00:01:38.530
So let's say I
shuffle that deck.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.610
I shuffle it really,
really well and then

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.240
I randomly pick a
card from that deck.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.400
And I want to think about
what is the probability that I

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.220
pick a Jack.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.450
Well, how many equally
likely events are there?

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.540
Well, I could pick any
one of those 52 cards.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.350
So there's 52 possibilities
for when I pick that card.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.130
And how many of those 52
possibilities are Jacks?

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.480
Well you have the Jack of
spades, the Jack of diamonds,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.880
the Jack of clubs, and
the Jack of hearts.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.170
There's four Jacks in that deck.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.090
So it is 4 over 52-- these
are both divisible by 4-- 4

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.060
divided by 4 is 1, 52
divided by 4 is 13.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.390
Now, let's think
about the probability.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.976
So I'll start over.

00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:30.600
I'm going to put that
Jack back and I'm

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.850
going to reshuffle the deck.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.020
So once again, I
still have 52 cards.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.290
So what's the probability
that I get a hearts?

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.290
What's the probability
that I just randomly pick

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.720
a card from a shuffled
deck and it is a heart?

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.580
Well, once again,
there's 52 possible cards

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.480
I could pick from.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.720
52 possible, equally likely
events that we're dealing with.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.010
And how many of those
have our hearts?

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.770
Well, essentially 13
of them are hearts.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.180
For each of those suits
you have 13 types.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.892
So there are 13
hearts in that deck.

00:03:01.892 --> 00:03:03.350
There are 13 diamonds
in that deck.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.970
There are 13 spades
in that deck.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.490
There are 13 clubs in that deck.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.570
So 13 of the 52 would result
in hearts, and both of these

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.270
are divisible by 13.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.670
This is the same thing as 1/4.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.040
One in four times
I will pick it out,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.690
or I have a one in four
probability of getting a hearts

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.619
when I randomly pick a card
from that shuffled deck.

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.160
Now, let's do something that's
a little bit more interesting,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.250
or maybe it's a little obvious.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.130
What's the probability
that I pick something

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.540
that is a Jack-- I'll just
write J-- and it is a hearts?

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.230
Well, if you are reasonably
familiar with cards

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.605
you'll know that
there's actually

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:47.900
only one card that is
both a Jack and a heart.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.520
It is literally
the Jack of hearts.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.530
So we're saying, what
is the probability

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.870
that we pick the exact
card, the Jack of hearts?

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.200
Well, there's only
one event, one card,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.660
that meets this criteria
right over here,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.630
and there's 52 possible cards.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.630
So there's a one
in 52 chance that I

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.650
pick the Jack of hearts--
something that is both a Jack

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.710
and it's a heart.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.640
Now, let's do something a
little bit more interesting.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.434
What is the
probability-- you might

00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:16.600
want to pause this and think
about this a little bit

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.808
before I give you the answer.

00:04:17.808 --> 00:04:20.019
What is the probability
of-- so I once again, I

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.340
have a deck of 52
cards, I shuffled it,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.350
randomly pick a card from that
deck-- what is the probability

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.420
that that card that I pick from
that deck is a Jack or a heart?

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.050
So it could be the
Jack of hearts,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.414
or it could be the
Jack of diamonds,

00:04:35.414 --> 00:04:36.830
or it could be the
Jack of spades,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.450
or it could be the
Queen of hearts,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.872
or it could be
the two of hearts.

00:04:39.872 --> 00:04:41.330
So what is the
probability of this?

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.579
And this is a little bit
more of an interesting thing,

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:46.440
because we know, first
of all, that there

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.912
are 52 possibilities.

00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:51.370
But how many of
those possibilities

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.010
meet these conditions that
it is a Jack or a heart.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.080
And to understand that,
I'll draw a Venn diagram.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.650
Sounds kind of fancy,
but nothing fancy here.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.740
So imagine that this
rectangle I'm drawing here

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.820
represents all of the outcomes.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.770
So if you want, you could
imagine it has an area of 52.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.730
So this is 52 possible outcomes.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.730
Now, how many of those
outcomes result in a Jack?

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.860
So we already learned, one out
of 13 of those outcomes result

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.860
in a Jack.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.490
So I could draw a
little circle here,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.290
where that area-- and I'm
approximating-- represents

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.520
the probability of a Jack.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.770
So it should be
roughly 1/13, or 4/52,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.460
of this area right over here.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.060
So I'll just draw it like this.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.505
So this right over here is
the probability of a Jack.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.660
There's four possible
cards out of the 52.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.560
So that is 4/52,
or one out of 13.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.470
Now, what's the probability
of getting a hearts?

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.540
Well, I'll draw another
little circle here

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.530
that represents that.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.540
13 out of 52 cards
represent a heart.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.880
And actually, one of those
represents both a heart

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.920
and a Jack.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.060
So I'm actually going
to overlap them,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.870
and hopefully this will
make sense in a second.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.010
So there's actually 13
cards that are a heart.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.530
So this is the number of hearts.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.110
And actually, let me write this
top thing that way as well.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.380
It makes it a little bit
clearer that we're actually

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.320
looking at the number of Jacks.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.210
And of course,
this overlap right

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.920
here is the number of Jacks
and hearts-- the number

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.470
of items out of this 52 that
are both a Jack and a heart--

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.160
it is in both sets here.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.810
It is in this green circle and
it is in this orange circle.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.500
So this right over here--
let me do that in yellow

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.600
since I did that problem in
yellow-- this right over here

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.210
is a number of Jacks and hearts.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.710
So let me draw a
little arrow there.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.590
It's getting a little
cluttered, maybe

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.325
I should draw a little
bit bigger number.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.960
And that's an
overlap over there.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.670
So what is the probability
of getting a Jack or a heart?

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.450
So if you think about
it, the probability

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.260
is going to be the
number of events

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.977
that meet these conditions,
over the total number events.

00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:25.060
We already know the total
number of events are 52.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.040
But how many meet
these conditions?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.950
So it's going to be the
number-- you could say,

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.110
well, look at the green
circle right there says

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.580
the number that gives us a Jack,
and the orange circle tells us

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.580
the number that
gives us a heart.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.100
So you might want to say,
well, why don't we add up

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.800
the green and the
orange, but if you

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.047
did that, you would
be double counting,

00:07:46.047 --> 00:07:47.630
Because if you add
it up-- if you just

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.580
did four plus 13--
what are we saying?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.980
We're saying that
there are four Jacks

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.170
and we're saying that
there are 13 hearts.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.230
But in both of these, when we
do it this way, in both cases

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.239
we are counting
the Jack of hearts.

00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:07.780
We're putting the
Jack of hearts here

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.370
and we're putting the
Jack of hearts here.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.869
So we're counting
the Jack of hearts

00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:13.890
twice, even though there's
only one card there.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.090
So you would have to subtract
out where they're common.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.090
You would have to
subtract out the item that

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.390
is both a Jack and a heart.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.990
So you would subtract out a 1.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.800
Another way to
think about it is,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.130
you really want to figure
out the total area here.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.590
And let me zoom in-- and I'll
generalize it a little bit.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.090
So if you have one
circle like that,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.030
and then you have another
overlapping circle like that,

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.730
and you wanted to figure
out the total area of both

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.700
of these circles
combined, you would

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.260
look at the area of this circle.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.730
And then you could add it
to the area of this circle.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.530
But when you do that, you'll
see that when you add the two

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.270
areas, you're counting
this area twice.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.270
So in order to only
count that area once,

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.510
you have to subtract
that area from the sum.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:10.200
So if this area has
A, this area is B,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.830
and the intersection
where they overlap is C,

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.370
the combined area is
going to be A plus B-- --

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.492
minus where they
overlap-- minus C.

00:09:23.492 --> 00:09:24.950
So that's the same
thing over here,

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.874
we're counting all
the Jacks, and that

00:09:26.874 --> 00:09:28.040
includes the Jack of hearts.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.664
We're counting all
the hearts, and that

00:09:29.664 --> 00:09:31.230
includes the Jack of hearts.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.250
So we counted the
Jack of hearts twice,

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.260
so we have to subtract
1 out of that.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.640
This is going to be
4 plus 13 minus 1,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.284
or this is going to be 16/52.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:48.250
And both of these things
are divisible by 4.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.890
So this is going to be the
same thing as, divide 16 by 4,

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:52.670
you get 4.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.330
52 divided by 4 is 13.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:01.460
So there's a 4/13 chance that
you'd get a Jack or a hearts.
