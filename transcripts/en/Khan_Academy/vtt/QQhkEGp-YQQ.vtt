00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.400
We're asked to factor
this expression.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.460
And there's going to be simpler
ways to factor it, but

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.390
in this video I'm going to
factor it by grouping.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.460
And when you factor by grouping,
what you need to do

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.170
is think about two numbers
whose products are

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.050
going to be equal to.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.530
You have actually one
coefficient right here, right?

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.020
t squared is the same
thing as 1t squared.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.070
So we're looking for two
numbers, let's call them a and

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.510
b, a times b.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.750
the product of these two
numbers needs to be the

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.820
product of the coefficient on
the t squared, which is 1, and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.090
the negative 15 right here.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.950
So a times b has to be equal
to 1 times negative 15, or

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.510
just negative 15.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.770
And the sum of a and b, and a
plus b, needs to be equal to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.035
negative 2.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.940
And once we have these two
numbers, I can show you how we

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.240
can use those to factor
by grouping.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.620
And in other videos I've
actually broken down to why

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.430
this technique works.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.370
Now, let's think of the
different factors of negative

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.290
15 when we take their product,
and if we take the sum, if we

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.030
can somehow get to negative 2.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
So let's look at the different
factors of negative 15.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.260
So we could do-- let me do it in
this other, let me do it in

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.250
pink-- see if 1 and negative 15,
these are-- so everything

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.570
I list here, their product is
going to be negative 15.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.220
But let's think about
what happens when

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.790
you take their sum.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.790
So 1 and negative 15, the
sum is negative 14.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.120
And if you did negative 1 and
15, you're just going to get

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.930
the negative of that.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.730
You're going to get 14.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.240
It does not equal negative 2.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.090
So what happens if you take
3 and negative 5?

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.430
So their product is definitely
negative 15, 3, plus negative

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.150
5 is negative 2,
so that works.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.910
And if we tried negative 3 and
5 first, we would have gotten

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.780
that to be positive 2.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.466
It's just like, oh, we just have
to swap the signs and we

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:55.510
would have gotten
a negative 2.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.280
So these work, 3 and
negative 5 work.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.430
3 times negative 5 is negative
15, 3 plus negative 5 is

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.420
negative 2.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.130
So what we want to do
here is break this

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.230
middle term up here.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.550
We know that 3 plus negative
5 is equal to negative 2.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.010
So we can break up this middle
term here as a sum of-- and

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.370
I'll do it right here; I'll
actually do it in the same

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.910
color-- so this thing here, we
can rewrite as t squared.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.230
I'll put the minus
15 out here.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.320
But the negative 2t we can
rewrite as the sum of 3t.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.960
We could write it here
as plus 3t, minus 5t.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.070
And when you're trying to figure
out which one to put

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.540
first or second, you should look
at these other terms, and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.290
say which ones have
common factors?

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.570
The 3 and 5 both have a common
factor with 15, so it's not as

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.460
obvious which one to put first,
so we're just going to

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.890
go with this.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.250
3t minus 5t, I got that from
3t minus 5t is equal to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.390
negative 2t.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.300
Positive 3 times negative 5
is equal to negative 15.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.690
That's where it came from.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.480
Now, we're ready to factor
by grouping.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.530
So let's take the first group,
let's take these first two

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.230
terms, right there.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.060
And what's the common
factor there?

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.510
Well, the common factor
there is t.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.810
So if I factor a t out, that
becomes t times-- t squared

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.270
divided by t is t.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.530
3t divided by t is 3.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.120
So these first two terms
are the same thing as t

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.090
times t plus 3.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.500
Now, let's look at the
second two terms.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.150
What's a common factor?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.680
Well, they're both divisible by
negative 5, so let's factor

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.930
out a negative 5.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.450
And negative 5t divided by
negative 5, if you factor out

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.400
the negative 5, you're just
going to have a t there.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.620
And then negative 15, if you
factor out a negative 5, you

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.700
divide negative 15 by negative
5, you're just going to have a

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.970
positive 3.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.290
And then notice, you now have
two terms here, two products,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.660
and they both have the common
factor of t plus 3.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.200
So we can rewrite this right
here as a product of t plus 3.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.565
We're undistributing
the t plus 3.

00:04:12.565 --> 00:04:20.140
We're factoring out the t plus
3. t plus 3 times t, right?

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.920
Times t minus 5.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.310
And I want you to really make
sure you feel good that these

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.030
are really the same thing.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.405
If you take t times t plus 3 and
factor out the t plus 3,

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:33.550
you're just left with that t.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.180
If you take negative 5 times t
plus 3 and you factor out the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.950
t plus 3, you're just left
with that negative 5.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.256
But once you factor out the t
plus 3, and you're just left

00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:44.470
with the t minus 5, you
have fully factored

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.830
this expression here.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.580
And in the future we're going
to see easier ways of doing

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.370
this, but factoring by grouping
is actually the

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.130
easiest way to do it if you have
a coefficient higher than

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.390
1, or a non-one coefficient.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.830
It could also be a negative
coefficient out front here.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.650
When you have 1 as your
coefficient here, there's

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.710
actually much easier ways to
factor something like this,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.120
but it's really the same
thought process.
