00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.240
We've already seen alcohols in
many of these videos, but I

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.710
thought it was about time
that I actually

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.436
made a video on alcohols.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.160
Now, alcohols is the general
term for any molecule that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.860
fits the pattern some type of
functional group or chain of

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.200
carbons OH.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.540
And they use the letter R.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.500
And I've used it before.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.600
R stands for radical.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.110
And I don't want you to confuse

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.970
this R with free radical.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.020
It means completely
different things.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.450
R in this form really just means
a functional group or a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.890
chain of carbons here.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.960
It doesn't mean a
free radical.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.640
This just means it could be
just something attached to

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.260
this OH right there.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.640
Now another point of
clarification, do not think

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.740
that anything that fits this
pattern is drinkable.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.480
Do not associate it with the
traditional alcohol that you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.580
may or may not have
been exposed to.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:03.400
Traditional drinking alcohol
is actually ethanol.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.100
Alcohol is actually--
let me write out

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.430
the molecular formula.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.160
CH3, CH2, and then OH.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.430
This is what is inside of wine
and beer and hard liquor, or

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.400
whatever you might want.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.060
You do not want to drink and
maybe you might not actually

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.720
want to drink this either, but
you definitely do not want to

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.200
drink something like methanol.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.900
It might kill you.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.750
So you do not want to do
something like this.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.000
You do not want to
ingest that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.290
Might kill or blind you.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.310
This might do it in a
more indirect way.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.230
So I want to get that out of
the way and just so that we

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.710
get kind of a little bit more
comfortable with alcohols, and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.520
we've seen them involved
in other reactions.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.880
We've seen hydroxides act
as nucleophiles and Sn2

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.650
substitution reactions
create alcohols.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.760
But I want to do is just learn
to get comfortable and really

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.870
make sure we know how to
name these things.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.510
So let's just name these
molecules that I drew right

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.430
before I pressed record
right over here.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.610
So over here, like everything
else, we always want to define

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.110
the longest carbon chain.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.070
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 carbons.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.320
So it's going to be pent.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.260
And there's no double bonds.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.840
So it's a pentane.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.200
So I'll just write pentane
right then.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.910
And we're not going to just
write a pentane because

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.860
actually, the fact that makes
it an alcohol, that takes

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.070
precedence over the fact
that it is an alkane.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.650
So it actually, the suffix of
the word will involve the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.740
alcohol part.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.990
So it is pentanol.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.970
That tells us that's
an alcohol.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.070
And to know where the OH is
grouped, we'll start numbering

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.350
closest to the OH.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.740
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.710
Sometimes it'll be called
2-pentanol.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.720
And this is pretty clear because
we only have one group

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.680
here, only one OH.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.240
So we know that that is
what the 2 applies to.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.720
But a lot of times, if people
want to be a little bit more

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.615
particular, they might
write pentan-2-ol.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.800
And this way is more useful,
especially if you have

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.740
multiple functional groups.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.420
So you know exactly
where they sit.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.880
This one is harder to say.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.170
2-pentanol is pretty
straightforward.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.940
Now let's try the name this
beast right over here.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.900
So we have a couple of
things going on.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.200
This is an alkyne.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.870
We have a triple bond.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.920
It's an alkyne.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.020
We have two bromo groups here.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.800
And it's also an alcohol.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.340
And alcohol takes precedence
on all of them.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.770
So we want to start numbering
closest to the alcohol.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.710
So we want to start numbering
from this end

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.940
of the carbon chain.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.375
And we have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 carbons.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.120
We want to call it an octyne.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.190
But because we have an alcohol
there, we want to call this an

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.560
octyne-- let me make
it very clear.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.320
So oct tells us that
we have 8 carbons.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.300
Now we have to specify where
that triple bond is.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.120
The triple bond is
on the 5 carbon.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.320
You always specify the lower
number of the carbons on that

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.980
triple bond.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.230
So it is oct-5-yn.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.029
That tells us that's where
the triple bond is.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.640
And then we have the
OH on the 4 carbon.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.890
So 4-al.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.210
And now we have these
two bromo groups

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.590
here on the 7 carbon.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.710
So it's 7,7-dibromo
oct-5-yn-4-al.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.520
And this would all
be one word.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.010
Let me make sure that
you realize that

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.850
this should be connected.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.640
I just ran out of space.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.875
So that's probably about as
messy of a thing you'll have

00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:52.620
to name, but just showing
you that these

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.120
things can be named.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.950
Now let's think about this
one over here in green.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.850
So we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 carbons.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.850
So it's going to be a hex.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.560
And they're all single bonds,
so it's a hexane.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.100
It's a cyclohexane.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.920
But then of course, the
hydroxide or the hydroxy group

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.140
I should call it,
takes dominance.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.550
It's a hexanol.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.870
So this is a cyclohexanol.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.230
And once again, that comes
from the OH right there.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.460
And you don't have
to number it.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.220
Because no matter what carbon
it's on, it's on the same one.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.410
If you had more than one of
these OH groups, then we would

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.300
have to worry about
numbering them.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.280
Let's just do this one
right over here.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.620
So once again, what is
our carbon chain?

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.670
We have 1, 2, 3 carbons.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.050
And we have the hydroxy
group attached to

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.630
the 1 and the 3 carbon.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.800
Prop is our prefix.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.060
It is an alkane.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.590
So we would call this--
and there's a couple

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.330
of ways to do this.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.500
We could call this 1 comma
3 propanediol.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.530
Actually, I don't have
to put a dash their.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.350
Propanediol.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.860
And over here, we would add the
E because we have the D

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.330
right there.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.700
So it's propanediol.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.790
If it wasn't diol, it
would be propanal.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.330
You wouldn't have the E,
D and the I there.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.800
So this would specify we're at
the 1 and the 3 carbons.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.580
We have the hydroxy group.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:38.260
Or this could also be written
as propane- 1, 3- diol.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.110
And once again, the di is
telling us that we have two of

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.380
the hydroxy groups attached
to this thing.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.120
But either of these things are
ways that you would see this

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.550
molecule named.
