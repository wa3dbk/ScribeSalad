00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.600
OK, I filled your brain with a
bunch of partial derivatives

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.920
and psi's, with respect
to x's and y's.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.820
I think now it's time to
actually do it with a real

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.400
differential equation,
and make things a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.195
little bit more concrete.

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.640
So let's say I have the
differential, y, the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.570
differential equation, y cosine
of x, plus 2xe to the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:34.360
y, plus sine of x, plus-- I'm
already running out of space--

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.140
x squared, e to the y,
minus 1, times y

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.970
prime, is equal to 0.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.090
Well, your brain is already,
hopefully, in exact

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.310
differential equations mode.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.510
But if you were to see this
pattern in general, where you

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.690
see a function of x and y,
here-- this is just some

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.870
function of x and y-- and then
you have another function of x

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.440
and y, times y prime, or times
dy, d of x, your brain should

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.950
immediately say if this
is inseparable.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.180
And I'm not going to try to
make it separable, just

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.530
because that'll take
a lot of time.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.460
But if it's not separable, your
brain said, oh, maybe

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.850
this is an exact equation.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.350
And, you say, let
me test whether

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.040
this is an exact equation.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.300
So if this is an exact equation,
this is our function

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.160
M, which is a function
of x and y.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.670
And this is our function
N, which is a

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.140
function of x and y.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.700
Now, the test is to see if the
partial of this, with respect

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.290
to y, is equal to the partial
of this, with respect to x.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.420
So let's see.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.240
The partial of M, with respect
to y, is equal to-- let's see,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.480
y is-- so this cosine of x is
just a constant, so it's just

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.460
cosine of x.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.610
Cosine of x plus-- now,
what's the derivative?

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.725
Well, 2x is just a constant,
what's the derivative of e to

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:50.820
the y, with respect to y?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.350
Well, it's just e
to the y, right?

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.110
So we have the constant on
the outside, 2x times the

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.810
derivative, with respect to
y, so it's 2xe to the y.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.910
Fair enough.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.430
Now, what is the partial
derivative of this, with

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.950
respect to x?

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.100
So N sub x, or the partial of
N, with respect to x-- so

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.360
what's the derivative of sine
of x, with respect to x?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.630
Well, that's easy, that's cosine
of x, plus 2x times e

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.830
to the y, right? e and y is just
a constant, because y is

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.030
constant when we're taking the
partial, with respect to x.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.550
So plus 2xe to the y.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.800
And then minus 1, the derivative
of a constant, with

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.450
respect to anything
is going to be 0.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.310
So the derivative of N-- the
partial of N, with respect to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.460
x, is cosine of x, plus 2xe to
the y, which, lo and behold,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.000
is the same thing as the
derivative, the partial of M,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.120
with respect to y.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.190
So there we have it.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.860
We've shown that M of y is equal
to-- or the partial of

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.230
M, with respect to y-- is equal
to the partial of N,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.510
with respect to x, which
tells us that

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.040
this is an exact equation.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.380
Now, given that this is an exact
equation-- oh, my wife

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.120
snuck up behind me,
I was wondering.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.150
I thought there was
some critter in

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.820
my house, or something.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.440
Anyway, so we know that this is
an exact equation, so what

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.020
does that tell us?

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.990
Well, that tells us that there's
some psi, where the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.060
partial derivative of psi, with
respect to x, is equal to

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.420
M, and the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to y, is

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.600
equal to N.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.800
And if we know that psi,
then we can rewrite our

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.090
differential equation as the
derivative of psi, with

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.450
respect to x, is equal to 0.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.790
So let's solve for psi.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.765
So we know that the partial of
psi, with respect to x, is

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:44.390
equal to M.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.160
So we could write that.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.820
We could write the partial of
psi, with respect to x, is

00:03:50.820 --> 00:04:01.110
equal to M, which is y cosine
of x, plus 2xe to the y.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.600
That's just here.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.570
That's my M of x.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.440
We could have done
it the other way.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.160
We could have said the partial
of y-- the partial of psi,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.220
with respect to y, is this
thing over here.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.430
But let's just do it with x.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.910
Now, to at least get kind of a
first approximation of what

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.930
size-- not an approximation, but
to start to get a sense of

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.829
it-- let's take the derivative
of both sides, with respect

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.000
to-- sorry, take the
antiderivative-- take the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.270
integral of both sides,
with respect to x.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.280
So if you take the derivative of
this, with respect to x, if

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.800
you integrate-- sorry, if
you were to take the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.220
antiderivative of this,
with respect to x.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.836
So let me just write
that down.

00:04:36.836 --> 00:04:38.520
The partial, with
respect to x.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.360
We're going to [? integrate ?]

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.820
it, with respect to x.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.030
That is going to be equal to
the integral of this whole

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.820
thing, with respect to x.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.940
Cosine of x plus 2xe to the y.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.870
We're integrating with
respect to x.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.220
And normally when you integrate
with respect to x,

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.430
you'd say, OK, plus c, right?

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.000
But it actually could be a
plus-- since this is a

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.740
partial, with respect to x, we
could have had some function

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.045
of y here in general, because
y, we treat it

00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:10.730
as a constant, right?

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.300
And that makes sense, because
if you were to take the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.110
partial of both sides of this,
with respect to x, if you were

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.430
to take the partial of a
function that is only a

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.420
function of y, with respect
to x, you would

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.880
have gotten a 0 here.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.200
So when you take the
antiderivative, you were,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.190
like, oh well, there might have
been some function of y

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.780
here that we lost when
we took the partial,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.790
with respect to x.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.690
So anyway, this will
simplify to psi.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.710
psi is going to be equal to the
integral, with respect to

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.340
x, or the antiderivative, with
respect to x, here, plus some

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.130
function of y that we might
have lost when we took the

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.520
partial, with respect to x.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.260
So let's do that.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.260
Let's figure out
this integral.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.890
I'll do it in blue So y
is just a constant.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.310
So the antiderivative of y
cosine of x, is just y sine of

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:04.020
x, plus-- either the y
is constant, so 2x.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.060
The antiderivative of 2x, with
respect to x, is x squared, so

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.920
it's x squared e to the y.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:18.440
And then plus some
function of y.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.540
And if you want to verify this,
you should take the

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.080
partial of this, with
respect to x.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.200
If you take the partial of
this, with respect to x,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.780
you're going to get this in
here, which is our function,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.310
M, up here.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.190
And then when you take the
partial of this, with respect

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.720
to x, you'll get 0, and
it'll get lost. OK, so

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.430
we're almost there.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.270
We've almost figured out our
psi, but we still need to

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.030
figure out this function of y.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.880
Well, we know that if we take
the partial of this, with

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.340
respect to y, since this
is an exact equation,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.210
we should get this.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.410
We should get our N function.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.150
So let's do that.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.540
So the partial-- I'll switch
notation, just to expose you

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.340
to it-- the partial psi, with
respect to y, is going to be

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.160
equal to-- so here, y sine
of x, sine of x is just a

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.420
constant. y is just y, so the
derivative of this, with

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.030
respect to y, is
just sine of x.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.300
Plus the derivative of e to the
y is e to the y. x squared

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.950
is just a constant.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:18.600
So it's just x squared e to
the y, plus-- what's the

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.120
partial of f of y, with
respect to y?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.900
It's going to be f prime of y.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.530
Well, what did we do?

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.230
We took M, we integrated with
respect to x, and we said,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.270
well, we might have lost some
function of y, so we added

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.060
that to it.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.740
And then we took the partial of
that side that we've almost

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.470
constructed, and we took
the partial of that,

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.040
with respect to y.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.940
Now, we know, since this is
exact, that that is going to

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.960
equal our N.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.670
So our N is up there.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.585
Cosine of x plus-- So that's
going to be equal to-- I want

00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:57.720
to make sure I can read it up
there-- to our N, right?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.390
Oh no, sorry.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.930
N is up here.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:00.540
Our N is up here.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.150
Sine of x-- let me write
that-- sine of x plus x

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.450
squared, e to the y, minus 1.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:13.760
So sine of x plus x squared,
e to the y, minus 1.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.350
That was just our N,
from our original

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.470
differential equation.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.720
And now we can solve
for f prime of y.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:31.010
So let's see, we get sine of x
plus x squared, e to the y,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:39.364
plus f prime of y, is equal to
sine of x plus x squared, e to

00:08:39.364 --> 00:08:42.150
the y, minus 1.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.600
So let's see, we can delete
sine of x from both sides.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.640
We can delete x squared e to
the y from both sides.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.740
And then what are
we left with?

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:55.750
We're left with f prime
of y is equal to 1.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:03.610
And then we're left with f of
y is equal to-- well, it

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:11.720
equals y plus some constant,
c, right?

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.350
So what is our psi now?

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.040
We wrote our psi up here, and we
had this f of y here, so we

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.600
can rewrite it now.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.640
So psi is a function of x and
y-- we're actually pretty much

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.240
almost done solving it-- psi
is a function of x and y is

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:41.010
equal to y sine of x, plus x
squared, e to the y, plus y--

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.860
oh, sorry, this is f prime
of y, minus 1.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.330
So this is a minus 1.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.350
So this is a minus y plus c.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.370
So this is going to be
a minus y plus c.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.560
So we've solved for psi.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.800
And so what does that tell us?

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.390
Well, we said that original
differential equation, up

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.390
here, using the partial
derivative chain rule, that

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.270
original differential equation,
can be rewritten now

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:10.740
as the derivative dx of psi is
equal to-- psi is a function

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.570
of x and y-- is equal to 0.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.560
Or if you were to integrate both
sides of this, you would

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:26.630
get that psi of xy is equal
to c is a solution of that

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.430
differential equation.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.020
So if we were to set this is
equal to c, that's the

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:30.700
differential equation.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:37.530
So we could say, y sine of x
plus x squared, e to the y,

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:42.890
minus y-- now we could say, plus
this c-- plus this c, you

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.990
call it c1, is equal to c2.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.143
Well, you could subtract the c's
from both sides, and just

00:10:47.143 --> 00:10:48.520
be left with a c at the end.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.380
But anyway, we have solved
this exact equation, one,

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.220
first, by recognizing it was
exact, by taking the partial

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.670
of this, with respect to y, and
seeing if that was equal

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.110
to the partial of N,
with respect to x.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.000
Once we saw that they were
equal, we're like, OK, this is

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.090
going to be exact.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.850
So let's figure out psi.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.340
Since this is exact, M is going
to be the partial of

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.000
psi, with respect to x.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.700
N is the partial of psi,
with respect to y.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.570
Then to figure out y, we
integrated M, with respect to

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.130
x, and we got this.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.500
But since we said, oh, well,
instead of a plus c, it could

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.520
have been a function of y there,
because we took the

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.140
partial, with respect to x, so
this might have been lost. To

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.100
figure out the function of y,
we then took our psi that we

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.960
figured out, took the partial
of that, with

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.290
respect to y, got this.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.450
And we said, this was an exact
equation, so this is going to

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.710
equal our N of x y.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.750
We set those equal to each
other, and then we

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.420
solved for f of y.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.690
And then we had our final psi.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.320
Our final psi was this.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.500
And then the differential
equation, because of the chain

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.270
rule of partial derivatives,
we could rewrite the

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.330
differential equation as this.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.000
The solution is this, and so
this is the solution to our

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.510
differential equation.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.780
See you in the next video.
