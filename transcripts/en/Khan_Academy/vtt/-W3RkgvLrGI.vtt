00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.500
We'll now use that equation we
just derived to go back and

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.980
solve-- or at least address--
that same problem we were

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.510
doing before, so let's write
that equation down again.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.660
Actually, let's write
the problem down.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.140
Lets say I have the cliff
again, and so my initial

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.750
distance is 0, but it goes
down 500 meters.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.230
I'm not going to redraw the
cliff, because it takes a lot

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.260
of space up on my limited
chalkboard.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.440
We know that the change
in distance is equal

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.659
to minus 500 meters.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.100
I'm still going to use the
example where I don't just

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.070
drop the ball, or the penny, or
whatever I'm throwing off

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.270
the cliff, but I actually throw
it straight up, so it's

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.145
going to go up and slow down
from gravity, and then it will

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:46.370
go to 0 velocity, and start
accelerating downwards.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.275
You could even say decelerating

00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:48.930
in the other direction.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:59.780
The initial velocity, vi, is
equal to 30 meters per second,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.730
and of course, we know that the
acceleration is equal to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.530
minus 10 meters per second
squared-- it's because

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.200
acceleration gravity is always
pulling downwards, or towards

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.260
the center of our planet.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.150
If we wanted to figure out the
final velocity, we could have

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
just used the formula, and we
did this in the last video--

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.340
vf squared is equal to
vi squared plus 2ad.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.900
Now what I want to do is use the
formula that we learned in

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.260
the very last video to figure
out-- how long does it take to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.680
get to the bottom, and
to hit the ground?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.350
Let's use that formula: we
derived that the change in

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.720
distance is equal to the initial
velocity times time

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.570
plus acceleration time
squared over 2, and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.200
that's initial velocity.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.550
The change in distance is minus
500, and that's equal to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.410
the initial velocity-- that's
positive, going upwards, 30

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.300
meters per second, 30t.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.600
I'm not going to write the units
right now, because I'll

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.030
run out of space, but you can
redo it with the units, and

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.550
see that the units
do work out.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.009
When you square time, you have
to square the time units,

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.792
although we're solving
for time.

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:18.250
Then, plus acceleration, and
acceleration is minus 10, and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.850
we're going to divided it by 2,
so it's minus 5t squared.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.520
We have minus 500 is equal to
30t plus minus 5t, and we

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.000
could just say minus
5t squared, and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.270
get rid of this plus.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.150
At first, you say, Sal-- there's
a t, that's t to the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.600
first, and t to the second,
how do I saw solve this?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.310
Hopefully, you've taken algebra
two or algebra one, in

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.430
some places, and you remember
how to solve this.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.310
Otherwise, you're about to learn
the quadratic equation,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.150
although I recommend you go
back, and learn about

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.430
factoring in the quadratic
equation, which there are

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.280
videos on that I've
put on Youtube.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.570
I hope you watch those first
if you don't remember.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.080
We can do this-- let's put these
two right terms on the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.810
left hand side, and then we'll
use the quadratic equation to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.625
solve, because I don't think
this is easy to factor.

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:14.020
We'll get 5t squared minus 30t
minus 500 is equal to 0-- I

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.060
just took these terms and put
them on the left side.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.580
We could divide both sides by
5, just to simplify things,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.740
and so we get t squared minus
6t minus 100 is equal to 0.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.160
I could do that, because 0
divided by 5 is just five, so

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.220
I just cleaned it
up a little bit.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.130
Let's use the quadratic
equation, and for those of us

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.840
who need a refresher,
I'll write it down.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.740
The roots of any quadratic--
in this case, it's t we're

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.060
solving for-- t will equal
negative b plus or minus the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:56.770
square root of b squared minus
4ac over 2a, where a is a

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.990
coefficient on this term, b is
the coefficient on this term,

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.900
negative 6, and c is the
constant, so minus 100.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.830
Let's just solve.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.190
We get t is equal to negative
b-- so negative this term.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.850
This term is negative 6, so if
we make it a negative, it

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.380
becomes plus 6.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.305
It becomes 6 plus or minus the
square root of b squared, so

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:33.130
it's minus 6 squared, 36,
minus 4 times a, and the

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.826
coefficient on a is here,
and that's just times 1.

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:42.810
With 4ac, c is a constant term,
minus 100, minus 4 times

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:51.250
1 times minus 100, and all of
that is over 2a-- a is 1

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.010
agains, so all of
that is over 2.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.140
That just equals 6 plus or minus
the square root-- this

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.470
is minus 4 times minus 100, and
these become pluses, so it

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.490
becomes 36 plus 400.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:15.180
So, 6 plus or minus
436 divided by 2.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.680
This is not a clean number,
and if you type into a

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.050
calculator, it's something on
the order of about 20.9.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.730
We can just say approximately
21-- you might want to get the

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.710
exact number, if you're actually
doing this on a test,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.880
or trying to send something to
Mars, but for our purposes, I

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.420
think you'll get the point.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.080
I'll say it approximately now,
because we're going to be a

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.210
little off, but just to have
clean numbers, this is

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.540
approximately 21--
it's like 20.9.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.260
We'll say 6 plus or minus--
let me just write

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:52.410
20.9-- 20.9 over 2.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.250
Let me ask you a question:
if I do 6 minus

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.940
20.9, what do I get?

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.770
I get a negative number,
and does a

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.340
negative time make sense?

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.120
No, it does not, and that means
that somehow in the

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.100
past-- I don't want to get
philosophical-- the negative

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.360
time in this context will
not make sense.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.342
Really, we can just stick to the
plus, because 6 minus 20

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:20.540
is negative, so there's only one
time that will solve this

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.570
in a meaningful way.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:28.900
Time is approximately equal to
6 plus 20.9, so that's 26.9

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:39.690
over 2, and that equals
13.45 seconds.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.670
That's interesting.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.490
I think if you remember way
back, maybe four or five

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.110
videos ago, when we first did
this problem, we just dropped

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.530
the penny straight
from the height.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.095
Actually, in that problem, I
gave you the time-- I said it

00:06:52.095 --> 00:06:54.790
took 10 seconds to hit the
ground, and we worked

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.660
backwards to figure out that the
cliff was 500 meters high.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.660
Now, if you're here at the top
of a 500 cliff, or building,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.970
and you drop something that has
air resistance-- like a

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.700
penny, that has very air
resistance-- it would take 10

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.060
seconds to reach the ground,
assuming all of our

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.000
assumptions about gravity.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.280
But if you were to throw the
penny straight up, off the

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.470
edge of the cliff, at 30 meters
per second right here,

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.720
it's going to take 13.5--
roughly, 13 and 1/2 seconds--

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.680
to reach the ground.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.460
It takes a little bit longer,
and that should make sense

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.230
because-- I have time to
draw a little picture.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:43.040
In the first case, I just took
the penny, and its motion just

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.220
went straight down.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:51.310
In the second case, I took the
penny-- it first went up, and

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.930
then it went down.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.600
It had all the time when it went
up, and then it went down

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.310
a longer distance, so it makes
sense that this time-- this

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:09.950
was 10 seconds, while this time
was 13.45 five seconds.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.310
You can kind of say that it
took-- well, you actually

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.920
can't say that.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.000
I don't want to get too
involved, but I hopefully this

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.710
make sense to you.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.620
If you have a smaller number
here, you should have gone and

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.600
checked your work, because why
would it take less time when I

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.030
throw the object straight up?

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.370
Hopefully, that gave you a
little bit more intuition, and

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.620
you really do have in your
arsenal now all of the

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.049
equations-- and hopefully, the
intuition you need-- to solve

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:41.480
basic projectile problems.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.960
I'll now probably do a couple
more videos where I just do a

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.580
bunch of problems, just to
really drive the points home.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.570
Then, I'll expand these
problems to two

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.700
dimensions and angles.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.510
Before we get there, you might
want to refresh your

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.440
trigonometry.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.060
I'll see you soon.
