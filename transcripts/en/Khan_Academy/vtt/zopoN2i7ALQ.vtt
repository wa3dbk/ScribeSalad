00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
 

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.370
What I want to do in this video
is try to understand how

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.960
two proteins can interact with
each other in conjunction with

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.210
ATP to actually produce
mechanical motion.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.320
And the reason why I want to
do this-- one, it occurs

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.570
outside of muscle cells as well,
but this is really going

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.025
to be the first video on really
how muscles work.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:23.310
And then we'll talk about how
nerves actually stimulate

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.080
muscles to work.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.580
So it'll all build up
from this video.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.000
So what I've done here is I've
copy and pasted two images of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.480
proteins from Wikipedia.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.470
This is myosin.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.110
It's actually myosin II because
you actually have two

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.410
strands of the myosin protein.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.150
They're interwound around each
other so you can see it's this

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.040
very complex looking protein or
enzyme, however you want to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.696
talk about it.

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:48.430
I'll tell you why it's called
an enzyme-- because it

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.030
actually helps react ATP into
ADP and phosphate groups.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.460
So that's why it's
called an ATPase.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.150
It's a subclass of the
ATPase enzymes.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.530
This right here is actin.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.850
What we're going to see in
this video is how myosin

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.920
essentially uses the ATP to
essentially crawl along.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.830
You can almost view it as an
actin rope and that's what

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.790
creates mechanical energy.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.490
So let me draw it.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.240
I'll actually draw it on
this actin right here.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.280
So let's say we have one
of these myosin heads.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.740
So when I say a myosin head,
this is one of the myosin

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.140
heads right here and then it's
connected, it's interwound,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.060
it's woven around.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.630
This is the other one and it
winds around that way.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.900
Now let's just say we're
just dealing with one

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.730
of the myosin heads.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.050
Let's say it's in
this position.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.450
Let me see how well
I can draw it.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.370
Let's say it starts off in a
position that looks like that

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.650
and then this is kind of the
tail part that connects to

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.480
some other structural and we'll
talk about that in more

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.580
detail, but this is my myosin
head right there in its

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.490
starting position, not
doing anything.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.990
Now, ATP can come along and bond
to this myosin head, this

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.940
enzyme, this protein,
this ATPase enzyme.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.210
So let me draw some ATP.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.820
So ATP comes along and bonds
to this guy right here.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.850
Let's say that's the-- and it's
not going to be this big

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.940
relative to the protein,
but this is just to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.240
give you the idea.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.120
So soon as the ATP binds to its
appropriate site on this

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.400
enzyme or protein, the enzyme,
it detaches from the actin.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.520
So let me write this down.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:44.560
So one, ATP binds to myosin
head and as soon as that

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:58.390
happens, that causes the myosin
to release actin.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.720
So that's step one.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.050
So I start it off with this guy
just touching the actin,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.570
the ATP comes, and
it gets released.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.570
So in the next step-- so after
that step, it's going to look

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.815
something like this--
and I want to draw

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:11.990
it in the same place.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.300
After the next step,
it's going to look

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.810
something like this.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.060
It will have released.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.910
 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.160
So now it looks something like
that and you have the ATP

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.870
attached to it still.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.970
I know it might be a little
bit convoluted when I keep

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.450
writing over the same thing,
but you have the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.610
ATP attached to it.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.320
Now the next step-- the ATP
hydrolizes, the phosphate gets

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.430
pulled off of it.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.330
This is an ATPase enzyme.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.320
That's what it does.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.570
Let me write that down.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:54.250
 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.670
And what that does, that
releases the energy to cock

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.030
this myosin protein into kind
of a high energy state.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.370
So let me do step two.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.310
This thing-- it gets
hydrolized.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.250
It releases energy.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.500
We know that ATP is the energy
currency of biological

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.290
systems. So it releases
energy.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.579
I'm drawing it as a little spark
or explosion, but you

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.010
can really imagine it's changing
the conformation of--

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.540
it kind of spring-loads this
protein right here to go into

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.750
a state so it's ready to
crawl along the myosin.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.500
So in step two-- plus energy,
energy and then this-- you can

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.500
say it cocks the myosin
protein or

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.410
enzyme to high energy.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.940
You can imagine it winds the
spring, or loads the spring.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.650
 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.820
And conformation for proteins
just mean shape.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.970
So step two-- what happens is
the phosphate group gets--

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.830
they're still attached, but
it gets detached from

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.950
the rest of the ATP.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.770
So that becomes ADP and that
energy changes the

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.420
conformation so that this
protein now goes into a

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.230
position that looks like this.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.545
So this is where we end up
at the end of step two.

00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:27.490
Let me make sure
I do it right.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.130
So at the end of step
two, it might look

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.380
something like this.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.860
 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.930
So the end of step two,
the protein looks

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.560
something like this.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.260
This is in its cocked
position.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.670
It has a lot of energy
right now.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.620
It's wound up in
this position.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.500
You still have your ADP.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.810
You still have your-- that's
your adenosine and let's say

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.780
you have your two phosphate
groups on the ADP and you

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.560
still have one phosphate
group right there.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.490
Now, when that phosphate group
releases-- so let me write

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.040
this as step three.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.380
Remember, when we started, we
were just sitting here.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.190
The ATP binds on step one--
actually, it does definitely

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.440
bind, at the end of step one,
that causes the myosin protein

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.880
to get released.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.060
Then after step one, we
naturally have step two.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.470
The ATP hydrolyzes into
ADP phosphate.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.850
That releases energy and that
allows the myosin protein to

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.230
get cocked into this high energy
position and kind of

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.620
attach, you can think of
it, to the next rung

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.480
of our actin filament.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.965
Now we're in a high
energy state.

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:47.160
 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.700
In step three, the phosphate
releases.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:57.750
 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.980
The phosphate is released from
myosin in step three.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.170
That's step three right there.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.260
That's a phosphate group
being released.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.320
And what this does is, this
releases that energy of that

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.150
cocked position and it causes
this myosin protein

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.290
to push on the actin.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.730
This is the power stroke, if
you imagine in an engine.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.070
This is what's causing the
mechanical movement.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.390
So when the phosphate group is
actually released-- remember,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.470
the original release
is when you take

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.430
ATP to ADP in a phosphate.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.030
That put it in this
spring-loaded position.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.925
When the phosphate releases it,
this releases the spring.

00:07:32.925 --> 00:07:41.090
 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.430
And what that does is it pushes
on the actin filament.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:49.930
 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.720
So you could view this
as the power stroke.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.750
We're actually creating
mechanical energy.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.130
So depending on which one you
want to view as fixed-- if you

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.930
view the actin as fixed,
whatever myosin is attached to

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.360
it would move to the left.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.530
If you imagine the myosin being
fixed, the actin and

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.190
whatever it's attached to
would move to the right,

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.900
either way.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.540
But this is where
we fundamentally

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.950
get the muscle action.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:16.295
And then step four-- you
have the ADP released.

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:21.170
 

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.960
And then we're exactly where
we were before we did step

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.260
one, except we're just one rung
further to the left on

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.890
the actin molecule.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.530
So to me, this is
pretty amazing.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.000
We actually are seeing how ATP
energy can be used to-- we're

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.570
going from chemical energy
or bond energy in ATP to

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.820
mechanical energy.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.060
 

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.080
For me, that's amazing because
when I first learned about

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.640
ATP-- people say, you use ATP to
do everything in your cells

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.650
and contract muscles.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.350
Well, gee, how do you go from
bond energy to actually

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.850
contracting things, to actually
doing what we see in

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.010
our everyday world as
mechanical energy?

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.390
And this is really where
it all occurs.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.140
This is really the core issue
that's going on here.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.110
And you have to say, well, gee,
how this thing change

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.290
shape and all that?

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.320
And you have to remember,
these proteins, based on

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.240
what's bonded to it and
what's not bonded to

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.260
it, they change shape.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.810
And some of those shapes take
more energy to attain, and

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.610
then if you do the right things,
that energy can be

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.440
released and then it can
push another protein.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.920
But I find this just
fascinating.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.100
And now we can build up from
this actin and myosin

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.930
interactions to understand how
muscles actually work.
