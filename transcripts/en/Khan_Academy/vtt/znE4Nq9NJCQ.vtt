00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.440
We're now ready to solve
non-homogeneous second-order

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.440
linear differential equations
with constant coefficients.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.870
So what does all that mean?

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.870
Well, it means an equation
that looks like this.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.760
A times the second derivative
plus B times the first

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.990
derivative plus C times the
function is equal to g of x.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.390
Before I show you an actual
example, I want to show you

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.310
something interesting.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.630
That the general solution of
this non-homogeneous equation

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.770
is actually the general solution
of the homogeneous

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.030
equation plus a particular
solution.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.920
I'll explain what that
means in a second.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.340
So let's say that h
is a solution of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.425
the homogeneous equation.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.790
And that worked out well,
because, h for homogeneous.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.593
h is solution for homogeneous.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.320
There should be some shorthand
notation for homogeneous.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.880
So what does that mean?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.700
That means that A times the
second derivative of h plus B

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.670
times h prime plus C times
h is equal to 0.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.980
That's what I mean when I say
that h is a solution-- and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.570
actually, let's just say that h
is the general solution for

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.190
this homogeneous equation.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.790
And we know how to solve that.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.000
Take the characteristic equation
depending on how many

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.030
roots it has and whether they're
real or complex.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.310
You can figure out a
general solution.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190
And then if you have initial
conditions, you can substitute

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.940
them and get the values
of the constants.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.970
Fair enough.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.060
Now let's say that I were to
say that g is a solution.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.450
Well no, I already
used g up here.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.770
Well, I don't like
using vowels.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.930
Let's say j.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.860
Let's say j is a particular
solution to this

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.790
differential equation.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.520
So what does that mean?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.585
That means that A times j prime
prime plus B times j

00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:09.410
prime plus C times j
is equal to g of x.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.789
Right?

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:20.150
So we're just defining j of x
to be a particular solution.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.150
Now what I want to show you is
that j of x plus h of x is

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.820
also going to be a solution
to this original equation.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.730
And that it's the general
solution for this

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.040
non-homogeneous equation.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.800
And before I just do it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.380
mathematically, what's the intuition?

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.200
Well, when you substitute
h here, you get 0.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.340
When you substitute j here,
you get g of x.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.300
So when you add them together,
you're going to get

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.950
0 plus g of x here.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.930
So you're going to
get g of x here.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.120
And I'll show you
that right now.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.350
So let's say I wanted to
substitute h plus j here.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.985
And I'll do it in a
different color.

00:03:02.985 --> 00:03:06.460
A-- so the second derivative
of the sum of those two

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.520
functions is going to be the
second derivative of both of

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:16.090
them summed up-- plus B times
the first derivative of the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.490
sum plus C times the sum
of the functions.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.970
And my goal is to show that
this is equal to g of x.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.600
So what is this simplified to?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.990
Well if we take all the h terms,
we get Ah prime prime

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:39.978
plus Bh prime plus Ch plus,
let's do all the j terms. Aj

00:03:39.978 --> 00:03:48.800
prime prime plus Bj
prime plus Cj.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.710
Well by definition of how
we defined h and j, what

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.260
is this equal to?

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.360
We said that h is a solution for
the homogeneous equation,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.610
or that this expression
is equal to 0.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.820
So that equals 0.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.910
And by our definition for
j, what does this equal?

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.210
We said j is a particular
solution for the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.830
non-homogeneous equation, or
that this expression is

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.080
equal to g of x.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.680
So when you substitute h plus
j into this differential

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.600
equation on the left-hand
side.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.740
On the right-hand side, true
enough, you get g of x.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.190
So we've just shown that if you
define h and j this way,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.380
that the function, we'll call
it k of x is equal to h of x

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.490
plus j of x.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.390
I'm running out of space.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.290
That is the general solution.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.830
I haven't proven that is the
most general solution, but I

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.630
think you have the
intuition, right?

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.150
Because the general solution
on the homogeneous one that

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.950
was the most general solution,
and now we're adding a

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.240
particular solution that gets
you the g of x on the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.620
right-hand side.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.830
That might be very confusing to
you, so let's actually try

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.470
to do it with some
real numbers.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.190
And I think it'll make
a lot more sense.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.100
Let's say we have the
differential equations-- and

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.970
I'm going to teach you a
technique now for figuring out

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.690
that j in that last example.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.500
So how do you figure out that
particular solution?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.840
Let's say I have the
differential equation the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.910
second derivative of y minus 3
times the first derivative

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.860
minus 4 times y is equal
to 3e to the 2x.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.260
So, the first step is we want
the general solution of the

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.660
homogeneous equation.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.620
And in that example I just
did, that would have

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.250
been our h of x.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.310
So we want the solution of y
prime prime minus 3y prime

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.850
minus 4y is equal to 0.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.060
Take the characteristic
equation.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.030
This 4 is equal to 0.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:02.950
r minus 4 times r plus
1 is equal to 0.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.760
2 roots, r could be
4 or negative 1.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.610
And so our general solution--
I'll call that h.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.520
Well, let's call
that y general.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.060
y sub g.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.440
So our general solution is equal
to-- and we've done this

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.810
many times-- C1 e to the 4x
plus C2 e to the minus

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.660
1x, or minus x.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.640
Fair enough.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.210
So we solved the homogeneous
equation.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.260
So how do we get, in that last
example, a j of x that will

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.820
give us a particular
solution, so on the

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.030
right-hand side we get this.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.370
Well here we just have to
think a little bit.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.320
And this method is called The
Method of Undetermined

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.900
Coefficients.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.260
And you have to say, well, if
I want some function where I

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.510
take a second derivative and
add that or subtracted some

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.610
multiple of its first derivative
minus some multiple

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.670
of the function, I
get e to the 2x.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.890
That function and its
derivatives and its second

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.860
derivatives must be something
of the form, something

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.550
times e to the 2x.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.840
So essentially we
take a guess.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.770
We say well what does it look
like when we take the various

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.270
derivatives and the functions
and we multiply multiples of

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.410
it plus each other?

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.170
And all of that.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.230
We would get e the to 2x or some
multiple of e to the 2x.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.970
Well, a good guess could just be
that j-- well I'll call it

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.460
y particular.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.100
Our particular solution here
could be that-- and particular

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.170
solution I'm using a little
different than the particular

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.510
solution when we had
initial conditions.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.400
Here we can view this as
a particular solution.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.680
A solution that gives us this
on the right-hand side.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.450
So let's say that the one I pick
is some constant A times

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.526
e to the 2x.

00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:56.100
If that's my guess, then the
derivative of that is equal to

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.450
2Ae the to 2x.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.490
And the second derivative of
that, of my particular

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:07.310
solution, is equal
to 4Ae to the 2x.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.440
And now I can substitute in
here, and let's see if I can

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.740
solve for A, and then I'll have
my particular solution.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.030
So the second derivitive,
that's this.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:21.660
So I get 4Ae to the 2x minus 3
times the first derivitive.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.760
So minus 3 times this.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:30.550
So that's minus 6Ae to the 2x
minus 4 times the function.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:36.750
So minus 4Ae to the 2x, and
all of that is going to be

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.929
equal to 3e to the 2x.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.140
Well we know e to the 2x equal
0, so we can divide

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.150
both sides by that.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.120
Just factor it out, really.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.970
Get rid of all of the
e's to the 2x.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.340
On the left-hand side, we
have 4A and a minus 4A.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.300
Well, those cancel out.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.540
And then lo and behold, we have
minus 6A is equal to 3.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.400
Divide both sides by 6 and get
A is equal to minus 1/2.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:03.940
So there.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.330
We have our particular
solution.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:11.710
It is equal to minus
1/2 e to the 2x.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.640
And now, like I just showed
you before I cleared the

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.390
screen, our general solution
of this non-homogeneous

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.650
equation is going to be our
particular solution plus the

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.790
general solution to the
homogeneous equation.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.170
So we can call this
the most general

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.770
solution-- I don't know.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.360
I'll just call it y.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:41.230
It is our general solution C1e
to the 4x plus C2e to the

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.300
minus x plus our particular
solution we found.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:51.840
So that's minus 1/2e
to the 2x.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.300
Pretty neat.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.780
Anyway, I'll do a couple
more examples of this.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.790
And I think you'll get
the hang of it.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.560
In the next examples, we'll do
something other than an e to

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.260
the 2x or an e function here.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.750
We'll try to do stuff with
polynomials and trig

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.860
functions as well.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.440
I'll see you in the
next video.
