00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.150
Let's apply everything we've
learned to an actual

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.390
differential equation.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.850
Instead of just taking Laplace
transforms and taking their

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.940
inverse, let's actually
solve a problem.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.880
So let's say that I have the
second derivative of my

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:22.550
function y plus 4 times my
function y is equal to sine of

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:36.370
t minus the unit step function
0 up until 2 pi of t times

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.890
sine of t minus 2 pi.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.120
Let's solve this differential
equation, an

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.870
interpretation of it.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.950
And I actually do a whole
playlist on interpretations of

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.440
differential equations and how
you model it, but you know,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.490
you can kind of view this
is a forcing function.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.830
That it's a weird forcing
function of this being applied

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.280
to some weight with, you
know, this is the

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.470
acceleration term, right?

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.490
The second derivative with
respect to time is the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.290
acceleration.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.540
So the mass would be 1 whatever
units, and then as a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.340
function of its position, this
is probably some type of

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.150
spring constant.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.210
Anyway, I won't go there.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.650
I don't want to waste your time
with the interpretation

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.860
of it, but let's solve it.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.600
We can do more about
interpretations later.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600
So we're going take the Laplace
transform of both

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.340
sides of this equation.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.550
So what's the Laplace
transform of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.610
the left-hand side?

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.680
So the Laplace transform of the
second derivative of y is

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.530
just s squared, so now I'm
taking the Laplace transform

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.880
of just that.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.570
The Laplace transform of s
squared times the Laplace

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.110
transform of y minus-- lower the
degree there once-- minus

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.170
s times y of 0 minus
y prime of 0.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.520
So clearly, I must have to
give you some initial

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.980
conditions in order to
do this properly.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:05.490
And then plus 4 times the
Laplace transform of y is

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.979
equal to-- what's the Laplace
transform of sine of t?

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.690
That should be second
nature by now.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.530
It's just 1 over s
squared plus 1.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.160
And then we have minus
the Laplace

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.790
transform of this thing.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.390
And I'll do a little side note
here to figure out the Laplace

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.020
transform of this thing
right here.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.630
And we know, I showed it to you
a couple of videos ago, we

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.320
showed that the Laplace
transform-- actually I could

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.370
just write it out here.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.290
This is going to be the same
thing as the Laplace transform

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.510
of sine of t, but we're going to
have to multiply it by e to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.130
the minus-- if you remember that
last formula-- e to the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.520
minus cs, where c is 2 pi.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.480
Actually, let me write
that down.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.720
I decided to write it down,
then I decided, oh, no, I

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.080
don't want to do this.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.110
But let me write that.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.940
So the Laplace transform of the
unit step function that

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.950
goes up to c times some function
shifted by c is equal

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.240
to e to the minus cs times the
Laplace transform of just the

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.510
original function times the
Laplace transform of f of t.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.600
So if we're taking the Laplace
transform of this

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.330
thing, our c is 2 pi.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.690
Our f of t is just
sine of t, right?

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.240
So then this is just going to
be equal to-- if we just do

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.630
this piece right here-- it's
going to be equal to e to the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:53.480
minus cs-- our c is 2 pi-- e to
the minus 2 pi s times the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.270
Laplace transform of f of t. f
of t is just sine of t before

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.120
we shifted.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.340
This is f of t minus 2 pi.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.090
So f of t is just going
to be sine of t.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.340
So it's going to be times
1 over s squared plus 1.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.860
This is the Laplace transform
of sine of t.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.000
So let's go back to where
we had left off.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.490
So we've taken the Laplace
transform of both sides of

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.490
this equation.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.870
And clearly, I have some initial
conditions here, so

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.420
the problem must have given me
some and I just forgot to

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.290
write them down.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.190
So let's see, the initial
conditions I'm given, and they

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.150
are written kind of in the
margin here, they tell us--

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.340
I'll do it in orange, they tell
us that y of 0 is equal

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.310
to 0, and y prime of
0 is equal to 0.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.090
That makes the math easy.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.110
That's 0 and that's 0.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.550
So let's see if I can simplify
my equation.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.290
So the left-hand side,
let's factor

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.920
out the Laplace transform.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.440
So let's factor out this
term and that term.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.760
So we get the Laplace transform
of y times this plus

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.740
this times s squared plus 4 is
equal to the right-hand side.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.130
And what's the right-hand
side?

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.570
We could simplify this.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.650
Well, I'll just write it out.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.170
I don't want to do too
many steps at once.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:30.180
It's 1 over s squared plus 1
and then plus-- or minus

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.420
actually, this is a minus--
minus the Laplace transfer of

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:39.010
this thing, which was e to
the minus 2 pi s over s

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.720
squared plus 1.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.190
So if we divide both sides of
this equation by the s squared

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:55.650
plus 4, then we get the Laplace
transform of y is

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.620
equal to-- and actually, I
can just merge these two.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.810
They're the same denominator.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.700
So before I even divide by
s squared plus 4, that

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.090
right-hand side will
look like this.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.410
It will look like with a
denominator of s squared plus

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:19.280
1 and you have a numerator of 1
minus e to the minus 2 pi s.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.150
And, of course, we're dividing
both sides of this equation by

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.260
s squared plus 4, so we're going
to have to stick that s

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.150
squared plus 4 over here.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.610
Now, we're at the hard part.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.910
In order to figure out why, we
have to take the inverse

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.140
Laplace transform
of this thing.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.620
So how do we take the
inverse Laplace

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.720
transform of this thing?

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.400
That's where the hard part is
always, you know, it makes

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.060
solving the differential
equation's easy if you know

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.213
the Laplace transforms. So it
looks like we're going to have

00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:48.040
to do some partial fraction
expansion.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.290
So let's see if we
can do that.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.675
So we can rewrite this
equation right here.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.670
Actually, let's write it as
this, because this'll kind of

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.250
simplify our work.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.710
Let's factor this
whole thing out.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.370
So we're going to write it as 1
minus e to the minus 2 pi s,

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.340
all of that times-- I'll do it
in orange-- all of that times

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:21.940
1 over s squared plus 1 times
s squared plus 4.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.410
Now, we need to do some partial
fraction expansion to

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.430
simplify this thing
right here.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.260
We're going to do this
on the side.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.390
Maybe I should do this over
on the right here.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:38.300
This thing-- let me rewrite it--
1 over s squared plus 1

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.990
times s squared plus 4 should be
able to be rewritten as two

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:50.100
separate fractions, s squared
plus 1 and s squared plus 4,

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.680
with the numerators.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.070
This one would be As plus B.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.770
It's going to have to have
degree 1, because

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.600
this is degree 2.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.700
Here And then we'd
have Cs plus D.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:11.360
And so when you add these two
things up, you get As plus B

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:23.000
times s squared plus 4 plus Cs
plus D times s squared plus 1,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.870
all of that over the
common denominator.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.330
We've seen this story before.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.650
We just have to do some
algebra here.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.520
As you can tell, these
differential equations

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.190
problems, they require
a lot of stamina.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.830
You kind of just have to say I
will keep moving forward and

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.700
do the algebra that I need to do
in order to get the answer.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.950
And you kind of have to get
excited about that notion that

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.570
you have all this
algebra to do.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.660
So let's figure it out.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:09:00.200
So this top can be simplified
to As to the third plus Bs

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:10.570
squared plus 4As plus 4B.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:19.330
And then this one, you end up
with Cs to the third plus Ds

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:27.850
squared plus Cs plus D.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.350
So when you add of these up
together, you get-- and this

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.410
is all the algebra that we have
to do, for better, for

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:43.510
worse-- A plus C over s to the
third plus B plus D times s

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:49.920
squared plus 4A plus C times s--
let's scroll over a little

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.770
bit-- plus 4B plus D.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.730
And now we just have to say,
OK, all of this is equal to

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.710
this thing up here.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.770
This is the numerator.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.140
We just simplified
the numerator.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.050
This is the numerator.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.840
That's the numerator
right there.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.740
And all of this is going to be
over your original s squared

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.280
plus 1 times your s
squared plus 4.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.150
And we established that this
thing should be-- let me just

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:23.610
write this-- that 1 over s
squared plus 1 times s squared

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.240
plus 4 should equal
this thing.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.010
And then you just pattern match
on the coefficients.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.420
This is all just intense partial
fraction expansion.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.190
And you say, look, A plus C is
the coefficient of the s cubed

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.610
terms. I don't see any
s cubed terms here.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:43.180
So A plus C must
be equal to 0.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.070
And then you see, OK, B plus D
is the coefficient of the s

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.010
squared terms. I don't see any
s squared terms there.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:53.670
So B plus D must
be equal to 0.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.220
4A plus C, the coefficient of
the s terms. I don't see any s

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.070
terms over here.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.080
So 4A plus C must
be equal to 0.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.490
And then we're almost done.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.490
4B plus D must be the constant
terms. There is a constant

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.530
term there.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.465
So 4B plus D is equal to 1.

00:11:10.465 --> 00:11:12.490
So let's see if we can
do anything here.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:17.680
If we subtract this from that,
we get minus 3A is equal to 0,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.160
or A is equal to 0.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.840
If A is equal to 0, then
C is equals to 0.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.720
And let's see what
we can get here.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:31.010
If we subtract this from
that, we get minus 3B.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.020
The D's cancel out.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.290
It's equal to minus 1,
or B is equal to 1/3.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.470
And then, of course, we have D
is equal to minus B, if you

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.550
subtract B from both sides.
so D is equal to 1/3.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.960
So all of that work, and
we actually have a

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.400
pretty simple result.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:12:00.660
Our equation, this thing here,
can be rewritten as-- the A

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.630
disappeared.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:06.130
It's 1/3 over s squared
plus 1.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.490
B was the coefficient on the--
let me make it very clear.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.230
B was the coefficient on the--
or it was a term on top of the

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.400
s squared plus 1, so that's
why I'm using B there.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.730
And then D is minus B,
so D is minus 1.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:23.510
So let me make sure
I have that.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:29.060
B is 1/3 minus-- let me make
sure I get that right.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.260
D is 1/3.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:36.830
So, sorry, B as in boy is
1/3, so D is minus 1/3.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.930
So B, there's a term on top
of the s squared plus 1.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.560
And then you have minus D over
the minus 1/3 over s

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.510
squared plus 4.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.560
This takes a lot of stamina
to record this video.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.370
I hope you appreciate it.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.090
OK, so let me rewrite
everything, just so we can get

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.450
back to the problem because
when you take the partial

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.740
fraction detour, you forget--
not even to speak of the

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.620
problem, you forget
what day it is.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.810
Let's see, so you get the
Laplace transform of y is

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:20.060
equal to 1 minus e to the minus
2 pi s times what that

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.673
mess that we just solved
for, times-- and I'll

00:13:23.673 --> 00:13:24.360
write it like this.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:34.440
1/3 times 1 over s squared
plus 1 minus 1/3 times--

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.470
actually, let me write
it this way.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.190
Because I have this s squared
plus 4, so I really want to

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.880
have a 2 there.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.680
So I want to have a 2 in the
numerator, so you want to have

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.825
a 2 over s squared plus 4.

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:48.690
So if I put a 2 in the numerator
there, I have to

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.440
divide this by 2 as well.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.140
So let me change this to a 6.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.690
Minus 1/6 times 2
is minus 1/3.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.800
So I did that just so I get
this in the form of the

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.860
Laplace transform
of sine of t.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.920
Now, let's see if there's
anything that

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.090
I can do from here.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.640
This is an epic problem.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.750
I'll be amazed if I don't
make a careless

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.320
mistake while I do this.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.170
So we can rewrite everything.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.280
Let's see if we can
simplify this.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.880
And by simplifying it, I'm just
going to make it longer.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:28.400
We can write the Laplace
transform of y is equal to--

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.640
I'm just going to multiply the
1 out, and then I'm going to

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.660
multiply the e to the
minus 2 pi s out.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:39.540
So if you multiply the 1 out,
you get 1/3 times 1 over s

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.840
squared plus 1-- I'm just
multiplying the 1 out-- minus

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:50.060
1/6-- these are all the 1's
times the 1-- times 2 over s

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.020
squared plus 4.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.660
And then I'm going to multiply
the minus e.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.670
Let me just switch colors,
do the minus e.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:06.820
So then you get minus e to the
minus 2 pi s over 3 times 1

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.430
over s squared plus 1.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.860
And then the minus and the minus
cancel out, so you get

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:20.680
plus e to the minus 2 pi
s over 6 times 2 over s

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.680
squared plus 4.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.630
Now, taking the inverse Laplace
transform of these

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.800
things are pretty
straightforward.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.580
So let's do that.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.000
Let's take the inverse Laplace
transform of the whole thing.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.280
And we get y is equal to the
inverse Laplace transform of

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:44.390
this guy right here, is just 1/3
sine of t-- I don't have

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.330
to write a parentheses there--
sine of t, and then this is

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:56.590
minus 1/6 times-- this
is the Laplace

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:57.840
transform of sine of 2t.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.730
That's that term right there.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.410
Now, these are almost the same,
but we have this little

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.700
pesky character over here.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.250
We have this e to the
minus 2 pi s.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.486
And there, we just have to
remind ourselves-- I'll write

00:16:12.486 --> 00:16:13.550
it here in the bottom.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.520
We just have to remind ourselves
that the Laplace

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:21.380
transform of the unit step
function-- I'll put the pi

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:28.470
there, just 2 pi times f of t
minus 2 pi-- I should put as

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:36.260
the step function of t-- is
equal to e to the minus 2 pi s

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.865
times the Laplace transform of
just-- or let me just write it

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:45.860
this way-- times the Laplace
transform of f of t.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.040
So if we view f of t as just
sine of t or sine of 2t, then

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.290
we can kind of backwards
pattern match.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.790
And we'll have to shift
it and multiply it by

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.500
the unit step function.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.050
So I want to make that clear.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.690
If you didn't have this guy
here, the inverse Laplace

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.010
transform of this guy would be
the same thing as this guy.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.110
It'd just be sine of t.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.210
The inverse Laplace transform
of this guy

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.579
would be sine of 2t.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:13.450
But we have this pesky
character here, which

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.079
essentially, instead of having
the inverse Laplace transform

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.190
just being our f of t, it's
going to be our f of t shifted

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.510
by 2 pi times the unit
step function, where

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.050
it steps up at 2pi.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:34.340
So this is going to be minus
1/3 times the unit step

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:41.010
function, where c is 2 pi of t
times-- instead of sine of t--

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:46.150
sine of t minus 2pi.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.170
And then we're almost done.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.660
I'll do it in magenta
to celebrate it.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:58.030
Plus this very last term, which
is 1/6 times the unit

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:03.550
step function 2 pi of t, the
unit step function that steps

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:13.780
up at 2 pi times sine of-- and
we have to be careful here.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.990
Wherever we had a t before,
we're going to replace it with

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.750
a t minus 2 pi.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.850
So sine of, instead of
2t, is going to be 2

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.270
times t minus 2 pi.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.540
And there you have it.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.650
We finally have solved our
very hairy problem.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.600
We could take some time
if we want to simplify

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.250
this a little bit.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.780
In fact, we might as well.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.580
At the risk of making a careless
mistake at the last

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.690
moment, let me see if I can make
any simplifications here.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:52.470
Well, we could factor out this
guy right here, but other than

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.090
that, that seems about as
simple as we can get.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:58.180
So this is our function of t
that satisfies our otherwise

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.330
simple-looking differential
equation that we had up here.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.850
This looked fairly
straightforward, but we got

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:08.340
this big mess to actually
satisfy that equation, given

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.130
those initial conditions
that we had initially.
