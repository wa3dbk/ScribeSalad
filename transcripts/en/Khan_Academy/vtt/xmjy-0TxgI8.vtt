00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.481
We're asked to graph f(x) is equal to the natural log of

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:08.545
2x, and I'll use a calculator here to find a table of values

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:12.817
for different x values, what does f(x) equals, but then I'll hand draw the graph

00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:14.373
which might be a little bit ironic

00:00:14.373 --> 00:00:16.742
because I'll be using a graphic calculator to come up with the values.

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:19.156
But I won't use the graphing function to graph it,

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:21.316
we'll do that part by hand.

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:23.452
So let's draw here a little table of values.

00:00:23.452 --> 00:00:25.310
Of x values and of y values.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.912
And see what we get.

00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:31.509
So these are my x values and let's just say y = f(x)

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.878
So whatever the output is I'm going to set that equal

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:36.920
to our dependent variable and plot it on the vertical axis

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.870
and we call that dependent variable y.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.005
So let's just try really small numbers.

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.327
So actually first, let's remind ourselves what's the domain?

00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:47.810
What's the set of valid inputs for x, that we can put in right there?

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.595
So the natural logarithm is just logaritm base e.

00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:56.680
And any logarithm is only defined when input into the logaritm,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.372
in this case 2x, is greater than zero.

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:02.462
You can't even take the logarithm of zero.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.621
You can raise something to a very negative exponent,

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:08.151
negative bilion power, it will get pretty close to zero

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.055
but you can never get to zero.

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:13.352
If you take a positive base there is no exponent you can raise it to

00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:17.694
to get to the zero or get to a negative number.

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:21.432
So the 2x here, the input into our logarithm function,

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:23.545
in this case the natural logarithm function,

00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:25.937
it has to be greater than zero.

00:01:25.937 --> 00:01:28.584
And if that's greater than zero, divide both sides by 2.

00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:30.720
That means x is greater than zero.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.157
So that is essentially the constraint on our domain.

00:01:34.157 --> 00:01:38.453
Our domain is all real numbers greater than zero.

00:01:38.453 --> 00:01:41.843
So let's try something pretty close to zero.

00:01:41.843 --> 00:01:45.047
Just so we see what happens, the behaviour as we approach

00:01:45.047 --> 00:01:46.858
as we are close to zero.

00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:49.343
And especially as input here is less than one.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:02:00.813
So let's try 0.1, 0.5, 1.

00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:05.806
And let's try, I don't know - let's try 5...

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:07.408
Oh, I don't actually want to get too far,

00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:10.310
cause I want to be able to see the resolution down here.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.976
So let's try 1.5 and let's try 3.

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:19.157
So those will be our inputs that we'll try.

00:02:19.157 --> 00:02:21.967
That's sounds good enough.

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:25.728
And then let me draw my axes and then we'll plot the points.

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:29.002
So our domain is positive x values

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:33.089
so we don't really have to draw much on the negative x values.

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.411
But we will have some negative values here,

00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:38.337
so let me give ourselves some room to work with.

00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:40.287
And out x values go up to 3.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:44.885
So this is 1, 2 and 3.

00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:50.388
This is 0.5, 1.5 and this is 2.5 (which we do not use).

00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:54.869
And then let's see what our y values are, f(x) are going to be equal to

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:56.890
So get out our TI-85

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.048
So if we take the natural log -- remember, we have to take

00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:02.161
2 times x and then natural log of that.

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:07.408
So if we take the natural log of 2 times 0.1,

00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:09.730
which is obviously 0.2, what do we get?

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.281
We get negative 1.61, I'll say.

00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:17.462
Negative 1.61.

00:03:17.462 --> 00:03:25.682
And then if we input 0.5, what do we get?

00:03:25.682 --> 00:03:27.563
Let me get the calculator back.

00:03:27.563 --> 00:03:31.603
So we're going to take the natural log of 2 times 0.5.

00:03:31.603 --> 00:03:33.484
We can do it in out heads.

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:35.388
Actually I'll just write it out just so it's clear what we're doing.

00:03:35.388 --> 00:03:39.429
2 times 0.5, that's the natural log of one.

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.054
And you should be able to do that in your head.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.653
What power you have to raise any positive base to, to get to one?

00:03:44.653 --> 00:03:47.068
Well, you raise e to the zero power and you get one.

00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:50.203
So I'll write it over here.

00:03:50.203 --> 00:03:56.008
We should've been able do to that one in our heads.

00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:58.051
Now let's do the next one.

00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:07.432
What happens when we have the natural log of 2 times 1.

00:04:07.432 --> 00:04:09.313
Which is obviously just going to be 2.

00:04:09.313 --> 00:04:11.426
So it's te natural log of 2.

00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:14.746
Gets us .69. Which makes sense that this is less than 1.

00:04:14.746 --> 00:04:19.297
Because 2 is less than e. e is 2.71 and so on and so forth.

00:04:19.297 --> 00:04:21.596
So this is .69.

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:30.071
Now let's try the natural log of 2 times 1.5.

00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:37.804
Natural log of 3.

00:04:37.804 --> 00:04:43.121
And that gets us to 1.10, I'll round to the hundedths.

00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:46.859
So this is 1.10.

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:54.406
And finally the natural log of 2 times 3.

00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:58.818
2 times x, x is 3.

00:04:58.818 --> 00:05:01.720
What do I get? This is going to be natural log of 6.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.017
Which is 1.79.

00:05:05.017 --> 00:05:08.013
This is going to be, I'll choose a new color.

00:05:08.013 --> 00:05:13.051
This is going to be 1.79.

00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:19.228
So in terms of the coordinates we run as low as -1.61 and as high as 1.79.

00:05:19.228 --> 00:05:26.217
So let's call this right over here -1

00:05:26.217 --> 00:05:31.209
and then down here would be -2.

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:34.971
I'll extend the y axis down a little bit.

00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:39.383
So this is the x axis and this is out y = f(x) axis.

00:05:39.383 --> 00:05:43.028
And then let's call this right over here positive 1.

00:05:43.028 --> 00:05:45.838
And this over here is positive 2.

00:05:45.838 --> 00:05:47.881
And this would be half way between those

00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:51.550
just cause it looks like we gonna have to be able to see that as well.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.614
And so this first point is 0.1, -1.61.

00:05:55.614 --> 00:05:58.145
So 0.1, that's one tenth,

00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:00.443
that's gonna be right around there.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.603
And then we have -1.61.

00:06:02.603 --> 00:06:06.875
It's gonna sit right about there.

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:19.089
So that is the point (0.1, -1.61). Fair enough.

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:22.108
That's the first point right there.

00:06:22.108 --> 00:06:24.848
Now let's do this one.

00:06:24.848 --> 00:06:26.821
0.5, 0

00:06:26.821 --> 00:06:29.817
When x is 0.5, y is 0.

00:06:29.817 --> 00:06:33.718
That's (0.5, 0). Fair enough.

00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:42.866
When x is equal to 1, y is 0.69.

00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:44.886
Which might be right about there.

00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:48.880
Just approximating it, so a little bit closer to 1 that is close 0.5.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.272
Actually a little bit closer to 0.5 than it is to 1.

00:06:51.272 --> 00:06:54.290
So let me put it right over there.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.608
This would be (1, 0.69)

00:06:59.608 --> 00:07:06.249
And then we have the point, when x is 1.5 - f(x) is 1.10.

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:13.586
When x is 1.5, f(x) is 1.1, which takes us right above there.

00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:18.323
So that is the point and I think you see where this curve is going.

00:07:18.323 --> 00:07:21.736
(1.5, 1.10)

00:07:21.736 --> 00:07:24.221
And finally, so that was that point.

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:26.009
We'll do this last one in yellow

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:28.493
when x is 3, y is 1.79.

00:07:28.493 --> 00:07:33.811
So a little bit closer to 2.0 than to 1.5.

00:07:33.811 --> 00:07:36.528
So it's gonna be right about there.

00:07:36.528 --> 00:07:40.823
It's gonna be coordinate (3, 1.79).

00:07:40.823 --> 00:07:42.750
And now we can connect the dots

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.538
and I'll do that in white.

00:07:44.538 --> 00:07:48.672
And so as we get x values that are closer and closer to 0

00:07:48.672 --> 00:07:52.619
Our graph of our function is gonna get more and more negative

00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:57.170
And it's gonna get closer and closer to the y axis without ever touching it.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.535
So it's gonna get less close from the y axis, slowly break away

00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:05.738
and then curve out like this.

00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:10.080
Curve out just like that.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.681
And just keep on going down like this.

00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:16.164
And what happens here is pretty cool, as x gets smaller and smaller

00:08:16.164 --> 00:08:21.388
The functions becomes more...infinetely negative as x aproaches 0.

00:08:21.388 --> 00:08:24.477
But x can never be 0.

00:08:24.477 --> 00:08:27.658
There is no power you can raise e or any positive base to,

00:08:27.658 --> 00:08:32.882
to actually get zero. You can raise it to raise to a very large negative exponent

00:08:32.882 --> 00:08:40.475
I you raise e to the negative one billion, you'll get a number

00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:43.540
That's very close to 0, because it is the same as

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.886
1 over e to the one bilionth power.

00:08:45.886 --> 00:08:49.578
So this is a number that's very close to 0.

00:08:49.578 --> 00:08:51.598
But you're never going to approach zero.

00:08:51.598 --> 00:08:53.548
You can make this number more and more negative

00:08:53.548 --> 00:08:55.359
it'll just get smaller and smaller numbers

00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:59.074
but you'll never quite approach 0.

00:08:59.074 --> 00:09:03.788
So you can never a logarithm of zero. You just approach it.

00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:07.666
We're done! This is the graph of natural log of 2x.

00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:10.336
And it has a typical shape, cause it's just a logarithm.

00:09:10.336 --> 99:59:59.999
It has a shape of a logarithmic graph.
