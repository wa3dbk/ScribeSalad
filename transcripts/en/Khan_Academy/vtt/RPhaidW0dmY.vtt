00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.550
Multiply 1 and 3/4
times 7 and 1/5.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.760
Simplify your answer and write
it as a mixed fraction.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.080
So the first thing we want to
do is rewrite each of these

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.990
mixed numbers as improper
fractions.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.790
It's very difficult, or at least
it's not easy for me, to

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.680
directly multiply
mixed numbers.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.560
One can do it, but it's much
easier if you just make them

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.180
improper fractions.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.620
So let's convert each of them.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.380
So 1 and 3/4 is equal to-- it's
still going to be over 4,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.810
so you're still going to have
the same denominator, but your

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.710
numerator as an improper
fraction is going to be 4

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.615
times 1 plus 3.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.750
And the reason why this makes
sense is 1 is 4/4, or 1 is 4

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.790
times 1 fourths, right?

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.480
1 is the same thing as 4/4, and
then you have three more

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.670
fourths, so 4/4 plus 3/4
will give you 7/4.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.670
So that's the same thing
as 1 and 3/4.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.319
Now, let's do 7 and 1/5.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.580
Same exact process.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.860
We're going to still be talking
in terms of fifths.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.710
That's going to be
the denominator.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.600
You take 5 times 7, because
think about it.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.960
7 is the same thing as 35/5.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.150
So you take 5 times 7 plus this
numerator right here.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.670
So 7 is 35/5, then you have
one more fifth, so you're

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.870
going to have 35 plus 1,
which is equal to 36/5.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.320
So this product is the exact
same thing as taking the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:51.350
product of 7/4 times 36/5.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.220
And we could multiply
it out right now.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.100
Take the 7 times 36 as our new
numerator, 4 times 5 as our

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.780
new denominator, but that'll
give us large numbers.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.370
I can't multiply 7 and
36 in my head, or I

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.890
can't do it too easily.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.590
So let's see if we can
simplify this first.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.320
Both our numerator and our
denominator have numbers that

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.220
are divisible by 4, so let's
divide both the numerator and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.740
the denominator by 4.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.100
So in the numerator, we can
divide the 36 by 4 and get 9.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.360
If you divide something in the
numerator by 4, you need to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.020
divide something in the
denominator by 4, and the 4 is

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.890
the obvious guy, so 4
divided by 4 is 1.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.700
So now this becomes 7 times 9,
and what's the 7 times 9?

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.900
It's 63, over 1 times 5.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.920
So now we have our answer as an
improper fraction, but they

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.020
want it as a mixed number
or as a mixed fraction.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.120
So what are 63/5?

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.120
So to figure that out-- let me
pick a nice color here-- we

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.260
take 5 into 63.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.420
5 goes into 6 one time.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.320
1 times 5 is 5.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.260
You subtract.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
6 minus 5 is 1.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.330
Bring down the 3.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.220
5 goes into 13 two times.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.160
And you could have immediately
said 5 goes into 63 twelve

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.480
times, but this way, at
least to me, it's a

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.960
little bit more obvious.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:27.305
And then 2 times 5 is 12,
and then we have sorry!

00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:32.390
2 times 5 is 10.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.660
That tells you not to
switch gears in the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.560
middle of a math problem.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.600
2 times 5 is 10, and then you
subtract, and you have a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.165
remainder of 3.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:51.070
So 63/5 is the same thing as 12
wholes and 3 left over, or

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.800
3/5 left over.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.460
And if you wanted to go back
from this to that, just think:

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.030
12 is the same thing as
60 fifths, or 60/5.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.950
60/5 plus 3/5 is 63/5,
so these two things

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.720
are the same thing.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.810
These two things
are equivalent.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.980
This is as an improper
fraction.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.390
This is as a mixed number
or a mixed fraction.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.130
But this is our answer right
there: 12 and 3/5.
