00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.610
We're on problem 16.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.960
And they want to know what is
the area of the shaded square?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.590
Let me shade it because they
call it shaded square.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.100
So what's that area?

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.030
So how can we do it?

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.180
Well, it's a bit of a trick, but
what you need to realize

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.880
is, you could draw-- Let me draw
some things that might--

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.610
This is actually a really
fun problem.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.900
Let me draw some interesting
rectangles here.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:38.020
Let me draw a rectangle there.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.640
Let me draw another rectangle
there to there.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.226
This really is just kind
of a brain teaser.

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:50.510
Draw another rectangle
from there to there.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:06.930
And then let me draw another
rectangle from there to there.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.720
OK, so let me ask you
a couple of things.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.980
One: what is the distance of
the base of this rectangle

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.820
right here?

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.090
This distance.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.540
Well, we know this entire--
whoops, wrong tool-- we know

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.490
this entire distance
is 3, right?

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.310
Because they tell us-- oh,
they don't even tell us.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.910
They tell us that this
distance is this 1.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.300
So we know that this
is a cube, right?

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.110
That this distance is 3.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.180
So this distance is 1.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.580
And then this distance
down here is 3.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.445
And they tell us that this is
a shaded square, right?

00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:51.770
So all the sides of this
inner shape are also

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.510
going to be the same.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.280
So if this is 1, this
is 2, this is also

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.220
going to be 2, right?

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.970
That's going to be 2, that's
going to be 1, that's going to

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.780
be 1, this is going
to be 2, 1.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.580
I think you get when
I'm saying, right?

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.830
And what is the distances
of the smaller

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.520
square inside of here?

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.940
Well, if this distance is 1,
this distance is 1 from here

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.870
to here, this distance
is also going to be 1

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.640
because 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.660
That's 1.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.200
Same reason, you can make
the same argument.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.410
This is 1, this is
1, this is 1.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.280
So the area of this small square
inside, what's the area

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.740
of that small square?

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.370
What's the area of the magenta
square that I just filled in?

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.270
Well that area is
going to be 1.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.610
right?

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.240
The magenta square is 1.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.420
So now all we have to figure
out is the area of these 4

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.630
yellow triangles.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.360
And what are the areas of each
of those yellow triangles?

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.300
Well, each of those yellow
triangles are-- they have a

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.140
dimension, on the long side,
the dimension is 2.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.570
Let me find a good color.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.450
On the long side, the dimension
is 2, right?

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.220
This distance right here is 2.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.610
And on the short side,
the distance is 1.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.950
So its area, each yellow
triangle is 2 times 1 times

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.850
1/2, right?

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.890
Because area of a triangle
is area equals

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.160
1/2 base times height.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.880
So area of each of those
triangles is going to be 1/2

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.950
times 2 times 1, so that
equals 1, right?

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.390
So the area of this triangle
is 1, the area of this

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.006
triangle is 1, the area of this
triangle is 1, the area

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:40.020
of this triangle is 1.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.800
And then the area of the square
inside is also 1.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.540
So it's 1 plus 1 plus
1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.360
The total area is 5.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.920
Area equals 5, that
was pretty neat.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.990
And the big thing you need to
realize is that you can split

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.205
up the square on the
inside like this.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:03.200
Let me think if there
was another way.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.440
That's the way that
it occurred to me.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.130
Maybe there's another way, maybe
I'm over-complicating

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.900
it, I don't know.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.100
But it looks nice.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.850
Next problem.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.899
For all positive integers, j
and k, let j-- I like these

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.680
where they define new math
operations-- j square with an

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.780
r inside of it, k, be defined as
the whole number remainder

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.070
when j is divided by k.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.320
So this equals remainder
when j is divided by k.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.680
If you're familiar with the
concept of a modulus, that's

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.890
essentially what this
operation is.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:47.760
If 13-- I guess we'll call this
remainder operation-- k

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.010
is equal to 2, what
is the value of k?

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.780
And they tell us in the
beginning that j and k, all of

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.870
these things have to be positive
numbers, right?

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.790
So this is essentially saying
that when I divide 13 by some

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:12.510
positive number, I get
a remainder of 2.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.160
Well, what number when I
divide it into 13 is 2?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.620
I guess another way to think
about it is 13 minus 2 is a

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.040
multiple of this
number, right?

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.050
So you could say, what's
13 minus 2?

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.270
Well it's 11.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.170
So 11 is a multiple of k, and
actually 11 should be k

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:36.310
because if 11's a multiple of k,
and 11's not a multiple of

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.090
much, right?

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.320
Eleven's only a multiple of 1
and 11, so k has to be 11.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.510
And you can test it out.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.050
I mean, if you get confused,
just try

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.300
out different numbers.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.460
13 divided by 11 is equal
to one, right?

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.450
Because 11 goes in
13 one time.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.020
Remainder 2.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.920
Which satisfies this.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.830
13 remainder 11 is equal to 2.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.080
Next problem.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.270
Problem 18.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.720
The average of the test
scores of a class of

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.060
p students is 70.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.190
The average is 70, so what
do we know about that?

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.130
We know that if we were to add
up all of the p students--

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.170
well, actually, let me read the
rest of the problem before

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.670
I do anything.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.150
And the average of the test
scores of a class of n

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.620
students is 92.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.150
When the scores of both classes
are combined, the

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.450
average score is 86.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.750
What is the value of p/n?

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:43.880
OK, so what is the sum of
the p student scores?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.720
So their average is 70, so the
sum of all of their scores is

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.810
going to be 70p, right?

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.320
You can take the average
and multiply it by

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.440
the number of students.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.260
And then you get the sum of all
of their scores, right?

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.300
And if that doesn't make a lot
of sense, think about it.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.375
What's the definition
of average?

00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:10.920
It's the sum divided by p is
equal to the average, right?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.520
So if you multiply both sides by
p, you get the sum is equal

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.940
to p times the average.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.690
In this case, the
average is 70.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.590
So 70 times p is the sum of
the first class, and then

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.560
what's the sum of the
second class?

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.810
It's going to be 92n for
the same exact reason.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.430
And now, how many total students
are we averaging?

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.380
Well there are p in this sum and
there are n in this sum,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.640
so it's p plus n, and they
tell us that this average

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.370
score is 86.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.410
So we set up our equation
and now let's solve.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:53.040
Let's multiply both sides by p
plus n, so you get 70p plus

00:07:53.040 --> 00:08:03.410
92n is equal to 86p plus 86n,
right? p plus n times 86,

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.360
distribute the 86.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.180
Now what do we want to do?

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.650
We eventually want to figure out
p/n, so let's put the n's

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.020
on the left-hand side.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.220
So I'm going to subtract 86n
from both sides, so you get

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:22.710
70p plus-- 92 minus 86 is 6n
is equal to 86p, right?

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.590
I subtracted this from
the other side.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.690
And then let's subtract 70p from
both sides, so you get 6n

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.360
is equal to 16p, right?

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.140
86 minus 70.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.965
And then we want to know p/n.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:46.620
So we divide both sides by n,
you get 6 is equal to 16p/n

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.920
and now divide both sides
by 16, and you get

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.090
6/16 is equal to p/n.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.300
And, of course, we
can reduced 6/16.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.030
6/16 is the same thing as 3/8.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.040
That is our answer for p/n.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.170
I'll see you in the
next section.
