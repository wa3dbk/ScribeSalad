00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.440
In the last video, I introduced
you to what is

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.850
probably the most bizarro
function that you've

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.950
encountered so far.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.235
And that was the Dirac
delta function.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.190
And I defined it to be--
and I'll do the

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.400
shifted version of it.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.970
You're already hopefully
reasonably familiar with it.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.380
So Dirac delta of t minus c.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.370
We can say that it equals 0,
when t does not equal c, so it

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.775
equals 0 everywhere, but it

00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:35.450
essentially pops up to infinity.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.470
And we have to be careful
with this infinity.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.760
I'm going to write
it in quotes.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970
It pops up to infinity.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.700
And we even saw in the previous
video, it's kind of

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.100
different degrees of infinity,
because you can still multiply

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.510
this by other numbers to get
larger Dirac delta functions

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.560
when t is equal to c.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.170
But more important than this,
and this is kind of a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.750
pseudodefinition here, is the
idea that when we take the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.860
integral, when we take the area
under the curve over the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.839
entire x- or the entire t-axis,
I guess we could say,

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.730
when we take the area under this
curve, and obviously, it

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.890
equals zero everywhere except
at t is equal to c, when we

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.930
take this area, this is the
important point, that the area

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.180
is equal to 1.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.830
And so this is what I meant by
pseudoinfinity, because if I

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.730
have 2 times the Dirac delta
function, and if I'm taking

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.140
the area under the curve of
that, of 2 times the Dirac

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.370
delta function t minus c dt,
this should be equal to 2

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.410
times-- the area of just under
the Dirac delta function 2

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.570
times from minus infinity to
infinity of the delta function

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.120
shifted by c dt, which is just
2 times-- we already showed

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.090
you, I just said, by definition,
this is 1, so this

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.060
will be equal to 2.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.620
So if I put a 2 out here, this
infinity will have to be twice

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.370
as high, so that the
area is now 2.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.870
That's why I put that infinity
in parentheses.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.180
But it's an interesting
function.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.100
I talked about it at the end of
the last video that it can

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.720
help model things that kind of
jar things all of a sudden,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.970
but they impart a fixed amount
of impulse on something and a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.010
fixed amount of change
in momentum.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.660
And we'll understand that a
little bit more in the future.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.300
But let's kind of get the
mathematical tools completely

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.720
understood.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.590
And let's try to figure out what
the Dirac delta function

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.200
does when we multiply it, what
it does to the Laplace

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.550
transform when we multiply
it times some function.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.105
So let's say I have my Dirac
delta function and I'm going

00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:43.170
to shift it.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.560
That's a little bit
more interesting.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.480
And if you want to unshift
it, you just say, OK,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.440
well, c equals 0.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.030
What happens when c equals 0?

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.520
And I'm going to shift it and
multiply it times some

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.720
arbitrary function f of t.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.590
If I wanted to figure out the
Laplace transform of just the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.800
delta function by itself,
I could say f of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.390
t is equal to 1.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.020
So let's take our Laplace
transform of this.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.220
And we can just use the
definition of the Laplace

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.740
transform, so this is equal to
the area from 0 to infinity,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.510
or we could call it the integral
from 0 to infinity of

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.340
e to the minus -- that's just
part of the Laplace transform

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.095
definition-- times this thing--
and I'll just write it

00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:31.080
in this order-- times
f of t times

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.960
our Dirac delta function.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.600
Delta t minus c and times dt.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.090
Now, here I'm going to
make a little bit of

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.670
an intuitive argument.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.760
A lot of the math we do is kind
of-- especially if you

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.410
want to be very rigorous and
formal, the Dirac delta

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.660
function starts to break down a
lot of tools that you might

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.170
have not realized it would
break down, but I think

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.920
intuitively, we can still
work with it.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.425
So I'm going to solve this
integral for you intuitively,

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:02.990
and I think it'll
make some sense.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.380
So let's draw this.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.790
Let me draw this, what
we're trying to do.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.310
So let me draw what we're
trying to take

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.375
the integral of.

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:13.600
And we only care from zero to
infinity, so I'll only do it

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.610
from zero to infinity.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.820
And I'll assume that c is
greater than zero, that the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.560
delta function pops
up someplace in

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.870
the positive t-axis.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.620
So what is this first part
going to look like?

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.610
What is that going to look
like? e to the minus

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.780
st times f of t?

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.220
I don't know.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.460
It's going to be some function.
e to the minus st

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.320
starts at 1 and drops down, but
we're multiplying it times

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.270
some arbitrary function, so I'll
just draw it like this.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.510
Maybe it looks something
like this.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.570
This right here is e to the
minus st times f of t.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.860
And the f of t is what kind of
gives it its arbitrary shape.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.200
Fair enough.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.110
Now, let's graph our Dirac
delta function.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.980
With zero everywhere except
right at c, right at c right

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.840
there, it pops up infinitely
high, but we only draw an

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.540
arrow that is of height 1 to
show that its area is 1.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.260
I mean, normally when you graph
things you don't draw

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.110
arrows, but this arrow shows
that the area under this

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.290
infinitely high thing is 1.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.260
So we do a 1 there.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.630
So if we multiply this, we care
about the area under this

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.410
whole thing.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.120
When we multiply these two
functions, when we multiply

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.050
this times this times the delta
function, this is-- let

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.570
me write this.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.800
This is the delta function
shifted to c.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.950
If I multiply that times
that, what do I get?

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.060
This is kind of the key
intuition here.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.410
Let me redraw my axes.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.500
Let me see if I can do it
a little bit straighter.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.930
Don't judge me by the
straightness of my axes.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.260
So that's t.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.480
So what happens when I
multiply these two?

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.480
Everywhere, when t equals
anything other than c, the

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.570
Dirac delta function is zero.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.290
So it's zero times anything.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.560
I don't care what this function
is going to do, it's

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.920
going to be zero.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.760
So it's going to be zero
everywhere, except something

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.050
interesting happens at
t is equal to c.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.110
At t equals c, what's the
value of the function?

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.000
Well, it's going to
be the value of

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.070
the Dirac delta function.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.760
It's going to be the Dirac delta
function times whatever

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.030
height this is.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.410
This is going to be this point
right here or this right

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.530
there, that point.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.030
This is going to be this
function evaluated at c.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.830
I'll mark it right here on the
y-axis, or on the f of t,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.950
whatever you want to call it.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.765
This is going to be e to the
minus sc times f of c.

00:06:39.765 --> 00:06:42.970
All I'm doing is I'm just
evaluating this function at c,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.150
so that's the point
right there.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.180
So if you take this point, which
is just some number, it

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.840
could be 5, 5 times this, you're
just getting 5 times

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.140
the Dirac delta function.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.540
Or in this case, it's not 5.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.930
It's this little more
abstract thing.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.660
I could just draw
it like this.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.080
When I multiply this thing times
my little delta function

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.260
there, I get this.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.560
The height, it's a delta
function, but it's scaled now.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.420
It's scaled, so now my
new thing is going

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.950
to look like this.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.080
If I just multiply that times
that, I essentially get e to

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.820
the minus sc times f of c.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.240
This might look like some fancy
function, but it's just

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.600
a number when we consider
it in terms of t.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.240
s, it becomes something when we
go into the Laplace world,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.250
but from t's point of view,
it's just a constant.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.100
All of these are just constants,
so this might as

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.430
well just be 5.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:41.060
So it's this constant times my
Dirac delta function, times

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.360
delta of t minus c.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.600
When I multiply that thing times
that thing, all I'm left

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.680
with is this thing.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.315
And this height is still going
to be infinitely high, but

00:07:51.315 --> 00:07:57.070
it's infinitely high scaled in
such a way that its area is

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.130
going to be not 1.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.500
And I'll show it to you.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.850
So what's the integral
of this thing?

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.980
Taking the integral of this
thing from minus infinity to

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.870
infinity, since this thing is
this thing, it should be the

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.380
same thing as taking the
integral of this thing from

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.710
minus infinity to infinity.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.220
So let's do that.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.500
Actually, we don't have to do
it from minus infinity.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.220
I said from zero to infinity.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.850
So if we take from zero to
infinity, what I'm saying is

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.390
taking this integral
is equivalent

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.160
to taking this integral.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:31.260
So e to the minus sc f of c
times my delta function t

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.270
minus c dt.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.179
Now, this thing right here, let
me make this very clear,

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:41.280
I'm claiming that this is
equivalent to this.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.530
Because everywhere else, the
delta function zeroes out this

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.300
function, so we only care about
this function, or e to

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.430
the minus st f of t when
t is equal to c.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.810
And so that's why we were able
to turn it into a constant.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.920
But since this is a constant,
we can bring it out of the

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.380
integral, and so this is equal
to-- I'm going to go backwards

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.860
here just to kind of save space
and still give you these

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.120
things to look at.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.690
If we take out the constants
from inside of the integral,

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:14.540
we get e to the minus sc times f
of c times the integral from

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:21.650
0 to infinity of f
of t minus c dt.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.830
Oh sorry, not f of t minus c.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.370
This is not an f.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:29.380
I have to be very careful.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.000
This is a delta.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.160
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.960
I took out the constant terms
there, and it's going to be a

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.710
delta of t minus c dt.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.760
Let me get the right color.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.300
Now, what is this thing
by definition?

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.370
This thing is 1.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.420
I mean, we could put it from
minus infinity to infinity, it

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.150
doesn't matter.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.170
The only time where it has any
area is right under c.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.110
So this thing is equal to 1.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.390
So this whole integral right
there has been reduced to this

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.040
right there, because this
is just equal to 1.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.460
So the Laplace transform of
our shifted delta function

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:13.060
times some other function is
equal to e to the minus sc

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.200
times f of c.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.160
Let me write that
again down here.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.650
Let me write it all at once.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:25.590
So the Laplace transform of our
shifted delta function t

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:32.900
minus c times some function
f of t, it equals e

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.570
to the minus c.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.420
Essentially, we're just
evaluating e to the minus st

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.240
evaluated at c.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.110
So e to the minus
cs times f of c.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.420
We're essentially just
evaluating these things at c.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.680
This is what it equals.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.160
So from this we can get a lot
of interesting things.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.080
What is the Laplace transform--
actually, what is

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.490
the Laplace transform
of just the plain

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.250
vanilla delta function?

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:05.880
Well, in this case, we have c
is equal to 0, and f of t is

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.880
equal to 1.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.340
It's just a constant term.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.090
So if we do that, then the
Laplace transform of this

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:16.095
thing is just going to be e to
the minus 0 times s times 1,

00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:18.040
which is just equal to 1.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.740
So the Laplace transform of our
delta function is 1, which

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.850
is a nice clean thing
to find out.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.270
And then if we wanted to just
figure out the Laplace

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.530
transform of our shifted
function, the Laplace

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:35.870
transform of our shifted delta
function, this is just a

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.813
special case where f
of t is equal to 1.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.870
We could write it times 1, where
f of t is equal to 1.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:47.810
So this is going to be equal to
e to the minus cs times f

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.840
of c, but f is just a constant,
f is just 1 here.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.670
So it's times 1, or it's
just e to the mine cs.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:01.550
So just like that, using a kind
of visual evaluation of

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.820
the integral, we were able
to figure out the Laplace

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.850
transforms for a bunch of
different situations involving

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.510
the Dirac delta function.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.400
Anyway, hopefully, you found
that reasonably useful.
