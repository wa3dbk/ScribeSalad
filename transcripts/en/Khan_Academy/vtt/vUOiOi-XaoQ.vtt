00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.695
I've done a bunch of videos now
on inflation and deflation

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:07.580
and how they can be impacted
by capacity utilization.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.230
And the traditional notion of
capacity utilization, and this

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.380
is what my brain does when
someone mentions it, is I

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.140
think of industrial capacity
utilization.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.670
I imagine factories.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.620
And when people say low
utilization, I imagine idle

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.770
factories, and when high
utilization, I imagine

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.200
factories that are running at
three shifts and things are

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.120
moving feverishly.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.340
But in a service-based economy
like we have here in the U.S.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.880
and like we have in a lot of
Western societies, most of our

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.980
real capacity for what we
produce, or our GDP, is

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.030
service based, because we're
a service-based economy.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.250
And if you think about it,
industrial capacity

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.950
utilization, it matters, but
it matters much more to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.820
manufacturing-based economy.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.870
In a service-based economy,
the best measure of

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.860
utilization really
is unemployment.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.870
And I guess we could say
the best measure of

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.570
underutilization is
unemployment.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.290
With that said, I think it's
really important to have a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.200
deeper understanding of how
unemployment is measured and

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.540
how it's thought about from
the Government, and the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.820
numbers you hear on CNN, what
they really mean in terms of

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.310
the real unemployment picture.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.230
And most of these charts,
actually all of these charts

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.040
that I have in this video, I
got from Mike Shedlock, who

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.190
runs the Global Economic
Analysis blog.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.440
And I had a conversation with
him on Friday and he pointed

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.110
out some really interesting
things.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.760
That's what I really want to
cover, and I think it'll give

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.330
us a good general view of
unemployment and give us some

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.640
clues as to what's going
on right now.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.330
But I encourage you
to read his blog.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.450
He goes by Mish, and he tells
people that the best way to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.020
find his blog is to just do a
search on Google for Mish.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.750
And he does a lot of this, where
he looks at the economic

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.520
data, but he goes several levels
deeper than anyone

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.660
really would go, especially
on TV.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.290
But that's what you really have
to do to really discern

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.610
what matters.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.550
And I want to give him full
credit because he really is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.810
who pointed out a lot of this
to me, but I think it's very

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.120
instructive to the capacity
utilization and

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.820
inflation-deflation argument
that I've been making.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.230
So right here I have a
screenshot from the Bureau Of

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.509
Labor Statistics and you
could go there, just do

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.889
a search for them.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.350
And what most people don't
realize is, just like on the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.090
money supply, you have different
measures of money

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.430
supply, you also have different
measures of

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.450
unemployment.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.940
And the number that you hear
reported, at least since 1994,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.790
is U-3, and that's where
we'll start.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.400
That's kind of the official
rate of unemployment.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.570
I know you can't read
this properly.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.160
My screen capture software
doesn't do

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.390
well with this font.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.800
But U-3 is total unemployed as
a percent of the civilian

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.340
labor force.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.750
So it's very important to
realize what they consider

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.410
unemployed and what they
consider the labor force.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.820
They consider you unemployed
if you don't have a job and

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:56.790
you have looked for work
in the past four weeks.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.390
And this is a really
important point.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.000
It really is important to think
about it relative to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.550
everything else I'll go
over in this video.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.820
Because we've probably had times
in our life where we

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.830
considered ourselves unemployed
or we considered

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.380
someone else unemployed, but
they had maybe gotten dejected

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.540
and stopped looking
a little bit or

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.810
decided to take a break.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.930
It's important to realize, in
the numbers that we hear from

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.930
the Government, they don't count
as part of the civilian

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.180
labor force.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.270
Well, let's say, you stop
looking for a job for five

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.340
weeks, because you wanted to
take a break and maybe redo

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.170
your resume for awhile, so
you're kind of passively

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.280
looking for a job.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.790
The Government no longer
considers you part of the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.730
labor force and you're not
included in that number.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.860
They do have broader numbers
that do include that.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.175
And I think that's important,
because we're actually going

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:46.950
to study the difference between
the different numbers.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.320
U-4 is total unemployed.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.300
So it's the number up here, plus
discouraged workers, as a

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.910
percent of the civilian
labor force,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.420
plus discouraged workers.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.980
So they're going to add
the discouraged

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.230
workers to the numerator.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.920
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.590
Before you had-- this
is the standard one.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.310
You have unemployed over
employed plus unemployed, as

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.280
defined-- and when we say
unemployed, it's someone who

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.620
doesn't have a job, but you've
looked for a job in the last

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.540
four weeks.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.810
U-4 is now-- let me do it
in a different color.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.290
It is unemployed plus
discouraged over employed plus

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.730
unemployed plus discouraged
workers.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.100
And their definition of
discouraged workers-- I just

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.880
talked about people who haven't
looked or actively

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.340
looked for a job in more than
five weeks or actually more

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.390
than four weeks.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.200
You're considered discouraged if
you give a reason for that,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.800
and you say, well, I just
haven't looked for it, because

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.900
I'm discouraged, because I don't
think there are jobs for

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.130
what I want to do anymore, so
that's the reason why haven't

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.830
looked for it.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.540
And that's when you get included
into this bucket.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.310
And then U-5 is that same thing,
but what they do is

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.890
they add other marginally
attached workers.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.640
And the difference between a
discouraged worker and a

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.450
marginally attached worker, a
discouraged worker gives the

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.380
economic reason.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.230
They say I haven't looked for
a job in the past five weeks

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.310
because I just think
it's impossible.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.090
I want to work but it's just
impossible find a job as an

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.460
accountant or an engineer
anymore.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.070
While a marginally attached
worker also says I haven't

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.570
looked for a job in the last
five weeks, but they don't say

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.150
it's because they think the
economy is making it

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.800
impossible.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.570
It could just be that they're--
I don't know--

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.390
depressed generally or they
don't want to-- it could be a

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.180
whole set of reasons.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.860
The important thing is that on
the survey that the Bureau Of

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.570
Labor Statistics conducts, that
they don't literally give

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.440
that argument that the only
reason that they're not

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.760
looking for it is economic
reasons, and then they'll be

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.300
put into the marginally
attached

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.580
workers and that's U-5.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.810
And then U-6 is really
interesting because it

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.040
includes all of these
above, but it

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.160
actually shifts some people.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
So in U-5 you would add
marginally attached to the

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.256
denominator there.

00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:07.800
In U-6 what you do is you have
total unemployed plus all

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.510
marginally attached workers plus
total employed part-time

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.570
for economic reasons as a
percent of the civilian labor

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.810
force, plus all marginally
attached workers.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.970
So the important thing here
is, plus total employed

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.330
part-time for economic
reasons.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.390
That's key, so the denominator
doesn't change anymore, but

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.750
this unemployed number is
going to get bigger.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.760
Because there's some part of
the employed population who

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.840
are not working 40 hours a week,
or they're not working

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.230
as much as they want to work,
or they're not maybe working

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.690
in even the field they
want to work.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.960
Maybe instead of working as an
engineer, they're working 20

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.340
hours a week at the local
bookstore or at Starbuck's,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.880
and these people are
included in U-6.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.520
And the reason why I want to
really highlight that, and

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.260
Mish pointed this out to me,
is that this is increasing

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.470
much faster than this.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.400
And we'll think a little bit
about why that's happening and

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.720
what conclusions we can take.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.040
These are the numbers straight
from the Bureau Of Labor

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.160
Statistics.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.890
I know this screen right here is
really hard to see, but if

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:16.680
you look at March 2008, the U-3
number was 5.2% and the

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.030
U-6 was 9.3%.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.090
So the difference between
the two is about 4.1%.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.350
But if you go to the most recent
month, the standard

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.680
unemployment number is 8.5%,
but the U-6, the one that

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.590
includes the discouraged
workers, the marginally

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.160
attached workers and the people
who aren't working full

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.300
time for economic reasons, the
difference is now 7.1%, so

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.370
that spread.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.260
People who would like to work,
but they've either stopped

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.370
looking because they've gotten
dejected, or they've just

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.840
bitten the bullet and taken
a job that they otherwise

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.140
wouldn't want to take or taken
fewer hours than they

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.630
otherwise wouldn't want to
take, that's growing.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.160
That really is.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.440
And the reason why we really
want to focus on that is

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.290
because it tells us that even
though the unemployment rate,

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.500
the official unemployment rate--
that is increasing very

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.560
steeply and I'll show a graph
right here, this is actually

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.430
work Mish did, where he actually
shows that the spread

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.850
between U-6 and U-3 has been
increasing, and it's been

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.210
increasing at an accelerating
rate since last February.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.870
That's actually shown right
here in this graph.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.367
And he got this from his
friend Chris Puplava at

00:08:29.367 --> 00:08:32.620
Financial Sense, so I want to
give him credit for it.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.919
But you see here, U-6, this
is the broad measure of

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.650
unemployment that we talked
about right here.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.100
That's increasing at an even
faster rate than the standard

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.250
unemployment measure.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.140
And this green line right here,
this is actually the

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.260
difference between the two.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.190
What's interesting about that
is this is kind of measuring

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.890
the percentage of the labor pool
that's getting dejected,

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.140
that's getting depressed.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.210
So they're either getting
depressed or dejected and not

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.670
looking for work, or they're
just saying, you know what?

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.310
I can't get a job 40 hours a
week anymore as an accountant.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.220
I will now go work part-time at
the local department store

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.470
or do whatever it takes to put
some food on the table for

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.850
their families.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.400
In general, it shows the
level of desperation.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.960
And if you look here, and this
is really interesting.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.420
This is also from
Chris Puplava.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.605
If you look relative to the
path, the last major recession

00:09:27.605 --> 00:09:29.850
that a lot of people talk about
is the early 80's, the

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.970
double dip recession, and
even though the headline

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.680
unemployment rate-- let me
make sure I get the right

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.590
color-- the headline
unemployment rate here is the

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.530
blue line, that is still
a good bit below.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.160
We peaked out there, and I
don't know what the exact

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.370
number is, but it looks like
about in the mid 10%.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.120
Even though we're a lot lower
than that now, we're at 8.2%

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.960
right now, if you look at U-6,
which is the broadest,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.210
that's spiked up.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.970
Unfortunately, the data
for U-6 doesn't

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.990
go back before 1994.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.880
They actually changed how a lot
of things were measured.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.020
The official headline rate,
instead of calling it U-3, it

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.800
used to be called U-5, but it
was, for the most part, the

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.770
same measure, but that's
changed a little bit.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.840
But U-6 did not exist before
1994 so, unfortunately, we

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.810
can't measure U-6 back then.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.910
But a good, I guess,
pseudo-indicator for U-6 that

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.850
we do have more historical
data on is the number of

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.110
unemployed for more
than 15 weeks.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.830
These are people who have been
looking for work, but 15 weeks

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.750
or more, they still haven't
found a job even though

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.610
they've been actively
looking for work.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.290
And that, if you look at least
while we have U-6 being

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.390
measured, it has tracked that
broad measure quite well.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.670
So if we can make the assumption
that U-6 is always

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.150
on that line or above it as it's
graphed here, which it is

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:59.070
so far, then U-6 in the early
80's was probably right around

00:10:59.070 --> 00:10:59.860
where that line is now.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.140
Maybe it was a little higher,
maybe it was up here.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.140
But what this graph really
does convey is that that

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.530
broadest measure of unemployment
is already as bad

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.840
as it probably was in
the early 80's.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.530
It's just that we don't
have that data there.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.000
And if anything, those part-time
workers, because

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.430
they are employed, so in the
official unemployment measure,

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.230
they're actually making
the number look

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.130
a little bit better.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.000
Here you had fewer people.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.810
You were either employed
or you were unemployed.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.160
If you're unemployed, you
made the number look

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.180
a little bit bigger.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.490
Here you have a lot more
people who are kind of

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.510
in-between, but they
get counted in

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.310
the employed number.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.440
So they're making the actual
reported official unemployment

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.420
rate a little bit lower
than is actually

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.940
the economic reality.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.430
I think that's a really
important thing to realize

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.430
that you have this accelerating
rate of

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.880
desperation out there in the
economy and, if anything, it's

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.560
telling us that things are
getting worse, and it's

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.460
telling us that things are
probably as bad as they've

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.140
been in some of the worst
recessions in history and

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.890
they're only getting worse.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.900
And going back to where we
started this video, in terms

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.660
of capacity utilization and what
that might do to prices,

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:13.100
this tells us that labor
utilization is

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.130
low and going down.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.480
What that tells us, is
that the price of

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.280
labor is going down.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.800
And you've probably read
multiple news reports already

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.120
about how this is the first
time furloughs are big.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.710
People are actually
taking wage cuts.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:32.250
So you're already seeing
deflation in wages.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.210
And when so much of our economy,
and even the basket

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.920
of goods in the CPI-- and I'll
do another video on that --is

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.780
service based, if you're seeing
deflation in wages,

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.140
that's another data point that
tells you, at least in the

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.340
medium term, we're probably
going to see further deflation

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.280
in prices as a whole.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.100
See you in the next video.
