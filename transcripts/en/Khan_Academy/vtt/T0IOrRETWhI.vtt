00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.640
A carpet measures 7 feet long
and has a diagonal measurement

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.530
of square root of 74 feet.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.845
Find the width of the carpet.

00:00:09.845 --> 00:00:12.630
So let's draw ourselves
a carpet here.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.080
So let's draw a carpet.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.410
It has a length of 7 feet, so
let's say that that is 7 feet,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.350
right there.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.620
And it's going to be a rectangle
of some kind.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.450
So let's say that we're
looking down on

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.350
the carpet like that.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.340
That's our carpet.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.280
And then it has a diagonal
measurement of

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.590
square root of 74 feet.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.570
So that means that this
distance, right here-- draw it

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.280
a little bit neater than that
--this distance right here,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.000
the diagonal of the carpet, is
the square root of 74 feet.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.850
And what they want to know is
the width of the carpet.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580
Find the width of the carpet.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.640
So let's say that this is
the width of the carpet.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.220
That is w, right there.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.300
Now, you might already realize
that what I have drawn here is

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.520
a right triangle.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.310
Let me make sure
you realize it.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.910
This is a 90 degree
angle here.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.660
And since that is a triangle
that has a 90 degree angle,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.050
it's a right triangle.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.520
The side opposite the right
angle, or the 90 degrees, is a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.370
hypotenuse, or the
longest side.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.520
It is the square root of 74.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.710
And the shorter sides
are w and 7.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.830
And the Pythagorean Theorem
tells us that the sum of the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.980
squares of the shorter side will
be equal to the square of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.930
the hypotenuse, so the square
of the longer side.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.930
So we get w squared,
this side squared.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.640
plus 7 squared, this other side
squared, is going to be

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.790
equal to the hypotenuse
squared,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.890
square root of 74 squared.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.912
And then we get w squared plus
49 is equal to the square root

00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:56.600
of 74 squared.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.415
Well, that's just
going to be 74.

00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:00.880
It is equal to 74.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.930
We can subtract 49 from both
sides of this equation.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.790
So we have just a w squared
on the left-hand side.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.940
Subtract 49 from both sides.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.470
The left side-- these guys are
going to cancel out, we're

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.800
just going to be left with a w
squared --is equal to-- What's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.900
74 minus 49?

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.270
74 minus 49, well, we can do a
little bit of regrouping or

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.140
borrowing here, if we don't
want to do it in our head.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.250
We can make this a 14.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.810
This becomes a 6.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.640
14 minus 9 is 5.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.850
6 minus 4 is 2.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.070
And we have w squared
is equal to 25.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.810
So w is going to be equal to
the square root of 25, the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.260
positive square root.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.200
So let's take the square root
of both sides, the positive

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.870
square root, and we will
get w is equal to 5.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.210
Because we obviously we don't
want it to be negative 5.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.130
That wouldn't be a realistic
distance.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.330
So the width of the
carpet is 5.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.820
And we're done.
