00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.740
In the last video, we showed
that any external pressure on

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.490
a liquid in a container
is distributed

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.000
evenly through the liquid.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.340
But that only applied to-- and
that was called Pascal's

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.950
principle-- external pressure.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.670
Let's think a little bit about
what the internal pressure is

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.620
within a liquid.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.760
We're all familiar, I think,
with the notion of the deeper

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.930
you go into a fluid or the
deeper you dive into the

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.350
ocean, the higher the
pressure is on you.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.619
Let's see if we can think about
that a little bit more

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.420
analytically, and get a
framework for what the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.270
pressure is at any depth
under the water, or

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.730
really in any fluid.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.680
Here I've drawn a cylinder, and
in that cylinder I have

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.620
some fluid-- let's not assume
that it's water, but some

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.160
fluid, and that's
the blue stuff.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.250
I'm also assuming that I'm doing
this on a planet that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.670
has the same mass as Earth, but
it has no atmosphere, so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.630
there's a vacuum up here--
there's no air.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.590
We'll see later that the
atmosphere actually adds

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.940
pressure on top of this.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.800
Let's assume that there's no
air, but it's on a planet of

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.770
the same mass, so the
gravity is the same.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.530
There is gravity, so the
liquid will fill this

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.810
container on the bottom
part of it.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.840
Also, the gravitational constant
would be the same as

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.040
Earth, so we can imagine this is
a horrible situation where

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.020
Earth has lost its magnetic
field and the solar winds have

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.820
gotten rid of Earth's
atmosphere.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.300
That's very negative, so we
won't think about that, but

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.000
anyway-- let's go back
to the problem.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.640
Let's say within this cylinder,
I have a thin piece

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.340
of foil or something that
takes up the entire

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.000
cross-sectional area
of the cylinder.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.290
I did that just because I want
that to be an indicator of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.150
whether the fluid is moving
up or down or not.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.760
Let's say I have that in the
fluid at some depth, h, and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.650
since the fluid is completely
static-- nothing's moving--

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.335
that object that's floating
right at that level, at a

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:02.440
depth of h, will
also be static.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.060
In order for something to be
static, where it's not

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.490
moving-- what do we
know about it?

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.060
We know that the net forces on
it must be zero-- in fact,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.050
that tells that it's
not accelerating.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.470
Obviously, if something's not
moving, it has a velocity of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.170
zero, and that's a constant
velocity-- it's not

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.000
accelerating in any direction,
and so its net

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.830
forces must be zero.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:32.810
This force down must be
equal to the force up.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.050
So what is the force down
acting on this cylinder?

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.860
It's going to be the weight of
the water above it, because

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.780
we're in a gravitational
environment, and so this water

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.030
has some mass.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.470
Whatever that mass is, times
the gravitational constant,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.170
will equal the force down.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.240
Let's figure out what that is.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.960
The force down, which is the
same thing is the force up, is

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:12.860
going to equal the mass of
this water, times the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.490
gravitational constant.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.020
Actually, I shouldn't say
water-- let me change this,

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.760
because I said that this is
going to be some random

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.140
liquid, and the mass
is a liquid.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.360
The force down is going to be
equal to the mass of the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.500
liquid times gravity.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.220
What is that mass
of the liquid?

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.565
Well, now I'll introduce you to
a concept called density,

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:38.460
and I think you understand what
density is-- it's how

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.150
much there is of something in
a given amount of volume, or

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.290
how much mass per volume.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.560
That's the definition
of density.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.670
The letter people use for
density is rho-- let me do

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.440
that in a different
color down here.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:04:01.476
rho, which looks like a p to
me, equals mass per volume,

00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:03.940
and that's the density.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:12.380
The units are kilograms per
meter cubed-- that is density.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.170
I think you might have an
intuition that if I have a

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:24.930
cubic meter of lead-- lead is
more dense than marshmallows.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.690
Because of that, if I have a
cubic meter of lead, it will

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.320
have a lot more mass, and in a
gravitational field, weigh a

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.100
lot more than a cubic meter
of marshmallows.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.050
Of course, there's always that
trick people say, what weighs

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.740
more-- a pound of feathers,
or a pound of lead?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.600
Those, obviously, weigh the
same-- the key is the volume.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.010
A cubic meter of lead is going
to weigh a lot more than a

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.180
cubic meter of feathers.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.890
Making sure that we now know
what the density is, let's go

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.360
back to what we were
doing before.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.330
We said that the downward force
is equal to the mass of

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.300
the liquid times the
gravitational force, and so

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.390
what is the mass
of the liquid?

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.250
We could use this formula right
here-- density is equal

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.490
to mass times volume, so we
could also say that mass is

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.660
equal to density times volume.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.130
I just multiply both sides of
this equation times volume.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.570
In this situation, force down is
equal to-- let's substitute

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.430
this with this.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.300
The mass of the liquid is equal
to the density of the

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.910
liquid times the volume of the
liquid-- I could get rid of

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.110
these l's-- times gravity.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.110
What's the volume
of the liquid?

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.150
The volume of the liquid
is going to be the

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.685
cross-sectional area of the
cylinder times the height.

00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:53.110
So let's call this
cross-sectional area A.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.290
A for area-- that's the area
of the cylinder or the foil

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.290
that's floating within
the water.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.820
We could write down that the
downward force is equal to the

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.460
density of the fluid-- I'll stop
writing the l or f, or

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.800
whatever I was doing
there-- times the

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.310
volume of the liquid.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.870
The volume of the liquid is just
the height times the area

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.390
of the liquid.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:27.110
So that is just times the height
times the area and then

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.360
times gravity.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.560
We've now figured out if we knew
the density, this height,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.840
the cross-sectional area, and
the gravitational constant, we

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.100
would know the force
coming down.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.800
That's kind of vaguely
interesting, but let's try to

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.610
figure out what the pressure
is, because that's what

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.180
started this whole discussion.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.720
What is the pressure when you go
to deep parts of the ocean?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.903
This is the force-- what is the
pressure on this foil that

00:06:59.903 --> 00:07:01.190
I have floating?

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.060
It's the force divided by the
area of pressure on this foil.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.400
So I would take the force and
divide it by the area, which

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.780
is the same thing as A,
so let's do that.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.470
Let's divide both sides of this
equation by area, so the

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.850
pressure coming down--
so that's P sub d.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.900
The downward pressure at that
point is going to be equal

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.460
to-- keep in mind, that's going
to be the same thing as

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.950
the upward pressure, because the
upward force is the same.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.680
The area of whether you're going
upwards or downwards is

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.380
going to be the same thing.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.130
The downward pressure is going
to be equal to the downward

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.430
force divided by area, which is
going to be equal to this

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.260
expression divided by area.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.630
Essentially, we can just get
rid of the area here, so it

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:57.550
equals PhAg divided by A-- we
get rid of the A's in both

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.580
situations-- so the downward
pressure is equal to the

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.480
density of the fluid, times the
depth of the fluid, or the

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.040
height of the fluid above it,
times the gravitational

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.400
constant Phg.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.430
As I said, the downward pressure
is equal to the

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.910
upward pressure-- how
do we know that?

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.360
Because we knew that the upward
force is the same as

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.230
the downward force.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:26.170
If the upward force were less,
this little piece of foil

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.480
would actually accelerate
downwards.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.050
The fact that it's static-- it's
in one place-- lets us

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.250
know that the upward force is
equal to the downward force,

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.390
so the upward pressure
is equal to

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.520
the downward pressure.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.640
Let's use that in an example.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.650
If I were on the same planet,
and this is water, and so the

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:53.330
density of water-- and this is
something good to memorize--

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:58.805
is 1,000 kilograms
per meter cubed.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.400
Let's say that we have no
atmosphere, but I were to go

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.230
10 meters under the
water-- roughly 30

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.000
feet under the water.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.980
What would be the
pressure on me?

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.840
My pressure would be the density
of water, which is

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.760
1,000 kilograms per meter
cubed-- make sure your units

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.750
are right, and I'm running out
of space, so I don't have the

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.110
units-- times the height,
10 meters, times the

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.970
gravitational acceleration, 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.440
It's a good exercise for
you to make sure

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.210
the units work out.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.000
It's 10,000 times 9.8, so the
pressure is going to be equal

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.200
to 98,000 pascals.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.500
This actually isn't that
much-- it just

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.960
sounds like a lot.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.100
We'll actually see that this
is almost one atmosphere,

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.450
which is the pressure at sea
level in France, I think.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.380
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
