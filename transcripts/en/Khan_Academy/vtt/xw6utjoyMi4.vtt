00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
 

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.440
Welcome back.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.430
Now let's do a problem that
involves almost everything

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.460
we've learned so far about
probability and combinations

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.880
and conditional probability.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.485
So let's say I
have a bag again.

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:17.700
And in that bag, I have
5 fair coins, and I

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.060
have 10 unfair coins.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.960
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.580
And a fair coin, of course, is
a 50:50 chance of getting heads

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.930
or tails, and the unfair coin--
let's say that there is an 80%

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.240
chance of getting a heads for
any one of those coins,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.110
and that there is a 20%
chance of getting tails.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.350
Right?

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.020
Because it's going to
either be heads or tails.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.160
So my question is, what happens
is I put my hand in the bag,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.430
and my eyes are closed,
and I picked out a coin.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.055
And then I flip it six times.

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:55.090
 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.380
Let's say I got four
out of six heads.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.620
That's the result I got.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.530
What I want to know is, what is
the probability that I picked

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.040
out a fair coin, given that I
got four out of six heads?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.550
 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.430
So before moving on, let's do a
little bit of review of Bayes'

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.490
Theorem, and I think that'll
give us a good framework for

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.090
the rest of this problem.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.760
So Bayes' Theorem-- and let me
do it in this corner up here.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.210
Bayes' Theorem tells us
the probability of both

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.610
a and b happening.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.250
That upside down u is just an
intersection in set theory, but

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.930
it's essentially saying, you
know, it's a set of events in

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.340
which both a and b occur.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.810
That's equal to the probability
of a occurring given b, times

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.660
the probability of b, which is
also equal to the probability

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.655
of b occurring given a,
times the probability of a.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:58.450
And I think this should make
some intuition for you.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.570
If it doesn't, it might be
a good idea to watch the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.450
conditional probability videos.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.970
But what we can do is we can
rearrange this equation right

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.115
here to get-- if we just divide
both sides by the probability

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:13.280
of b, we get the probability--
and I'll do this in a vibrant

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.910
color-- the probability of a
given b is equal to the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.770
probability of b given a, times
the probability of a divided

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.530
by the probability of b.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.530
I just took this equation,
divided both sides by the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.560
probability of b,
and I got this.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.250
So what is a and b in the
problem we're trying

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.610
to figure out?

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.470
We're want to try to figure out
the probability that I picked

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.810
out a fair coin, given that I
got four out of six heads.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.250
So in this situation, a is
that I got a fair coin.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.850
a is equal to picked fair coin.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.090
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.450
And then b is equal to
four out of six heads.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.240
 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.440
So in order to figure out the
probability that I picked a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.360
fair coin, given that I got
four out of six heads, I have

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.620
to know the probability of
getting four out of six heads

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.120
given that I picked the fair
coin, times the probability of

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.870
picking out a fair coin,
divided by the probability of

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.250
getting four out of six
heads, in general.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.990
So this is probably the
hardest part to figure out.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.710
And we will-- along the way--
we will actually probably

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.830
figure out the top 2 terms.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.680
So what's the probability of b,
or the probability of getting

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.800
four out of six heads?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.290
Let's see what happens.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.110
Right when I put my hand into
the bag and I pick out a coin,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.470
there is a five in fifteen
chance-- right, there are 15

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.630
total coins-- that I
pick a fair coin.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.550
So five in fifteen-- that's
the same thing as 1/3--

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.440
that I pick a fair coin.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.860
And then there's a 2/3 chance
that I pick an unfair coin.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.730
Now if I pick a fair coin,
given that I have a fair coin,

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.710
what is the probability
given the fair coin?

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.520
What is the probability that
I get four out of six heads?

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.420
 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.460
Well, once again, let's
think about the previous

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.080
several videos.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.690
What's the probability of
getting any one particular

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.150
combination of four
out of six heads?

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.950
So, for example, you know,
it could be heads, tails,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.585
heads, tails, heads, heads.

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:30.500
 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.380
It could be the first four
heads: heads, heads, heads,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.560
heads, tails, tails.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.750
Right?

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.890
And there are a bunch of these,
and we once again will use the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.050
binomial coefficient, or we'll
use our knowledge of

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.450
combinations to figure
out how many different

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.340
combinations there are.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.040
But what's the probability of
each of these combinations?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.040
Well, what's the
probability of heads?

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.030
That's .5 times .5
times .5 times .5.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.330
And the probability of
tails, if this is a fair coin,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.460
is also .5 times .5 times .5.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.660
So each of these-- there's a
1/2 chance of getting a heads,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.510
times a 1/2 chance of a tails,
times a 1/2 chance of a heads,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.600
times 1/2 chance of a tails,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.990
So each of these are
essentially 1/2 times

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.910
1/2, six times.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.070
So the probability of each
of the combinations is

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.380
1/2 to the sixth power.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.830
 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.190
And so how many combinations
are there like this?

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.370
Where you get-- out of the six
flips, you're essentially

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.150
choosing four heads.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.550
You're choosing-- if I'm once
again the God of probability--

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.550
I'm picking four, exactly
four, of the six heads.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.630
Sorry, I'm picking four of
exactly six of the flips

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.940
to end up heads, right?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.060
I'm choosing which of the flips
get selected, so to speak.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.480
So it's essentially, there are
going to be-- out of six flips,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.090
I'm choosing, as the God of
probability-- four to be heads.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.230
So that's the number of unique
combinations, where you have

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.120
four out of six heads, times
the probability of each of

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.670
the combinations, which is
1/2 to the sixth power.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.610
Well, what's 6 choose 4?

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.830
That's 6 factorial over
4 factorial times 6

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.880
minus 4 factorial.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.840
So that's 2 factorial.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.630
 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.620
And that's times
1/2 to the sixth.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.530
I'm going to switch
colors again, just to

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.370
stop the monotony.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:33.580
And that equals 6 times 5 times
4 times 3 times 2-- we don't

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.020
have to write the 1 times 1,
but I'll do it anyway--

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.720
over 4 factorial.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.980
4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.930
And then 2 factorial.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.490
2 times 1.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.320
So that cancels with that.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.850
The 1 we can ignore.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.530
2, divide the numerator
and denominator by 2,

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.950
and this becomes 3.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.560
So this becomes 15.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.720
So this equals 15 times
1/2 to the sixth.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.690
What's 1/2 to the sixth?

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.550
It's 1/64, right?

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.770
So 1/64, so it becomes 15/64.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.590
So the probability of getting
four out of six heads, given a

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.190
fair coin, is 15 out of 64.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:19.740
 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.225
And if you look at it, based on
our definition of b and a, this

00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:26.560
is the probability
of b given a.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.590
Right? b is four out of six
heads, given a fair coin.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.850
Fair enough.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.600
So let's figure out the
probability of-- because

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.690
there's two ways of getting
four out of six heads.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.710
One, that we picked a
fair coin, and then

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.070
times 15 out of 64.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.960
And then there's the
probability that we

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.080
picked an unfair coin.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.490
So what's the probability
of the unfair coin?

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.670
Of getting four out of six
heads, given the unfair coin?

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.930
Well, once again, what's the
probability of each of the

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.410
combinations where we
got four out of six?

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.740
So in this situation,
let's do the same one.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.680
Heads, tails, heads,
tails, heads, heads.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.860
That's four out of six heads.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.930
But in this situation, it's not
a 50% chance of getting heads.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:09.630
It's 80%.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:16.090
So it would be .8 times
.2 times .8 times .2

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.170
times .8 times .8.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.410
Now, essentially, we have-- you
know, this multiplication, we

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.060
can rearrange it, because it
doesn't matter what order

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.290
you multiply things in.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:32.470
So it's .8 to the fourth
power times .2 squared.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.080
And it doesn't matter.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.050
You know, any of the unique
combinations will each have

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:37.910
the same probability.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.510
Because we can just rearrange
the order in which we multiply.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.520
And then how many of these
combinations are there?

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.480
If we are, once again, the God
of probability, and out of six

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.950
flips we're picking four--
we're choosing four that

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:50.860
are going to end up heads?

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.600
How many ways can I
pick a group of four?

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.220
Well, once again, that's
times 6 choose 4.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.320
We figured out what that is.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.290
6 choose 4 is 15.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:13.365
So this equals 15 times .8 to
the fourth times .2 squared.

00:09:13.365 --> 00:09:16.520
 

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:24.430
And this is the probability
of four out of six heads,

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.990
given an unfair coin.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.740
So what's the total
probability of getting

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.430
four out of six heads?

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.820
Well, it's going to be the
probability of getting the fair

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.700
coin-- which is 1/3-- times the
probability of getting four out

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:47.540
of six heads, given the fair
coin-- and that's this 15/64.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.260
Plus the probability of getting
an unfair coin-- 2/3-- times

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.610
the probability of getting four
out of six heads, given the

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.550
unfair coin-- and that's
what we figured out here.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:07.562
Times 15 times .8 to the
fourth, times .2 squared.

00:10:07.562 --> 00:10:09.950
And this is the probability of
getting four out of six heads.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.580
And let's figure
out what that is.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.910
This'll cancel out with this.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.450
This becomes 5 out of
64, that's easy enough.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.470
2/3 times 15, that's 10.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.540
And now we just have to
figure out what that is.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.900
Let's see, I'm going to go over
the time limit to see if being

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.980
a Youtube partner allows me
to go over the time limit.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:40.370
.8 times .8 times .8 times
.8 is equal to-- and

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.950
then times .2 squared.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:48.120
So times .2 times .2
is equal to .016.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.150
So that's that.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.580
And we said times 10, right?

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.460
Because 2/3 times 15.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:59.950
So, times 10, is
equal to 16.384%.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.630
So the probability is-- so this
term right here-- let me write

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:12.140
that down, and I'll switch
colors again-- this is .16384.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.040
And we're going to add
that to 5 divided by 64.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.290
So let's see.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:24.460
5 divided by 64 is equal to
.07, whatever, whatever.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:32.770
Plus .16384 is
equal to .241965.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.860
So that's the probability-- not
knowing which coin I picked

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.250
out-- that's the probability of
getting four out of six heads.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.230
When you combine them you know?

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.310
It could be 1/3 chance
fair, 2/3 chance unfair.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:50.440
So that's 24.19-- I'm keeping
the precision, just because it

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.430
might come in useful
later-- % chance.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.310
So that's the probability of b.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.730
So let's see if we can clean
this up a little bit, just

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.990
because I don't think we need
all of this writing now.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.050
I think we're ready to
substitute into the Bayes'

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.640
formula, which we-- Bayes'
Theorem-- that we rederived.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.980
Nope, that's not what
I wanted to do.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.110
 

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.370
Recording longer videos is
dangerous because if I

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.130
make a mistake that's
more time wasted.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.820
I don't want to delete anything
that could be useful.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.770
 

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.750
OK.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:31.650
So let's see if we can solve
the probability that we picked

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.400
a fair coin, given that we
got four out of six heads.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.880
So that is going to be equal
to-- by Bayes' Theorem, which

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.620
should make some sense to
you-- that is equal to the

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.820
probability of b given a.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:48.040
So it's the probability that we
get four out of six heads,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:54.060
given a fair coin, times the
probability of a fair coin,

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.660
over the probability of
getting four out of

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.090
six heads either way.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.480
So four out of six heads, given
a fair coin-- we figured that

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.270
over here-- that's 15/64.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.540
So this equals 15/64.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.240
What's the probability that
we picked a fair coin?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.110
Well, there's 15 coins and 5
of them are fair, so it's

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.860
5 out of 15, so it's 1/3.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.040
So times 1/3.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.110
And what's the probability
that, in general, we picked

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.250
four out of six heads?

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:26.115
Well that's this
number: .241965.

00:13:26.115 --> 00:13:33.720
So this equals-- let's see,
this is equal to 5/64 divided

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.690
by .241965, and what
does that equal to?

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.520
 

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:58.380
That's 5 divided by 64 divided
by .241965 is equal to 32.--

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:05.170
well, roughly 3%--
is equal to 32.3%.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.790
So that's amazing.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.290
Or relatively amazing.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.970
It's a little bit less than a
1/3 shot that we picked the

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.730
fair coin, given that we
got four out of six heads.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.480
And what's interesting is, the
four out of six heads, it kind

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.880
of decreased the probability
that we got a fair coin.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.800
Because before having any data
on what happens when we flip

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.560
it, we would have had
a 1/3 probability.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.130
Which is 33.3, right?

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:36.860
But given that we got more
heads than tails, the universal

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.280
probability is telling us that,
well, if you got more heads

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.340
then tails, that makes it a
little bit more likely that you

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.220
picked the unfair coin, which
is a little bit more

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.090
weighted to heads.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.240
But it's saying it's not that
much more likely, because this

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.870
isn't that unusual of a result
to get, even with a fair coin.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.230
So that's why it became a
little bit less likely

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.380
to get a fair coin.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.420
And let me give you a bit
of an intuition, visually,

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.840
kind of with Set Theory,
on why that makes sense.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.850
 

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.450
So if we go back to Bayes'
Theorem-- let's just say

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:22.180
that this is the universe
of all of the events.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.060
That's all of the universe.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.490
There's roughly a 1/3 chance
that I picked a fair coin.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.320
So roughly 1/3 of
this will be fair.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.040
This is fair, this is unfair.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.590
And then if I picked a fair
coin, we figured out there's

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:41.830
roughly a 15 out of 64
shot that I get four

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:42.460
out of six heads.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.732
So maybe that's this little
section of this-- let me do

00:15:44.732 --> 00:15:45.470
it in a different color.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.250
That's this section.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.200
And then we figured out if we
have an unfair coin-- I forgot

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.590
what the exact number is-- but
there was some probability that

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.720
we get four out of six heads.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.160
It's actually a little bit
bigger, it's like that.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.090
So this is getting four out
of six heads, given you

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.230
got an unfair coin.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.940
This is getting four out
of six heads, given that

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.290
you got a fair coin.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.680
And then this whole area is
the probability that you

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.110
get four out of six heads.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.530
So all Bayes' Theorem
told us is, look, we got

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.470
four out of six heads.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:17.590
So we're in this universe where
we got four out of six heads.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.570
And if we got four out of six
heads, 1/3 of this universe--

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.850
roughly, or 32.3% of this
subset of four out of six

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.620
heads-- intersects with
the fair coin universe.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:38.370
So this 32.3% is essentially
this fraction of the total

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.740
probability of getting
four out of six heads.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.240
Anyway, hopefully that gave you
a little bit of intuition.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.170
And I hope that Youtube lets me
publish this video, because

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.100
I'm on my 17th minute.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.370
I'll see you in the next video.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:51.870
