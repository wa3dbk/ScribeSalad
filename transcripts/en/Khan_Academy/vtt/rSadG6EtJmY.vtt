00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.370
We're told that the total cost
of filling up your car with

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.540
gas varies directly with the
number of gallons of gasoline

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.880
you are purchasing.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.800
So this first statement tells
us that if x is equal to the

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:28.790
number of gallons purchased, and
y is equal to the cost of

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.300
filling up the car, this first
statement tells us that y

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.450
varies directly with the number
of gallons, with x.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.850
So that means that y is equal
to some constant, we'll just

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.050
call that k, times x.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.310
This is what it means
to vary directly.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.670
If x goes up, y will go up.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.150
We don't know what the rate
is. k tells us the rate.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.100
If x goes down, y
will be down.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.850
Now, they give us more
information, and this will

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.260
help us figure out what k is.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.570
If a gallon of gas costs $2.25,
how many gallons could

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.700
you purchase for $18?

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.350
So if x is equal to 1-- this
statement up here, a gallon of

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.090
gas-- that tells us if we get 1
gallon, if x is equal to 1,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.060
then y is $2.25, right?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.390
y is what it costs.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.300
They tell us 1 gallon costs
$2.25, so you could write it

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:33.190
right here, $2.25 is equal
to k times x, times 1.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.190
Well, I didn't even have to
write the times 1 there.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.330
It's essentially telling
us exactly what the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.900
rate is, what k is.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.260
We don't even have to
write that 1 there.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.880
k is equal to 2.25.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.450
That's what this told
us right there.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.220
So the equation, how y varies
with x, is y is equal to

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.710
2.25x, where x is the number
of gallons we purchase.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.650
y is the cost of that
purchase, so

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.390
it's $2.25 a gallon.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.320
And then they ask us, how
many gallons could you

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.590
purchase for $18?

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.690
So $18 is going to be our total
cost. It is y cost of

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.990
filling the car.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.690
So 18 is going to be
equal to 2.25x.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.020
Now if we want to solve for x,
we can divide both sides by

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.730
2.25, so let's do that.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.310
You divide 18 by 2.25,
divide 2.25x by 2.25,

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.610
and what do we get?

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.520
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.650
The right-hand side, the 2.25's
cancel out, you get x.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.020
And then what is 18
divided by 2.25?

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.090
So let me write this down.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.210
So first of all, I just like to
think of it as a fraction.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.930
2.25 is the same thing-- let me
write over here-- 2.25 is

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.160
equal to 2 and 1/4, which is
the same thing as 9 over 4.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.480
So 18 divided by 2.25 is equal
to 18 divided by 9 over 4,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.960
which is equal to 18 times
4 over 9, or 18 over 1

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.160
times 4 over 9.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.540
And let's see, 18 divided by 9
is 2, 9 divided by 9 is 1.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.330
That simplifies pretty
nicely into 8.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.915
So 18 divided by 2.25 is 8, so
we can buy 8 gallons for $18.
