00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's see if we can tackle
a slightly more difficult

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.810
hyperbola graphing problem.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.150
Let's add the hyperbola.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:21.180
Make this up on the fly x minus
1 squared over 16 minus y plus

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.660
1 squared over 4 is equal to 1.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.480
So the first thing to recognize
is that this is a hyperbola and

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.410
we'll in a few videos, do a
bunch of problems where the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.025
first point is just to identify
what type of conic section we

00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:41.480
have and then the second
step is actually graph

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.440
the conic section.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.400
I already told you that we're
going to be doing a hyperbola

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.550
problem, so you know
it's a hyperbola.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.500
But the way to recognize that
is that you have this minus of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.670
the y squared term and then
we actually have it shifted.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.640
The classic or the standard
non-shifted form of a hyperbola

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.940
or a hyperbola centered at 0
would look something like this.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.950
Especially if it has the same
asymptotes just shifted, but

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.600
centered at 0 it would look
like this: x squared over 16

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.820
minus y squared over
4 is equal to 1.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.830
And the difference between this
hyperbola and this hyperbola

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:28.670
the center of this hyperbola is
at the point x is equal to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.250
1 y is equal to minus 1.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.670
And the way to think about it
is x equals 1 makes this whole

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.570
term 0, and so that's
why it's the center.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.720
And y equal to minus 1
makes this whole term 0.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.750
And on here, of course,
the center is the origin.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.030
Center is 0, 0.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.430
So the easy way to graph this
is to really graph this one,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.140
but you shift it so you use the
center being 1 minus 1 instead

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.770
of the center being 0, 0.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.440
So let's do that.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.990
So let's figure out the slope
of the two asymptotes here and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.270
then we can shift those two
slopes so that it's appropriate

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.220
for this hyperbola right here.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.140
So if we go with this one,
let's just solve for y.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.480
That's what I always
like to do whenever I'm

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.270
graphing a hyperbola.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.100
So we get minus y
squared over 4.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.470
Subtracting x squared over
16 from both sides minus

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.730
x squared over 16 plus 1.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.190
I'm working on this hyperbola
right here, not this one,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.880
and then I'm going to
just shift it later.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.810
And then let's say multiply
both sides by minus 4 and you

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.100
get y squared is equal to-- see
the minus cancels out with that

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:59.020
and then 4 over 16 is x squared
over 4 minus 4 and so y is

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.900
equal to plus or minus square
root of x squared

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.480
over 4 minus 4.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.340
And to figure out the
asymptotes you just have to

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.640
think about well what happens
as x approaches positive

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.220
or negative infinity.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.270
As x gets really positive
or x gets really negative.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.040
And we've done this a
bunch of times already.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.900
I think this is important.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.560
This is more important than
just memorizing the formula,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.640
because it gives you an
intuition of where those

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.750
equations for the lines of the
asymptote actually come from.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.710
Because these are what this
graph or this equation or this

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.330
function approaches as x
approaches positive or

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.600
negative infinity.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:47.090
As x approaches positive or
negative infinity, what is y

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.680
approximately equal
to, in this case?

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.860
Well once again, this term
is going to dominate.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.110
This is just a 4 right here.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.410
You could imagine when x is
like a trillion or a negative

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.650
trillion, this is going to be
huge number and this is going

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.230
to be just like you know
you almost view it like

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.920
the ground off area.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.630
You take the square root
of that and so this

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.520
is going to dominate.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.910
So as you approach positive or
negative infinity, y is going

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.570
to be approximately equal to
the square root, the positive

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.510
and negative square root,
of x squared over 4.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.950
So y would be approximately
equal to positive or

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.340
negative x over 2, or 1/2x.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.560
Let's do that.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.525
Let's draw our asymptotes.

00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:31.820
And remember, these are the
asymptotes for this situation.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.070
But now of course, we're
centered at 1 negative 1.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.330
So I'm going to draw two lines
with these slopes, with

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.840
positive 1/2 and negative 1/2
slopes, but they're going to be

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.450
centered at this point.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.090
I just got rid of the shift
just so I could figure out the

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.120
asymptotes but of course this
is the real thing that we're

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.480
trying to graph, so
let me do that.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:02.990
This is my y-axis this is my
x-axis and the center of

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.340
this is at 1 negative 1.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.360
So x is equal to 1 y
is equal to minus 1.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.530
And then the slopes of the
asymptotes were positive

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.420
and negative 1/2.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.040
So let's do the positive 1/2.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.330
So that means for every 2 you
run over, so if you go positive

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.770
in the positive x direction
2, you move up 1.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.710
So you go to the
right 2 and up 1.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.880
So that's the first one.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.620
Let me draw that asymptote.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.970
Looks something like that, and
then we draw it from this

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.610
point to that point.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.790
Got to have a steady hand.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.040
And then the other asymptote
is going to have a

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.850
minus 1/2 slope.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.350
Remember this is our
center 1 minus 1, so if

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.350
I go down 1 and over.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.580
So when I go over 2, I go down
1, so that will be right there,

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.850
Let me draw that asymptote.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.320
And then just to continue it
in the other direction I want

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.280
to make the lines overlap.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.230
It's going to look
something like that.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.690
So we've drawn our asymptotes
for this function, and now we

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.830
have to figure out if it's
going to be a vertical

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.600
hyperbola or a
horizontal hyperbola.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.860
And the easy way to think
about it is to try and make--

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.230
and we can do it two ways.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.650
I mean if you just look at
this equation right here.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.560
When you're taking the positive
square root, we're always going

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.720
to be slightly below
the asymptote.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.890
The asymptote is this thing,
but we're always going

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:48.810
to be slightly below it.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.550
So that tells us that were
always going to be slightly

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.810
below the asymptote on the
positive square root, and we're

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.460
always going to be slightly
above the asymptote on the

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.100
negative square root.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.000
Because it's going to be little
less, and it's negative.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.850
But I'll let you
think about that.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.890
My intuition is that it's
going to be there and there.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.600
It's more than intuition.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.770
I know that we're going to be
a little bit less than the

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.920
negative square root, but
I'll do it the other way.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.410
I'll do it the way I
did in the last video.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.430
So the other way to think
about it is what happens

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.850
when this term is 0?

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.330
For this term to be 0, x
has to be equal to 1.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.160
And does that ever happen?

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.680
Can x be equal to 1?

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.700
If x is equal to 1
here this term is 0.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:33.810
And then you have a situation
where-- and then you have a

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:39.530
minus y squared over 4 would
have to equal 1, or this would

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.975
have to be a negative number.

00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:43.610
So x could not be equal to 1.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.720
So y could be equal
to negative 1.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.770
Let's try that out.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:54.120
If y is equal to negative
1, this term right

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.680
here disappears.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:07.800
So when y is equal to negative
1, you're just left with-- x

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.450
minus 1 squared over
16 is equal to 1.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.270
I just canceled out this term,
because I'm saying what happens

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.400
when y is equal to negative 1.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.970
You multiply both sides by 16.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.330
Let me do it over here.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.280
These get messy. x minus 1
squared is equal to 16.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.860
Take the square root
of both sides.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:34.710
x minus 1 is equal to
positive or negative 4.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.440
And so if x is equal to
positive 4, if you add 1 to

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.700
that x would be equal to 5.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.660
And then if x minus 1 would be
minus 4 and you add 1 to that

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.080
you will have x is equal to 3.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.260
So our 2 points or our 2 points
closest to our center are the

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:59.830
points 5 comma negative 1
and 3 comma negative 1.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.770
Let's plot those 2.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:09.110
So 5, 1 2 3 4 5, negative
1 and 3, negative 1.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.310
Is that right?

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.070
No, minus 3, because x
minus 1 could be minus 4.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.210
That's what happens
when you skip steps.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.770
If you have the minus 4
situation, then x is

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.570
equal to minus 3.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.910
You go 1 2 3 minus 3, minus 1.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.690
So those are both points
on this hyperbola.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.980
And then our intuition was
correct, or it was what I said.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:47.110
That-- the positive square root
is always going to be slightly

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.490
below the asymptote,
so we get our curve.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.500
It's going to look
something like this.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.590
It's going to get closer and
closer, and then here it's

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.590
going to get closer and
closer in that direction.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.070
It keeps getting closer and
closer to that asymptote.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.690
And here, it's going to keep
getting closer and closer to

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:06.080
the asymptote on that side
and then on that side.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.760
And of course these
asymptotes keep going

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.600
on forever and forever.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.370
If you want you could try
out some other points

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.100
just to confirm.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.690
You could plot that point
there, or that point there

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.220
just to confirm that
that's the case.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.720
The hard part really is just to
identify the asymptotes and

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.620
just to figure out do we sit on
the left and the right, or do

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.950
we sit on the top
and the bottom.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.570
And then you're done.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.200
You can graph your hyperbola.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.690
See you in the next video.
