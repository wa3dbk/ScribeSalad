00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.150
When we first started talking
about central tendencies and

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.180
how we measure average, we
talked about the arithmetic

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.360
mean and there you just added
up the numbers and you

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.320
divided by the number
of numbers there were.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.040
So let's say our population
of numbers is-- we have a 3.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.110
Let's say we have three
3's, a 4, and a 5.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.480
That's our population.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.990
And if we wanted the population
mean here we were just

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.990
add all the numbers up.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.140
We'd say 3 plus 3 plus
3 plus 4 plus 5.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.630
And then we would divide
that sum by the number

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.750
of numbers we have.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.250
We would divide that by 5.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.200
And we would come--let's see.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.170
What would this be?

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.160
This would be 9 plus
9; it'd be 18/5.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.650
That would be 18/5,
which would be what?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.180
3 and 3/5, which is 3.6.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.980
It's a population mean for
this population of numbers.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.270
If we just rearranged the math
here a little bit we could view

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.200
it a slightly different way.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.460
How many 3's do we have?

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.410
We have three 3's, so we could
view this as 3 times 3.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.760
How many 4's do we have?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.470
We have one 4, so
it's plus 1 times 4.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.950
Plus 1 time 5.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.610
All of that divided by 5.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.820
And then what we could do
is, this is the same thing.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.840
And I'm just doing a little
bit of basic really,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.790
number manipulation here.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.130
This is the same thing as
1/5 times 3 times 3 plus

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.570
1 times 4 plus 1 times 5.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.110
And if we distribute this
1/5 this is equal to what?

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.970
3/5 times 3 plus 1/5 times 1.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.310
So it's plus 1/5 times
4 plus 1/5 times 5.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.010
And this we can see in a
bunch of different ways.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.860
Let me express
these as decimals.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.170
So 3/5.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:17.160
So it's 0.6 times 3 plus 0.2
times 4 plus 0.2 times 5.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.800
Or we could express these
decimals as percentage.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:29.050
We could say 60% times 3, plus
20%-- sorry, 20% times 4.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.250
Plus 20% times 5.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.570
This is identical to adding up
the numbers and then dividing

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.280
by the total number of
numbers there are.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.860
But this is interesting because
here we had to know how many

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.720
total numbers there are.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.350
We have to say, OK, we added up
5 numbers, we divided by 5.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.750
All I did is I played
around with the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.470
arithmetic a little bit.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.340
And I got to this expression.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.480
But this expression's more
interesting, or at least

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.860
it's-- well, it's different.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.110
It's not necessarily
more interesting.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.370
I don't want to make any
value judgment about it.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.570
But here I don't know how
many numbers there are.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.100
I'm just telling you about the
frequency of the numbers.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.810
I'm telling you that 60% of
the numbers are 3, 20% of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.450
the numbers are 4, and then
20% of the numbers are 5.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.570
And then if I were to calculate
this out I would get

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.750
60% times 3 is 1.8.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.350
Plus 20% times 4 is 0.8.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.450
Plus 20% times 5
is-- let's see.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.290
20% plus 1, which would
be equal to 2.6, plus

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.680
1 is equal to 3.6.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.360
So we would get the exact same
number, but what's interesting

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.780
here is that this tells you
just the frequencies-- really

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.030
the relative frequencies of the
3's, the 4's, and the 5's.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.310
What percentage of this
population is 3's?

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.480
60%.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.940
What percentage is 4's?

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.550
20%.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.320
And what population is 5's?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.870
And I'm doing that because we
just talked about random

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.880
variables and all of that.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.410
In the beginning we started our
statistics discussion about

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.070
populations and samples.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.950
But if you think about it,
every time you do one of your

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.580
experiments and you get a new
value for a random variable--

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.660
let's do our classic example.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.630
We have our random variable, x,
is equal to-- I don't know--

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:27.040
it's equal to the number of
heads after 6 tosses

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.840
of a fair coin.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.120
So that's our random variable.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.910
Hopefully now, we can kind of
connect what we thought about

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.190
in terms of just arithmetic
mean and central tendency and

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.330
population versus sample, and
then connect that to the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.770
notion of a random variable.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.380
So when we first started
talking about statistics we

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.480
said, OK, you have this
notion of a population.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.300
And that you would
sample the population.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.890
And we gave a couple
of examples.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.070
You know, the most common one
is you wanted up predict

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.100
the outcome of a
presidential election.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.310
The population is everyone
who's going to vote

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.830
in the election.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.125
You can't survey all 50 million
people or whatever's going

00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:05.930
to vote for the election.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.120
So what you do is you survey
a random sample of that

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.780
population and then you can
calculate statistics on that

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.210
sample that hopefully can
estimate the population

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.470
as a whole.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.340
But what happens if the
population is not finite?

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.360
And just to go back, if the
population is finite you can

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.460
calculate things like
the population mean.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.900
We learned the population
mean was that mu letter.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.350
And that was you just literally
take up all of the items in the

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.620
population, add them together,
and you divide by the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.660
number of items there are.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.980
That's what we did up here.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.610
If this was a whole population
of numbers, we've figured

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.480
out that this was mu.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.610
If this was a sample from a
population then this would

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.020
be the sample mean, but we
learned all about that.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.830
But that's not what I
want to get at now.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.980
But what happens if this
population is infinite?

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.510
If it's infinite and you're
like, oh, Sal, that

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.210
doesn't make any sense.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.910
But if you think about it,
well, a random variable really

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.160
is-- you can kind of view it as
each instance of a

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.960
random variable.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.900
Or every time you performed
the experiment you're taking

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.120
out an instance of an
infinite population.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.350
You can perform this experiment
an infinite number of times.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.530
You can just keep doing it.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.780
It's not like, after doing it a
thousand times you're like, oh,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.240
you can't toss a coin six times
anymore and count the

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.690
number of heads.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.810
You can perform
this indefinitely.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.850
So every specific result from a
random variable-- and those are

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:38.880
usually lowercase results,
lowercase x1 or x2 or x3.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.680
These are just specific
instances of a random variable.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.970
You can view these as samples
from an infinite population.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.170
So I'll try to draw an
infinite population;

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.220
it's kind of harder.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.390
Maybe I'll draw arrows that
go off in every direction.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.610
This population never ends.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.850
You can keep performing the
experiment and keep getting

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.920
samples, but you're sample
is usually finite.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.260
You know, let's say we
performed this experiment.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.180
We toss a fair coin six times
and we do that experiment--

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.680
I don't know-- we do
it a hundred times.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.300
So then we would have a hundred
samples, x2 and it would

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.650
go all the way to x100.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.330
And the reason why I'm doing
this connection is one, to make

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.520
you see the connection between
the random variable and the

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.840
probability, and the statistics
that we talked about earlier.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.630
And in this video, I'm going to
introduce you to the concept of

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.530
the expected value of
a random variable.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.110
And it's nothing else.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.890
So the expected value of a
random variable, the expected

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.000
value of a random variable is
the exact same thing as

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.100
the population mean.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.520
In fact, sometimes it's
called a population mean.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.330
But what makes it interesting
is in this situation, you

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.730
have an infinite population.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.310
So you can't just add up all
the numbers and divide by the

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.780
number of numbers you have
because you have an infinite

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.810
number of numbers.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.430
But what you can do is if
you said wow, I know the

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.400
frequency of the numbers.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.890
I know that 3 shows up 60%
of the time, 4 shows up

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.070
20% of the time, 5 shows
up 20% of the time.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.290
Then, even if you have an
infinite number of numbers,

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.980
you can actually still
calculate a mean.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.470
And that's how you do it
for an expected value

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.860
of a random variable.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.810
So how do you figure out
the frequencies that

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.980
numbers show up?

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.850
Well, you can look at the
probability distribution,

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.570
the discreet probability
distribution.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.350
So in that example that we did
last time, I forgot the exact

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.990
numbers, but actually let
me just take what we

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.050
did-- our Excel out.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.940
Let me just quickly, I want to
make n 6 trials, probability

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.990
of heads, tails-- OK, 0.5.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.790
And then I need to change
what this chart-- just

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.580
give me one second.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.775
Change what the inputs
of this chart are.

00:08:55.775 --> 00:08:57.520
I'm off the screen right now.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.090
OK, there you go.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.970
So this is the probability
distribution for what

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.880
I just described.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.880
I have a fair toss of a coin
and I want to know how many

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.620
heads I have after 6 tosses.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.760
So you can perform this
experiment a bunch of times,

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.480
but this tells you the
frequency, the frequency

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.090
of that random variables.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.480
So when you perform that
experiment-- let's see,

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.090
whatever this is--
0.09% of the time.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.910
No, actually, 9% of the
time you're going to

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.500
get exactly 1 head.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.060
23% of the time you're
going to get 2 heads.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.050
31% of the time you're
going to get 3 heads.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:48.120
23% of the time you're
going to get 4 heads.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.626
And then, you know 9% of
the time you're going

00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:52.910
to get 5 heads.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.330
And then 2% of the time
you're going to get 6 heads.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.840
So if you have that information
you can then actually figure

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.530
out the population mean for
this population that's

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.490
described by this probability
distribution, or the

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.780
expected value.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.800
And let's do that right here.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.330
I'll put this over to the side.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.660
So I'm looking at that chart
I just did while I do this.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.090
We just looked at the
probability distribution for

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.160
this random variable, the
number of heads after 6

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.670
tosses of a fair coin.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:29.910
So the expected value of our
random variable is going

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.050
to be each outcome.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:37.210
So the first outcome is that
we had 0 heads times the

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.720
frequency that 0 shows up.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.640
So we figured out before that
the frequency-- now, it's a

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.390
little inexact because I don't
have-- actually, I have

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.250
the exact numbers.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:58.920
0 will show up in our random
variable 0.01563% of the time.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.020
So let me write that.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.350
So we're going to say, well,
this happens and I can

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:10.270
write it as a percentage
1.563% of the time.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:19.230
Plus 1 happens
9.375% of the time.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:26.920
And then plus 2 happens
23.438% of the time.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:35.170
Plus 3 happens-- let's see,
it says 31.25% of the time.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.340
Almost there.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:41.730
4, I get 4 heads out of 6
tosses 23% percent of the time.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.520
So times 23.438%.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:53.130
I get 5 heads after 6
tosses 9.375% of the time.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:12:00.730
And finally, I get all heads
let's see-- no, I get all

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.370
heads 1.563% of the time.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.060
And that makes sense again
because all heads should be

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.810
just as likely as all tails.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.730
All tails is the same
thing is no heads.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:19.610
So what we did here is
exactly what we did up here.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.070
We took the relative frequency
of each of the numbers in the

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.050
population and we multiply that
outcome times its relative

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.420
frequency, and we're
adding it up.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.640
But this is the exact same
thing mathematically

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.810
as we did up here.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.860
But what's useful now is we can
apply the same principles, but

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.880
we're finding the arithmetic
mean of an infinite population,

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.060
or the expected value of a
random variable, which is the

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.690
same thing as the arithmetic
mean of the population of

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.000
this random variable.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.030
So this value would be equal
to-- actually, let me just

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.040
use Excel to calculate it.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.440
So the expected value of
getting-- the number of heads

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.960
you get after 6 tosses.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.673
So this is 0 times its
frequency, and then I'm going

00:13:08.673 --> 00:13:11.590
to add them all up and then
just will just do that

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.400
same thing in all of it.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.100
So this says this will be 1
times its frequency, 2 times

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.920
its frequency, and then if I
were to take the sum of all of

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:30.140
them-- equals sum of all of
these-- I get exactly 3.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.570
And that's actually kind of
an expected outcome, right?

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.030
I shouldn't use the word
expected too much.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.260
That the central tendency or
you could say, the population

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.480
mean, of this random variable,
or you could say the expected

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.400
value of this random
variable is exactly 3.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.290
And in this example it turned
out that 3 is also in kind of

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.330
the colloquial sense, it's
the most expected value.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.920
It's the most probable value.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.130
But we'll see in the future
that the expected value

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.540
doesn't have to be the
most probable value.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.900
You could have a very high
probability of having no heads

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.120
and a very high probability
of having 6 heads.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.690
And then you'd still have an
expected value of 3, even if

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.170
6 or 0 were more probable.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.820
And I'll show you more
examples of that.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.810
But the purpose of this video
is to really show you that the

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.790
expected value calculation
is the same thing as the

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.670
population mean calculation,
but we do it this way because

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.360
you can't add up an infinite
number of data points and

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.650
divide by an infinite number.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.880
Instead you want to know the
frequencies of each of the

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.500
outcomes and then you just add
up all the outcomes weighted

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.450
by their frequencies.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.290
But that's no different than
what you did up there.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.000
And I really want to hit that
point home because sometimes in

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.160
probability books they'll just
give you a formula-- oh, the

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.590
expected value of a probability
distribution is each of the

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.330
outcomes times their frequency.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.960
But I want to show you that
that is the same thing

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.470
as the population mean.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.900
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
