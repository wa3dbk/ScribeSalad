00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.520
A town had a population
of 11,256 in 1995.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.340
By 2010, the population
in that town had

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.560
increased by 4,312.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.290
Estimate the town's population
in 2010 by first rounding

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.300
these two numbers to the
nearest hundred.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.470
So we could figure out the
exact population just by

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.400
adding these two, but they
want us to round to the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.930
nearest hundred first and get an
estimate, and then add, so

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.430
it'll be an estimate of
the town's population.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.840
So first we have this 11,256.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.130
That's the population in 1995.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.610
11,256.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.020
We need to round to the nearest
hundred, so let's look

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.350
at the hundreds place here.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.790
So this is either going to go
down to 200 or go up to 300,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.130
depending on what the
next place is or

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.290
the next lowest place.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.370
So we go down to the tens
place, we see a 5.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.140
5 is 5 or greater, so we want
to round this number up.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.000
We are going to round up.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.220
So if you round up
to the nearest

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.960
hundred, you get 11,000.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.970
Instead of having 256, we're
rounding up to 300.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.170
300 is closer to 256
than 200 is.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.770
That's why we're rounding
up to that.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.010
That's why it's to the
nearest hundred.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.780
Now, we added 4,312
people, so 4,312.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.270
Now once again, we look
at the hundreds place.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.920
We go one spot below that.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.730
The question we're trying to
answer: Do we go down to 4,300

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.900
or do we go up to 4,400?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.370
Which one is closer?

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.230
Well, we see we only
have a 1 here.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.420
1 is definitely less than 5,
so we want to round down.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.930
So 312 is closer to 300.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.850
We round down to just a 3 here
and these get zeroed out.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.310
So 4,300.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.520
And now we're ready to add
our rounded numbers.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.700
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.160
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.140
3 plus 3 is 6.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.630
Let's put a comma here
so it's easy to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.880
read every third digit.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.080
1 plus 4 is 5, and then 1 plus--
we have nothing here,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.480
so we just bring down that 1.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.710
We could have written
that addition there.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.944
We're adding those
two numbers.

00:02:08.944 --> 00:02:14.005
So our estimate of the town's
population in 2010 is 15,600.
