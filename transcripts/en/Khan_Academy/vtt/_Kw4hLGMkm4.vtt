00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.410
In the last part of the problem
we figured out that the

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.420
function of the height of the
ferris wheel, the people at the

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.140
ferris wheel at any time is a
function of t. h of t is equal

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:18.590
to 9 minus 8 cosine of 18t
where t is in seconds.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.730
Now the second part of this
problem they want us to graph h

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.530
as a function of t between 0 is
less than or equal to t, is

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.800
less than or equal to 30.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.500
So let me draw axes.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.690
So let's say that
that's my h-axis.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.660
Let's say that this
is my t-axis.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.845
So this is t equals 0, and this
is t is equal to 30 seconds.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.660
I get confused when I see
this 18 here or whatever.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.040
So what I'm going to do first
of all is I'm going to graph a

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.230
different function, slightly
different function, then I'll

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.870
translate it to this function.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.820
I'm going to graph h of
theta is equal to 9

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.430
minus 8 cosine of theta.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.010
I think you'll see where
I'm going with this

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.320
when I'm all done.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.600
So let's try to graph h
of theta is equal to 9

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.260
minus 8 cosine of theta.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.810
So when t is equal
to 30 seconds, what

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.090
is theta equal to?

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.800
So 30 times 18, that's 540.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.780
So this is 540 degrees.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.370
Same thing.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.340
I'll write the thetas in
red above the t-axis.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.310
This is 540 degrees, so
that's like two times

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.940
around the circle.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.470
So that's 540 degrees,
then this is going to

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.890
be roughly 270 degrees.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.450
So, 90 degrees will be
about 1/3 of this.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.830
That would be 90 degrees, that
would be 180, so that would be

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.680
90 degrees, that would be 180
degrees, this would be 360

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.910
degrees, and this would be 360
plus 90 so this will

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.140
be 450 degrees.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.390
If you wanted to figure out
the corresponding time,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.680
you just take this
degree and divide by 18.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.300
So it's 90 divided
by 18 is what?

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.175
It's five, right?

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:39.360
So if I were to write here,
this is at 5 seconds, this is

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.400
at 10 seconds, this is 15
seconds, this is 20 seconds,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.910
this is -- sorry, this is 25
seconds, this is 30 seconds.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.140
Actually, a simple thing we
could do is let's just figure

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.640
out what the value of the
function is at these points.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.690
Because these are pretty
easy degrees to figure out

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.810
what the cosine value is.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.160
So let's figure out --
let me draw a table.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.740
Tables are always good and
I'll do it in yellow.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.520
So I'll draw a t theta and h.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.160
This might be kind of an
unconventional way of doing

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.170
things, but I have a simple
mind so this is actually

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.680
how I like to do it.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.460
So I like to think of
theta as 0, 90, 180,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.810
270, 360, 450 and 540.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.160
And t, the corresponding
time of those, as 0,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.170
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.850
It's not rocket science here.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.470
When t equals 15 seconds,
15 times 18, we're trying

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.120
to find the cosine of
270 degrees, right?

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.080
15 times 18 is 270 degrees.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.740
I'm just doing this because I
don't have a calculator and

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.480
this will help me
pick good points.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.850
So when t is equal to
0, what is height?

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.750
Or t is equal to 0, theta is
equal to 0, so cosine of theta

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.800
is -- cosine of 0 is 1.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.090
So 9 minus 8 is 1.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.610
I'm going to do h in
a different color.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.540
So this is 1.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.430
Cosine of 90 degrees?

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.180
Cosine of 90 degrees is 0.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.170
So 9 minus 0 is 9.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.885
Cosine of 180 degrees?

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:37.960
So we're going all the way
around the unit circle.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.310
Cosine of 180
degrees is minus 1.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:47.770
So minus 1 times minus 8 is
plus 8, so 9 plus 8, that's 15.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.500
Cosine of 270 degrees are
pointing straight down, so the

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.670
x-coord is going to be 0.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.540
So once again,
we're at 9 again.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.930
9 minus 0.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.900
360 degrees.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.900
Cosine of 360 degrees
is the same thing as

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.390
cosine of 0, right?

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.080
So once again, I mean we've
gone around the circle once.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.480
So it's going to be the same
as 0, so it's going to be 1.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.420
And 450 is going to be
the same thing as 90.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.250
So it's going to be 9
and then 15 degrees.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.690
So let's plot these points.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.980
Actually, let me just
draw 15 up here.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.820
So what are the points
that keep showing up?

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:33.310
So this is 1, that's 1, that's
1, and then we have 9.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:44.685
1, there's 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.970
Fair enough.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.380
So let me draw some
guidelines just to help us.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.270
Actually, let me do them kind
of hard to see, because I

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.400
don't want to draw too much
attention to the guidelines.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.100
I could do one guideline there.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.075
Then I'll do a bottom
guideline right there.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.690
Then the 9 keeps showing up.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.260
Oh, you know what, I can't add.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.060
What's 9 plus 8?

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.330
It's not 15, it's 17.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:37.580
Sorry, clearly, I need to
practice my addition.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.970
So this is 9 plus
8, this is 17.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.890
And I realized that because I
was like, well 9 should be in

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.820
the middle, so this
is actually 17.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.820
Ignore my little marks here.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.520
That's 17, this is 1.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.470
Ignore the marks.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.130
9 would be right in the
middle between 1 and 17.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.290
So let me draw kind of
mediant point right there.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.820
So this is 9.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.150
Sorry I can't add properly.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.230
Then let's draw the graph
or at least plot the

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.820
points on the graph.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:15.240
So, t equals 0 where h equals
1, so that's this point.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.020
That's right here.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.540
When t equals 5, h is
equal to 9, right here.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.350
When t is equal to 10,
h is equal to 17.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.280
When t is equal to
15, h is 9 again.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.510
So it's right here.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.040
At 20 we're back at 1.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.590
I think you see the pattern.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.570
At 25 we're back at 9.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.500
And then at 30 we're back at
17, not 15, because now I

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.330
have corrected my mistake.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.270
And this is going to be sined
graph, it's going to look

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.360
something like this.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.080
Let me do it in a vibrant color
so I can overwrite everything

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.130
and it's going to look
something like this.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:05.466
Go oops, and then up
and them down here.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:19.100
Curve up, come back down, curve
up and then come back down.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.060
Like that.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.490
So that's our graph.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.850
I think in the problem they
tell us to approximate.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:30.910
Actually, let me open up my
cousin's problem -- my other

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.120
account has timed-out on
me while I recorded this.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.080
They wanted to approximate when
t equals 4 what the height is.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.030
So when t equals 4 the
height is like right

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.440
around there, right?

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.650
So the height is a
little bit less than 9.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.500
And I don't know, 7 or
8 meters in the air.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.770
And when time is equal to 10 --
well, time equal 10, we figured

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.930
out exactly, we know that there
are 17 meters in the air.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.510
So I know this was kind of a
little messy and graphing

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.770
trick functions tend to be,
but hopefully you found

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.160
this vaguely useful.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.620
Have fun.
