00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:08.870
We are asked to graph y is
equal to 1/3x minus 2.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.740
Now, whenever you see an
equation in this form, this is

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.680
called slope-intercept form.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.290
And the general way of writing
it is y is equal to mx plus b,

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.140
where m is the slope.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.120
And here in this case, m is
equal to 1/3-- so let me write

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.300
that down-- m is equal to 1/3,
and b is the y-intercept.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.310
So in this case, b is
equal to negative 2.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.090
And you know that b is the
y-intercept, because we know

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.160
that the y-intercept occurs
when x is equal to 0.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.230
So if x is equal to 0 in either
of these situations,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.700
this term just becomes 0 and
y will be equal to b.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.380
So that's what we mean by
b is the y-intercept.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.690
So whenever you look at an
equation in this form, it's

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.170
actually fairly straightforward

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.690
to graph this line.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.220
b is the y-intercept.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.090
In this case it is negative 2,
so that means that this line

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.810
must intersect the y-axis at y
is equal to negative 2, so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.760
it's this point right here.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.910
Negative 1, negative 2, this
is the point 0, negative 2.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.920
If you don't believe me, there's
nothing magical about

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.410
this, try evaluating or
try solving for y when

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.250
x is equal to 0.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.440
When x is equal to 0, this term
cancels out and you're

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.900
just left with y is equal
to negative 2.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.510
So that's the y-intercept
right there.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.830
Now, this 1/3 tells us the
slope of the line.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.430
How much do we change in
y for any change in x?

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.760
So this tells us that
1/3, so that right

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.230
there, is the slope.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:54.380
So it tells us that 1/3 is equal
to the change in y over

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.840
the change in x.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.760
Or another way to think about
it, if x changes by 3, then y

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.890
would change by 1.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.660
So let me graph that.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.930
So we know that this point is
on the graph, that's the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.960
y-intercept.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.530
The slope tells us that if x
changes by 3-- so let me go 3

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.180
three to the right, 1, 2, 3--
that y will change by 1.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.820
So this must also be a
point on the graph.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.720
And we could keep doing that.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.960
If x changes by 3,
y changes by 1.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.030
If x goes down by 3, y
will go down by 1.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.710
If x goes down by 6, y
will go down by 2.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.600
It's that same ratio, so
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.810
And you can see all of these
points are on the line, and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.080
the line is the graph of
this equation up here.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.690
So let me graph it.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.220
So it'll look something
like that.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.810
And you're done.
