00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.140
We learned in the videos on
torque that torque equals--

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.940
let me actually draw a picture,
so you remember what

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.170
we're talking about
with torque.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.580
So let's say-- so that's the
arm, let's say right here is

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.120
what its pivot is.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.510
That's its pivot.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:30.420
And let's say that I'm putting
a force right there, and it's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.216
perpendicular to this arm.

00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:35.540
And let's say the length
of this arm is r.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:45.220
And this force is f.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.000
So we know that the torque
is this force times

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.730
the distance, right?

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.030
And then we also know that--
what is force?

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.390
Well, that is equal
to mass times

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.980
acceleration times distance.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.730
So torque is equal
to mass times

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.090
acceleration times distance.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.900
And then so what is
acceleration?

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.540
Well that's equal to mass times
change in velocity over

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.240
change in time, times
distance, right?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.020
So we learned all that from our
torque chapter, and you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.420
might want to review it, just
to get an intuition of what

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.180
torque is good for.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.850
But in general, if something
isn't spinning, you apply

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.080
torque, and you'll
get it spinning.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.560
Or if something is spinning
already, if you apply torque

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560
in the direction that it's
spinning, it'll spin faster.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.280
Or if you go in the opposite
direction, it'll spin slower.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.170
And what I'm showing you here,
is that what happens if you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.690
apply no torque?

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.310
Well if you apply no torque,
then we know that this

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.070
quantity is 0.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.270
Or another way to think about
it-- actually why did I write

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.530
d, it could be d, but I
shouldn't have called this r,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.590
it should be d.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.950
So if this is 0-- if we are
applying no torque, right--

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.920
what do we know?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.850
We know that the change in
velocity over change in time,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.660
times this distance,
won't change-- that

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.760
this quantity is 0.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.020
So we know that the velocity
times the distance is going to

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.270
be a constant.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.660
And that comes from what
I just talked about.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.070
It falls out of Newton's laws,
but it applies to spinning.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.690
An object that's not spinning
will tend to not stay

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.480
spinning, and an object
that is spinning will

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.190
tend to stay spinning.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.470
So in this case, if this object
at this point right

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.090
here-- so we're in a case where
there's no torque, so

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.770
this force is 0-- there's
no force applying here.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.190
And whatever this object's
velocity was-- its tangential

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.490
velocity-- it's going to stay
at that velocity, right?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.300
It's just going to keep spinning
at that velocity.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.940
If I apply more torque it'll
go even faster, if I apply

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.600
less torque, it'll slow
down a little bit.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.510
But we know that this
velocity times

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.440
the distance is constant.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.850
And actually, I don't know why
I took this m out-- we know

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.060
that the mass times the velocity
times the distance,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.320
is constant.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.520
Right?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.350
So what does that tell us?

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.400
Well, we learned in the angular
velocity video-- my

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.530
mind's a little slow
today-- that what?

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.220
Angular velocity is equal to
velocity divided by the

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.330
radius, and this case, the
radius is this distance, so we

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.730
could also write it as velocity
over distance.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.510
And when I talk about radius,
it's just the radius of the

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.760
circle that you're spinning
around in, right?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.620
This could be the
circle, up here.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.920
So this d, that's the same
thing as the radius.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.280
I'm just switching letters
to confuse you.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.210
But let's see if we can write
something, if we can change

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.670
this expression to include
angular velocity.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.800
You'll see where I'm
going in a second.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.070
So let's solve for v.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.560
So let's multiply both sides
of this, times d.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.450
So you get dw is equal to v.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.890
Right, I just took this d,
put it on this side.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.740
So let's write that here-- m
times dw-- right, I just

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.560
replaced the v-- times d,
is equal to a constant.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.660
Assuming that we have no net
torque on the system.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.130
And so what does that get us?

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.310
Well that gets us m times the
angular velocity times d

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.490
squared is equal
to a constant.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.170
So what does this tell us?

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.400
This tells us the mass of an
object spinning-- let me

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.050
rewrite this, because I think--
so what we know is

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.300
that the mass of an object
spinning, times how fast it is

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.020
spinning, times the distance
to the center of its

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.110
rotation-- and actually I'm
going to change that d to an

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.370
r, I don't know why I even used
d to begin with-- times

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.720
that squared.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.950
That's going to be equal to a
constant, assuming no net

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.720
force-- no net torque.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.970
Another way of looking at that,
if we just wanted to go

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.420
to angular velocity from the
get-go, we could have said

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.870
torque is equal to mass times
change in velocity, times

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.840
change in time, times the radius
to the center of where

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.400
you're rotating around.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.810
And change in velocity is just
the same thing as mass times

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.920
change in angular velocity,
times r.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.460
Change in time, and then
there's another

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.480
r, that's this r.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.996
Because velocity is angular
velocity times r, and we're

00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:43.560
assuming r doesn't change, so
any change in velocity is just

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.260
going to be a change in
the angular velocity.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.880
And then we would get the same
thing that we just got here.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.040
If we have no net torque, we're
going to have no change

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.840
in angular velocity, so angular

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.100
velocity will be a constant.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.690
So you'll get mass times angular
velocity, times-- and

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.780
then you have this r, and this
r-- times r squared, is going

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.790
to be equal to a constant.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.430
Where am I going with
all of this?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.930
Well let's think about
something.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.870
Let's say that I have some
object traveling in a circle.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.080
I do everything for a reason,
and you'll see my

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.290
reason right now.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:34.120
Let's say that-- so let's
say this is some type of

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.740
retractable pole, and
I'm an ice skater.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.230
And I'm not using the ice
skater's body right now,

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.690
because it'll become
complicated.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.070
Let's say this is some type of
robot arm, and that's its

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.050
joint right there.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.440
And it's holding a
mass out here.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.730
This is neat because after
this concept, you'll

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.660
understand what goes on in
figure skating, and then the

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.930
Olympics-- oh no, the
Winter Olympics are

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:00.980
over, aren't they?

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.830
Anyway, let's say that this
object is spinning

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.080
around at some rate.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:17.320
It's spinning around at
10 radians a second.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.330
That's its angular velocity.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.570
And let's say, right
now its rotational

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:29.560
distance is 10 feet.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:38.665
So this is spinning on an ice
skating rink, because you

00:07:38.665 --> 00:07:40.280
don't want friction
and all of that.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.920
So what's its current
angular momentum?

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.690
So that's what this term right
here is, angular momentum.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.790
So what's its current
angular momentum?

00:07:52.790 --> 00:08:00.880
Well its mass times 10, times--
10 is its-- actually,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.920
let's make this radius a
different number, let's call

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.810
it 8 feet, just you know
what I'm doing.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.310
So its angular velocity is
10, and then its radius

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.560
is 8, so times 64.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.250
So it equals 640 times mass.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.535
This is its angular momentum.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.130
Now what happens if this arm,
for whatever reason,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.900
shortens-- and maybe it does
something like this, the arm

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.950
kind of bends.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.760
And then the mass comes
here, it comes in

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.340
closer to the center.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.900
I'll write that in a
different color.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.280
The mass comes closer to
the center, so now

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.659
the radius is 4.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.870
But I've had no net torque on
the system, all I've done is

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.450
change how far it is from
the center of rotation.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.660
How much faster is it
going to spin now?

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.760
Let's think about it.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.310
Its angular momentum won't
change, this is a constant,

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.680
which is its angular momentum.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.940
That won't change.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:01.810
So we now know that the mass
times the angular-- the new

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.470
angular momentum, we'll write
that angular momentum 1--

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.890
times the new distance squared--
times 16-- is also

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.780
going to be equal to 640m.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.860
The angular momentum
doesn't change.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.000
Let's cross out m from both
sides, and then divide both

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.330
sides by 16.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:23.790
We now have that w1 is equal
to 16 goes into 640.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.390
So what happened?

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.540
Originally, I was going around
at 10 radians per second, when

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.400
I halved the radius-- when I
got half as close to the

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.200
center of my rotation, I'm
actually spinning around 4

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.540
times as much.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.620
And that's because this term
is a quadratic term.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.860
And you probably have observed
this behavior before, when you

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.140
see the ice skater skating
around, and they're spinning

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.950
with their arms wide open, and
then they pull their arms in,

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.130
and they go a lot, lot,
lot, lot faster.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.700
And that's because their angular
velocity, or the rate

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.980
at which they're spinning, is
proportional to the square of

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.680
the radius around their
axis of rotation.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.770
Anyway, I hope I didn't confuse
you, and I'll do some

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.620
more problems with this in
the future, but I've

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.390
just run out of time.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.840
See you soon.
