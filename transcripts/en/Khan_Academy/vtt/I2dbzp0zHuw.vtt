00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.130
In the last video, we saw that
if a vector field can be

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:12.580
written as the gradient of a
scalar field-- or another way

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.080
we could say it: this would be
equal to the partial of our big

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.060
f with respect to x times i
plus the partial of big f, our

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.100
scalar field with respect to y
times j; and I'm just writing

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.690
it in multiple ways just so you
remember what the gradient is

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.490
--but we saw that if our vector
field is the gradient of

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.780
a scalar field then we
call it conservative.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:47.825
So that tells us that f is a
conservative vector field.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.140
And it also tells us, and this
was the big take away from the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.400
last video, that the line
integral of f between two

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.900
points-- let me draw two points
here; so let me draw my

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.210
coordinates just so we know
we're on the xy plane.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.780
My axes: x-axis, y-axis.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.820
Let's say I have the point, I
have that point and that point,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.620
and I have two different paths
between those two points.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.190
So I have path 1, that goes
something like that, so

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.005
I'll call that c1 and it
goes in that direction.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.380
And then I have, maybe in
a different shades of

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.010
green, c2 goes like that.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.010
They both start here
and go to there.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.520
We learned in the last video
that the line integral

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.330
is path independent
between any two points.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:57.930
So in this case the line
integral along c1 of f dot dr

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.560
is going to be equal to the
line integral of c2, over the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.870
path c2, of f dot dr. The line,
if we have a potential in

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.500
a region, and we may be
everywhere, then the line

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.590
integral between any two points
is independent of the path.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.390
That's the neat thing about
a conservative field.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.190
Now what I want to do in this
video is do a little bit of

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.680
an extension of the take
away of the last video.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.710
It's actually a pretty
important extension; it might

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.540
already be obvious to you.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.550
I've already written this
here; I could rearrange

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.410
this equation a little bit.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.745
So let me do it.

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:35.310
So let me a rearrange this.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.976
I'll just rewrite
this in orange.

00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:42.730
So the line integral on path c1
dot dr minus-- I'll just go

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.670
subtract this from both sides
--minus the line integral c2 of

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.110
f dot dr is going
to be equal to 0.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.610
All I did is I took this take
away from the last video and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.430
I subtracted this
from both sides.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.370
Now we learned several videos
ago that if we're dealing with

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.560
a line integral of a vector
field-- not a scalar field

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.690
--with a vector field,
the direction of the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.090
path is important.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.370
We learned that the line
integral over, say, c2 of f dot

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.580
dr, is equal to the negative of
the line integral of minus c2

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.830
of f dot dr where we denoted
minus c2 is the same path as

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.740
c2, but just in the
opposite direction.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.370
So for example, minus c2 I
would write like this-- so let

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.440
me do it in a different color
--so let's say this is minus

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.740
c2, it'd be a path just like
c2-- I'm going to call this

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.100
minus c2 --but instead of going
in that direction, I'm now

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.380
going to go in that direction.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.980
So ignore the old c2 arrows.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.030
We're now starting from
there and coming back here.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.100
So this is minus c2.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.220
Or we could write, we could
put, the minus on the other

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.250
side and we could say that
the negative of the c2 line

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.770
integral along the path of c2
of f dot dr is equal to the

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.510
line integral over the reverse
path of f dot dr. All I did is

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.630
I switched the negative on
the other side; multiplied

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.370
both sides by negative 1.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.900
So let's replace-- in this
equation we have the minus of

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.480
the c2 path; we have that right
there, and we have that right

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.880
there --so we could just
replace this with

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.800
this right there.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.670
So let me do that.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.670
So I'll write this
first part first.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.410
So the integral along the curve
c1 of f dot dr, instead of

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.200
minus the line integral along
c2, I'm going to say plus the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200
integral along minus c2.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.940
This-- let me switch to the
green --this we've established

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.480
is the same thing as this.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.720
The negative of this curve, or
the line integral along this

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.950
path, is the same thing as the
line integral, the positive of

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.350
the line integral along
the reverse path.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.610
So we'll say plus the line
integral of minus c2 of

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.270
f dot dr is equal to 0.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.670
Now there's something
interesting.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.550
Let's look at what the
combination of the path

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.560
of c1 and minus c2 is.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.370
c1 starts over here.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.280
Let me get a nice,
vibrant color.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.580
c1 starts over here
at this point.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.540
It moves from this point
along this curve c1 and

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.020
ends up at this point.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.840
And then we do the minus c2.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.590
Minus c2 starts at this point
and just goes and comes back

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.810
to the original point;
it completes a loop.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.270
So this is a closed
line integral.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.440
So if you combine this,
we could rewrite this.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.660
Remember, this is just a loop.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.365
By reversing this, instead of
having two guys starting here

00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:58.450
and going there, I now can
start here, go all the way

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.660
there, and then come all
the way back on this

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.630
reverse path of c2.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.880
So this is equivalent to
a closed line integral.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.150
So that is the same thing as an
integral along a closed path.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.730
I mean, we could call the
closed path, maybe, c1 plus

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.200
minus c2, if we wanted to be
particular about

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.900
the closed path.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.390
But this could be, I drew c1
and c2 or minus c2 arbitrarily;

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.600
this could be any closed path
where our vector field f has a

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.000
potential, or where it is the
gradient of a scalar field,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.960
or where it is conservative.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.620
And so this can be written as
a closed path of c1 plus the

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:45.930
reverse of c2 of f dot dr.
That's just a rewriting

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.040
of that, and so that's
going to be equal to 0.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.050
And this is our take
away for this video.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.110
This is, you can view
it as a corollary.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.160
It's kind of a low-hanging
conclusion that you can make

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.610
after this conclusion.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.900
So now we know that if we have
a vector field that's the

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.570
gradient of a scalar field in
some region, or maybe over the

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.440
entire xy plane-- and this is
called the potential of f;

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.320
this is a potential function.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.370
Oftentimes it will be the
negative of it, but it's easy

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.670
to mess with negatives --but if
we have a vector field that is

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.650
the gradient of a scalar field,
we call that vector

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.100
field conservative.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.880
That tells us that at any point
in the region where this is

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.860
valid, the line integral from
one point to another is

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.150
independent of the path; that's
what we got from

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.130
the last video.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.890
And because of that, a closed
loop line integral, or a closed

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.570
line integral, so if we take
some other place, if we take

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:52.915
any other closed line integral
or we take the line integral of

00:07:52.915 --> 00:07:57.490
the vector field on any closed
loop, it will become 0 because

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.740
it is path independent.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.240
So that's the neat take away
here, that if you know that

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.370
this is conservative, if you
ever see something like this:

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.580
if you see this f dot dr and
someone asks you to evaluate

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.840
this given that f is
conservative, or given that f

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.710
is the gradient of another
function, or given that f is

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.960
path independent, you can now
immediately say, that is going

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.170
to be equal to 0, which
simplifies the math a good bit.
