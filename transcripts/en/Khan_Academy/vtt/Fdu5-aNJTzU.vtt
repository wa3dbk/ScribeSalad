00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.680
It is not unusual in calculus
textbooks to see something-- to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.780
see problems along the lines
of, prove that the limit as x

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.380
approaches-- I don't know,
say, as x approaches 1.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.240
Let me think of an interesting
function when x approaches 1.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.380
Let's see.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.770
3x times x minus 1
over x minus 1.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.980
And you might say, hey Sal, why
did you do this x minus 1 in

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.820
the numerator and denominator?

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.970
Well, I did that because
obviously you can't

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.020
have a 0 down here.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.270
So this function is actually
not defined as x is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.030
equal to 1, right?

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.930
If I had just put a 3x,
this cancels out for

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.120
all the other values.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.250
So this is essentially the
line 3x, except it has a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.970
hole at x is equal to 1.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.580
And that's why I did it.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.230
Because I want to take the
limit, and it's interesting to

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.070
take a limit a to a point where
the function doesn't exist.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.200
But the books will say, hey,
prove that this limit is equal

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.650
to-- well, it would actually
be equal to 3, right?

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.440
Prove that.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.290
And you essentially have
to use the epsilon delta

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.910
definition of a limit.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.390
So to prove this, you're
essentially proving

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.540
what this means.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.720
And this means-- proving
this is the same thing as

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.690
proving-- so you could
just prove that given--.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.190
So if you give me some epsilon
greater than 0-- and remember,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.980
that's how close you want f
of x to get to the limit.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.880
Given some epsilon greater than
0, in order for this to be

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.970
true, I need to prove that I
can give you-- that there

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.650
exists-- that, you know, I can
give you a delta

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.400
greater than 0.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:49.006
Where as long as the distance
between x and our limit point,

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:54.090
x and 1, is less than delta--
remember, we don't want x to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.320
ever get right on top
of the limit point.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.480
Because a function might
not be defined there.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.020
So the distance between
x and 1 has to be

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.970
greater than 0, right?

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.390
That's what this tells us.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.110
So I have to prove, you
give me an epsilon, that

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.850
I can give you a delta.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.460
And as long as x is within
delta of 1-- and this is all

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.980
this is saying-- as long as
the distance between

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.780
x and 1, right?

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.320
That's when you subtract
2 things and take

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.910
the absolute value.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.070
That's just distance.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.050
So as long as the distance
between x and 1 is less than

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.770
delta then the distance between
3x-- let me write that up

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:37.650
there-- the distance between 3x
times x minus 1 over x minus 1,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.470
that's the function, right?

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.550
The distance between that and
the limit point-- and 3--

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.260
is going to be less
than the epsilon.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.390
A lot of calculus text
books, you know, they'll

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.070
write it generally.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.620
They're like, the limit of f of
x as x approaches a of equals

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.030
l, and so this would be a.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.410
This would be your f of
x, and this would be

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.090
your l, right there.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.420
But anyway, when someone says
they want you to prove this,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.020
they essentially want
you to prove this.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.410
I'll give you an epsilon.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.090
You have to prove that any
epsilon that you're given, or

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.860
that you give me, that I--
let's say I'm the one who has

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.360
to prove it-- any epsilon you
give me, I have to be able to

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.380
give you a delta where, as long
as x is within delta of 1,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.000
then the function is within
epsilon of the limit point.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.550
And how do we do that?

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.140
And I'll just say, you know, a
lot of proofs, it's just kind

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.600
of-- there's not a-- well,
there's not a systematic

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.250
way to do proofs.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.520
And that's kind of what
makes them so interesting

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.730
on a lot of levels.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.060
But these, there kind of tends
to be a systematic way.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.355
And this problem I've given
you, to some degree, is kind of

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:48.310
the easy one that they'll give
when they ask you

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.170
to prove these.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.450
But they usually involve
starting from this point right

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.580
here and algebraically
manipulating it until you get--

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.680
until this expression
right here looks something

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.210
like this expression.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.640
And then you'll have
this expression is less

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.560
than, you know, epsilon
divided by something.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.450
Or, you know, some
function of epsilon.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.450
And it's like, oh, well as long
as delta is that, you give me

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.270
an epsilon, I can just apply
that, you know, take epsilon

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.660
and divide it by
4, or whatever.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.150
And use that as my delta.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.710
Then I've proved the theorem.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.680
And so we'll do that here.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.510
So let's start with this.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.810
Let's start with kind of
where we want to get to.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.380
And then figure out a delta
that's essentially a

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.290
function of epsilon.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.440
So that whenever I'm given an
epsilon, I can say, hey,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.380
whatever number you give me,
I'm going to give you back

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.500
a number that's, you know,
that divided by whatever.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.060
And then this will all work.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.840
So let's do that.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.740
So immediately we
can simplify this.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.750
We can cross these out.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.720
And when you cross that out,
you still have to say, well, we

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.430
can't do that as long as x--
you can only do this as long as

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.200
you assume that x
does not equal 1.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.340
Because if x equals 1, this
function is undefined, right?

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.860
And that's OK because we only
care about the intervals

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.610
as x approaches 1.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.270
We only care about the
intervals as x approaches 1.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.860
We don't care exactly
when x is equal to 1.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.660
So that's fine.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.480
So then this simplifies to--
this right there simplifies

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:18.550
to-- the absolute value of 3x
minus 3 is less than epsilon.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.360
And then we could factor out a
3, so that's, you know, we

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.820
could say the absolute value of
3 times x minus 1 is

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.950
less than epsilon.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.280
And you might already see, we
already have an x minus 1

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.200
there and an x minus 1 there.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.000
If we can get this 3 over
on this side, then we'll

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.030
be done, essentially.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.940
So the absolute value of 3
times some other number, it's

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.200
going to be the same thing as
the absolute value of 3 times

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.240
the absolute value
of x minus 1.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.000
And if you don't believe me,
I mean, try it out with

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.980
a bunch of numbers.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.600
This is going to be
positive no matter what.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.040
This is going to be
positive no matter what.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.850
It's going to have the
same magnitude, right?

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.210
And of course, that is
less than epsilon.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.600
And this is what we say-- you
know, a lot of times a calculus

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.950
teacher will say, if this is
true, this is true, if and

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.370
only if this is true.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.830
And that's just a
fancy way of saying.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.940
So sometimes they'll
do a two way arrow.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.550
Sometimes they'll write IF
and only IF, kind of an IFF.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.260
An IF with 2 f's.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.940
But that just means if
that's true, that's true.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.570
And if this is true,
then that's true.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.380
And that's generally the case,
whenever you just do some

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.510
algebraic manipulation.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.450
You can manipulate this back to
get that, or that to get that.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.770
And then they'll say, well, if
this is true, this is true

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.370
if and only if this is true.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.020
But this is just
algebraic manipulation.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.220
Right?

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.490
Because you can go back and
forth between these steps.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.720
And that's true, if and
only if that is true.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.980
And then the absolute value
of 3 is just 3, right?

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.980
We know that.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.180
Let's divide both sides by 3
and you get-- well, I can

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.920
just get rid of the absolute
value signs right there.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.725
Because we know that's 3.

00:06:44.725 --> 00:06:46.760
If you divide both sides of the
equation by 3, you get the

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.680
absolute value of x minus 1
is less than epsilon over 3.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.120
So what have we
just done so far?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.455
We've just proved that the
absolute value-- I need to

00:06:59.455 --> 00:07:00.710
write this in another color.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.930
We've just proved that the
absolute value of essentially

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:14.270
3x times x minus 1 over x minus
1 minus 3 is less than epsilon,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:22.620
if and only if x minus 1 is
less than epsilon over 3.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.390
Right?

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:29.570
So it's like, this is true, as
long as the distance between x

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.890
and 1 is less than
epsilon over 3.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.080
So we can just use epsilon
over 3 as our delta.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.100
Remember the whole point of
this was like, you give me

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.645
an epsilon, you give me a
distance, or you say, I want

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:46.110
to be within this distance
of my limit point.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.480
I want the function to be that
close to the limit point.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.100
And this is just the distance
between the function and

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.240
the limit point, right?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.150
This is f of x.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.150
And this is the limit
that it approaches.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.360
So you want to be that close.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.680
And I say, well, you're going
to be that close if and only if

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.600
x-- the distance between x and
1, or the distance between x

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.320
and the value it's
approaching-- is

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.750
less than this.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.630
So we just prove
this algebraically.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.890
So whatever number you give
me-- if you give me a-- if

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.490
you say, Sal, I want to be
within 1 of the limit point.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.110
I want f of x to be no further
than 1 from the limit point,

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.850
then I'll say, OK, and
I'll give you 1/3, right?

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.780
Because this is true.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.580
Let me write that out.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.460
So let's say you pick
1 as an epsilon.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:37.597
So you say, hey, you need to
prove to me that there's some x

00:08:37.597 --> 00:08:43.080
value where, as long as the x
value is no more-- there's

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.130
some value of delta.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.080
So as long as we're no more
than delta away from 1, then

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.210
the function itself will
be no more than 1 away

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.570
from the limit value.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.590
Right?

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.660
And then I say, well,
you, gave me an epsilon

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.310
that's equal to 1.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.140
So I could just make-- I can
just say this is, you know, we

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.860
just proved, if and only if
absolute value of x minus 1 is

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.120
less than whatever number
you gave me divided by 3.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.790
And that actually makes
a lot of sense if you

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.900
graph this equation.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.990
Let me see.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.100
Let me draw the x-axis, y-axis.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.710
We already established.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.470
This thing looks just like the
equation of 3x except it has

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.490
a hole at x is equal to 1.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.840
Let me draw the graph.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.530
It'll have slope.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.700
It'll have the slope of 3.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.790
So it'll be pretty steep.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.410
It'll look something like that.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.940
And when we're at 1--
this point right

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.200
here-- there's a hole.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.420
Right?

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.620
This is 3.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.880
So all we're saying, we just
proved that-- so if you said

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.930
that you wanted to be within 1
of our limit point, that's like

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.970
you giving me an epsilon of 1.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.710
So this distance
right here is 1.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.780
Which would be a
pretty big number.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.970
So you want the function
to be within 1 of our

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.980
limit point, right?

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.240
Because this is
the limit point.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.510
Then all we're saying is, you
just have to take 1/3 of that.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.520
So we just have to be within
1/3-- so this distance right

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:22.570
here is 1/3 away from 1.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.030
Or we could have said it more
generally, this is epsilon.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.180
This is epsilon.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.220
This would be epsilon over 3.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.810
This is epsilon over 3.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.090
And the reason why this is a
proof, is because it shows no

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.670
matter what epsilon you give
me, I can always find a delta.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.410
Because I can just take
whatever number you gave

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.410
me, and divide it by 3.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.160
And I can divide any real
number greater than 0.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.690
I can divide any
real number by 3.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.970
So I can always-- no matter
what you give me-- I can always

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.840
find you something else.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.640
And therefore, I have proven by
the epsilon delta definition of

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.350
limits that the limit
as x approaches 1, of

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.890
this, is equal to 3.
