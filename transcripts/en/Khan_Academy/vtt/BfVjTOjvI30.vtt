00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.310
In the last video we saw a
method of figuring out what

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.590
the basis for column space is.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.260
And we use these
exact examples.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.960
Whereas this was matrix A, I
just took it and I put it in

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.610
reduced row echelon form.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.920
And I figured out which of these
columns in my reduced

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.330
row echelon form of A,
are pivot columns.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.490
And it turned out to be the
first one, the second one, and

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.430
the fourth one.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.510
And then the method is, you say
look, the corresponding

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.940
columns in A-- so the first one,
the second one, and the

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.550
fourth one-- form my basis
for my column space.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.430
And since they form the basis,
and if you want to know the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.000
dimension of your basis of your
column space, which is

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.020
also called the rank,
you just say, well

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.230
there's three in there.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.890
So it has a rank of
one, two, three.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.350
In this video I want to discuss
a little bit about why

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.890
this worked.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.370
Why were we able to just take
the corresponding columns?

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.360
Why did linear independence of
these three guys, imply linear

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.060
independence of these
three guys?

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.420
Why was the fact that I can
represent these guys-- this

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.040
guy right here as a linear
combination of these three, or

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.930
this guy as a linear combination
of these three--

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.430
why does that imply that I can
construct this guy as a linear

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.790
combination of my
basis vectors?

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.270
So the first thing that wasn't
too much of a stretch of the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.380
imagination in the last video,
was the idea that these pivot

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.650
vectors are linearly
independent.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.980
So r1, r2, and r4.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.960
And everything I'm doing, I'm
kind of applying to the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.420
special case just so that it's
easier to understand.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.630
But it should be
generalizable.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.950
In fact, it definitely
is generalizable.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.330
That all of the pivot columns
in reduced row echelon form

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.500
are linearly independent.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.700
And that's because the very
nature of reduced row echelon

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.040
form, is that you are the only
pivot column that has a 1 in

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.580
that respective row.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.420
So the only way to construct
it is with that vector.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.140
You can't construct it with
the other pivot columns

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.420
because they're all going
to have 0 in that row.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.560
And when I say it's linearly
independent, I'm just saying

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.000
the set of pivot columns.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.770
So let me say this in general.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:12.940
The set of pivot columns for any
reduced row echelon form

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.150
matrix is linearly
independent.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.000
And it's just a very
straightforward argument.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.380
Because each column is
going to have a 1 in

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.170
a very unique place.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.630
All of the other pivot columns
are going to have a 0 in that

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.110
same place.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.290
And so you can't take any linear
combinations to get to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.410
that 1 because 0 times anything,
minus or plus 0

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.540
times anything, can never
be equal to 1.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.560
So I think you can
accept that.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:48.250
Now, that means that the
solution to c1 times r1, plus

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.610
c2 times r2, plus, let
me say, c4 times r4.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.500
The solution to this equation,
because these guys are

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.680
linearly independent, we know
that this only has one

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.200
solution, and that's c1, c2,
and c4 is equal to 0.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.840
That's the only solution
to that.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.690
So another way we could say it
is, if we write r times some

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.200
vector x-- well I'll just write
it times this particular

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.680
x-- where I write it as
c1, c2, 0, c4, and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.460
0 is equal to 0.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.800
So this will be some special
member of your null space.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.210
It's a particular solution
to the equation.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.830
This is equal to one, two,
three, four 0's because we

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.430
have four rows here.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.270
Now, if we just expand
this out.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.410
If we just multiply 1 times c1,
plus 0 times c2, minus 1

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.870
times 0, plus 4 times 0, you'll
get-- or actually a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.770
better way to explain it-- this
multiplication right here

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.120
can be written as-- and we've
seen this multiple times-- c1

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:13.460
times r1, plus c2 times
r2, plus 0 times r3.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.589
So we could just ignore that
term, plus c4, c4 times r4,

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.450
plus 0 times r5.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.850
That's r5 right there.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.740
All of that equal to 0.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.360
So the only solution to this,
because we know that these

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.200
three columns are linearly
independent-- or the set of

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.690
just those three columns, those
three pivot columns are

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.050
linearly independent-- the only
solution here is all of

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.720
these equal to 0.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.120
That's exactly what I
said right up here.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.870
So the only solution here, where
if these two are 0, is

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.110
that these guys also all have
to equal 0, if I already

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.670
constrain these two.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.460
Now, the one thing that we've
done over and over again, we

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.790
know that the solution set of
this equation, the solution

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.310
set of Rx is equal to 0, is the
same as the solution set

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.870
of Ax is equal to 0.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.740
Now, how do we know that?

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.820
Or what do I mean?

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.640
Well the solution set of this
is just the null space.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.850
The solution set is just
the null space of r.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.590
It's all of x's that satisfy
this equation.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.160
And we know that is equal to the
null space of a, because r

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.550
is just a in reduced
row echelon form.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.240
So this is the null space of
a, is all of the x's that

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.040
satisfy this equation.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.550
Now, the only version of this
that satisfied this equation

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.440
was when c1, c2, and
c4 are equal to 0.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:48.380
So that tells us that the only
version of this, c1, c2, 0,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:55.180
c4, 0, that satisfies this
equation, or this equation, is

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.240
when c1, c2, and c4
is equal to 0.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.390
Or another way of saying that
it if this is vector a1, a2,

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.780
a4 right here, if you multiply
this out, you get c1-- let me

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:16.760
do it over here, let me do it in
blue-- you get c1 times a1

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:28.040
plus c2 times a2, and then 0
times a3, plus c4 times a4 is

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.200
equal to 0.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.820
Now these guys are going to be
linearly independent, if and

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.640
only if the only solution to
this equation is they all

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.930
equal to 0.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.150
Well we know that the only
solution to this is that they

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.670
all equal 0 because anything
that's a solution to this is a

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.850
solution to this.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.220
And the only solution to this
was, if I go ahead and I

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.030
constrain these two terms to
being equal to 0, the only

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.320
solution to this is all of
these c's have to be 0.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.580
So likewise, if I constrain
these to be 0, the only

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.120
solution to this is that c1,
c2, and c4 have to be 0.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.500
So those guys have to be 0,
which imply that these three

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:16.580
vectors, a1, a2, and a4, so that
implies that the set a1,

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.950
a2, and a4 are linearly
independent.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.920
So we're halfway there.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.970
We've shown that because the
pivot columns here are

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.240
linearly independent.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.900
We can show and they have
the same solution set.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.410
The null space of the reduced
row echelon form is the same

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.510
as the null space of our
original matrix.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.920
We were able to show that the
only solution to c1 times this

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.240
plus c2 times this plus c4 times
this is when all the

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.970
constants are 0, which shows
that these three vectors or a

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.740
set of those three vectors
are definitely linearly

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.900
independent.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.520
Now, the next thing to prove
that they are a basis, is to

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.990
show that all of the other
column vectors can be

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.420
represented as multiples
of these three guys.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.440
And I realize, just for the sake
of clarity, or maybe not

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.340
boring you too much, I'll do
that in the next video.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.100
So in this one we saw that if
the pivot columns are linearly

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.330
independent, they always are.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.560
All pivot columns, by definition
are linearly

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:16.830
independent.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.500
Or the set of pivot columns
are always linearly

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.520
independent when you take away
the non-pivot columns, then

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.000
the corresponding columns in
your original vector are also

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.910
linearly independent.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.310
In the next one we'll show that
these three guys also

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.910
span your column space.
