00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.180
We want to test the hypothesis
that more than 30% of U.S.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.300
households have internet access
with a significance

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.720
level of 5%.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.270
We collect a sample of 150
households, and find that 57

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.640
have access.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.940
So to do our hypothesis test,
let's just establish our null

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.550
hypothesis and our alternative
hypothesis.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.780
So our null hypothesis is that
the hypothesis is not correct.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.430
Our null hypothesis is that
the proportion of U.S.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.140
households that have internet
access is less

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.910
than or equal to 30%.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.890
And our alternative hypothesis,
is what our

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.030
hypothesis actually is, is
that the proportion is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.110
greater than 30%.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.910
We see it over here.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.980
We want to test the hypothesis
that more than 30% of U.S.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.580
households have internet
access.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.860
That's that right here.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.910
This is what we're testing.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.530
We're testing the alternative
hypothesis.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.870
And the way we're going to do it
is we're going to assume a

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.950
P-value based on the
null hypothesis.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.129
We're going to assume a
proportion based on the null

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.850
hypothesis for the population.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.310
And the given that assumption,
what is the probability that

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:19.410
57 out of 150 of our samples
actually have internet access.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.810
And if that probability is less
than 5%, if it's less

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.610
than our significance level,
then we're going to reject the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.790
null hypothesis in favor
of the alternative one.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.550
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.580
So we're going to start off
assuming-- we're going to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.930
assume the null hypothesis
is true.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.780
And in that assumption we're
going to have to pick a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.150
population proportion or a
population mean-- we know that

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.095
for Bernoulli distributions
do the same thing.

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:53.250
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to pick a proportion

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.460
so high so that it maximizes
the probability of getting

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.070
this over here.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.710
And we actually don't even
know what that number is.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.940
And actually so that we can
think about a little more

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.180
intelligent, let's just find
out what our sample

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.630
proportion even is.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.060
We had 57 people out of 150
having internet access.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.150
So 57 households out of 150.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.430
So our sample proportion
is 0.38, so let me

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.070
write that over here.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.870
Our sample proportion
is equal to 0.38.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.290
So when we assume our null
hypothesis to be true, we're

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:39.210
going to assume a population
proportion that maximizes the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.970
probability that we get
this over here.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.530
So the highest population
proportion that's within our

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.440
null hypothesis that will
maximize the probability of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.560
getting this is actually
if we are right at 30%.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.910
So if we say our population
proportion, we're going to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.940
assume this is true.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.630
This is our null hypothesis.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.160
We're going to assume that
it is 0.3 or 30%.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.430
And I want you understand that--
29% would have been a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.170
null hypothesis.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.570
28% that would have been
a null hypothesis.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.550
But for 29% or 28%, the
probability of getting this

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.870
would have been even lower.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.870
So it wouldn't have been
as strong of a test.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.060
If we take the maximum
proportion that still

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.070
satisfies our null hypothesis,
we're maximizing the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.610
probability that we get this.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.150
So if that number is still low,
if it's still less than

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.380
5%, we can feel pretty good
about the alternative

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.440
hypothesis.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.210
So just to refresh ourselves
we're going to assume a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.700
population proportion of 0.3,
and if we just think about the

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.660
distribution-- sometimes it's
helpful to draw these things,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.890
so I will draw it.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.900
So this is what the population
distribution looks like based

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.350
on our assumption,
based on this

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.360
assumption right over here.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.930
Our population distribution
has-- or maybe I should write

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.560
30% have internet access.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.740
And I'll signify
that with a 1.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.585
And then the rest don't
have internet access.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.560
70% do not have internet
access.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.070
This is just a Bernoulli
distribution.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.500
We know that the mean over here
is going to be the same

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.390
thing as the proportion that
has internet access.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:22.160
So the mean over here is going
to be 0.3, same thing as 30%.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.370
This is the population mean.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.510
And maybe I should
write this way.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.850
The mean assuming our null
hypothesis, the population

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.510
mean assuming our null
hypothesis is 0.3.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.810
And then the population
standard deviation.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.510
Let me write this over
here in yellow.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.190
The population standard
deviation assuming our null

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.880
hypothesis.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.160
And we've seen this when we
first learned about Bernoulli

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.210
distributions.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:58.620
It is going to be the square
root of the percentage of the

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.310
population that has internet
access, so 0.3 times the

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.470
proportion of the population
that does not have internet

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.520
access, times 0.7
right over here.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.430
So this is the square
root of 0.21.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.290
And we could deal with this
later using our calculator.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.630
Now, with that out of the way,
we want to figure out the

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.600
probability of getting a sample

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.100
proportion that has a 0.38.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.850
So let's look at the
distribution of sample

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.550
proportions.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.160
So you could literally look at
every combination of getting

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.570
150 households from this, and
you would actually get a

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.350
binomial distribution.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.780
And we've also seen
this before.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.300
You would actually get a
binomial distribution where

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.010
you'd get a bunch of
bars like that.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.530
But if your n is suitably large,
and in particular-- and

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:02.670
this is kind of the test for
it-- the test if n times p--

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.190
and in this case we're saying
p is 30%-- if n times p is

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.940
greater than 5, and n times 1
minus p is greater than 5, you

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.570
can assume that the distribution
of the sample

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.410
proportion or the sample
proportion distribution is

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.220
going to be normal.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.770
So if you looked at all of the
different ways you could

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.820
sample 150 households from this
population, you get all

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.790
of these bars.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.250
But since our n is pretty big,
it's 150, and 150 times 0.3 is

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.550
obviously greater than 5.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.210
150 times 0.7 is also
greater than 5.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.375
You can approximate that with
a normal distribution.

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:38.070
So let me do that.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.090
So you can approximate it with
a normal distribution.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.540
So this is a normal distribution
right over there.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.120
Now the mean of the distribution
of the proportion

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.190
data that we're assuming is a
normal distribution is going

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.270
to be-- and remember, working
under the context that the

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.500
null hypothesis is true.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.210
So this mean is going to be--
this mean right here-- so the

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:11.550
mean of our sample proportions
is going to be the same thing

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.150
as our population mean.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.180
So this is going to be 0.3,
same value as that.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.860
And the standard deviation---
this comes straight from the

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.320
central limit theorem.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.870
So the standard deviation of
our sample proportions, the

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:34.200
standard deviation is going to
be the square root-- let me

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.230
put it this way-- it's going to
be our population standard

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.180
deviation, the standard
deviation we're assuming with

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.610
our null hypothesis divided by
the square root of the number

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.630
of samples we have. And in this
case we have 150 samples.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.320
It's going to be 150 samples
and we can calculate this.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.370
This value on top we just
figured out is the

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.610
square root of 0.21.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.770
So this is the square root
of 0.21 over the

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:05.270
square root of 150.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.150
And I can get the calculator
out to calculate this.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.825
So I'll just do it the
way I wrote it.

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:19.890
The square root of 0.21-- and
I'm going to divide that, so

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.630
whatever answer is I'm going to
divide that by the square

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.320
root of 150.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.320
So it's 0.037.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.630
So we figured out the standard
deviation here of our-- or the

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:38.100
distribution of our sample
proportions is going to be--

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.120
let me write this down, I'll
scroll over to the right a

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.580
little bit-- it is 0.037.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.150
I think I'm falling off the
screen a little bit.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.770
So we'll just say 0.037.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.360
Now to figure out the
probability of having a sample

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.270
proportion of 0.38, we just have
to figure out how many

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.420
standard deviations that is
away from our mean, or

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.140
essentially calculate a
Z-statistic for our sample,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.650
because a Z-statistic or a
Z-score is really just how

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.100
many standard deviations you
are away from the mean.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.600
And then figure out whether
the probability of getting

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.310
that Z-statistic is more
or less than 5%.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.350
So let's figure out how many
standard deviations we are

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.360
away from the mean.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.640
So just remind ourselves, this
sample proportion we got we

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.880
can view as just a sample from
this distribution of all of

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.220
the possible sample
proportions.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.670
So how many standard
deviations away

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.110
from the mean is this?

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.540
So if we take our sample
proportion, subtract from that

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.820
the mean of the distribution
of sample proportions and

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.480
divide it by the standard
deviation of the distribution

00:09:49.480 --> 00:10:00.360
of the sample proportions, we
get 0.38, 0.38 minus 0.3.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.290
All of that over this
value which we just

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.190
figured out was 0.037.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.180
So what does that give us?

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:13.460
The numerator over
here is a 0.08.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.120
The denominator is 0.037.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.240
So let's figure this out.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.910
So our numerator is 0.08 divided
by this last number

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.520
right here, which
is the 0.037.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.660
So second answer and we get
2.1-- I'll just round it to

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.650
2.14 standard deviations.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:43.460
So this is equal to-- this right
here is equal to 2.14

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.250
standard deviations.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.430
Or we could say that our
Z-statistic, right, we could

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.350
call this our Z-score or our
Z-statistic, the number of

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:56.540
standard deviations we are away
from our mean is 2.14.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.020
We're at 2.14, and to be exact,
we're 2.14 standard

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.800
deviations above the mean.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.620
We're going to care about a
one-tailed distribution.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.970
Now is the probability
of getting this more

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.530
or less than 5%?

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.490
If it's less than 5% we're
going to reject the null

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.160
hypothesis in favor of
our alternative.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.740
So how do we think about that?

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.580
Well let's think about just
a normalized normal

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.450
distribution.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.330
Or maybe you could call the
Z-distribution if you want.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.950
If you look at a normal
distribution, a completely

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.320
normalized normal distribution,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.570
it's mean is at 0.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.730
And essentially each
of these values

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.440
are essentially Z-scores.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.130
Because a value of 1 literally
means you are 1 standard

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.140
deviation away from this
mean over here.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:49.120
So we need to find a critical
Z-value right over here.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:55.770
Let me call that a critical Z--
we could even say critical

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.930
Z-score or critical Z-value--
so that the probability of

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.450
getting a Z-value higher
than that is 5%.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.540
So that this whole area
right here is 5%.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.480
And that's because that's what
our significance level is.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.450
Anything that has a lower than
5% a chance of occurring, for

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.150
us will be validation to reject
our null hypothesis.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.830
Or another way of thinking about
it is that area's 5%,

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.870
this whole area right
over here is 95%.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.690
And once again, this is a
one-tailed test, because we

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.990
only care about values
greater than this.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.890
Z-values greater than that will
make us reject the null

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:35.870
hypothesis.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.700
And to figure out this critical
Z-value you can

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.590
literally just go
to a Z-table.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:44.210
And we say OK, the probability
of being a Z-value less than

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.650
that is 95%.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.440
And that's exactly the number
that this gives us.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.090
The cumulative probability
of getting a

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.800
value less than that.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.800
So if we just scan this,
we're looking for 95%.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.610
We have 0.9495, we
have 0.9505.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.330
So I'll go with this just
to make sure we're

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.490
a little bit closer.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.060
So this Z-value, and the z-value
here is 1.6, and the

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.550
next digit is 5.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.260
1.6 5.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.380
So this critical Z-value
is equal to 1.65.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:23.910
So the probability of getting
a Z-value less than 1.65, or

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.730
even in a completely
normalized normal

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.720
distribution, the probability
of getting a

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.310
value less than 1.65.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.570
Or in any normal distribution,
the probability of being less

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.790
than 1.65 standard deviations
away from the mean

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.620
is going to be 95%.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.800
So that's our critical
Z-value.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.200
Now does Z-value, or the
Z-statistic, for our actual

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.140
sample is 2.14.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.940
Our actual Z-value
we got is 2.14.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.140
It's sitting all the way
out here some place.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.710
So the probability of
getting that was

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.135
definitely less than 5%.

00:13:59.135 --> 00:14:01.050
And actually we could even say
what's the probability of

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.360
getting that or a more
extreme result.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.720
And if you figured out this
area, and you could actually

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.760
figure it out by looking at a
Z-table, you could figure out

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.980
the P-value of this result.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.160
But anyway, the whole exercise
here is just to figure out if

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.810
can reject the null hypothesis
with a significance level 5%.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:18.890
We can.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.250
This is a more extreme result
than our critical Z-value, so

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:28.240
we can reject the null
hypothesis in favor of our

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.490
alternative.
