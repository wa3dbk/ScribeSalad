00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.270
In the last video we saw, a
little bit more formally than

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.990
you might have been exposed to
the past, that a function is

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.250
just a mapping of the members
of one set to another set.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.050
So if this is my first set, x.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.580
We call that the domain.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.850
And the set that we're mapping
to, y, in this case, that's

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.260
called the codomain.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.290
And the function just maps each
of the specific entries

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.230
of x to an entry in y.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.030
When I say map, it really just
creates an association.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.580
If we think of these in even
less abstract terms -- which,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.395
on some levels is more abstract
-- you could view x

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:40.150
as a basket of bananas and
y as a basket of apples.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.330
And for every banana, you're
associating it

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.030
with one of the apples.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.130
The mapping of going from each
of those bananas to each of

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.490
those apples would
be a function.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.520
I don't know if that helps you
or not, but I just want to

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.810
broaden your preconceived notion
of what a function is.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.280
I mean everything that you've
probably seen before probably

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.720
took a form that looks
something like that.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.810
Where you said, oh, a function
is, you just give me some

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.600
number and I'll give
you another number.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.580
Or I'll do something
to that number.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.230
While it can be much more
general than that.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.980
It's an association between any
member of one set and some

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.890
other members of another set.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.190
Now, we know that vectors
are members of sets.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.210
Right?

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.970
In particular, if we say that
some vector x is a member of

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.440
some set -- let me just say it's
a member of rn, because

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.390
that's what we deal with -- all
that means is that this is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.220
just a particular representation
of an n-tuple.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.680
Remember what rn was.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.150
rn we defined way back at the
beginning of the linear

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.482
algebra playlist. We defined it
as the set of all n-tuples

00:01:50.482 --> 00:02:03.370
-- x1, x2, xn, where your x1's,
x2's, all the way to

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.600
xn's are a member of
the real numbers.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.880
So your rn is most
definitely a set.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.120
This could be rn.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.550
And obviously the use of the
letter n is arbitrary.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.510
It could be rm, it
could be rs.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.200
n is just kind of a placeholder
for how many

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.990
tuples we have. It
could be r5.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.790
It could be 5 tuples.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.990
And when we say that a vector
x is a member of rn, we're

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.370
just saying that it's another
way of writing

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.680
one of these n-tuples.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.440
And all of our vectors so far
are column vectors -- that's

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.830
the only type that we've defined
so far -- and we say

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.820
it's this ordered list where
each of the members are a

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.505
member of r's.

00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:41.770
It's an ordered list of n --
it's an ordered list of

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.540
n-components -- x1, x2, all the
way to xn -- where each of

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.440
those guys, or each of those
x1's, x2's all the way to

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.130
xn's, are a member of
the real numbers.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.890
That's, by definition, what we
mean when we say that x is a

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.480
member of rn.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.840
So if x is a member of rn -- so
let me draw two sets right

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.590
here -- let's say that this set
right here is rn and then

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.890
let me just change, just to be
general, let me create another

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.120
set right there and call that
set right there rm.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.250
Just a different number.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.200
It it could be the same as
n, it could be different.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.900
This is m-tuples,
that's n-tuples.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.540
We've defined that vectors
can be members of rn.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.930
So you could have some vector
here and then, if you

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.430
associate with that vector in rn
-- if you associate it with

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.790
some vector in are rm -- if you
associate it with, let's

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.550
call that vector y, if you make
this association, that

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.120
too is a function.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.480
And that might have already been
obvious to you and this

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:04.885
would be a function that's
mapping from rn to rm.

00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:06.430
And actually, I just want
to make one little

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.080
special note here.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.080
When I just drew the arrow like
this, this shows that I'm

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.280
mapping between two sets.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.300
I'm taking elements of this set
and I'm associating with

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.060
them with elements
of that set.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.690
Now, in the last video you
probably saw this.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.550
I wanted to do the side note
note because I realized it

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.910
might've been confusing.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.330
I introduced you to another
way of writing a

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.615
function like this.

00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:28.330
Where I said f could be defined
as a mapping for any

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.480
given x to x squared.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.960
And I just want to make a
note on the notation.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.860
When I just have a regular arrow
I'm going between sets.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.100
When I have this little vertical
line at the base of

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.860
the arrow, that's kind of
the function definition.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.060
It tells me for any x you give
me in the first set, in the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.560
second set I'm going to
associate this x with, in this

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.530
case, x squared.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.210
Anyway, I just wanted to
make that side note.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.580
But the whole direction I was
going in is that vectors are

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.220
valid elements of sets,
functions are just mappings

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.300
between elements of sets,
so you could have

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.540
functions of vectors.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.000
And I even touched on that a
little bit in the last video

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.160
when I talked about
vector-valued functions.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:25.080
If your codomain is a subset of
rm, where m is greater than

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.600
1, then we say your function
is vector-valued.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.910
It's not just mapping into
the real numbers.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.080
It's mapping into some m-tuple
of real numbers.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.670
So if you mapped two-dimensional
space, you're

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.325
dealing with a vector-valued
function.

00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:44.140
Now I've been all abstract and
whatnot, so let me actually

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.290
deal with some vectors and it
might make everything a little

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.540
bit more concrete.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:06:00.620
So let's say I define the
function f as f of x1, x2, and

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:13.440
x3, is equal to x1 plus
2x2 and the second

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.740
coordinate is just 3x3.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.480
And actually, I haven't formally
defined coordinates

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.440
for you yet, but I think you
understand that just from your

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.080
basic algebra training.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.060
So let's say that that's my
function definition based on

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.000
the notation that we've
been introduced to.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.660
We could say that f is a mapping
from -- its domain is

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.470
r3 -- and it maps from r3, or it
associates all values in r3

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.960
with some value in r2.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.210
This is a 2-tuple.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.760
Right?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.040
So this is an r2 This
is 3-tuple.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.730
Right?

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.750
Or another way we could do this,
if we just wanted to

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:02.170
write it in vector notation, I
could write that f -- if you

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:10.610
pass f to some vector x1, x2,
x3, I could say this will be

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.550
equal to the vector -- and
now it's going to have a

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.640
two-component vector.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.050
It's going to be a vector in r2
where the first term is x1

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.320
plus 2x2 and the second
term is 3x3.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.810
So let's play around with
this a little bit.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.010
See what it does for us, what
it does to the vectors.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:39.280
So what is f of the
vector 1, 1, 1?

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.890
Well, I get 1 plus 2 times 1
is, I get the vector 3, and

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.860
then my second term is just 3
times this one, so I get the

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.690
vector 3, 3.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.040
Fair enough, let me
do another one.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.850
Just to really experiment
with this mapping.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:09.490
If I take the f of the vector in
r3 2, 4, 1, what do I get?

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.330
That equals 2 plus 2 times 4.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.840
That goes to the vector 10.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.570
2 plus 2 times 4 and
then 3 times the

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.720
third term right there.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.670
So the vector 10, 3.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.630
So how can we visualize this?

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.220
Well, three-dimensional vectors
-- or vectors in r3 --

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.240
are not always the easiest to
visualize, but I think we can

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.784
attempt to visualize
these two guys.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:50.030
So let's say that this is the
x1-axis, that's the x2-axis,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.160
that's the x3-axis.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.650
So this first vector right here,
this yellow one, 1, 1,

00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:00.090
1, it will look like
this -- 1, 1, 1.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.210
And so if I were to go out here,
then go out here, then

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.170
go up 1, the point would be
right there and if I were to

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.790
draw it in standard position,
I'd start at the origin, and

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.940
the vector looks something
like that.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.250
And then the second guy, 2, 4,
1, it would look like this.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.630
It would go 2 out here,
we'd go 4 this

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.790
direction, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.070
And then we'd go 1 up.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.350
So it looks something
like this.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.330
2, 4, 1.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.970
I think you get the idea.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.680
So I've drawn these two vectors
that are essentially

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.970
in my domain.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.380
Our domain is r3.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.370
This is our r3 right here.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.350
And let's see what
our function maps

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.980
these vectors to.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.510
So what's our codomain?

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.110
Our codomain is r2, so this
is much easier to

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.880
visualize for us.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.320
So we just have to draw
two axes like this.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.420
Let's call this x1 and
let's call this x2.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.650
And so what does f of 1, 1, 1 --
of this yellow vector -- it

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.540
becomes 3, 3.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:12.010
So if I do it in yellow,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.360
So it gets me this one.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.370
If I draw it in standard
position the

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.070
vector looks like this.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.110
So, literally, our function
went from mapped from this

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:26.250
vector in r3 to this
vector in r2.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.560
That was what our
function did.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.870
Likewise, if we take the other
vector, we went from this 2,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.860
4, 1 vector to sector 10, 3.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.970
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.410
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.180
And it's going to be 3 up,
so it's going to look

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.480
something like this.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.000
So this vector right here, by
our function, f, got mapped --

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.610
let me do a different color
-- to this vector.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.700
This vector right here in r3 got
mapped to this vector in

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.620
r2 by our function.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.230
Now this is just a switch
of terminology.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.060
When we talk about functions
of vectors the term that we

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.700
tend to use is the word
transformation.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.600
But it really is the exact
same thing as a function.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.340
I don't want to confuse you,
because if you watch the

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.990
differential equations playlist,
you saw the idea of

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.440
a Laplace transformation, which
is really an operation

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.500
that takes a function
as an argument.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.550
But in this case, and when
we're dealing into linear

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.270
algebra world, a transformation
is really just

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.180
a function operating on vectors
-- or the way we're

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.330
going to use it -- it's just a
function operating on vectors.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.640
And so the general notation,
instead of writing a lowercase

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.670
f like that, for a function,
people use an uppercase T to

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.850
say it's a transformation.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.330
Although it doesn't have
to be an uppercase T.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.210
But that's the one that people
use the most. Just like this

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.160
could be a g or an h,
but people always

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.300
use a lowercase f.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.920
So the same way we could have
written this, we could have

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.260
called this a transformation.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.210
And my sense of why, in the
linear algebra world, they use

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:15.150
this, is because you kind of
imagine that this vector is

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.100
being changed into
that vector.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.370
Or that this is vector is being

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.610
transformed into that vector.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.210
I think that's why they call it
a transformation as opposed

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:23.760
to a function.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.340
And it actually makes a lot
more sense when you start

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.870
going into things like video
game programming.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.630
And a lot of what we're
embarking on with our

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.360
transformations is key to
video game programming.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.860
But you're kind of transforming
one image into

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.030
another image if you're viewing
at it from a different

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.030
angle or whatever else
you might want to do.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.850
We'll talk a lot more about
that in the future.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.320
But I just wanted to introduce
you to this notation.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:51.570
So these statements, I could
have replaced all my f's with

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.010
T's and I could have defined
some transformation.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.030
And I just want to make you
comfortable the notation.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.200
I could have defined it
similarly, a transformation

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:11.510
from r3 to r2 and I could have
said that T of x1, x2, x3 is

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:21.460
equal to the 2-tuple x1 plus 2
x1 comma 3x3 And I could have,

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.250
just as similarly put a T up
here because I have defined it

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.150
the same way.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.990
I could have said T of
my vector 1, 1, 1

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.210
is equal to 3, 3.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.960
Now, you might say, hey Sal, why
are you going through all

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.050
this trouble of replacing
T's with f's?

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.800
I'm just doing this so you
don't get confused.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.300
So that when you see in your
linear algebra book, when you

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.300
see linear algebra problems,
when you see this big capital

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.940
T and you're like, wow, I've
never seen that before and

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.180
they're using this fancy word
called a transformation.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.890
This is completely identical to
your notion of a function.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.540
It is a function.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.130
In the next video I'm going
to talk about linear

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.230
transformations.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.190
That's really just
linear functions.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.820
And I'll define that
a little bit more

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.450
precisely in the next video.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.390
But hopefully by watching this
video you at least have a

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.945
sense that you can apply
functions to vectors and, in

00:14:06.945 --> 00:14:09.360
the linear algebra world,
we tend to call those

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.270
transformations.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.670
And hopefully this example
right here gives you, at

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.080
least, a visual representation
of why it's called a

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.760
transformation.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.250
We're transforming from
one vector to another.
