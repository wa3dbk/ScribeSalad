00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.090
Let's say I've got some subspace
V, which tends to be

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.750
our favorite letter for
subspaces, and it's equal to

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.170
the span of two vectors in R4.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.840
Let's say that the first vector
is 1 0 0 1, and the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:26.350
second vector is 0 1 0 1.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.210
That is my subspace V.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.220
And you can see that these
are going to be a basis.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.810
That these are linearly
independent.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.150
Two vectors that are linear-- or
any set of vectors that are

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.380
linearly independent and that
span a subspace are a basis

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.960
for that subspace.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020
You can see they are linearly
independent.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.040
This guy's has a 1 here.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.250
There's no way you can take some
combination of this guy

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.820
to somehow get a 1 there.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.960
And this guy has a 1 here.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.730
There's no way you can get some
linear combination of

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.440
these zeroes here
to a 1 there, so

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.050
they're linearly dependent.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.500
You can also call this
a basis for V.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.920
Now, given that, let's see
if we can find out the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.730
transformation matrix for the
projection of any arbitrary

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.360
vector onto this subspace.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.440
So let's say that X-- we're
dealing in R4 here, right?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.030
Let's say that x is a member
of R4, and I want to figure

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.170
out a transformation
matrix for the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.320
projection onto V of x.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.040
Now, in the last video, we came
up with a general way to

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.850
figure this out.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.400
We said if A is a transformation
matrix-- sorry.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.900
If A is a matrix who's columns
are the basis for the

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:52.350
subspace, so let's say A is
equal to 1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.197
So A is a matrix whose columns
are the basis for our

00:01:55.197 --> 00:02:00.130
subspace, then the projection
of x onto V would be equal

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.350
to-- and this is kind of hard.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.600
The first time you look at, it
gives you a headache, but

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.030
there's a certain pattern or
symmetry or a way of-- you

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.140
could say it's A times, you're
gonna have something in the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.790
middle, and then you have A
transpose times your vector x.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.100
And the way I remember it is in
the middle, you have these

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.760
two guys switched around.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.790
So then you have A transpose
A, and you take

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.040
the inverse of it.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.940
You probably won't be using
this in your everyday life

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.500
five or ten years from now, so
it's OK if you don't memorize

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.390
it, but temporarily, put this
in your medium-term memory

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.110
because it's a good thing
to know for doing these

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.490
projection problems.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.640
So if we want to find the
general matrix for this

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.790
transformation, we just have to
determine what this matrix

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.000
is equal to, and that's just a
bunch of matrix operations.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.980
So that's A.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.840
What is A transpose?

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:05.450
A transpose is going to be equal
to just all the rows

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.020
turn into columns.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.960
So the first column becomes
the first row.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.165
So it becomes 1 0 0 1.

00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:17.740
The second column becomes
the second row 0 1 0 1.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.290
That's what A transpose is.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.270
Now, what's A transpose A?

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.100
To figure out that, I want to
figure out what A transpose

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.680
times A is.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.210
So let me multiply A
transpose times A.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.370
So I'll rewrite A right here.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.120
1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.290
This is giving us some
good practice on

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.890
matrix-matrix products.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.590
This is going to be
equal to what?

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.660
Well, first of all, this is
a 2-by-4 matrix, and I'm

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.400
multiplying it by a 4-by-2
matrix, so it's going to be a

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.150
2-by-2 matrix.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.410
So the first entry is
essentially the dot product of

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.870
that row with that column.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:06.100
So it's 1 times 1 plus 0
times 0 plus 0 times 0

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.840
plus 1 times 1.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.250
So it's just going to be 2 for
that first entry right there.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.710
And then you take the dot
product of this guy with this

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.760
guy right here.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.860
So it's 1 times 0, which is 0,
plus 0 times 1, which is 0,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.090
plus 0 time 0, which is 0, plus
1 times 1, which is 1.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.970
Now, we do this guy dotted with
this column right there.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:40.170
0 times 1 is 0 plus 1 time 0 is
0 plus 0 times 0 is 0 plus

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.525
1 times 1 is 1.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.740
And then finally,
this row dotted

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.640
with this second column.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.430
Second row, second column.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.660
0 times 0 is 0, 1 times 1
is 1, 0 times 0 is 0,

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.580
1 times 1 is 1.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.530
So we have 1 times
1 plus 1 times 1.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.450
It's going to be 2.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.800
It's going to be equal to 2.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.590
So this right here
is A transpose A.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.520
But that's not good enough.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.680
We need to figure out what the
inverse of A transpose A is.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.710
This is A transpose A.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.720
But we need to figure out
A transpose A inverse.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.300
So what's the inverse of this?

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.420
So let me write it here.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:26.050
The inverse A transpose
A inverse is going

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.970
to be equal to what?

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.060
It's 1 over the determinant
of this guy.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.185
What's the determinant here?

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:32.920
It's going to be 1 over the
determinant of this.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.510
The determinant is 2 times 2,
which is 4, minus 1 times 1.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.910
So it's 4 minus 1, which is 3.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.090
So 1 over the determinant times
this guy, where if I

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:53.170
swap these two, so I swap the
1's-- sorry, I swap the 2's.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:06:01.210
So this 2 goes here, and then
this orange 2 goes over here.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.570
And then I make these
1's negative.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.730
This becomes a minus 1 and
this becomes a minus 1.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.010
We learned that this is a
general solution for the

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.510
inverse of a 2-by-2 matrix.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.350
I think it was 10 or 11 videos
ago, and you probably learned

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.420
this in your Algebra II class,
frankly, but there you go.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.420
We have A transpose A inverse.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.620
So we have this guy.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.020
We have this whole guy here
is just this matrix.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.850
I could multiply the 1/3 into
it, but I don't have to do

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.930
that just yet.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.670
But let's figure out the
whole matrix now.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.700
The whole A times this
guy, A transpose A

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.340
inverse times A transpose.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.350
Let me write it this way.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:49.630
So the projection onto the
subspace V of x is going to be

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.880
equal to A.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:02.270
1 0 0 1-- let me write a little
bit bigger like this.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:11.680
So 1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1 times A
transpose A inverse, right?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.810
A times A transpose A inverse,
which is this guy right here.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.370
Let's just put the 1/3 out
front just because

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.780
that's just a scalar.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.570
I'll put the 1/3 out front
times this guy.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.700
This A transpose A inverse
is 1/3 times 2

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.690
minus 1, minus 1, 2.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.860
And then I'm going to multiply
it times A transpose.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.180
And all that times
our vector x.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.880
So A transpose is right there.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.340
It is 1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.440
And then all of that's going
to be times your vector x.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.070
So we still have some
nice matrix-matrix

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.070
products ahead of us.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.290
Let see if we can do these.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.160
So the first one, let's just
multiply these two guys.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.210
I don't think there's any
simple way to do it.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.370
This is a 2-by-2 matrix and this
is a 2-by-4 matrix, so

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.740
when I multiply them,
I'm going to end up

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:23.230
with a 2-by-4 matrix.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.430
Let me write that 2-by-4
matrix right here.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.080
And then I can write this
guy right here.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.450
1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.070
And then I have the 1/3 that
was from A transpose A

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.760
inverse, but I put the scaling
factor out there.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.039
And all of this is equal to the
projection of x onto V.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.040
So let's do this product.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.690
So this first entry is going to
be 2 times 1 plus minus 1

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.930
times 0, so that is just 2.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:57.250
Then you're going to have 2
times 0 plus minus 1 times 1.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.895
Well, that's minus 1.

00:08:58.895 --> 00:09:02.040
Then you have 2 times 0
plus minus 1 times 0.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.110
Well, that's just 0.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.010
And then you're going to
have 2 times 1 plus

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.420
minus 1 times 1.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.350
That's 2 minus 1.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.640
That's just 1, right?

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.790
2 times 1 plus minus
1 times 1.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.430
Fair enough.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.930
Now, let's do the second row.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.730
Minus 1 times 1 plus 2 times
0, so that's just minus 1.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.460
Minus 1 times 0 plus
2 times 1.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.170
Well, that's just 2.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.150
Minus 1 times 0 plus
2 times 0.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.750
That's just 0.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.640
Minus 1 times 1 plus
2 times 1.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.020
Well, that's minus 1 plus
2, so that is 1.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.560
Almost there, and, of course, we
have to multiply it times x

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.950
at the end.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.350
That's what the transformation
is.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.050
But this right here is our
transformation matrix.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.390
One more left to do.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.620
Let's hope I haven't made any
careless mistakes and that I

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.685
won't make any when doing
this product.

00:09:53.685 --> 00:09:55.480
This is going to be a little
more complicated because this

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.350
is a 4 by 2 times a 2 by 4.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.550
I'm going to end up with
a 4-by-4 matrix.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.890
Let me give myself some
breathing room here because

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:11.260
I'm going to generate a 4-by-4
matrix right there.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.820
And so what am I going to get?

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.690
So this first entry is going
to be 1 times 2 plus

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.060
0 times minus 1.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.840
So it's just going
to be equal to 2.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:29.100
The next entry: 1 times-- this
row times any column here is

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.560
just going to be the first entry
in the column because it

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.090
gets zeroed out.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.600
So 1 times 2 plus 0 times
minus 1 is just 2.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.500
1 times minus 1 plus 0 times
2 is just minus 1.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.570
1 times 0 plus 0 times 0 is 0.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.690
1 times 1 plus 0 times
1 is just 1.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.920
When you take this row and you
multiply it times these

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.710
columns, you literally just
got your first row there.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:58.100
Now, let's do this row
times these columns.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.340
Now, you've got a 0 here, so
you're going to have a 0 times

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.010
the first entry of all
of these and a 1

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.820
times the second one.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.800
So 0 times 2 plus 1 times
minus 1 is minus 1.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.450
0 times minus 1 plus
1 times 2 is 2.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.450
You're just going to get
the second row here.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.110
2 0 1.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.140
That actually makes sense,
because if you just look at

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.990
this part of the matrix, it's
the 2-by-2 identity matrix.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.500
So, anyway, that's a little hint
why this looks very much

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.060
like that, but we're just
going to go through this

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.340
matrix product.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.280
Now, you multiply this-- let me
do it in a different color.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.530
You multiply this guy times
each of these columns.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.440
That guy dotted with that is
just going to 0 because this

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.475
guy's essentially the 0 row
vector, so you're just going

00:11:37.475 --> 00:11:39.330
to get a bunch of zeroes.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:44.540
And then, finally, this last
row, it's 1 times the first

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.810
entry plus 1 times
the second entry.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.920
So this guy's going to be 2
plus minus 1, which is 1.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.000
Minus 1 plus 2, which is 1.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.160
0 plus 0, which is 0.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.240
And then 1 plus 1, which is 2.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.090
And all that times x.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.710
And there you have it.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.500
This is exciting!

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.220
The projection onto V of x
is equal to this whole

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.060
matrix times x.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.770
So this thing right here, I
could multiply the 1/3 into

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:15.820
it, but we don't have
to do that.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.870
That'll just make it a little
bit more messy.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.720
This thing right here is the
transformation matrix.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.760
As you can see, since we're
transforming-- remember, this

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.560
projection onto V,
this is a linear

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.540
transformation from R4 to R4.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.610
You give me some member of R4,
and I'll give you another

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.600
member of R4 that's in my
subspace that is the

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.760
projection.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.740
So this is going to be
a 4-by-4 You can

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.830
see it right there.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.610
Anyway, hopefully, you found
that useful to actually see a

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.880
tangible result.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.430
R4 is very abstract, so this
would even be beyond our

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.730
three-dimensional programming
example.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.900
We're dealing with a more
abstract data set where we're

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.220
interested in finding
a projection.
