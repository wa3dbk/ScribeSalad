00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.970
Welcome back.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.390
I'm now going to use definite
integrals to figure out the

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.890
areas under a bunch of curves
and, if we have time, maybe

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.290
even between some curves.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.660
So let me right down the
fundamental theorem

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.350
of calculus.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.560
I know I covered it really fast
in the last presentation.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.310
Just to make sure you
understand this formula.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.020
The last couple presentations
were really to give you an

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.800
intuition for this
exact formula.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:34.440
Let's say that big f prime of
x is equal to f of x, right?

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.200
That's also like saying that
the -- that's equivalent to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.950
saying that f of x -- big f
of x -- is equal to the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:56.000
antiderivative of
f of x, right?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.880
Well, let's just that it's one
of the possible antiderivatives

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.760
of f of x, right?

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.420
Because there's always a
constant term here and you're

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.090
not sure whether it is.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.760
And this is why people tend to
use this standard because we

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.590
know that f of x is the
derivative of big f prime of x.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.850
Big f of x is just one of the
antiderivatives of f of x.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.100
So this is a little bit
not true, but I think

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.800
you get the idea.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.430
But the fundamental theorem of
calculus tells us if this top

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:38.480
line is true, then the definite
integral from a to b of f of x

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.520
d x is equal to its
antiderivative evaluated at b

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.010
minus its antiderivative
evaluated at a.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.300
And I know I said here that
big f isn't the only

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.310
antiderivative, right?

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.760
Because you could at any
constant to this and that would

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.200
also be the antiderivative.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.110
But when you subtract here, the
constants will cancel out.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.575
So it really doesn't
matter which of the

00:02:02.575 --> 00:02:03.250
constants you pick.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.420
The constant actually
doesn't matter.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.765
So that's why I actually
said the antiderivative.

00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:08.150
But let's apply this.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.960
You might be
confused right now.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.795
So let me draw a graph.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.160
There you go.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.630
Look how straight that is.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.220
Draw the x-axis.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.510
Not perfect but it'll do.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:47.570
Let's say that my f of x is
equal to x squared plus 1.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.620
So f of x looks like this.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.630
This is 1.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.770
So it'll start at 1.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.880
It'll just be a parabola.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.600
Let me see how good
I can draw this.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.900
I've done worse.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.550
OK.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.550
So that's f of x.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.260
It's a parabola.
y-intercept at 1.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.660
And let's say I want to figure
out the area under the curve --

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.570
between the curve and,
really, the x-axis.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.180
Let's say I want to figure out
the area between the curve and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.030
the x-axis from x equals
negative 1 to, I don't

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.190
know, x equals 3.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.220
So this is the area I
want to figure out.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.220
I'm going to shade it in.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.470
So this is the area.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.980
All of this stuff.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.660
I want to figure out this area.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.620
And you could imagine, before
you knew calculus, figuring out

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.870
an area of something with a
curve -- it's kind

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.630
of top boundary.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.100
It would have been
very difficult.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.000
But we will now use the
fundamental theorem of calculus

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.970
and hopefully you have an
intuition of why this works and

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.470
how the integral is really just
a sum of a bunch of little,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.400
little, small squares with
infinitely small bases.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.030
But if you watched the last
videos, hopefully that

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.540
hit the point home.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.310
But now we'll just mechanically
compute because, actually,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.925
understanding it is a bit
harder than just doing it.

00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:04.390
But let's just
mechanically compute it.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.470
So we are essentially just
going to figure out the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:16.780
integral from minus 1 to 3
of f of x, which is x

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.970
squared plus 1 d x.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.850
What's the antiderivative
of x squared plus 1?

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.010
This just equals the
antiderivative.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.630
So it's just x to the third --
we could say 1/3 x to the third

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.860
or x to the third over
3 -- plus x, right?

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.130
The derivative of x is 1.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.770
And then we don't have to worry
about plus c because we're

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.600
going to subtract out the c's.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.030
You'll see.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.850
I think you'll get the point.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.340
It doesn't matter.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.800
You could pick an arbitrary
c right here and it'll

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.900
just cancel out.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.960
And we're going to evaluate
that at 3 and negative 1 and

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.590
we're going to subtract
out big f of negative

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.650
1 from big f of 3.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.940
This is just the
notation they use.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.070
You figure out the
antiderivative and

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.710
you say where you're
going to evaluate it.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.430
And then this is equal to
-- So if I evaluate 3.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.820
3 to the third power is what?

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.370
That's 27.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.010
27 divided by 3 is 9.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.420
And then 9 plus 3 is 12.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.360
Right?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.150
This is just big f of 3, right?

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.520
Because I figured out the
end -- This is big f of x.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.150
You can kind of view
this as big f of x.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.340
But not to be confused with
small, cursive f of x.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.860
This is big f of x.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.430
So this big f of 3.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.480
And then, from that
we'll subtract big f

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.280
of negative 1, right?

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.950
Minus big f of negative 1.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.640
And if we put minus 1 here.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.020
Let's see, minus 1 to the
third power is minus 1.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.570
So it's minus 1/3 and then
plus minus 1, right?

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.610
So minus 1/3 plus minus 1.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.690
I think that equals
minus 4/3, correct?

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.470
I think so.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.420
Maybe I'm making a mistake
with negative signs.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.790
Minus 1/3 minus 4/3.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.840
And I'm going to
subtract that, right?

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.010
So if I'm subtracting minus
4/3, it's the same thing

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.850
as adding minus 4/3.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.040
And then we have our answer.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.460
Actually, it's 12 and 4/3
-- whatever -- units.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.290
Squared units.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.880
12 and 4/3 squared units.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.480
We could write this as a
mixed number as well.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.520
Let's do another one.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.285
I'll do a slight variation.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.850
OK.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.110
Let me draw again.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.596
Some coordinates.

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:49.210
I don't know if I'm going
to have time to do it in

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.040
this video but I'll try.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.000
I always try.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:07.440
Let's say I have f of x is
equal to the square root of x.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.590
So it looks something
like this.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.910
That's actually a pretty nice
looking, kind of sideways

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.790
parabola, I think.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.960
This is f of x.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.660
And let's say I have
another function.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.250
g of x which equals x squared.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.790
So g of x is actually going
to look something like this.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.840
Whoops!

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.650
I was doing well and then
something happened.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.750
And, of course, it'll continue
on this side as well.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.810
Because it is defined
for negative numbers.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.990
But anyway, my question to you,
or my question to myself,

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.170
really, is what is the
area between the curves

00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.730
where they intersect?

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.340
What is this?

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.420
What is this area?

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.830
Well, the first thing you have
to figure out is just what

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.690
are the boundary points?

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.922
What is this point?

00:08:12.922 --> 00:08:15.350
And what is this point?

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.800
Well this point, I
think, is pretty clear.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.220
It's 0, 0, right?

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.570
They both intersect at 0, 0.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.640
And even this point, you could
probably do it from intuition.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.310
But if you don't, I guess, want
to do it through intuition, you

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.990
could just set these 2
equations equal to

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.580
each other, right?

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.690
You could say x squared
is equal to the square

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.790
root of x, right?

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.330
And then you could do
a bunch of things.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:50.450
You could square both sides or
-- well, actually, this is the

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.910
same thing as doing
it by intuition.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.170
But I think it's pretty obvious
that the only places where x

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.390
squared is equal to the square
root of x are the points x

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.510
equals 0, which you already
know, and x equals 1.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.060
So this is the point 1, 1.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.310
Which is true for both of them.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.005
And this is more algebra,
so I won't go into that

00:09:09.005 --> 00:09:09.890
in too much detail.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.220
I'm kind of running
out of time.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.400
So we want to figure out the
area between these 2 curves.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.280
So what we can do is -- maybe
you want to pause it and think

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.320
about it yourself -- we
can figure out the area

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.840
under the grey curve.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.180
We could figure out this area.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.840
So we want to figure out --
this is a boundary, right?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.760
Between 0 and 1.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.970
We could figure out this area
and then we could figure out

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.640
the entire area under the green
curve separately and then we

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.700
could subtract the difference.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.930
Which is exactly how we're
going to do it in the next

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.630
video because I have
run out of time.
