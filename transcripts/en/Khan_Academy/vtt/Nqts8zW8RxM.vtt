00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:07.760
We need to divide 0.25
into 1.03075.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.260
Now the first thing you want to
do when your divisor, the

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.690
number that you're dividing into
the other number, is a

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.850
decimal, is to multiply it by
10 enough times so that it

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.990
becomes a whole number
so you can shift the

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.220
decimal to the right.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.620
So every time you multiply
something by 10, you're

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.170
shifting the decimal over
to the right once.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.620
So in this case, we want
to switch it over the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.310
right once and twice.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.690
So 0.25 times 10 twice is the
same thing as 0.25 times 100,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.190
and we'll turn the
0.25 into 25.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.250
Now if you do that with the
divisor, you also have to do

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.860
that with the dividend,
the number that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.920
you're dividing into.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.220
So we also have to multiply this
by 10 twice, or another

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.190
way of doing it is shift
the decimal over

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.560
to the right twice.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.680
So we shift it over
once, twice.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.440
It will sit right over here.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.180
And to see why that makes
sense, you just have to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.700
realize that this expression
right here, this division

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:14.840
problem, is the exact same
thing as having 1.03075

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.310
divided by 0.25.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.650
And so we're multiplying
the 0.25 by 10 twice.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.590
We're essentially multiplying
it by 100.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.960
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.750
We're multiplying it by 100
in the denominator.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.760
This is the divisor.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.670
We're multiplying it by 100, so
we also have to do the same

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.040
thing to the numerator, if we
don't want to change this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.720
expression, if we don't want
to change the number.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.400
So we also have to multiply
that by 100.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.050
And when you do that,
this becomes 25, and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.200
this becomes 103.075.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.400
Now let me just rewrite this.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.520
Sometimes if you're doing this
in a workbook or something,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.240
you don't have to rewrite it as
long as you remember where

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.910
the decimal is.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.340
But I'm going to rewrite
it, just so it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.480
a little bit neater.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.330
So we multiplied both
the divisor and

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.040
the dividend by 100.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:17.590
This problem becomes 25
divided into 103.075.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.130
These are going to result in
the exact same quotient.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.160
They're the exact same fraction,
if you want to view

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.580
it that way.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.430
We've just multiplied both the
numerator and the denominator

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.720
by 100 to shift the decimal
over to the right twice.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.560
Now that we've done that,
we're ready to divide.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.520
So the first thing, we have 25
here, and there's always a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.160
little bit of an art to dividing
something by a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.660
multiple-digit number, so we'll
see how well we can do.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.810
So 25 does not go into 1.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.750
25 does not go into 10.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.410
25 does go into 103.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.400
We know that 4 times 25
is 100, so 25 goes

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.880
into 100 four times.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.540
4 times 5 is 20.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.840
4 times 2 is 8, plus 2 is 100.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.990
We knew that.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.600
Four quarters is $1.00.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.130
It's 100 cents.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.590
And now we subtract.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.920
103 minus 100 is going to
be 3, and now we can

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.100
bring down this 0.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.640
So we bring down that 0 there.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.710
25 goes into 30 one time.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.210
And if we want, we could
immediately put

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.070
this decimal here.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.400
We don't have to wait until
the end of the problem.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.930
This decimal sits right in that
place, so we could always

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.730
have that decimal sitting right
there in our quotient or

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.980
in our answer.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.690
So we were at 25 goes
into 30 one time.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.970
1 times 25 is 25, and then
we can subtract.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.550
30 minus 25, well,
that's just 5.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.510
I mean, we can do all this
borrowing business, or

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.140
regrouping.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.410
This can become a 10.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.570
This becomes a 2.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.350
10 minus 5 is 5.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.200
2 minus 2 is nothing.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.250
But anyway, 30 minus 25 is 5.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.860
Now we can bring down this 7.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.270
25 goes into 57 two
times, right?

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.780
25 times 2 is 50.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.940
25 goes into 57 two times.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.130
2 times 25 is 50.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.940
And now we subtract again.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.950
57 minus 50 is 7.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.760
And now we're almost done.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.280
We bring down that 5
right over there.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.150
25 goes into 75 three times.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.610
3 times 25 is 75.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.390
3 times 5 is 15.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.240
Regroup the 1.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.980
We can ignore that.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.920
That was from before.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.960
3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.260
So you can see that.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.540
And then we subtract, and then
we have no remainder.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:59.110
So 25 goes into 103.075 exactly
4.123 times, which

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.100
makes sense, because 25 goes
into 100 about four times.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.080
This is a little bit larger than
100, so it's going to be

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.740
a little bit more
than four times.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.920
And that's going to be the
exact same answer as the

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:16.600
number of times that 0.25
goes into 1.03075.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.520
This will also be 4.123.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.580
So this fraction, or this
expression, is the exact same

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.730
thing as 4.123.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.340
And we're done!
