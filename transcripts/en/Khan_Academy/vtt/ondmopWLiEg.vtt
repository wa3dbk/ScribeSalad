00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.350
I think you're pretty familiar
with the idea of matrix vector

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.860
products and what I want to do
in this video is show you that

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.440
taking a product of a vector
with a matrix is equivalent to

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.490
a transformation.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.020
It's actually a linear
transformation.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.630
Let's say we have some matrix A
and let's say that its terms

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.870
are, or its columns are v1--
column vector is v2,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.130
all the way to vn.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.490
So this guy has n columns.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.780
Let's say it has m rows.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.260
So it's an m by n matrix.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.126
And let's say I define
some transformation.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.380
Let's say my transformation
goes from Rn to Rm.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.300
This is the domain.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.650
I can take any vector in Rn
and it will map it to some

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.730
factor in Rm.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.650
And I define my transformation.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.990
So T of x where this is some
vector in Rn, is equal to A--

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050
this is this A.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.040
Let me write it in this
color right here.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.120
And it should be bolded.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.590
I kind of get careless sometimes
with the bolding.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.370
But big bold A times
the vector x.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.150
So the first thing you might,
Sal, this transformation looks

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.510
very odd relative to how we've
been defining transformations

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.830
or functions so far.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.770
So the first thing we have to
just feel comfortable with is

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.680
the idea that this is
a transformation.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.430
So what are we doing?

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.530
We're taking something
from Rn and then

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.780
what does A x produce?

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.220
If we write A x like this, if
this is x where it's x1, x2.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.220
It's going to have n terms
because it's in Rn.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.760
This can be rewritten as x1
times v1 plus x2 times v2, all

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.690
the way to xn times vn.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.280
So it's going to be a sum of a
bunch of these column vectors.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.100
And each of these columns
vectors, v1, v2, all the way

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.670
to vn, what set are
they members of?

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.280
This is an m by n matrix, so
they're going to have m-- the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.620
matrix has m rows, or
each of these column

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.720
vectors will have m entries.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.430
So all of these guys
are members of Rm.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.870
So if I just take a linear
combination of all of these

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.310
guys, I'm going to get
another member of Rm.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.440
So this guy right here is going
to be a member of Rm,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.540
another vector.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.590
So clearly, by multiplying my
vector x times a, I'm mapping,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.840
I'm creating a mapping from Rn--
and let me pick another

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.780
color-- to Rm.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.640
And I'm saying it in very
general terms. Maybe n is 3,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.810
maybe m is 5.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.300
Who knows?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.225
But I'm saying it in very
general terms. And so if this

00:02:58.225 --> 00:03:03.340
is a particular instance, a
particular member of set Rn,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.800
so it's that vector, our
transformation or our function

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.910
is going to map it to
this guy right here.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.290
And this guy will be a
member of Rm and we

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.570
could call him a x.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.660
Or maybe if we said a x equaled
b we could call him

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.150
the vector b-- whatever.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.460
But this is our transformation
mapping.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.540
So this does fit our kind of
definition or our terminology

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.480
for a function or a
transformation as a mapping

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.760
from one set to another.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.490
But it still might not be
satisfying because everything

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.900
we saw before looked
kind of like this.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.690
If we had a transformation
I would write it like the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.040
transformation of-- I would
write, you know, x1 and x2 and

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.100
xn is equal to.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.450
I'd write m terms
here in commas.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.740
How does this relate to that?

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.480
And to do that I'll do
a specific example.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.680
So let's say that I had
the matrix-- let me

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.690
to a different letter.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.270
Let's say I have my matrix
B and it is a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.290
fairly simple matrix.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.780
It's a 2, minus 1, 3 and 4.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.211
And I define some
transformation.

00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:20.959
So I define some transformation
T.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.540
And it goes from R2 to R2.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.080
And I define T.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.270
T of some vector x is equal
to this matrix, B

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.260
times that vector x.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.830
Now what would that equal?

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.850
Well the matrix is
right there.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.310
Let me write it in purple.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.570
2, minus 1, 3, and 4 times x.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.130
x1, x2.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.390
And so what does this equal?

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.310
Well this equals
another vector.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.600
It equals a vector in the
co-domain R2 where the first

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.290
term is 2 times x1.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.770
I'm just doing the definition
of matrix vector

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.310
multiplication.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.840
2 times x1 plus minus 1
times x2, or minus x2.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.660
That's that row times
our vector.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.570
And then the second row
times that factor.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.910
We get 3 times x1.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.210
Plus 4 times x2.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.520
So this is what we might
be more familiar with.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.530
I could rewrite this
transformation.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.130
I could rewrite this
transformation as T of x1 x2

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:42.780
is equal to 2x1 minus x2 comma--
let me scroll over a

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.490
little bit, comma
3x1 plus 4x2.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.100
So hopefully you're satisfied
that a matrix multiplication,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.770
it isn't some new, exotic
form of transformation.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.010
That they really are
just another way.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.590
This statement right here is
just another way of writing

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.480
this exact transformation
right here.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.490
Now, the next question you might
ask and I already told

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.400
you the answer to this at the
beginning of the video is, is

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.510
multiplication by a matrix
always going to be a linear

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.800
transformation?

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.730
Now what are the two constraints
for being a linear

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.390
transformation?

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.000
We know that the transformation
of two vectors,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.290
a plus b, the sum of two vectors
should be equal to the

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.826
sum of their transformations.

00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:34.770
The transformation of a plus
the transformation of b.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.135
And then the other requirement
is that the transformation of

00:06:38.135 --> 00:06:42.180
a scaled version of a vector
should be equal to a scaled

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.670
version of the transformation.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.500
These are our two requirements
for being a linear

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.390
transformation.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.300
So let's see if matrix
multiplication applies there.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.210
And I've touched on this in the
past and I've even told

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.130
you that you should prove it.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.000
I've already assumed you know
it, but I'll prove it to you

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.630
here because I'm tired of
telling you that you

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.120
should prove it.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.500
I should do it at least once.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.090
So let's see, matrix
multiplication.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:11.220
If I multiply a matrix A times
some vector x, we know that--

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.780
let me write it this way.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.120
We know that this is equivalent

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.270
to-- I said our matrix.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.540
Let's say this is an
m by n matrix.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.000
We can write any matrix
as just a

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.240
series of column vectors.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.760
So this guy could have
n column vectors.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:30.700
So let's say it's v1, v2, all
the way to vn column vectors.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.050
And each of these guys are going
to have m components.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.880
Times x1, x2, all the
way down to xn.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.740
And we've seen this multiple,
multiple times before.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.790
This, by the definition of
matrix vector multiplication

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.820
is equal to x1 times v1.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.080
That times that.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.270
This scalar times that vector
plus x2 times v2, all the way

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.270
to plus xn times vn.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.650
This was by definition of a
matrix vector multiplication.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.630
And of course, this is going
to-- and I did this at the top

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.160
of the video.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.540
This is going to have right
here, this vector is going to

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.310
be a member of Rm.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.920
It's going to have
m components.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:19.520
So what happens if I take some
matrix A, some m by n matrix

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:30.450
A, and I multiply it times the
sum of two vectors a plus b?

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.100
So I could rewrite this as
this thing right here.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.880
So my matrix A times.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.309
The sum of a plus b, the first
term will just be a1 plus b1.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:45.460
Second term is a2 plus b2, all
the way down to a n plus bn.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.720
This is the same
thing as this.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.290
I'm not saying a of a plus b.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.260
I'm saying a times.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.920
Maybe I should put a
dot right there.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.760
I'm multiplying the matrix.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.000
I want to be careful
with my notation.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.110
This is the matrix vector
multiplication.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.940
It's not some type of new
matrix dot product.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.450
But this is the same
thing as this

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.660
multiplication right here.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.060
And based on what I just told
you up here, which we've seen

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:11.780
multiple, multiple times, this
is the same thing as a1 plus

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.960
b1 times the first column
in a, which is that

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.890
vector right there.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.560
This a is the same as this a.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.130
So times v1.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:28.820
Plus a2 plus b2 times v2,
all the way to plus an

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.180
plus bn times vn.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.840
Each xi term here is just
being replaced by

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.850
an ai plus bi term.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.910
So each x1 here is replaced
by an a1 plus b1 here.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.090
This is equivalent to this.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:51.440
And then from the fact that we
know that well vector products

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.700
times scalars exhibit the
distributive property, we can

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.290
say that this is equal
to a1 times v1.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.710
Let me actually write all of
the a1 terms. Let me write

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:10.230
this. a1 times v1 plus b1 times
v1 plus a2 times v2 plus

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:15.460
b2 times v2, all the way
to plus a n times vn

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.170
plus bn times vn.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.910
And then if we just re-associate
this, if we just

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.890
group all of the a's together,
all of the a terms together,

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.440
we get a1 plus a-- sorry.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:35.870
a1 plus-- let me write it this
way. a1 times v1 plus a2 times

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.870
v2 plus, all the way,
a n times vn.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.640
I just grabbed all
the a terms.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.550
We get that plus all the b
terms. All the b terms I'll do

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.500
in this color.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.310
All the b terms are like that.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:57.850
So plus b1 times v1 plus b2
times v2, all the way to plus

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.560
bn times vn.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.640
That's that guy right there.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.340
Is equivalent to this statement
up here; I just

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.240
regrouped everything, which is
of course, equivalent to that

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.780
statement over there.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.770
But what's this equal to?

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:15.210
This is equal to my vector--
these columns are remember,

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.160
the column for the
matrix capital A.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.780
So this is equal to the matrix
capital A times a1, a2, all

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.650
the way down to a n, which
was our vector a.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.020
And what's this equal to?

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.700
This is equal to plus
these v1's.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.720
These are the columns for the a,
so it's equal to the matrix

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.440
A times my vector b.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.140
b1, b2, all the way
down to bn.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:45.140
This is my vector b.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.260
We just showed you that if I add
my two vectors, a and b,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.970
and then multiply it by the
matrix, it's completely

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.620
equivalent to multiplying each
of the vectors times the

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.850
matrix first and then
adding them up.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.620
So we've satisfied-- and this
is for an m by n matrix.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:08.470
So we've now satisfied this
first condition right there.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.980
And then what about the
second condition?

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.080
And this one's even more
straightforward to understand.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.420
c times a1, so let me
write it this way.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.200
The vector a times-- sorry.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.260
The matrix capital A times the
vector lowercase a-- let me do

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.495
it this way because
I want-- times the

00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:29.650
vector c lowercase a.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.940
So I'm multiplying my vector
times the scalar first. Is

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.530
equal to-- I can write
my big matrix A.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.210
I've already labeled
its columns.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.800
It's v1, v2, all
the way to vn.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.780
That's my matrix a.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.510
And then, what does
ca look like?

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.680
ca, you just multiply its
scalar times each of

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.530
the terms of a.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:56.940
So it's ca1, ca2, all the
way down to c a n.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.270
And what does this equal?

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.020
We know this, we've seen this
show multiple times before

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.230
right there.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.670
So it just equals-- I'll write
a little bit lower.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:13.000
That equals c a1 times this
column vector, times v1.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:22.010
Plus c a2 times v2 times this
guy, all the way to

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:26.570
plus c a n times vn.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.460
And if you just factor this
c out, once again, scalar

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.230
multiplication times vectors
exhibits the

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.530
distributive property.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.420
I believe I've done a video
on that, but it's

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.700
very easy to prove.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.960
So this will be equal to c
times-- I'll just stay in one

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:51.210
color right now-- a1 v1
plus a2 v2 plus all

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.600
the way to a n vn.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.400
And what is this
thing equal to?

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:03.770
Well that's just our matrix A
times our vector-- or our

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.040
matrix uppercase A.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.970
Maybe I'm overloading
the letter A.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.470
My matrix uppercase A times
my vector lowercase a.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.210
Where the lowercase a is just
this thing right here, a1, a2

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:18.700
and so forth.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.320
This thing up here was the
same thing as that.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.680
So I just showed you that if I
take my matrix and multiply it

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.020
times some vector that was
multiplied by a scalar first,

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.190
that's equivalent to first
multiplying the matrix times a

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.310
vector and then multiplying
by the scalar.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:39.020
So we've shown you that matrix
times vector products or

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.880
matrix vector products satisfied
this condition of

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.320
linear transformations
and this condition.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.680
So the big takeaway right here
is matrix multiplication.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.580
And this is a important
takeaway.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:15:03.570
Matrix multiplication or matrix
products with vectors

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:08.475
is always a linear
transformation.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.540
And this is a bit
of a side note.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.710
In the next video I'm going to
show you that any linear

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.460
transformation-- this is
incredibly powerful-- can be

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:22.260
represented by a matrix
product or by-- any

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.410
transformation on any vector can
be equivalently, I guess,

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.600
written as a product of that
vector with a matrix.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.640
Has huge repercussions and you
know, just as a side note,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.770
kind of tying this back
to your everyday life.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.410
You have your Xbox, your Sony
Playstation and you know, you

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.950
have these 3D graphic programs
where you're running around

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.000
and shooting at things.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.980
And the way that the software
renders those programs where

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.160
you can see things from every
different angle, you have a

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.100
cube then if you kind of move
this way a little bit, the

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.070
cube will look more like this
and it gets rotated, and you

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.780
move up and down, these are all

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.010
transformations of matrices.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.540
And we'll do this
in more detail.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.830
These are all transformations of
vectors or the positions of

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.690
vectors and I'll do that
in a lot more detail.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.390
And all of that is really just
matrix multiplication.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.130
So all of these things that
you're doing in your fancy 3D

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.890
games on your Xbox or your
Playstation, they're all just

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:16.800
matrix multiplications.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.840
And I'm going to prove that
to you in the next video.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.960
And so when you have these
graphics cards or these

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.420
graphics engines, all they are--
you know, we're jumping

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.630
away from the theoretical.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:32.650
But all these graphics
processors are, are hard wired

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.270
matrix multipliers.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.970
If I have just a generalized,
some type of CPU, I have to in

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.230
software write how to
multiply matrices.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.370
But if I'm making an Xbox or
something and 99% of what I'm

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.150
doing is just rotating these
abstract objects and

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.550
displaying them in transformed
ways, I should have a

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.590
dedicated piece of hardware, a
chip, that all it does-- it's

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.620
hard wired into it-- is
multiplying matrices.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.750
And that's what those graphics
processors or graphics engines

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.380
really are.
