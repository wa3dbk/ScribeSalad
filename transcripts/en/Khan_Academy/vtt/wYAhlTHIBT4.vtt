00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.880
Before I go a into an
explanation of why housing

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.340
prices skyrocketed from 2000 to
2006, I think it's a good

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.250
idea to give a little history of
what the housing market and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.130
the mortgage market used
to be like before

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.680
things got out of control.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.450
So let's go back to,
say, I don't know.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.030
Let's go back to
the late '70s--

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.840
maybe mid-'70s, actually.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.340
I remember my parents,
they bought a house.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.330
We lived in New Orleans.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.390
And the house, if I remember
correctly, it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.040
cost roughly $60,000.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.370
And back then, to buy a house --
and actually, for a while,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.390
until more recently -- in order
to buy a house you had

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.650
to put 25% down.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.430
So 25% of $60,000
is 1/4 of it.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.966
So you have to put
$15,000 down.

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.510
So you have to save
up $15,000.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.660
And then you're going to get a
mortgage on $45,000, right?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.300
$45,000, you're going
to borrow.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.430
And I forgot the exact interest
rates then, but I'm

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.830
just going to throw
out a number.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.090
This is really just for
instructive purposes.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.920
Let's say interest rates back
then, they were higher.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.190
They were like 9%, I think.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.260
So 9% on $45,000.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.900
How much interest am
I going to pay?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.750
45,000 times 0.09.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.100
So I'm going to pay a little
over $4,000 a year in

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:30.240
interest. Or if I divide by
12, about $340 a month in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.320
interest.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.760
And I remember at the time, we
actually moved out of our

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.350
house and we rented it out,
because we needed cash.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.280
And we rented out that exact
same house -- and I this is in

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.310
the late '70s or early '80s-- we
rented out that exact same

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.390
house for $900.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.680
The rent was $900.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.070
So this raises, I guess,
a couple of questions.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.500
First of all, the big question
is, why did those people who

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.210
rented our house -- I mean,
they paid $900 a month.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.289
They must have had a good
income, for that time.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.970
Why were they willing to pay
rent, when they could have

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.380
bought a house, where the
mortgage would have been --

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.840
interest plus a little principal
-- it would have

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.750
been no more than
$400 a month?

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.350
So why would you just throw away
-- this is the classic

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.640
rent-versus-buy argument -- why
would you throw away $900,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.190
where you could actually build
equity paying $400 a month for

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.990
the exact same place?

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.640
And you can think about
that a little bit.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.510
But there's a bunch
of reasons.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.550
What was necessary to
buy a house then?

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.180
Well, one, you needed a
$15,000 down payment.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.100
Maybe these people had really
good cash flow every month,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.210
but they just never had the
circumstances, or maybe even

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.740
the discipline, to
save up $15,000.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.350
You also needed a really
steady job.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.260
So you needed -- this
is the down

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.220
payment, this is one thing.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.470
You also needed a steady job.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.130
Maybe the people who were
renting, they were working odd

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.290
jobs, or they didn't have
a steady income.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.850
Although I doubt it.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.750
I don't think we would have
actually leased the house to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.910
them, had that been the case.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.160
They probably had that.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.510
And then the last thing you
needed to get a mortgage, you

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.800
needed good credit.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.840
And maybe these people
didn't have that.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.500
Maybe they didn't pay some bills
in the past. And they

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.620
just couldn't find a bank that
was willing to give them a

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.990
loan, despite having a steady
job and the $15,000 down.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.220
If you have to ask me, I think
the biggest barrier for this

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.080
family at that time
was probably the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.830
$15,000 down payment.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.420
And frankly, they probably had
trouble saving $15,000 because

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.840
they were busy paying
$900 in rent.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.400
So that was the circumstance
throughout, actually, most of

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.390
modern history.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.370
That you had this barrier
towards buying a house.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.590
That it did make sense, that the
conventional wisdom that

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.650
it is better to buy
than rent held.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.620
It's just, everyone knew that,
but a lot of people just

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.670
couldn't buy, even though they
wanted to, because they didn't

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.820
have the down payment.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.090
They didn't have
the steady job.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.360
Or they didn't have
the good credit.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.790
That was a circumstance then,
and that lasted for some time.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.490
What happened in the
early 2000s?

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.480
And it actually happened in
California in the mid-'90s.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.899
But it got more and more, I
guess we could say, flagrant,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.380
as we went through the decade--
is that people

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.800
started lowering these
standards.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.120
And I'll do a whole other video
on possibly why those

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.330
standards were lowered.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:36.700
But let's say that in 1980
you needed 25% down.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.350
Let me just switch colors.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.130
That color is kind of ugly.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.380
You needed a steady job.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.200
And you needed a,
I don't know.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.290
Let's say you needed
a 700 credit score.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.620
And that was true from 1980
to, let's say, 2000.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.570
I'm exaggerating a bit.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.460
But this is just to give you
the broad sense of what

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.140
actually happened.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.310
But let's say then, in 2001 --
and I'll explain later why

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.590
this might have happened -- the
standards were lowered.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.780
That if you wanted to buy a
house, all of a sudden you

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.570
could actually find someone who
was willing to give you a

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:13.760
house for 10% down, maybe kind
of a steady job, maybe just

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.910
need a job.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.000
And maybe you had a
600 credit rating.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.650
So what happens when the
standards on the mortgage go

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.820
from this to this?

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.900
Let's go back to these people
who used to rent that house

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.510
from us for $900.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.640
Maybe they didn't have
$15,000, right?

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.510
That would have been
a 25% down payment.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.450
But maybe back then,
they had 10%.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.810
Maybe they had $6,000.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.430
They just couldn't get up
to $15,000 in savings.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.840
Back when they were doing this,
back in the '80s, if the

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.750
standards got a little bit
freer, like they did in the

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.390
early 2000s, those people could
have bought a house.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.540
They would have said, man, we
don't have to rent anymore.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.640
We saved up the 10%
down payment.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.490
It's gotten a little easier.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.300
Our job now meets the
requirements.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.820
Our credit now meets
the requirements.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.250
We can go buy that house.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.720
So that would have
increased the

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.820
aggregate demand for housing.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.270
Even though, even if no one's
incomes increased, even if the

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.570
population didn't increase.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.370
All of a sudden, there's a new
person who could get financing

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.390
to buy a house.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.400
And then if we go to,
let's say, 2003.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.290
They say, you know what,
you don't even

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.410
need any down payment.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.740
No down.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.260
No money down.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.200
So you can imagine, there's a
whole set of people who maybe

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.490
had a decent income, but they
couldn't save any money.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.330
Now all of a sudden there was
no down payment barrier to

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.230
buying a house.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.785
Maybe you still needed a job.

00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:38.340
And maybe you just needed
a 500 credit.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.880
Right?

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.950
So all of a sudden, without
people's incomes going up,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.000
without more jobs being
available, without the

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.230
population increase, there
were more people

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.870
who could get financing.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.200
Or more people who could
bid up homes.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.010
And the situation actually
got pretty bad.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.410
By 2004, 2005 -- and this isn't
exact, but it gives you

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.010
a sense of what happened.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.160
By 2004, 2005, you had a
situation where they had these

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.700
stated income -- they had these

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.930
things called liar loans.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.610
Maybe I'll do videos
on each of these.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.530
But these were essentially
no down payment.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.260
If you had a job, you could
kind of make it up.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.030
You just said, I have a job.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.060
They wouldn't validate it.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.140
These were stated income.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.970
You could just say
what you made.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.530
So even though the mortgage
might require an income of

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.140
$10,000 a month, and your income
is only $2,000 a month,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.300
you could say your income
is $10,000 a month.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.065
So stated income, no
down, maybe a job.

00:07:33.065 --> 00:07:35.260
And they didn't even
do a credit check.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.660
So what happened from 2000 to
2004 is that credit just got

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.320
easier and easier and easier.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.650
And every time credit got
easier, there were more people

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.620
who, despite the fact that they
weren't making any more

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.140
money, they were able
to get financing.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.560
And so the pool of people who
were able to bid on homes, or

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.200
the demand for homes because now
there was this financing,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.600
became larger and larger.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.630
And that's what increased
the prices of homes.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.510
And now you know, the obvious
question is, well, why did

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.290
this happen?

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.170
First of all, why did they get
easier in 2001, get easier and

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.510
easier as we went to 2004?

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.510
And why did they get to this
unbelievably absurd level,

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.260
where by 2004 and 2005 -- you
hear stories, especially in

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.310
California and Florida, of
people who were making maybe

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.560
$40,000 a year.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.530
And they were able to buy houses
with no money down.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.560
Some of these people were
migrant laborers.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.260
And they were able to buy
houses for $1 million.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.480
So in the next video, I will
tell you why that happened.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.630
Why were people willing to give
their cash to people to

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.480
buy a house that had a very low
likelihood of getting paid

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.200
back, and for a house that had a
very low likelihood of being

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.750
able to retain its value.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.870
I'll see you in the
next video.
