00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.670
Let's talk a little bit about
the structure of the cell.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.480
I've done a lot of videos where
we deal with things that

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.560
go on inside of them, but I
haven't done one where we just

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.870
talk about the entire
structure of them.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.500
So a good place to start is--
let me just draw the membrane.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.850
And the cellular membrane is a
good place to start because

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.780
this is what separates the cell
from the outside world,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.020
and to a large degree, it kind
of defines the cell.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.200
It defines it as this very,
very small compartment.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.220
That's where the word,
"cell" came from.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.870
So let me label that.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.390
Cellular membrane.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.570
And all cells have a
cellular membrane.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.490
Now if we think about maybe the
most important thing that

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.590
defines a cell, you've probably
seen in the DNA

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.680
videos and we're going to talk
about translation and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.300
transcription and all of that,
that what defines what a

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.440
living organism is,
is its DNA.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.570
So all cells have DNA
inside of it.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.270
And I won't go into the details
of how DNA defines

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.150
what an organism is.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.580
I've done that in some detail
on the DNA videos.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.019
But all cells have DNA.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.150
This is more of an anatomy of a
cell video than necessarily

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.200
the function, but we'll go into
the function because we

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.780
need to know what these
different parts do.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.610
So this is, right here,
this is the DNA.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.390
And it's in its chromatin
form here.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.190
There's also little
proteins here.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.170
Not in all organisms, but
we're going to stick to

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.000
eukaryotes, and I'll talk
a little bit about the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.635
difference between eukaryotes
and prokaryotes in a second.

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:29.940
But we have DNA.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.390
As I've drawn this cell right
now, this is pretty much any

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.810
cell, and any animal or plant
or whatever kingdom

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.840
could look like this.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.300
I haven't drawn a lot
of the details.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.270
I've just drawn the DNA and
the cellular membrane.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.460
Now here's kind of the first
major division in the living

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.430
world, or at least from our
point of view, or it seemed

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.560
obvious, is that some
cells have a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.330
membrane around the DNA.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.970
So they'll have a membrane
around the DNA that separates

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.100
the DNA and the chromatin and
everything that makes up the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.090
stuff within the DNA, separates
that from the rest

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.130
of the cell, and this
is called a nucleus.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.920
This is called a nucleus.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.670
And I said that's a major
division because when some

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.770
people looked at some cells
and they saw a nucleus and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.780
other cells and they didn't see
a nucleus, they said, hey,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.210
this is a good way to classify
organisms. So they called the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.480
things that had nucleuses,
eukaryotes.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.150
These have a nucleus.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.950
So as I've drawn this cell right
here, it is a eukaryote.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.350
Now, if you do not have a
nucleus, you are dealing with

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.600
a prokaryote.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.440
No nucleus.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.320
And examples of prokaryotes,
the two big groups of them,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.110
are bacteria and Archaea.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.200
Now, Archaea are really
interesting.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.900
We know very little
about them.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.190
They were originally thought to
be types of bacteria, but

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.770
now people are realizing that
they're this whole completely

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.870
other group, and we've actually
observed a very small

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.050
subset of them, so it's a
very fascinating group.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.040
And it actually turns out that,
evolutionarily speaking,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.300
you shouldn't make this division
first. It actually

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.800
makes more sense to divide
things into eukaryotes, I'll

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.100
just write that Euk, bacteria
and Archaea.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.230
You don't want to do this
division first. There are

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.370
actually three separate
groups that you want

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.790
to start off with.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.840
We'll talk more about this
in future videos.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.280
But if you want to say
who has a nucleus?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.110
Well, eukaryotes have a
nucleus by definition.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.670
Who does not have a nucleus?

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.110
Well, the bacteria and the
Archaea do not have nuclei,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.740
just like that.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.780
But I'm going to focus on
eukaryotes because they tend

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.500
to be a little bit
more complex.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.070
They tend to be larger.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.720
And most of what we talk about,
at least in the videos

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.810
so far, are dealing
with eukaryotes.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.840
Eukaryotes include plants,
animals-- we're animals, at

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.680
least I am-- animals and fungi,
and there are other

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.020
groups within eukaryotes, but
these are the ones that we

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.290
normally deal with in
our everyday world.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.829
But let's go back to looking
at the anatomy of the cell.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.000
So we have our DNA.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.839
We know that it gets transcribed
into mRNA, That

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:29.540
mRNA leaves the nucleus, and
it gets translated into

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.390
proteins at the ribosomes.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.530
So the ribosomes are these
little complexes that could be

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.780
floating all over the cell, and
we'll see in a second that

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.430
they can also be attached
to these other membrane

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.280
structures.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.530
So this is a ribosome.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.590
And if all this talk of DNA
transcription into mRNA and

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.000
mRNA leaving the nucleus and
traveling to the ribosome to

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.710
be translated into proteins
makes no sense to you, there

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.720
are several videos where I
go into that in detail.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.660
But what I want to do is just
focus on all of the different

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.820
parts to kind of give a
big picture of things.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.590
So ribosomes are where mRNA that
gets transcribed inside

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.750
the nucleus from DNA, where it
gets translated into proteins.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.580
So you can kind of view them as
the place where information

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.720
actually turns into proteins,
which then can be used

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.500
anywhere else in the cell.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.160
And these ribosomes, they're
made up of proteins, and

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.300
actually they're made up RNA.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.000
And so one question is, well,
where are the pieces of the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.080
ribosomes made?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.190
Well, some are made by proteins,
which might be made

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.600
in other ribosomes.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.360
But some of it, the mRNA,
ribosomes, you can kind of

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.770
view them as this big
mess, if you were to

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.980
look at it in detail.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.900
There's some protein there.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.720
And I'm not drawing it that
realistically, but then you

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.130
have some mRNA tied in with
the protein, and the mRNA

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.490
isn't used for actual
information purposes like it

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.060
normally is when it goes from
DNA to the ribosome.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.770
Within the ribosome itself,
ribosomal RNA is actually used

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.890
as part of the structure.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.480
It actually helps the ribosome
function as a ribosome.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.420
So it's actually part
of the ribosome.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:20.060
And all of that gets built in
a part of the nucleus called

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.960
the nucleolus or the nucleole.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.070
Let me write that down.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.970
So this right here, this is
interesting right here.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.680
This is the nucleolus
or the nucleole.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.860
And it isn't a separate
organelle, and it's not

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.550
separated by a membrane, but it
shows up in a microscope.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.130
So when people first saw it,
they said, hey, there's like a

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.980
bundle there.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.210
That must be like the core of
the nucleus or something.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.920
But it turns out what it is,
it's the densely packed--

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.190
you've got DNA and RNA, and
that's actually where the

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.240
ribosomal RNA, the stuff that
makes up the ribosomes, is

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.020
actually produced.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.820
But it's so dense that it shows
up on a microscope, and

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.080
that's why people decided to
name it something different.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.510
But it is not membrane bound.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.960
It's not an organelle
within an organelle.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.090
It's just densely packed
proteins and ribosomal RNA,

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.550
and it's where ribosomal
RNA gets produced.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.620
So anyway, we're at
the ribosome.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.400
That's where proteins
get produced.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.030
But if the ribosomes are just
floating around, if they're

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.340
free ribosomes, then those
proteins will just-- once

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.430
they're produced at the
ribosome, they'll just float

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.590
around here in the fluid
inside the cell

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.840
that we call cytosol.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.830
But what if we wanted to produce
proteins that are

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.950
supposed to end up, maybe in the
membrane of the cell, or

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.850
maybe outside of the
cell itself?

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.970
Cells produce things that are
used by other cells, that are

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.450
used by the rest of the body.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.440
And here we have to go to
proteins that are attached to

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.220
this membrane.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.580
You can kind of view it
as a bunch of tunnels.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.880
Let me see how well
I can draw that.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.130
I'm going to draw
it very roughly.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.670
You have this thing called the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:59.920
Endoplasmic reticulum.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.210
You can just view it as a bunch
of tunnels like that.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.460
Endoplasmic reticulum.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.140
And they eventually lead to
something called Golgi bodies,

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.730
named after Mr. Golgi himself.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.110
So I'll do the endoplasmic
reticulum in yellow and I'll

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:23.520
do the Golgi bodies in green
maybe, just like that.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.340
I'll tell you in a second
what they are.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.170
So what's going on?

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.200
This is kind of a big kind of
stack, or you can kind of view

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.250
it as a bunch of folded
membranes together.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.039
And some ribosomes are actually
attached to this

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.840
part, which I call the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.880
So we have ribosomes attached.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.400
Some of them are free, some
of them are attached.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.060
And let me write
my labels down.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.540
So this right here, and we use
the space over here, this big

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.430
flap of convoluted
membrane, that's

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.680
the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:09:02.206 --> 00:09:04.020
It's fun to say.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.660
Endoplasmic reticulum.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.510
Maybe a good name for a band.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.780
Endoplasmic reticulum, and the
parts that have ribosomes

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.860
attached to it are called the
rough endoplasmic reticulum.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.140
Maybe even a better
name for a band.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.750
So right here, where I have
attached ribosomes, so these

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.770
ribosomes are attached right
here, this is the rough

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.640
endoplasmic reticulum, or
maybe the rough ER.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:35.410
The rough ER, ER standing for
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.210
And then where we don't have any
ribosomes attached, that's

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.530
the smooth endoplasmic
reticulum.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:48.070
So right here, that is this
smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.340
And I'm going to tell you in a
second what this is, but we

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.870
can keep following
the membranes.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.490
Eventually we get the
Golgi bodies.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.500
And what happens is,
I gave you a hint.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.430
In our free ribosomes, mRNA gets
there, gets translated

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.610
into proteins, and the proteins
then just float

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.360
around in the cytosol.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.930
But what if we want proteins
that should end up in

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.190
membranes or that end up
outside of the cell?

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.000
And that's where the endoplasmic
reticulum and the

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.890
Golgi bodies come into play.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.680
Because now what we can do is,
we have mRNA coming outside of

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.560
the nucleus, and it can attach
to the ribosomes or it can be

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.690
translated by the ribosomes
in the rough ER.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.190
And what happens here is your
mRNA comes here and it's

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.240
getting-- and I drew that
arrow very small-- it's

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.725
getting translated on the
outside of the endoplasmic

00:10:34.725 --> 00:10:38.940
reticulum, but as the protein
gets produced, it's getting

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.660
pushed into the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.950
And when I say the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum, I'm

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.590
talking about this area.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.470
I'm coloring it in.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.030
This is the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.070
And so the proteins will
get pushed into

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.440
the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.400
The ones that are to be used
outside of the cytosol,

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.400
outside of the cell or maybe
in the cell's membrane.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.350
So proteins will end up here.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.120
That's why those ribosomes are
on the membrane, because they

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.315
can translate things that are
outside of the endoplasmic

00:11:06.315 --> 00:11:11.800
reticulum, but as the proteins
get produced, the amino acid

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.430
chain ends up inside of it.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.630
Let me make a blow-up
of that because I

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.930
think that'll be useful.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.430
So let me draw-- let's say this
is the membrane of the

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.450
endoplasmic reticulum
and then you have

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.080
ribosomes attached to it.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.900
Let's say that's a ribosome on
the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.860
And is this is going to be the
rough endoplasmic reticulum.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.790
And what you can have is mRNA
coming into one side of it.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.860
mRNA can kind of come
in through here.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.050
Maybe it's going in
that direction.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.430
It's getting translated
into the proteins.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.810
But then the protein, as the
amino acid chain is built up,

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.710
will pop out on this end
of the membrane.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.300
Remember, this is our membrane
of our endoplasmic reticulum.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.070
So even though the mRNA is on
the outside, because the

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.710
ribosome is attached to
it, the protein can

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.790
show up on the inside.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.510
So once the protein is built,
maybe then it folds all up,

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.900
you know, a protein is just a
folded chain of amino acids,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.375
it can travel through the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:12:16.375 --> 00:12:17.920
And it travels through it.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.140
It travels through the smooth
endoplasmic reticulum all the

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.590
way until it gets to
the Golgi bodies.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.870
And all sorts of other
things happen.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.223
I'm oversimplifying things, but
I just want to give you a

00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:28.580
sense of what everything
in the cell does.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.390
And once the protein travels to
the Golgi bodies and they

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.230
get ready for traveling outside
of the cell, or maybe

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.710
traveling to the cell's
membrane, they'll actually bud

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.770
out of the Golgi bodies.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.530
So let's say this same protein,
when it gets to the

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.225
Golgi bodies-- remember it's
inside of the Golgi body, so

00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:48.800
let me draw the membrane of the
Golgi body right there.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.520
The protein might
end up there.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.830
It's just a big chain
of amino acids.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.880
And then it will bud out.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.780
So let's say it looks like that,
and then maybe the next

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.630
step it will look
something like.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:00.880
It will look like that.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.310
And the very next step, you
could imagine, will look

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.870
something like this, where
it's actually completely

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.420
budded out.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.850
It's popped out a little
of the membrane of the

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.070
Golgi body with it.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.010
So now the protein
is surrounded by

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.760
its own little membrane.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.590
So let's think about
what happened.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.260
We had DNA transcribed
into mRNA.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.980
mRNA goes to a ribosome
that's attached to

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.740
the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.740
It is translated into a protein
that travels through

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.320
the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.150
First, the rough, where
all the ribosomes

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.410
are, then this smooth.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.740
The smooth has other
functions.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:48.520
It also helps produce hormones
and other fatty compounds, but

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.850
I won't go into detail there.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:50.940
But it just travels.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.070
It connects to the
Golgi bodies.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.480
Then the Golgi bodies, the
proteins can bud off and take

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.340
a little bit of the
membrane with it.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.900
And this idea of something being
surrounded by a membrane

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.400
and just traveling in the cell,
so maybe the protein now

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.100
looks like this.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:06.930
I'm enlarging it.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.380
Maybe the protein is there and
then it took a little bit of

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.200
the Golgi body membrane
with it.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.780
This is called a vesicle.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.750
And this right here, let's add
another one right here.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.980
I'm just doing that
to label it.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.160
That's called a vesicle.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.110
And a vesicle is really just
a very general term for

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.280
anything, little small things,
mostly proteins, in the cell

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.430
that are just floating around,
that are surrounded by their

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.320
own little mini-membranes.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.780
And the reason why this
mini-membrane is useful is now

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.430
this protein can now
float to the outer

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.430
membrane of the cell.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.130
It can also float to other
parts of the cell.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.780
I'm doing a simplification.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.010
And then it can merge either
with the membrane of the cell,

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.950
or it can use this membrane,
this little vesicle membrane

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.240
it has, to facilitate it getting
out of the cell.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.810
You can imagine that it
eventually, you know this

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:00.430
thing-- let's say this is the
outer membrane of the cell.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.470
And I'm doing a gross
oversimplification.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.230
I'm not even drawing
the bilipid layer.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.580
But just to have a visual
impression of what it might

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.880
look like, that's the vesicle
there, the little protein

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.680
inside of it, and it gets
closer and closer to the

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.530
membrane, and then it can
merge with the membrane

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.300
because it's made up
of the same stuff.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.060
It merges with the membrane,
your protein inside.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.250
I switched colors arbitrarily.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.140
But now, all of a sudden, once
it merges with the membrane,

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.920
then the protein can exit the
actual cell, or maybe it can

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.210
actually embed itself within
this membrane, within the

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.200
outer cellular membrane, which
I drew very thin, but it has

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:39.960
two layers to it.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.970
And we'll talk more
about that.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.130
And I could probably make
a whole video on it.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.970
So those are-- we've already
made pretty good progress on

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.400
showing the anatomy
of the cell.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.360
There are a few other things
we can throw in there.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:58.860
There are things called
lysosomes, which exist in

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.840
animal cells that contain
enzymes in them that help

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.155
dissolve other things.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.050
So if a lysosome attaches to
something else and is able to

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.950
spew its enzymes into it,
it usually kills it.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.140
It usually digests it.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.100
So that's what a
lysosome does.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.310
In plants, you have things
called lytic vacuoles, and

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.600
those are really the same thing
as a lysosome in terms

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.280
of their function in that
they're really big vesicles.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.590
In fact, in general, a vacuole
is just a big vesicle.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:36.630
It's just a general term for a
big membrane-bound organelle.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.430
Vacuole.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.280
And once again, what's
an organelle?

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.000
Let me write down that word.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.730
Organelle.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.780
It's just a membrane-bound
subunit of a cell.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.430
Just like my liver is a subunit
of Sal and it's an

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.480
organ, an organelle is
a subunit of a cell.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.020
So a vacuole is just a general
term for a membrane-bound

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.290
organelle that stores stuff
inside of our cells.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.400
So a lytic vacuole would be a
vacuole in a plant cell that

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.440
stores a bunch of enzymes, and
if it were attached to

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.619
something else it would dissolve
it if it were able to

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:16.069
spew its enzymes into
the other thing.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.050
Now, there's several organelles
that we've talked

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.230
about within the context
of respiration and

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.619
photosynthesis, and I go into
detail in those videos.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:28.390
But we have things called
mitochondria.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.070
Mitochondrion cells.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.610
And they have inner and outer
membranes, and this is where

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:38.470
we produce our energy, where
sugars are turned into ATP.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.270
I've done detailed
videos on this.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.350
These actually contain their own
DNA, and they can actually

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:50.070
reproduce on their own, which
makes people believe that they

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.780
exist-- that their ancestors
once existed as independent

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.910
prokaryotic organisms, that at
some point they just kind of

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.715
stumbled upon the notion of,
hey, why don't I live inside

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:06.650
of other organisms and kind
of live in symbiosis?

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:11.020
So mitochondria, these are
organelles that at one time

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.140
their ancestors might have been
independent prokaryotes.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.400
Mitochondria.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.810
That's where cellular
respiration takes part, and we

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:23.750
go into detail on that.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.640
And then on the plant cells,
this is only in-- well,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.830
definitely not in animal cells--
you have chloroplasts,

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.900
which are a subset of things
called plastids, but

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.990
chloroplasts are the
most famous.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.130
Maybe I should do that in
especially green, green.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.320
So we have chloroplasts.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.980
And we know they have little
thylakoids in there.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.750
This is where photosynthesis
takes place.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.270
You have your grana
and all of that.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.840
And I do go into detail in the
photosynthesis videos, but

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.280
it's good to know.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.680
These are other organelles.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.950
And just like mitochondria, they
have their own DNA and

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.440
their own ribosomes.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.780
And so the belief is that they
were once independent

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:01.210
prokaryotes that learned to live
in symbiosis inside of

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:04.090
larger eukaryotic cells.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.360
So we're almost done, really,
with the structure cells.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.620
There's other things we
can throw on here.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.800
If we're dealing with plant
cells or non-animal cells,

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.080
we'll have something called a
cell wall, which will give

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.380
some strength to the
outer membrane.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.090
You can kind of view
it that way, or it

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.680
gives it some rigidity.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.480
So you have things called cell
walls, although they're not

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.430
necessarily completely rigid.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.460
You can almost view them as
balloons that provide just a

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.330
little bit more rigidity.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.530
Things like wood actually have
double cell walls for really

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.400
hard-core rigidity.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.160
So this is a cell wall.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.170
This is in non-animals.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:43.810
And in plants it's made out of
cellulose, not cellulite.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:44.710
That used to confuse me.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.840
So this gives extra rigidity
or form to

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.510
the cellular membrane.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.710
And then to actually give the
cell its actual structure, you

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.450
have these things called
microfilaments, or sometimes

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.890
actin filaments, and these are
these little pipes that go

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.170
throughout the cell.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.810
These actually help give the
cell its actual structure in

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.880
three dimensions, and actually,
they can participate

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.150
in things moving around within
the cell or even the cell

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.910
moving around itself.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.780
And just to be complete and
make sure we're covering

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.620
everything, if you watch the
mitosis and meiosis videos,

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.800
you have these things
called centrioles.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.940
I go into detail there.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.660
Centrioles that are right
outside of the nucleus.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.150
Two centrioles that are at right
angles to each other

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:32.080
make up a centrosome, and they
kind of coordinate the

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.870
microtubules when we start
splitting the cells in mitosis

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:37.760
and meiosis.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.710
I won't go into detail there.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.490
I've done many videos
on that as well.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.930
But so far, this is pretty much
everything you need to

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.860
know-- or at least a first
overview-- of the

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.070
structure of the cell.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.960
And in one video, we finally
got it all in one place.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.060
This is pretty much-- I haven't
delved into detail on

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.170
everything-- on all of the
major pieces of the cell.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.820
So hopefully, you have a better
big-picture view of how

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.560
things are organized
inside of it.
