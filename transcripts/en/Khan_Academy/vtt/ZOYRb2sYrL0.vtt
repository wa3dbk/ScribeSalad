00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.800
You will hear me use the word abstract a lot

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.621
so i thought i would actually give you an attempt at a definition,

00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:09.267
or maybe even more important

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:11.800
an intuition of what abstract means

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.067
and abstract can be an adjective

00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:16.267
you can have an abstract idea

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:19.267
you can have abstract art

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:20.600
or it can be a verb

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.200
you can abstract something

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.067
abstract the idea from some other idea

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:26.836
and you can even have it as a noun

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:28.467
you can have an abstract

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.252
and it tends to, if you use it as a noun

00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:31.572
the one I tend to associate

00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:34.200
is the abstract of research paper, which is kind of,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.133
distills the essence of the research paper,

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.733
which is kind of a summary of that paper

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.200
and the one thing you are going to see

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.400
regardless of how you

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.467
what context you use the word abstract

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:46.800
there's this kind of notion taking the essence

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.200
of a real world object

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.231
whether you use it as a noun, adjective, or a verb

00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:56.067
so over here we have our real world

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:58.379
we have our real world

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.410
and then over here you have your world of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.267
you have ideas and concepts

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:08.400
and the general idea behind the abstraction

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.733
or abstracting something

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.933
is that you're taking it away

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.467
from the particular concrete real world

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:17.867
and you're going more into the direction of ideas and concepts

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:22.267
and probably for me, one of the most tangible ways of

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:25.733
thinking about abstraction, which is kind of a contradiction in itself

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.400
to think of abstraction in a tangible way

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.713
is things like geometric shapes

00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:34.969
so if i were to tell you to find me some cubes

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.267
you might point to a borg vessel right over there

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:39.302
a borg vessel

00:01:39.302 --> 00:01:44.800
you might point to a pair of dice

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.867
let me draw a pair of dice

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.952
if you were looking for cubes

00:01:48.952 --> 00:01:51.733
so you might point to a pair of dice

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:53.933
that looks something like that

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.733
you might point to a Rubik's cube

00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:56.800
anything you might find

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.733
there might be a building that looks like a cube

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.733
it might be a building that looks like a cube

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:03.467
or maybe there is a box in your house that is a cube

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:07.667
but in your mind you have a general idea of what a cube is

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:09.733
like i know a cube when i see one

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:13.133
and a general idea is distilling the concept

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.600
the idea of what a cube is

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.000
and all of these ideas are very different

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.267
this is some plastic thing i could hold in my hand

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:20.733
these are these white things

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:23.200
they aren't even geometrically close to being perfect

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.400
they have these little divets on the side right over there

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.200
this is a large borg vessel that you know

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.067
that doesn't exist yet

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.733
is a fictional thing

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:35.400
that they all have this cubeness to them

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.800
one of the fun things about geometry

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.733
so really distill the essence of these real world shapes

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:44.800
and we do have this definition in geometry

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.918
which is an object like this

00:02:49.918 --> 00:02:52.700
where every side has the exact same length

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.108
so this is length one and that would be length one

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.815
that would be length one

00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:58.098
it doesn't have to be

00:02:58.113 --> 00:02:59.621
whatever the length of this side is

00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.800
and this dimension

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.200
then this dimension would be that length

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.133
and then that dimension is going to be that length

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:05.933
and i'm not giving you the rigorous definition

00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:08.267
but i'm just trying to highlight that there is

00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:12.200
pure idea of what a cube is

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.267
of what a cube is

00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:16.733
and the real world, there is nothing that is actually

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:18.533
a perfect cube

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:20.333
if you were to get really really close to the die

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.533
if you were to measure exactly their measurements

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:24.667
they won't be exactly the same measurement

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:32.267
but the abstract idea is completely the same length as this

00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:35.200
and this and this and all of the edges are going to

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.467
have the exact same length

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.015
so this is going from the concrete

00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:40.933
the specific from the real world

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:43.933
if you consider the 24th or the 25th century, the real world

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:49.205
to going to the idea behind it, the general idea

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:51.748
and you probably also heard the word abstract

00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:54.267
in terms of art, like abstract art

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.467
so this is abstract art

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:57.933
and it is the same general idea

00:03:57.933 --> 00:03:59.000
so if you to look it up in the dictionary

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
you're going to find 20 definitions of the word abstract

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.200
but it's all, essentially trying to say the same thing

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.467
abstract art is art that is not focused on trying to paint

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:11.667
reality the exact way reality exists

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:15.000
if you look at kind of lot of Renaissance art

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.998
they are skilled at painting figures

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:18.933
exactly how they look in the real world

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:20.333
but the abstract artist

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:22.060
sometimes they're not even trying

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.267
to represent anything from the real world

00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:26.800
they are trying to represent a raw idea or

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.000
a raw expression of color and form and texture

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.200
and this is a Jackson Pollock painting

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.533
right over here and i printed out so many things wrong

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:39.267
taken by our own Steven Zucker, our art historian

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:41.800
and you can see that it's not clear

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.000
Jackson Pollock is not trying to paint a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.856
you know, a dog or horse or anything like that

00:04:46.856 --> 00:04:49.333
he is painting something that is devoid

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.379
completely independent of anything

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.733
that we actually see in physical reality

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:58.133
and the word, abstraction, you know,

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:01.800
it doesn't just apply on just a pure geometry and art

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
it applies to almost everything we do on a daily basis

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.467
when we even talk about things

00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:08.815
when we even use words or use symbols

00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:10.867
we are essentially abstracting away

00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:16.471
we're abstracting the essence of something that actually exists in physical reality

00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:19.867
so if i use the word dog

00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:23.671
it is a set of symbols that represent something in our mind

00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:25.533
that we associate with dog

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.467
we have in our minds kind of the quality

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:29.533
of what a dog actually is

00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:31.667
you know, it has four legs

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:34.554
and floppy ears and you enjoy petting it

00:05:34.554 --> 00:05:37.458
and they're man's or i guess people's best friend

00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:39.708
you imagine this thing called a dog

00:05:39.708 --> 00:05:41.975
and it has the essence of dog

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:43.748
and when you actually look at dogs in the real world

00:05:43.748 --> 00:05:46.538
they look very very different type of animals

00:05:46.538 --> 00:05:48.152
like when you look at a great dane

00:05:48.152 --> 00:05:52.385
or kind of a super small poodle

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:55.429
But we recognize there is an essence of those particulars

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:58.231
that we can abstract away and say this is a dog

00:05:58.231 --> 00:06:00.871
and we abstract it even more by representing these letter symbols

00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:02.948
that tend to conjure up this image

00:06:02.948 --> 00:06:05.000
even when we write something as simple as a number

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.354
so if i write the number five

00:06:09.354 --> 00:06:11.533
we use it so frequently that to us

00:06:11.533 --> 00:06:14.292
a number 5 seems kind of like a concrete thing

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:15.687
but it 's so abstract

00:06:15.687 --> 00:06:17.487
it's just a quantity of things

00:06:17.487 --> 00:06:19.000
i can symbolize like that

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.968
i could have symbolized 5 like that

00:06:21.968 --> 00:06:24.887
i could have symbolized 5 in roman numerals like that

00:06:24.887 --> 00:06:26.800
i could symbolize it like that

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.667
and in all of these cases they are

00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:32.333
it is the idea of a quantity of five things

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:35.933
five, you know, you could say point me to a five

00:06:35.933 --> 00:06:38.400
and someone could draw or point you to something like that

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.477
but they are still pointing you to the symbol of five

00:06:41.477 --> 00:06:45.188
but it's still an very abstract idea

00:06:45.188 --> 00:06:47.267
so hopefully this gives you an appreciation

00:06:47.267 --> 00:06:48.831
for what abstract means

00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:50.200
as you can tell, you know

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.000
it's kind of a, for lack of a better word

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.400
it's kind of an abstract idea

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.108
not to be too cute about that
