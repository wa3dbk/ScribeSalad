00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.340
 

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.910
In the last video we saw that
if we had some line that was

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.050
defined as all of the scalar
multiples of some vector-- I'll

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.800
just write it like this.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.040
The scalar multiples,
obviously,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.370
are any real number.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.900
We defined a transformation, and
I didn't speak of it much

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.280
in terms of transformations, but
it was a transformation.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.220
We defined a projection
onto that line L as a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.500
transformation.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.870
In the video, we drew it as
transformations within R2, but

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.110
it could be, in general, a
transformation from Rn to Rn.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:44.210
We defined it as, the projection
of x onto L was

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.046
equal to the dot product of x,
with this defining vector.

00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:53.420
x dot this defining vector,
divided by that defining

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.670
vector dotted with itself.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.160
 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.280
All of that times the defining
vector of the line.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.050
This was our definition.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.319
A couple of things might have
popped out at you right when

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.490
we first saw this.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.830
When you dot a vector with
itself, what's that equal to?

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.960
We know that if I take some
vector, and I dot it with

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.100
itself, that is equivalent
to the length

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.480
of the vector squared.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.610
We can rewrite this as being
equal to x dot v, over the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.600
length of v squared, all
of that times v.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.920
Wouldn't it be nice if the
length of v was 1.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.870
The length of v was
equal to 1.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.460
If the length of v was 1, or
this is another way of saying

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.670
that, v is a unit vector.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.040
Our formula for our projection
would just

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.180
simplify to x dot v.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.980
All of that times, this will
just be some scalar number,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.180
that times v.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.660
You say, hey Sal, how do
we know if this is a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.360
unit vector or not.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.290
What you can realize is that
any-- Let me draw it this way.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.280
When I drew it in the previous
video, I just picked

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.720
a line, like that.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.540
The line can be really defined
to this vector v in the line.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.150
It can be any of the vectors
that's contained in the line.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.490
The vector v could
be like that.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.100
Let's say someone gives
you a vector v that

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.360
isn't a unit vector.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.050
Let's say that the length
of v is not equal to 1.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.660
How can you define a line
using sum unit vector.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.300
You can just normalize v.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.180
You can define sum unit
vector right here.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.920
You could define sum
vector right there.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.340
Let's call it u, and I'll
say it's a unit vector.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.700
That is equal to 1 over 1 over
the length of v times v.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.490
I showed you this in the
unit vector video.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.790
You can construct a unit vector
that goes in the same

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.190
direction as any vector,
essentially just by dividing,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.070
or I guess multiplying,
that vector

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.160
times 1 over its length.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.310
In general, we can always
redefine the line.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.150
All of the possible scalar
multiples of v are going to be

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.880
the same thing as all of the
scalar multiples of our unit

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.760
vector, u, which is just
a scalar multiple of v.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.860
We can redefine our line.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.410
If we redefine our line, L,
as being equal to all the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.360
possible scalar multiples of
our unit vector, where the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.150
scalars are any members
of the real numbers.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.930
Our projection definition
simplifies a good bit.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:51.270
The projection of x onto L
becomes x dot our unit vector,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.690
times the unit vector, times
the unit vector itself.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.890
That case that I did in the
previous video, where I had

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.280
those two vectors.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.860
Where I said the vector v that
defined the line, I think it

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.660
was vector 2, 1.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:16.720
Our vector x was
equal to 2, 3.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.810
If you want to do this
definition, we just have to

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.720
turn this guy into a
unit vector first.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.830
The way you turn him into a unit
vector, you figure out

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.680
the magnitude.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.060
In this case the magnitude
of v is equal to what.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.270
2 squared plus 1 squared is 1.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.080
You take the square
root of that.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.630
Let me just write.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.320
It's equal to square root of 2
squared plus 1 squared, which

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.370
is equal to the square
root of 5.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.700
You can define your u-- your
unit vector could just be 1

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.510
over this, times that guy.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.010
1 over the square root
of 5 times 2, 1.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.590
You could multiply
it out, or not.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.200
You could just leave
it in this form.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.320
You can always, for any vector
v, you can always find a unit

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.870
vector that goes in the same
direction, assuming that we're

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.870
dealing with non-zero vectors.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.060
You can always reduce anything
like this, to some other

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.180
definition, like this.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.560
Where this is a unit
vector version of

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.780
your vector v up there.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.890
I just said that,
look, this is a

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.760
transformation from Rn to Rn.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.180
The one thing that we're not
sure of, is this a linear

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.390
transformation.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.590
We can always write
it like this.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.780
Let's see if this is always
going to be a linear

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.560
transformation.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.876
There's two conditions for it to
be a linear transformation.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:41.260
 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.720
Let's see what happens if I take
the projection onto L of

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.040
two vectors.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.030
Let's say the vector a
plus the vector v.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.650
If I take the sum of
their vectors.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.960
If this is a linear
transformation, this should be

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.190
equivalent to taking each
of their projections

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.770
individually, and
then summing.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.050
Let's see if this is the case.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.950
This is equal to, by our
definition, we'll use the unit

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.060
vector version, because
it's simpler.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:14.410
This is equal to a plus b,
that's our x, dot u.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.260
And then, all of that times
our unit vector.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.880
We know that the dot product has
a distributive property,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:29.580
so that this is equal to
a dot u plus b dot u.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.260
These are unit vectors.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.510
All of that times
the vector u.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.990
These are just scalar numbers.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.930
So scalar multiplication has
distributive properties.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:44.120
This is equal to a dot u,
times our vector u.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.200
Remember, this is just going
to be some scalar.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.670
Plus b dot u times our
unit vector u.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.980
What is this equal to.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.070
This right here is equal
to the projection of a.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.300
This is equal to the projection
of a onto L, by

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.880
definition, right here.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.910
By this definition.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.280
If we assume that we're dealing
with the unit vector

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.060
definition for the line.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.820
This is equal to, this whole
thing right here, is equal to

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.710
plus the projection onto
L of the vector b.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.210
We see our first condition
for this being a linear

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.150
transformation holds.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.190
A projection of the sum of the
vectors is equal to the sum of

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.390
the projections of
the vectors.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.350
Our second condition is that
the projection of a scalar

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.330
multiple should be equal to
a scalar multiple of the

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.710
projection.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.150
Let me write that down.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.380
What is the projection onto L
of some scalar multiple of

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.420
some vector a.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:53.940
That is equal to ca dot
our unit vector u

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.060
times unit vector u.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.710
This one is a little bit
more straightforward.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.060
This is the scalar multiple.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.410
We see it in our dot product
properties, this is equal to c

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.600
times a dot u, times
the vector u.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.320
This is just equal to c times,
this right here, is a

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.000
projection of a onto L.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.320
 

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.970
We met both of our conditions
for linear transformations.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.020
We know that our projection
onto a line L in Rn is a

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.480
linear transformation.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.610
That tells us that we can
represent it as a matrix

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.860
transformation.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.770
 

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:41.220
We know that projection of x
onto L, we already know this

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.440
definition, it can
be rewritten.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.919
It doesn't hurt to rewrite it.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.550
As x dot some unit vector
that defines our line.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.130
Let me draw it with a little
hat to show that

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.680
it is a unit vector.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.910
Times the unit vector
itself, so that we

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.590
actually get a vector.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.800
How can I write this as
some matrix product.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.220
Some matrix vector product.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.730
I want to write it as
a product of some

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.130
matrix times x.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.440
 

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.230
To simplify things, since we're
actually dealing with a

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.920
matrix, let's limit ourselves
to the case of R2.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.010
I'm assuming that my projection
onto L is going to

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.360
be a mapping from R2 to R2.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.770
You could do what I'm
doing here with

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.630
an arbitrary dimension.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.850
If we're doing it in R2, then
our matrix A, right there, is

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.540
going to be a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.200
We've seen in multiple videos
that to figure out the matrix

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.310
A, we just take the identity
matrix that has the standard

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.360
basis vectors as columns.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.610
0, 1.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.460
Or 1, 0, and then 0, 1.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.680
And we apply the transformation
to each of

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.740
these columns.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.400
We could say that A is going
to be equal to-- its first

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.910
column is going to be equal to
the projection onto L of this

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.200
thing right here.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.850
We'll do it in this orange
color, right here.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.050
What is that going to be.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.300
That is going to
be this dot u.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.570
Let me write my u.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.540
My unit vector, let's just
assume that u can be rewritten

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.990
as my unit vector is equal
to sum u1 and u2.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.100
Just like that.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.170
I need to take this dot
my unit vector, let

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.620
me write this down.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.940
Let me write this on the side.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.560
The first thing I want to do
is figure out what the

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.830
projection-- the projection
onto L, let me

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.270
write it this way.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.680
We know the projection is just
equal to this dot this times

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.340
that vector.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.140
Let me write that.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.660
The vector 1, 0 dot
the unit vector u,

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.970
which is just u1, u2.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.980
We're going to have that
times my unit vector.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.770
I'll write it like this.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.930
Times the vector u1, u2.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.800
This is going to be my
first column in my

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.580
transformation matrix.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.190
My second column is going to be
the same thing, but I'm not

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.980
ready to take the projection
of this guy.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.880
The definition of our projection
is you dot this guy

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.460
with our unit vector.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.310
So we dot it.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:19.570
We're taking the dot
product of 0, 1.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:26.190
0, 1 dot my unit vector
dot u1, u2.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.000
I'm going to multiply
that times my unit

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.830
vector, times u1, u2.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.670
This seems very complicated, but
it should simplify when we

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.810
actually try to work out our
transformation matrix.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.520
Let's do it.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.570
When I dot these two guys,
what do I get.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.580
Let me write it here.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:50.830
My matrix A will become 1 times
u1, plus 0 times u2.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.720
That's just u1.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.190
This whole thing just simplifies
to u1, when I take

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.350
the dot product of
these two things.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.050
Times u1, u2.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.210
That's going to be
my first column.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.890
My second column, if I dot these
two guys, I get 0 times

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.680
u1 plus 1 times u2.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:16.240
So I'm going to get u2 times
my unit vector, u1, u2.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.790
If I multiply that out, this
will be equal to what.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.540
I can just write them
as columns. u1

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.060
times u1 is u1 squared.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.860
u1 times u2 is u1, u2.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.680
u2 times u1 is u2 times u1.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.560
Then, u2 times u2
is u2 squared.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.110
You give me any unit vector
and I will give you the

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.920
transformation that gives you
any projection of some other

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.430
vector onto the line
defined by that.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.670
That was a very long
way of saying that.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.030
Let's go back to what
I did before.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.880
 

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.140
Let's say we want to find any
projection onto the line, onto

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.540
the vector, I'll draw it here.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.580
We'll do the same example that
we did in the last video.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.710
If I have some vector v
that looks like that.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:13.200
We said the vector v was equal
to the vector 2, 1.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.680
That was my vector v.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.930
How can we find sum
transformation for the

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.880
projection onto the
line defined by v?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.940
Onto this line right here.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.530
The line defined by v.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:29.070
What we can first do is convert
v into a unit vector.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.360
We can convert v into
a unit vector that

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.840
goes in the same direction.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.530
Some unit vector u.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.320
We did that already up here.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.290
Where we essentially just
divided [? bv ?]

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.210
by it's length.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.840
Let's take v and divide
by it's length.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.830
The unit vector is this, 1
over the square root of 5

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.800
times our vector v.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.090
It was 1 over the square
root of 5 times our

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.960
vector v, right there.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.820
You start with a unit
vector there.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.610
You just create this matrix,
and then we will have our

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.470
transformation matrix.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.660
If this is our u, what will
our matrix be equal to.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.220
This is u.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:14.270
Then our matrix would be
equal to u1 squared.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.220
What is u1 squared.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:20.190
Let me rewrite our u a little
bit, not at angles.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.060
Our vector u, our unit vector
that defines this line, is

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.020
equal to the vector 2 over the
square root of 5 and 1 over

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.910
the square root of 5.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.730
I just multiplied
out this scalar.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.870
If we want to construct this
matrix, we get A is equal to

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.870
u1 squared.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.550
What is this squared?

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.300
It becomes 2 squared 4 over the
square root of 5 squared,

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.700
which is just 5.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.640
Equals 4 over 5.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.280
What is u1 times u2?

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.780
2 times 1 over square root of
5 times square root of 5.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.590
So, 2/5.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.970
I just multiplied these two.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.990
What is u2 times u1.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.600
Same thing.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.570
Order doesn't matter
when you multiply.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.760
This will also be 2/5.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.780
What is u2 squared.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.270
1 squared over the square root
of 5 squared is just 1/5.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.170
 

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.040
Now we can say-- and that's the
neat thing about creating

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.010
these matrices, that the
projection-- Let's say we have

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.230
some, let's say this is the
origin right here, we have

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.540
some other vector
x, right here.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.220
We can now define our
transformation.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:31.970
The projection onto L where
L is equal to any scalar

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.190
multiple of our unit vector u.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.070
It's right here.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.030
Is a member of the reals.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.260
That is our line L.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.770
The projection onto L
of any vector x is

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.260
equal to this matrix.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:54.070
Is equal to the matrix 4, 5,
2/5, 2/5, 1/5 times x.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.530
Which is a pretty neat result,
at least for me.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.630
We once again reduced everything
to just a matrix

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.760
multiplication.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.400
You take this x and you multiply
it by this matrix,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.470
you're going to get its
projection onto

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.790
the L, onto the line.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:13.095
If you take this vector, let's
say a, and you multiply it

00:16:13.095 --> 00:16:15.190
times this matrix right there,
you're going to get its

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.480
projection.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.420
Its projection onto the line.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.320
If you could take this vector--
No, it should go

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.010
through the origin.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.240
I want to draw it in
standard position.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.660
If you take this vector, right
there, and multiply it times

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.300
this matrix, you're going to get
this vector, right here,

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.750
that is contained in the line.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.890
When you subtract it from
this, it's orthogonal.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:35.640
We know the definition.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.330
It's kind of the shadow
of that vector.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.220
Anyway, I think this
is pretty neat.
