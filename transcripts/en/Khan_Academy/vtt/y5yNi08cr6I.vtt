00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.360
We're asked which of these
lines are parallel.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.000
So they give us three equations
of three different

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.270
lines and if they're parallel,
then they have to have the

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.975
same slope.

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:11.570
So all we have to do over here
is figure out the slopes of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.830
each of these lines, and
if any of them are

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.060
equal, they're parallel.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.970
So let's do line A.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.870
Line A, it's 2y is equal
to 12x plus 10.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.010
We're almost in slope-intercept
form, we can

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.210
just divide both sides of
this equation by 2.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.420
We get y is equal to 6x--
right, 12 divided by

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.330
2 -- 6x plus 5.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.860
So our slope in this case, we
have it in slope-intercept

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.710
form, our slope in this
case is equal to 6.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.570
Let's try line B.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.810
Line B is y is equal to six.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.670
You might say this hey, this is
a bizarre character, how do

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.920
I get this into slope-intercept

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.790
form, where's the x?

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.680
And my answer to you is
that it already is in

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.640
slope-intercept form.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.670
I could just rewrite it as
y is equal to 0x plus 6.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.170
The x term is being multiplied
by 0 because the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.150
slope here is 0.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.130
y is going to be equal
to six no matter how

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.280
much you change x.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.690
Change in y is always
going to be 0, it's

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.880
always going to be 6.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.030
So here, our slope is 0, so
these two lines are definitely

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.060
not parallel, they have
different slopes.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.690
So let's try line C.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.030
Line C-- I'll do it down here.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.780
Line C, so it's y minus 2 is
equal to 6 times x plus 2.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.120
And this is actually in
point-slope form, where the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.410
point x is equal to negative
2, y is equal to 2.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.910
So the point negative 2, 2, is
being represented here because

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.870
you're subtracting the points.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.590
And the slope is 6, so we
already know that the slope is

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.340
equal to 6.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.340
And sometimes people are
more comfortable with

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.110
slope-intercept form, so let's
put it in slope-intercept form

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.006
just to confirm that if we put
it in this form, the slope

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:07.240
will still be equal to 6.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.320
So if we distribute the 6, we
get y minus 2 is equal to 6

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.690
times x, 6x, plus
6 times 2 is 12.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.870
And if you add this 2 -- if you
add 2 to both sides of the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.410
equation, you get y-- because
these guys cancel out-- is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.330
equal to 6x plus 14.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.710
So you see, once again,
the slope is 6.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.700
So line A and line C have the
same the slope, so line A and

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.100
line C are parallel.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.210
And they're different lines.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.460
If they had the same
y-intercept, then they would

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.490
just be the same line.
