00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.050
We're asked to determine the
solution set of this system,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.700
and we actually have three
inequalities right here.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.470
A good place to start is just to
graph the solution sets for

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.390
each of these inequalities and
then see where they overlap.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.250
And that's the region of the
x, y coordinate plane that

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.850
will satisfy all of them.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.450
So let's first graph y is equal
to 2x plus 1, and that

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.850
includes this line, and then
it's all the points greater

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.990
than that as well.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.820
So the y-intercept
right here is 1.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.259
If x is 0, y is 1, and
the slope is 2.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.400
If we move forward in the
x-direction 1, we move up 2.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.830
If we move forward 2, we'll
move up 4, just like that.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.920
So this graph is going to look
something like this.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.970
Let me graph a couple more
points here just so that I

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.460
make sure that I'm drawing
it reasonably accurately.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.180
So it would look something
like this.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.380
That's the graph of y is
equal to 2x plus 1.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.200
Now, for y is greater than or
equal, or if it's equal or

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.879
greater than, so we have to put
all the region above this.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.490
For any x, 2x plus 1 will be
right on the line, but all the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.760
y's greater than that
are also valid.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.240
So the solution set of that
first equation is all of this

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.510
area up here, all of the area
above the line, including the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.650
line, because it's greater
than or equal to.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.900
So that's the first inequality
right there.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.790
Now let's do the second
inequality.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.170
The second inequality is y
is less than 2x minus 5.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.360
So if we were to graph 2x minus
5, and something already

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.280
might jump out at you
that these two are

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.150
parallel to each other.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.340
They have the same slope.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.020
So 2x minus 5, the y-intercept
is negative 5. x is 0, y is

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.830
negative 1, negative 2, negative
3, negative 4,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.950
negative 5.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.710
Slope is 2 again.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.880
And this is only less than,
strictly less than, so we're

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.360
not going to actually
include the line.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.240
The slope is 2, so it will
look something like that.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.250
It has the exact same slope
as this other line.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.730
So I could draw a bit of a
dotted line here if you like,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.120
and we're not going to include
the dotted line because we're

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.270
strictly less than.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.420
So the solution set for this
second inequality is going to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.130
be all of the area
below the line.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.670
For any x, this is 2x minus 5,
and we care about the y's that

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.230
are less than that.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.100
So let me shade that in.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.850
So before we even get to this
last inequality, in order for

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.610
there to be something that
satisfies both of these

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.300
inequalities, it has to be in
both of their solution sets.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.040
But as you can see, their
solutions sets are completely

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.640
non-overlapping.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.850
There's no point on the x, y
plane that is in both of these

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.400
solution sets.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.090
They're separated by this kind
of no-man's land between these

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.600
two parallel lines.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.710
So there is actually
no solution set.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.720
It's actually the null set.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.920
There's the empty set.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.430
Maybe we could put an empty set
like that, two brackets

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.450
with nothing in it.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.670
There's no solution set
or the solution set of

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.290
the system is empty.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.290
We could do the x is
greater than 1.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.955
This is x is equal to 1, so
we put a dotted line there

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:06.930
because we don't want
include that.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.070
So it would be all
of this stuff.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.390
But once again, there's nothing
that satisfies all

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.210
three of these.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.630
This area right here satisfies
the bottom two.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.790
This area up here satisfies
the last one

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.500
and the first one.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.780
But there's nothing that
satisfies both these top two.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.490
Empty set.
