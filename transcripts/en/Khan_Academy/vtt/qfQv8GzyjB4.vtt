00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.430
What number sets does
the number 3.4028

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.330
repeating belong to?

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.150
And before even answering the
question, let's just think

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.690
about what this represents.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.000
And especially what this
line on top means.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.770
So this line on top means
that the 28 just

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.420
keep repeating forever.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:25.090
So I could express this number
as 3.4028, but the 28 just

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.110
keep repeating.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.740
Just keep repeating on and
on and on forever.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.299
I could just keep writing
them forever and ever.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.210
And obviously, it's just easier
to write this line over

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.620
the 28 to say that it
repeats forever.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.290
Now let's think about what
number sets it belongs to.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.600
Well, the broadest number set
we've dealt with so far is the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.330
real numbers.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.420
And this definitely belongs
to the real numbers.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.300
The real numbers is essentially
the entire number

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.990
line that we're used to using.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.660
And 3.4028 repeating sits
someplace over here.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.340
If this is negative 1, this
is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.730
3.4028 is a little bit more
than 3.4, a little

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.490
bit less than 3.41.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.760
It would sit right over there.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.450
So it definitely sits
on the number line.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.090
It's a real number.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.870
So it definitely is real.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.370
It definitely is
a real number.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.080
But the not so obvious question
is whether it is a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.180
rational number.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.040
Remember, a rational number is
one that can be expressed as a

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.890
rational expression
or as a fraction.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.390
If I were to tell you that p is
rational, that means that p

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.840
can be expressed as the
ratio of two integers.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.620
That means that p can be
expressed as the ratio of two

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.900
integers, m/n.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.960
So the question is, can I
express this as the ratio of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.410
two integers?

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.410
Or another way to think
of it, can I

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.990
express this as a fraction?

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.510
And to do that, let's actually
express it as a fraction.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.310
Let's define x as being
equal to this number.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.960
So x is equal to 3.4028
repeating.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.650
Let's think about
what 10,000x is.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.470
And the only reason why I want
10,000x is because I want to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.960
move the decimal point all the
way to the right over here.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.710
So 10,000x.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.380
What is that going
to be equal to?

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.350
Well every time you multiply
by a power of 10, you shift

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.420
the decimal one to the right.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.790
10,000 is 10 to the
fourth power.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.780
So it's like shifting
the decimal over to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.830
the right four spaces.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.400
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.575
So it'll be 34,028.

00:02:40.575 --> 00:02:42.700
But these 28's just
keep repeating.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.820
So you'll still have the 28's
go on and on, and on and on,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.720
and on after that.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.550
They just all got shifted to the
left of the decimal point

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.430
by five spaces.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.070
You can view it that way.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.140
That makes sense.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.670
It's nearly 3 and 1/2.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.810
If you multiply by 10,000,
you get almost 35,000.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.490
So that's 10,000x.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.970
Now, let's also think
about 100x.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.340
And my whole exercise here is
I want to get two numbers

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.590
that, when I subtract them and
they're in terms of x, the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.130
repeating part disappears.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.970
And then we can just treat them
as traditional numbers.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.260
So let's think about
what 100x is.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.530
100x.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.010
That moves this decimal point.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.370
Remember, the decimal point
was here originally.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.860
It moves it over to the
right two spaces.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.830
So 100x would be 300-- Let
me write it like this.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.750
It would be 340.28 repeating.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.220
We could have put the 28
repeating here, but it

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.010
wouldn't have made
as much sense.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.670
You always want to write it
after the decimal point.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.340
So we have to write 28 again to
show that it is repeating.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.710
Now something interesting
is going on.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.400
These two numbers, they're
just multiples of x.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.790
And if I subtract the bottom one
from the top one, what's

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.710
going to happen?

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.530
Well the repeating part
is going to disappear.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.170
So let's do that.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.280
Let's do that on both sides
of this equation.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.230
Let's do it.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.210
So on the left-hand side of this
equation, 10,000x minus

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.620
100x is going to be 9,900x.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.960
And on the right-hand side,
let's see-- The decimal part

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.230
will cancel out.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.030
And we just have to figure out
what 34,028 minus 340 is.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.120
So let's just figure this out.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.010
8 is larger than 0, so we
won't have to do any

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.649
regrouping there.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:19.769
2 is less than 4.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.200
So we will have to do some
regrouping, but we can't

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.510
borrow yet because we
have a 0 over there.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.710
And 0 is less than 3, so we
have to do some regrouping

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.000
there or some borrowing.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.770
So let's borrow from
the 4 first.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.590
So if we borrow from the 4, this
becomes a 3 and then this

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.140
becomes a 10.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.460
And then the 2 can now
borrow from the 10.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.090
This becomes a 9 and
this becomes a 12.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.820
And now we can do
the subtraction.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.390
8 minus 0 is 8.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.110
12 minus 4 is 8.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.880
9 minus 3 is 6.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.920
3 minus nothing is 3.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.950
3 minus nothing is 3.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:05.320
So 9,900x is equal to 33,688.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.180
We just subtracted 340
from this up here.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.110
So we get 33,688.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.710
Now, if we want to solve
for x, we just divide

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.610
both sides by 9,900.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.990
Divide the left by 9,900.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.900
Divide the right by 9,900.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.000
And then, what are
we left with?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.850
We're left with x is equal
to 33,688 over 9,900.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.550
Now what's the big
deal about this?

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.900
Well, x was this number. x was
this number that we started

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.580
off with, this number that
just kept on repeating.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.500
And by doing a little bit of
algebraic manipulation and

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.660
subtracting one multiple of it
from another, we're able to

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.530
express that same exact
x as a fraction.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.780
Now this isn't in simplest
terms. I mean they're both

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.900
definitely divisible by 2
and it looks like by 4.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.960
So you could put this in lowest
common form, but we

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.910
don't care about that.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.055
All we care about is the fact
that we were able to represent

00:06:05.055 --> 00:06:09.050
x, we were able to represent
this number, as a fraction.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.620
As the ratio of two integers.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.720
So the number is
also rational.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.550
It is also rational.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.010
And this technique we
did, it doesn't only

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.700
apply to this number.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.370
Any time you have a number that
has repeating digits, you

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.000
could do this.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.530
So in general, repeating
digits are rational.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.090
The ones that are irrational are
the ones that never, ever,

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.860
ever repeat, like pi.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.590
And so the other things, I think
it's pretty obvious,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.810
this isn't an integer.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.410
The integers are the
whole numbers that

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.020
we're dealing with.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.390
So this is someplace in
between the integers.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.360
It's not a natural number or a
whole number, which depending

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.240
on the context are viewed
as subsets of integers.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.360
So it's definitely
none of those.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.110
So it is real and
it is rational.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.460
That's all we can
say about it.
