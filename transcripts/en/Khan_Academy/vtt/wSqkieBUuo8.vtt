00:00:00.661 --> 00:00:05.597
Contango can be one of the more difficult to comprehend ideas

00:00:05.597 --> 00:00:08.339
when we talk about futures markets, but it's really because

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.876
it's used in different contexts all the time,

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:12.910
with slightly different meanings depending upon

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.397
whether you're talking about someone participating in a futures market

00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:18.743
or whether an academic is talking about it,

00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:21.160
but first let me give you the proper definition.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.979
So the proper definition of contango, it's actually a theory

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:29.572
and it really can't be observed.

00:00:29.572 --> 00:00:35.404
And Contango Theory says that people are willing to pay more

00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:39.167
to buy some commodity in the future

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:42.350
than the actually expected price of that commodity

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.800
so, when we talk about expected price, this is a very theoretical thing

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.515
if you were to go and survey everyone participating

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:50.915
in the futures market and say,

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:55.242
"What price do you think silver will be in 8 months?"

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:57.505
And if they all, you know, you took your survey,

00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:02.263
and they all told you the 100% answer, you could get this theoretical expected price

00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:06.334
and maybe that theoretical expected price is $33

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:12.344
so this right here is the expected price of silver in the market

00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:14.999
and you could see from this futures curve right here

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:20.731
that delivery, the silver futures contract for delivery

00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:22.840
(expected)

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.839
for delivery 8 months from now is trading above that

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:28.261
it's trading above the expected price,

00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:31.475
and it's probably trading above the expected price

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:35.047
because people don't want to, people who what to have silver in 8 months

00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:40.099
they don't want to buy it today and have to go rent some space and have to store the silver

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.332
and have to insure the silver, and worry about someone

00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:44.248
maybe stealing the silver, they'd rather

00:01:44.248 --> 00:01:48.039
just pay for a premium in order for it, to have it be delivered

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.105
in the future. So this is kind of the correct academic description of Contango Theory

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:58.198
The theory that the futures price, on a future delivery date,

00:01:58.198 --> 00:02:01.364
is going to be higher than what the market actually expects

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:04.456
so people to some degree are paying a premium

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:10.658
to have the delivery of the silver, to have it delayed.

00:02:10.658 --> 00:02:13.365
Now, in practice, you will hear people say that a market

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:17.466
is "in contango," and usually what they are talking about

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:19.352
they're usually talking about one of two things,

00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:23.260
and they're related, but usually if they're a little bit more correct about it

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.888
they're talking about the idea that the futures price.

00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:33.300
is, over time, going to converge downward to the actual spot price

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.949
So what I've done here, so this is the futures curve,

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.635
so this is just the price, the delivery price of the different contracts

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:41.893
going forward in time. But this is the delivery price,

00:02:41.893 --> 00:02:47.262
the market delivery price today, right now. This is how things trend over time

00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:51.313
so in magenta, I have the spot price trending over time

00:02:51.313 --> 00:02:55.069
right over there. And then you can see that you have the 4 month

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.594
the contract that's for delivery in 4 months, today

00:02:58.594 --> 00:03:03.665
it's price is a little bit under $35, but as you approach it's actual delivery date

00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.652
so now we're actually moving forward in time

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.619
it has to converge to the spot price,

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.148
otherwise people could make free money on that day.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:12.235
And so the delivery date 8 months out,

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:15.062
has to converge to the spot price eventually,

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:18.338
and so what you see is, is because the spot price

00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:22.784
hasn't moved up a lot, and you see this downward converging of the different

00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:26.319
futures price, this is what people normally refer to

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.892
when they say a market is in contango,

00:03:29.892 --> 00:03:33.207
when you see the delivery price of a certain futures contract

00:03:33.207 --> 00:03:37.354
converge downward to the actual spot price

00:03:37.354 --> 00:03:39.728
so all of these are converging downward over time

00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:41.751
so it's something that you would have to observe over time

00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:45.285
not something that you would traditionally just be able to look at a futures curve

00:03:45.285 --> 00:03:47.642
but in general when you have this,

00:03:47.642 --> 00:03:50.769
you normally see that the futures delivery prices are

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.056
higher the further out you go, so you have this upward

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:55.655
sloping futures curve.

00:03:55.655 --> 00:03:59.208
So the simplest kind of analysis when people say something is "in contango,"

00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:01.239
they'll just look at an upward sloping futures curve

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.720
or a normal curve

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.180
and then say "this is also in contango"

00:04:05.180 --> 99:59:59.999
but this isn't exactly right, it's really this movement over time.
