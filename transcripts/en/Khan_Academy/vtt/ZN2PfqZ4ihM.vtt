00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.280
Let's now do another triple
integral, and in this one I

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.300
won't actually evaluate
the triple integral.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.860
But what we'll do is we'll
define the triple integral.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.310
We're going to something
similar that we did in the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.500
second video where we
figured out the mass

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.670
using a density function.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.380
But what I want to do in this
video is show you how to set

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.010
the boundaries when the
figure is a little

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.010
bit more complicated.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.350
And if we have time we'll try
to do it where we change

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.470
the order of integration.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.090
So let's say I have the surface
-- let me just make something

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:39.340
up -- 2x plus 3z plus
y is equal to 6.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.516
Let's draw that surface.

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:43.070
It looks something like this.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.720
This will be my x-axis.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.580
This is going to be my z-axis.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.860
This is going to be my y-axis.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.694
Draw them out.

00:00:56.694 --> 00:00:59.990
x, y and z.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.600
And I care about the surface in
the kind of positive octant,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.970
right, because when you're
dealing with three-dimensionals

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.840
we have, instead of four
quadrants we have

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.380
eight octants.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.280
But we want the octant where
all x, y and z is positive,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.780
which is the one I drew here.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.740
So let's see, let me draw some
-- what is the x-intercept?

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.440
When y and z are 0,
so we'll write here,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.860
that's the x-intercept.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.880
2x is equal to 6, so
x is equal to 3.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.070
So 1, 2, 3.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.910
So that's the x-intercept.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.880
The y-intercept when x and
z are 0 are on the y-axis,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.470
so y will be equal to 6.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:41.000
so we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 is the y-intercept.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.160
Then finally the z-intercept
when x and y are 0

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.140
we're on the z-axis.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.620
3z will be equal to 6.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.240
So z is equal to 1, 2.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.880
So the figure that I care about
will look something like

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.730
this -- it's be this
inclined surface.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.150
It will look
something like that.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.740
In this positive octant.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.070
So this is the surface
defined by this function.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.545
Let's say that I care about
the volume, and I'm going

00:02:13.545 --> 00:02:15.540
to make it a little
bit more complicated.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.320
We could say oh, well this
was a volume between the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.170
surface and the xy plane.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.710
But I'm going to make it a
little bit more complicated.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.440
Let's say the volume above
this surface, and the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.530
surface z is equal to 2.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.830
So the volume we care
about is going to look

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.690
something like this.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.345
Let me see if I can
pull off drawing this.

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:46.130
If we go up 2 here -- let me
draw the top in a different

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.430
color, let me draw
the top in green.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.530
So this is along the zy plane.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.270
And then the other
edge is going to look

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.636
something like this.

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:02.110
Let me make sure I can draw it
-- this is the hardest part.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.350
We'll go up 2 here, and this
is along the zx plane.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.930
And we'd have another line
connecting these two.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.150
So this green triangle,
this is part of the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.180
plane z is equal to 2.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.450
The volume we care about is the
volume between this top green

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.540
plane and this tilted plane
defined by 2x plus 3z

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.100
plus y is equal to 6.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.530
So this area in between.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.780
Let me see if I can make
it a little bit clearer.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.750
Because the visualization, as I
say, is often the hardest part.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.590
So we'd have kind of a front
wall here, and then the back

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.660
wall would be this wall back
here, and then there'd

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.020
be another wall here.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.250
And then the base of it, the
base I'll do in magenta

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.330
will be this plane.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.140
So the base is that plane
-- that's the bottom part.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.190
Anyway, I don't know if I
should have made it that messy

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.120
because we're going to have to
draw dv's and d volumes on it.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.830
But anyway, let's try our best.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.130
So, if we're going to figure
out the volume -- and actually,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.230
since we're doing a triple
integral and we want to show

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.630
that we have to do the triple
integral, instead of doing a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.730
volume, let's do the mass of
something of variable density.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.700
So let's say the density in
this volume that we care about,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.240
the density function is a
function of x, y and z.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.220
It can be anything.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.770
That's not the point of what
I'm trying to teach here.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.860
But I'll just define something.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.820
Let's say it's x squared yz.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.080
Our focus is really just
to set up the integrals.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.130
So the first thing I like to do
is I visualize -- what we're

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.080
going to do is we're going to
set up a little cube in the

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.410
volume under consideration.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.750
So if I had a -- let me do it
in a bold color so that you can

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.565
see it -- so if I have a cube
-- maybe I'll do it in brown,

00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:53.400
it's not as bold but it's
different enough from

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.590
the other colors.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.810
So if I had a little cube
here in the volume under

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.480
consideration, that's a little
cube -- you consider that dv.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.840
The volume of that cube is kind
of a volume differential.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.470
And that is equal to dx --
no, sorry, this is dy.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.760
Let me do this in yellow,
or green even better.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.820
So dy, which is this.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.370
dy times dx, dx times dz.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.420
That's the volume of
that little cube.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.520
And if we wanted to know the
mass of that cube, we would

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.650
multiply the density function
at that point times this dv.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.810
So the mass, you could call
it d -- I don't know, dm.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.270
The mass differential is going
to be equal to that times that.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.230
So x squared y z times this.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.610
dy, dx, and dz.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.850
And we normally switch this
order around, depending on what

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.650
we're going to integrate with
respect to first so we

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.910
don't get confused.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.210
So let's try to do this.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.430
Let's try to set
up this integral.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.900
So let's do it traditionally.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.250
The last couple of triple
integrals we did we integrated

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.770
with respect to z first.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.580
So let's do that.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.155
So we're going to integrate
with respect to z first. so

00:06:07.155 --> 00:06:11.750
we're going to take this cube
and we're going to sum up all

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.280
of the cubes in the z-axis.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.130
So going up and
down first, right?

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.500
So if we do that, what
is the bottom boundary?

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.890
So when you sum up up and down,
these cubes are going to

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.460
turn to columns, right?

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.620
So what is the bottom of the
column, the bottom bound?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.700
What's the surface?

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.970
It's the surface
defined right here.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.740
So, if we want that bottom
bound defined in terms of

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.800
z, we just have to solve
this in terms of z.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.880
So let's subtract.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.950
So what do we get.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.210
If we want this defined in
terms of z, we get 3z is

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.160
equal to 6 minus 2x minus y.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.900
Or z is equal 2 minus
2/3x minus y over 3.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.380
This is the same thing as that.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.385
But when we're talking about
z, explicitly defining a

00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:05.070
z, this is how we get it,
algebraically manipulated.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.740
So the bottom boundary -- and
you can visualize it, right?

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.670
The bottom of these columns
are going to go up and down.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.490
We're going to add up all
the columns in up and

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.200
down direction, right?

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.680
You can imagine summing them.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.020
The bottom boundary is
going to be this surface.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:25.860
z is equal to 2 minus
2/3x minus y over 3.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.840
And then what's
the upper bound?

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.440
Well, the top of the column
is going to be this green

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.610
plane, and what did we
say the green plane was?

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.110
It was z is equal to 2.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.890
That's this plane, this
surface right here.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.970
Z is equal to 2.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.690
And, of course, what is the
volume of that column?

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:49.500
Well, it's going to be the
density function, x squared yz

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.820
times the volume differential,
but we're integrating

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.005
with respect to z first.

00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:57.020
Let me write dz there.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.950
I don't know, let's say we want
to integrate with respect to --

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.450
I don't know, we want to
integrate with respect

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.540
to x for next.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.030
In the last couple of
videos, I integrated

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:05.930
with respect to y next.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.880
So let's do x just to show you
it really doesn't matter.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.650
So we're going to integrate
with respect to x.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.760
So, now we have these
columns, right?

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.920
When we integrate with respect
to z, we get the volume of each

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.060
of these columns wher the
top boundary is that plane.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.220
Let's see if I can
draw it decently.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.570
The top boundary is that plane.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.810
The bottom boundary
is this surface.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.560
Now we want to integrate
with respect to x.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.720
So we're going to add
up all of the dx's.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.620
So what is the bottom
boundary for the x's?

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.620
Well, this surface is defined
all the way to -- the volume

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.590
under question is defined all
the way until x is equal to 0.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.110
And if you get confused, and
it's not that difficult to get

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.260
confused when you're imagining
these three-dimensional things,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.910
say you know what, we already
integrated with respect to z.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.530
The two variables I
have left are x and y.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.530
Let me draw the projection of
our volume onto the xy plane,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.300
and what does that look like?

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.350
So I will do that.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.900
Because that actually does
help simplify things.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.550
So if we twist it, if we take
this y and flip it out like

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.570
that, and x like that we'll get
in kind of the traditional way

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.664
that we learned when we
first learned algebra.

00:09:14.664 --> 00:09:15.600
The xy-axis.

00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:21.900
So this is x, this is y.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.510
And this point is what?

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.300
Or this point?

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:25.660
What is that?

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.060
That's x is equal to 3.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.710
So it's 1, 2, 3.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:31.600
That's x is equal to 3.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.930
And this point right here
is y is equal to 6.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:39.200
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.900
So on the xy-axis, kind of the
domain -- you can view it that

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.360
-- looks something like that.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.540
So one way to think about it is
we've figured out if these

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.000
columns -- we've integrated
up/down or along the z-axis.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.790
But when you view it looking
straight down onto it, you're

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.350
looking on the xy plane, each
of our columns are going to

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:06.100
look like this where the
column's going to pop out out

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.320
of your screen in
the z direction.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.760
But the base of each column is
going to dx like that, and

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.040
then dy up and down, right?

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.800
So we decided to integrate
with respect to x next.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.520
So we're going to add up each
of those columns in the

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.860
x direction, in the
horizontal direction.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.140
So the question was what
is the bottom boundary?

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.880
What is the lower bound
in the x direction?

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.680
Well, it's x is equal to 0.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.400
If there was a line here, then
it would be that line probably

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.740
as a function of y, or
definitely as a function of y.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.800
So our bottom bound here
is x is equal to 0.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.620
What's our top bound?

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.340
I realize I'm already pushing.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.490
Well, our top bound is this
relation, but it has to

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.100
be in terms of x, right?

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:46.980
So what is this relation.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.230
So, you could view it as kind
of saying well, if z is equal

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.840
to 0, what is this line?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.770
What is this line right here?

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:53.910
So z is equal to 0.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.390
We have 2x plus y
is equal to 6.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.590
We want the relationship
in terms of x.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:04.130
So we get 2x is equal to 6
minus y where x is equal

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.220
to 3 minus y over 2.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.500
And then finally we're going to
integrate with respect to y.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.130
And this is the easy part.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.530
So we've integrated up and
down to get a column.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.150
These are the bases of the
column, so we've integrated

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.000
in the x direction.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.480
Now we just have to go up and
down with respect to y, or in

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.350
the xy plane with respect to y.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.970
So what is the y
bottom boundary?

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.060
Well, it's 0.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.650
y is equal to 0.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.660
And the top boundary
is y is equal to 6.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.540
And there you have it.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.730
We have set up the integral
and now it's just a matter

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.590
of chugging through
it mechanically.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.120
But I've run out of time
and I don't want this

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.660
video to get rejected.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.870
So I'll leave you there.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.760
See you in the next video.
