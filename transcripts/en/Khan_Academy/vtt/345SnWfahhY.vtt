00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:01.538
- So I have here

00:00:01.538 --> 00:00:03.314
a very complicated function.

00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:05.149
It's got a two-dimensional input,

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:07.212
two different coordinates to its input,

00:00:07.212 --> 00:00:09.809
and then a three-dimensional output.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.827
Specifically, it's a
three-dimensional vector,

00:00:11.827 --> 00:00:13.804
and each one of these is some expression,

00:00:13.804 --> 00:00:15.957
its a bunch of cosines and sines

00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:18.171
that depends on the two input coordinates.

00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:20.325
And in the last video, we talked about how

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:22.668
to visualize functions
that have a single input,

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:24.553
a single parameter

00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:25.386
like T,

00:00:25.386 --> 00:00:28.752
and then, a two-dimensional vector output.

00:00:28.752 --> 00:00:30.214
So some kind of expression of T

00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:31.735
and another expression of T.

00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:34.658
And this is sort of the
three-dimensional analog of that.

00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:35.532
So what we're going to do,

00:00:35.532 --> 00:00:38.139
we're just going to visualize
things in the output space,

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:39.897
and we're gonna try to think of all

00:00:39.897 --> 00:00:42.601
the possible points that could be outputs.

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.553
So, for example, let's
just start off simple,

00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:46.991
let's get a feel for this function

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:51.429
by evaluating it at a
simple pair of points.

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.276
So, let's say

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:55.958
we evaluate this function F,

00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:00.125
at T equals zero, I think will
probably be pretty simple,

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:03.443
and then S is equal to pi.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.970
So let's think about what this would be.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.803
We go up and we say,

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:13.673
okay, T of zero, cosine of zero is one,

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:16.745
so this whole thing is gonna be one,

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:18.328
same with this one.

00:01:19.957 --> 00:01:22.868
And sine of zero is zero.

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:25.050
So this over here's gonna be zero,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.633
and this is also gonna be zero.

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:31.272
Now cosine of pi is negative one.

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:34.791
So this here's gonna be negative one.

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:37.647
This one here's also
gonna be negative one.

00:01:37.647 --> 00:01:40.512
And then sine of pi,
just like sine of zero,

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:41.861
is zero.

00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:46.145
So this whole thing actually
ends up simplifying quite a bit

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:50.592
so that the top is three
times one plus negative one,

00:01:50.592 --> 00:01:52.485
one times negative one is negative one,

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:53.735
and we get two.

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.135
Then we have three times zero plus zero,

00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:00.031
so the Y component is just zero,

00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:02.690
and then the Z component is also zero.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.571
So what that would mean

00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:07.125
is that this output is gonna be the point

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:09.349
that's two along the x-axis,

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.084
and, there's nothing else to it,

00:02:11.084 --> 00:02:12.965
it's just two along the x-axis.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:14.683
So go ahead and--whoop,

00:02:14.683 --> 00:02:15.728
move the graph about,

00:02:15.728 --> 00:02:18.150
add that point there.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.222
So that's what would correspond

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:22.342
to this one particular input, zero and pi.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.932
And, you know you can do
this with a whole bunch,

00:02:23.932 --> 00:02:25.689
and you might add a couple of other points

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.121
based on other inputs that you find.

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:29.567
But this would take forever,

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:31.669
to start to get a feel for
the function as a whole.

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:33.270
And another thing you can do, is say,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.959
okay, maybe rather than thinking of

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.799
evaluating at a particular point,

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.252
imagine one of the inputs was constant.

00:02:41.252 --> 00:02:45.514
So let's imagine that S
stayed constant at pi.

00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:47.110
But then we let T range freely.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.944
So, that means we're gonna have some kind

00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:51.027
of different output here.

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:54.318
And, we're gonna let T

00:02:57.563 --> 00:03:00.579
just be some kind of variable
while the output is pi.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.378
So what that means is
we keep all of these,

00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:05.026
these negative one, negative one, and zero

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:06.949
for what sine of pi is.

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.250
But the output now

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.750
is gonna be three cosine of T,

00:03:13.487 --> 00:03:14.487
cosine of T,

00:03:15.886 --> 00:03:19.010
plus negative one times the cosine of T,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.927
so it's gonna be minus cosine of T.

00:03:25.028 --> 00:03:28.429
The next part is gonna
still be three sine of T,

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.264
this is no longer zero.

00:03:30.264 --> 00:03:34.822
I should probably erase
those guys actually so...

00:03:34.822 --> 00:03:37.401
We're no longer evaluating

00:03:37.401 --> 00:03:41.899
(inaudible) when T was zero.

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:43.969
So, three times sine of T,

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.504
that's just still the function
that we're dealing with.

00:03:47.504 --> 00:03:48.337
Three,

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:51.052
sine of T,

00:03:54.994 --> 00:03:57.960
and then minus one times sine of T.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.043
So minus sine

00:04:00.444 --> 00:04:01.277
of T.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.077
Keep drawing it in green
just to be consistent.

00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:09.749
And then the bottom stays at zero.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.189
And this whole thing actually simplifies,

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.803
three cosine T minus cosine T,

00:04:12.803 --> 00:04:14.886
that's just two cosine T.

00:04:16.482 --> 00:04:18.570
And then the same deal for the other one.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.163
It's gonna be two sine of T.

00:04:20.163 --> 00:04:21.830
So this whole thing,

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:25.554
actually simplifies down

00:04:28.147 --> 00:04:29.297
to this.
So this is again

00:04:29.297 --> 00:04:30.647
when we're letting S stay constant

00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:32.845
and T ranges freely.

00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:34.595
And when you do that,

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.357
what you're gonna end up getting

00:04:36.357 --> 00:04:37.361
is a circle that you draw.

00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:38.849
And you can maybe see why it's a circle

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.452
'cause you have this cosine/sine pattern.

00:04:41.452 --> 00:04:42.780
It's a circle with radius two,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.613
and it should make sense that

00:04:43.613 --> 00:04:46.302
it runs through that first
point that we evaluated.

00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:47.177
So that's what happens if you let

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:49.003
just one of the variables run.

00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:50.791
But now let's do the same thing,

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:51.952
but think instead of what happens

00:04:51.952 --> 00:04:54.702
is S varies and T stays constant.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.105
I encourage you to work
it out for yourself,

00:04:58.105 --> 00:05:00.311
I'll go ahead and just kind of draw it,

00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.144
because I kinda wanna
give the intuition here.

00:05:05.644 --> 00:05:06.958
So in that case you're gonna get a circle

00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.708
that looks like this.

00:05:09.747 --> 00:05:10.875
So again I encourage you to try

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.108
to think through for the same reasons.

00:05:12.108 --> 00:05:14.263
Imagine that you let S run freely,

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:16.375
keep T constant at zero.

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:18.028
Why is that you would get a circle

00:05:18.028 --> 00:05:19.328
that looks like this?

00:05:19.328 --> 00:05:23.328
And in fact, if you let
both T and S run freely,

00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:26.747
a very nice way to visualize that

00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:28.303
is to imagine that this circle,

00:05:28.303 --> 00:05:30.032
which represents S running freely,

00:05:30.032 --> 00:05:33.321
sweeps throughout space
as you let T run freely.

00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:38.310
And what you're gonna end
up getting when you do that,

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.930
is a shape that goes like this.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.482
This is a doughnut. We have a fancy word

00:05:43.482 --> 00:05:47.136
for this in mathematics
we call it a torus.

00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:49.027
But it turns out the function here

00:05:49.027 --> 00:05:51.546
is a fancy way of drawing the torus.

00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:54.332
And in another video I'm gonna
go through in more detail

00:05:54.332 --> 00:05:55.481
if you were just given the torus,

00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:57.049
how you can find this function,

00:05:57.049 --> 00:05:59.272
how you can kind of get the
intuitive feel for that.

00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:01.069
And in that it'll involve going through,

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.235
in a bit more detail,

00:06:02.235 --> 00:06:03.917
why when you sweep the circle out

00:06:03.917 --> 00:06:06.136
it gets the torus just so.

00:06:06.136 --> 00:06:07.209
And what the relationship between

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:09.061
this red circle and the blue circle is.

00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:10.122
But here I just kind of want to give

00:06:10.122 --> 00:06:13.136
an intuition for what parametric
surfaces are all about,

00:06:13.136 --> 00:06:14.648
how it's a way of visualizing something

00:06:14.648 --> 00:06:17.468
that has a two-dimensional input

00:06:17.468 --> 00:06:20.135
and a three-dimensional output.
