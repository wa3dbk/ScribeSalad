00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.530
Let's say I have the equation
y is equal to x plus 3.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.570
And I want to graph all of the
sets, all of the coordinates x

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.750
comma y that satisfy this
equation right there.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.000
And we've done this
many times before.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So we draw our axis, our axes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.250
That's my y-axis.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.620
This is my x-axis.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.070
And this is already in
mx plus b form, or

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.540
slope-intercept form.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.840
The y-intercept here is y
is equal to 3, and the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.690
slope here is 1.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.840
So this line is going
to look like this.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.910
We intersect at 0 comma
3-- 1, 2, 3.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.190
At 0 comma 3.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.890
And we have a slope of 1,
so every 1 we go to the

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.070
right, we go up 1.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.870
So the line will look
something like that.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.760
It's a good enough
approximation.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.770
So the line will
look like this.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.380
And remember, when I'm drawing
a line, every point on this

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.280
line is a solution
to this equation.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.210
Or it represents a pair
of x and y that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.100
satisfy this equation.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.300
So maybe when you take x is
equal to 5, you go to the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.010
line, and you're going to see,
gee, when x is equal to 5 on

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.160
that line, y is equal
to 8 is a solution.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.370
And it's going to
sit on the line.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.550
So this represents the solution
set to this equation,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.820
all of the coordinates
that satisfy y is

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.660
equal to x plus 3.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.000
Now let's say we have
another equation.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.040
Let's say we have an equation
y is equal to

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.210
negative x plus 3.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.540
And we want to graph all of the
x and y pairs that satisfy

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.130
this equation.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.630
Well, we can do the
same thing.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.340
This has a y-intercept also
at 3, right there.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.250
But its slope is negative 1.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.810
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.505
Every time you move to the
right 1, you're going

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:05.870
to move down 1.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.980
Or if you move to the right a
bunch, you're going to move

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.020
down that same bunch.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.720
So that's what this equation
will look like.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.860
Every point on this line
represents a x and y pair that

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.070
will satisfy this equation.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.770
Now, what if I were to ask you,
is there an x and y pair

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.740
that satisfies both of
these equations?

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.280
Is there a point or coordinate
that satisfies both equations?

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.420
Well, think about it.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.850
Everything that satisfies this
first equation is on this

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.500
green line right here, and
everything that satisfies this

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.460
purple equation is on the
purple line right there.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.520
So what satisfies both?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.210
Well, if there's a point that's
on both lines, or

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.190
essentially, a point of
intersection of the lines.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.150
So in this situation, this
point is on both lines.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.570
And that's actually
the y-intercept.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.660
So the point 0, 3 is on
both of these lines.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.090
So that coordinate pair, or that
x, y pair, must satisfy

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.020
both equations.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.880
And you can try it out.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.890
When x is 0 here, 0 plus
3 is equal to 3.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.610
When x is 0 here, 0 plus
3 is equal to 3.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.880
It satisfies both of
these equations.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.500
So what we just did, in a
graphical way, is solve a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.786
system of equations.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.330
Let me write that down.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.550
And all that means is we
have several equations.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.650
Each of them constrain
our x's and y's.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.790
So in this case, the first one
is y is equal to x plus 3, and

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.140
then the second one is y is
equal to negative x plus 3.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.950
This constrained it to a line
in the xy plane, this

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.810
constrained our solution
set to another

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.510
line in the xy plane.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.600
And if we want to know the x's
and y's that satisfy both of

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.620
these, it's going to be the
intersection of those lines.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.070
So one way to solve these
systems of equations is to

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.270
graph both lines, both
equations, and then look at

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.420
their intersection.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.690
And that will be the solution
to both of these equations.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.460
In the next few videos, we're
going to see other ways to

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.850
solve it, that are maybe more

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.430
mathematical and less graphical.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.730
But I really want you to
understand the graphical

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.310
nature of solving systems
of equations.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.560
Let's do another one.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:36.270
Let's say we have y is
equal to 3x minus 6.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.620
That's one of our equations.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.410
And let's say the other equation
is y is equal to

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.860
negative x plus 6.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.220
And just like the last video,
let's graph both of these.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.740
I'll try to do it as
precisely as I can.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.530
There you go.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.260
Let me draw some.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.680
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.710
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.410
And then 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.790
I should have just copied and
pasted some graph paper here,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.470
but I think this'll
do the job.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.580
So let's graph this purple
equation here.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.380
Y-intercept is negative 6, so
we have-- let me do another

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.660
[? slash-- ?]

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.380
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.670
So that's y is equal
to negative 6.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.150
And then the slope is 3.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.510
So every time you move
1, you go up 3.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.370
You moved to the right 1,
your run is 1, your

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.830
rise is 1, 2, 3.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.580
That's 3, right?

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.120
1, 2, 3.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.640
So the equation, the line
will look like this.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.960
And it looks like I intersect
at the point 2

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.080
comma 0, which is right.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.270
3 times 2 is 6, minus 6 is 0.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.830
So our line will look something

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.700
like that right there.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.560
That's that line there.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.770
What about this line?

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.700
Our y-intercept is plus 6.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.850
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.620
And our slope is negative 1.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.630
So every time we go 1 to the
right, we go down 1.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.240
And so this will intersect at--
well, when y is equal to

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.100
0, x is equal to 6.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.880
So right over there.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.620
So this line will
look like that.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.300
The graph, I want to get it
as exact as possible.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.730
And so we're going to ask
ourselves the same question.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.440
What is an x, y pair
that satisfies

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.500
both of these equations?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.470
Well, you look at it here, it's
going to be this point.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.785
This point lies on both lines.

00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:04.560
And let's see if we can figure
out what that point is.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.060
Just eyeballing the graph here,
it looks like we're at

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.370
1, 2, 3 comma 1, 2, 3.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.810
It looks like this is the same
point right there, that this

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.820
is the point 3 comma 3.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.370
I'm doing it just on inspecting
my hand-drawn

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.080
graphs, so maybe it's
not the exact--

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.250
let's check this answer.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.260
Let's see if x is equal to
3, y equals 3 definitely

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.630
satisfies both these
equations.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.790
So if we check it into the first
equation, you get 3 is

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.740
equal to 3 times 3, minus 6.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.030
This is 9 minus 6, which
is indeed 3.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.350
So 3 comma 3 satisfies
the top equation.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.120
And let's see if it satisfies
the bottom equation.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.800
You get 3 is equal to negative
3 plus 6, and negative 3 plus

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.740
6 is indeed 3.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.487
So even with our hand-drawn
graph, we were able to inspect

00:07:54.487 --> 00:07:57.420
it and see that, yes, we were
able to come up with the point

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.370
3 comma 3, and that
does satisfy

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.450
both of these equations.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.810
So we were able to solve this
system of equations.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.160
When we say system of equations,
we just mean many

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.510
equations that have
many unknowns.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.060
They don't have to be, but they
tend to have more than

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:12.610
one unknown.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.310
And you use each equation as a
constraint on your variables,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.860
and you try to find the
intersection of the equations

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.300
to find a solution
to all of them.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.420
In the next few videos, we'll
see more algebraic ways of

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.300
solving these than drawing their
two graphs and trying to

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.910
find their intersection
points.
