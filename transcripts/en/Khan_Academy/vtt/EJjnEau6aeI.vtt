00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.570
So we're asked to add 3/15 plus
7/15, and then simplify

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.590
the answer.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.810
So just the process when you
add fractions is if they

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.000
already-- well, first of all, if
they're not mixed numbers,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.650
and neither of these are, and
if they have the same

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.280
denominator.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.190
In this example, the
denominators

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.370
are already the same.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.460
The denominator is 15.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.590
So if you add these two
fractions, your sum is going

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.860
to have the same denominator,
15, and your numerator is just

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.910
going to be the sum of the
numerator, so it's going to be

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.490
3 plus 7, or it's going
to be equal to 10/15.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.340
Now, if we wanted to simplify
this, we'd look for the

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.080
greatest common factor in both
the 10 and the 15, and as far

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.680
as I can tell, 5 is the largest
number that goes into

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.480
both of them.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.640
So divide the 10 by 5 and you
divide the 15 by 5, and you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.020
get-- 10 divided by 5 is 2
and 15 divided by 5 is 3.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.900
You get 2/3.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.099
Now, to understand why this
works, let's draw it out.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.865
Let's split something
up into 15 sections.

00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:11.470
So let me split it up
into 15 sections.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.670
Let me see how well
I can do this.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.300
Well, actually, even a better
way, an easier way might be to

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.740
draw circles.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.070
So let me do the 15 sections.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.260
So let me draw.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.800
So that is one section
right over there.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.340
That is one section and then if
I copy and paste it, that

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.710
is a second section, and then
a third section, fourth

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.760
section, and then we have
a fifth section.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.960
Let me copy and paste
this whole thing.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.920
So that's five sections
right there.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.300
Let me copy and then
paste that.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.200
So that is 10 sections,
and then let me

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.080
do it one more time.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.570
So that is 15 sections.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.010
So you can imagine this whole
thing is like a candy bar or

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.950
something, and we have now split
it up into 15 sections.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.870
Now, what is 3/15?

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.419
Well, it's going to be
3 of the 15 sections.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:17.570
So 3/15 is going to be one,
two, three: 3/15.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.880
Now, to that, were adding
7 of the 1/15

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.490
sections, or 7 of the sections.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.260
So we're adding 7
of those to it.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:35.240
So that's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.940
And you see now, if you take the
orange and the blue, you

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.310
get one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.800
ten of the sections, or
10 of the 15 sections.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.230
And then to see why this is the
same thing as 2/3, you can

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.220
just split this candy bar into
thirds, so each third would

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.760
have five sections in it.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.460
So let's do that.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.300
One, two, three, four, five,
so that is 1/3 right there.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.590
One, two, three, four,
five, that is

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.360
another third right there.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.810
And notice, when you do it like
this, we have filled out

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.190
exactly two-- one, two--
of the thirds.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.780
This is the third third, but
that's not filled in.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.210
So 10/15 is the same
thing as 2/3.
