00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.170
Welcome to this first video, and
actually the first video

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.800
in the playlist on differential
equations.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.810
I know I touched on this before
when we did harmonic

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.170
motion, and I think I
might have touched

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.450
on it in other subjects.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.400
But now, because of your
request, we'll do a whole

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.180
playlist on this.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.490
And that's a fairly useful
thing, because differential

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.730
equations is something that
shows up in a whole set of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.660
different fields.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.490
I've been requested by someone
who's starting an economics

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.050
PhD program to do this; I've
been requested by some people

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.660
who are going into physics, some
people who are going into

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.180
engineering.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.300
So it's a widely applicable
area of study.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.350
So let's just get started,
before I keep going off on

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.080
useless stuff.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.130
So the differential equations.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.370
So the first question is: what
is a differential equation?

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.730
You know what an equation is.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.740
What is a differential
equation?

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.670
Well, a differential equation
is an equation that involves

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.680
an unknown function and
its derivatives.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.590
So what do I mean by that?

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:10.290
Well, let's say that I said that
y prime plus y is equal

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.180
to x plus 3.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.010
Here, the unknown
function is y.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.430
We could have written it as y of
x, or we could have written

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.100
this as dy dx, the derivative
of y with respect to x plus

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.010
this unknown function y
is equal to plus 3.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.440
We also could have written f
prime of x plus f of x is

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.170
equal to plus 3.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.850
All of these would have been
valid ways of writing this

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.080
exact same differential
equation.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.100
And what's interesting here,
and how this is a departure

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.890
from what we've learned before
about just regular equations

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.020
is that-- let me write down
a regular equation just to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.500
remind you what they
look like.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.050
So a regular equation, if we had
one variable, would look

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.310
something like this.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.480
I don't know, x squared plus
the cosine of x is equal to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.570
the square root of x.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.970
I just made that up.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.110
Here, the solution is a number,
or sometimes it's a

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.770
set of numbers.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.030
Sometimes there's more
than one, right?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.760
If you have a polynomial, you
could have more than one

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.260
values of x that satisfy
this equation.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.870
Here, for a differential
equation, the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.290
solution is a function.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.600
Our goal is to figure out what
function of x, and here I

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.400
wrote f of x explicitly, but
what function of x explicitly

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.980
satisfies this relationship
or this equation.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.680
So let me show you what
I mean by that.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.380
And I have my differential
equations book from college,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.310
so I'm going to use
that as we go.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.290
So let's say that-- I'm
just writing now.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.120
See, they have this as a
differential equation.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.710
And I'm not going to show you
necessarily how to solve them

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.890
just yet, because we have to
learn some tricks first. But I

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.650
think a good place to start is
just so you understand what a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.620
differential equation is, so
you don't get confused with

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.460
the traditional equation.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.900
So, they have this differential
[? derivative. ?]

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.050
y prime prime.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.280
So the second derivative of y
with respect to x, plus 2

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.090
times the first derivative of y
with respect to x, minus 3 y

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.910
is equal to 0.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.990
And they give us the solutions
here, and what they want us to

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.210
do is show that these
are solutions.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.020
And I think this is a good
place to just at least

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.930
understand what a differential
equation is, and what its

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:27.970
solution means.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.000
So they say y1 of x is equal
to e to the minus 3x.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.310
So they claim that this
is a solution of this

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.040
differential equation.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.170
So let me show to you
that this is.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.590
Well, if this is soon. y1,
what's y-- well, let

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.570
me just write y1.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.080
What's y1 prime?

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.010
What's the derivative of this?

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.690
Well, just do the chain rule.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.180
The derivative of the whole
function, with respect to this

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.420
part of it, is just
e to the minus 3x.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.350
And then you take the derivative
of the inside.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.080
So that's just the derivative
of the outside, e

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.550
to the minus 3x.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.160
And the derivative of the
inside is minus 3.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.020
And the second derivative of
y1 is equal to-- we'll just

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.190
take the derivative of this, and
that's just equal to plus

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.100
9-- minus 3 times minus
3-- e to the minus 3x.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.060
Now, let's verify that if
we substitute y1 and its

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.930
derivatives back into this
differential equation, that it

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.520
holds true.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.730
So y prime prime, that's this.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:39.130
So we get nine e to the minus
3x, plus 2y prime.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.110
Plus 2 times y prime.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.620
Well, this is y prime.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.810
So 2 times minus 3 e to the
minus 3x plus-- oh sorry,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.010
minus-- 3 times y.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.430
Well, y is this.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.440
So minus 3 times e
to the minus 3x.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.440
Well, what does that equal?

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:09.260
We get 9 e to the minus 3x,
minus 6 e to the minus 3x,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.670
minus 3 e to the minus 3x.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.980
Well, what does that equal?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.160
We have 9 of something
minus 6 of

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.290
something minus 3 of something.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.460
So that just equals 0.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.550
It doesn't matter
of 0 whatever.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.140
So that equals 0.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.780
So we verified that for this
function, for y1 is equal to e

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.870
to the minus 3x, it satisfies
this differential equation.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.080
Now there's something
interesting here, and you've

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.340
kind of touched on this with
regular equations, is that

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.320
this might not be the
only solution.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.520
In fact we'll learn, in maybe a
video or two, that often the

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.760
solution is not just
a function.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.210
It could be a class of functions
where usually

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.900
they're all kind of the same
function, but you have a

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.980
difference of constants.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.200
But I'll show you that
in a second.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.850
But here, they actually show
us that there's another

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.960
solution, that this will
actually work with, we could

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.800
try the equation y2 of x
is equal to, well, just

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.020
simple e to the x.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.550
And we could verify
that, right?

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.900
What's the first and second
derivatives of e to the x?

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.470
Well, they're just e to the x.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.270
So the second derivative of y2
is just e to the x plus 2

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:22.730
times the first derivative
is what?

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.710
Well the first derivative of e
to the x is still e to the x,

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.970
2 e to the x, minus 3
times a function.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.320
Minus 3e to the x.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.010
Well, 1 plus 2 minus 3, well
that equals 0 again.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:41.690
So this was also a solution to
this differential equation.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.510
Now before we go on, in the next
one I'll show you some

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.920
fairly straightforward
differential

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.650
equations to solve.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.860
I think it's a good time now,
now that you hopefully have a

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.570
grasp of what a differential
equation is, and what its

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.370
solution is.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.610
And its solution isn't a number,
its solution is a

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.760
function, or a set
of functions,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.380
or a class of functions.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.820
It's a good time to just
go over a little bit of

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.100
terminology.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.820
So there's two big
classifications.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.580
Well actually, there's a first
big one, ordinary and partial

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.900
differential equations.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.590
I think you might have already
guessed what that means.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.290
An ordinary differential
equation is what I wrote down.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.550
It's one variable with respect
to another variable, or one

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.990
function with respect you to,
say, x and its derivatives.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.350
Partial differential equations
we'll get into later.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.190
That's more complicated.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.700
That's when a function
can be a function of

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.740
more than one variable.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.120
And you can have the derivative
with respect to x,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.950
and y, and z.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.570
We won't worry about
that right now.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.570
If your functions and their
derivatives are a function of

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.630
only one variable, then we're
dealing with an ordinary

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.490
differential equation.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.730
That's what this playlist
will deal with, ordinary

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:50.230
differential equations.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.620
Now within ordinary differential
equations,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.710
there's two ways of
classifying, and

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.280
they kind of overlap.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.300
You have your order, so what
is the order of my

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.180
differential equation?

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.820
And then you have this notion
of whether it is linear or

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.100
non-linear.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.640
And I think the best way to
figure this out is just to

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.250
write down examples.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.735
So let me write down one.

00:08:15.735 --> 00:08:17.760
And I'm getting this
from my college

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.060
differential equations book.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.050
x squared times the second
derivative of y with respect

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:33.189
to x, plus x times the first
derivative of y with respect

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:40.720
to x, plus 2y is equal
to sine of x.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.250
So the first question here
is: what is the order?

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.270
All the order is is the highest
derivative that exists

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.600
in your equation.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.360
The highest derivative
of the function

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.150
under question, right?

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.650
The solution of this is going to
be a y of x, that satisfies

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.880
this equation.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.750
And the order is the highest
derivative of that function.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.080
Well, the highest derivative
here is the second derivative.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.500
So this has order 2.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.960
Or as you could call this,
a second order ordinary

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.360
differential equation.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.780
Now the second thing we have to
figure out: is this linear

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.640
or is this a non-linear
differential equation?

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.600
So a differential equation is
linear if all of the functions

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.480
and its derivatives are
essentially, well for lack of

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.110
a better word, linear.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.830
What do I mean by that?

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.510
I mean you don't have a y
squared, or you don't have a

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.750
dy over dx squared, or you
don't have a y times the

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.080
second derivative of y.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.100
So this example I just wrote
here, this is a second order

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.530
linear equation, because you
have the second derivative,

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.580
the first derivative, and y, but
they're not multiplied by

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.910
the function or the
derivatives.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:59.600
Now if this equation were-- if
I rewrote it as x squared d,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.260
the second derivative of y with
respect to x squared, is

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.470
equal to sine of x, and let's
say I were to square this.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.660
Now, all of the sudden,
I have a non-linear

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.690
differential equation.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.860
This is non-linear.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.030
This is linear.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:21.190
Because I squared, I multiplied
the second

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.410
derivative of y with respect--
I multiplied it times itself.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.740
Another example of a non-linear
equation is if I

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:35.230
wrote y times the second
derivative of y with respect

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.390
to x is equal to sine of x.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.800
This is also non-linear, because
I multiplied the

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.140
function times its second
derivative.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.340
Notice here, I did multiply
stuff times the second

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.010
derivative, but it was the
independent variable x that I

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.200
multiplied.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.690
But anyway, I've run out of
time, and hopefully that gives

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.690
you a good at least
survey of what a

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.270
differential equation is.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.840
In the next video, we'll start
actually solving them.
