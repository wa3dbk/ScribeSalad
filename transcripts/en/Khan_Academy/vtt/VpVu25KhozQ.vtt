00:00:00.962 --> 00:00:05.412
In the last video we had Pete starting an open-ended mutual fund

00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:08.171
that was managed by Pete Inc.

00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:11.146
Mutual Funds normally have nice grand names

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:12.729
maybe they called this the Saturn Fund

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.997
and if there is a Saturn Fund out there, I just picked that name at random

00:00:15.997 --> 00:00:19.930
I'm not implying that this is you or anything like that

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.514
I just made up that name on the fly

00:00:27.514 --> 00:00:31.279
But it's managed by Pete Inc. and we called it an open-ended fund

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.995
because at any time one of the people who owned a share

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:38.548
or unit in the fund can redeem it back from the fund

00:00:38.548 --> 00:00:40.978
that Pete or the management company would say

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:45.496
If you want your $180 back we'll buy that

00:00:45.496 --> 00:00:50.780
we'll give you $180, you give back the share, and then we cancel the share

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.811
and if anyone wants to add to the fund

00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:54.546
if they want to invest

00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:57.413
the corporation can create new shares

00:00:57.413 --> 00:00:59.849
and then issue it to people - sell it to people

00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:02.770
and their money would go into the common pool

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.353
and the management company would take fees off of it

00:01:05.353 --> 00:01:07.214
But that probably had you asking

00:01:07.214 --> 00:01:10.767
If this is an open-ended fund, what is a closed-ended fund

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:11.786
or do they even exist?

00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:13.097
And they do

00:01:13.097 --> 00:01:15.099
That's what I'm going to talk about here

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:18.680
Closed-end funds

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.330
and closed-end funds on some level are a little bit simpler

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.396
What happens in a closed-end fund is that

00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:26.349
all of the investors are essentially

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:29.813
Or I guess you can say that the share structure

00:01:29.813 --> 00:01:31.630
is locked from the beginning

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.129
So if Pete wanted to start a closed-end mutual fund

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:37.647
he would once again register a corporation with the SEC

00:01:37.647 --> 00:01:38.979
he would market it it

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.548
he would tell everyone "Hey I'm Pete, I'm an awesome investor"

00:01:41.548 --> 00:01:43.165
"Here's my track record"

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:45.446
and then he would just get a bunch of investors

00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:48.131
so lets say he's able to find 20 investors

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:49.616
and that's all he's able to find

00:01:49.616 --> 00:01:52.030
so this is 20 right here, and I'm not going to count

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.130
but, let's say that there's 20 slices right over here

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.703
He gets 20 people, so let's say they each give $100

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:04.594
so he is able to raise $2000. 20 times $100

00:02:04.594 --> 00:02:07.611
So he is able to raise $2000

00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:11.362
And once that happens, the fund is closed.

00:02:11.362 --> 00:02:14.350
Pete's going to do his best to manage this

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.682
So Pete will manage this and he will still take a management fee

00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:21.782
Maybe the same 1%

00:02:21.782 --> 00:02:23.764
But what's fundamentally different here

00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:26.515
and he can market - well he doesn't have to market the fund anymore

00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:28.846
because he can no longer get new investors

00:02:28.846 --> 00:02:30.213
and this is actually the main difference

00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:31.914
An open-ended mutual fund

00:02:31.914 --> 00:02:33.548
at any point in time

00:02:33.548 --> 00:02:35.580
or I should say at the end of trading

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.265
at the end of a day, they can lose investors, or they can gain investors

00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:41.130
so it's an incentive for an open-ended fund

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.380
to constantly market itself

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.687
because the manager wants to manage more money

00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:47.331
so that he gets more of a management fee

00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:48.182
And a closed-end fund

00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:50.214
They'll market it right when they are creating the fund

00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:51.730
But once they create it

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.516
So lets say he just got his 20 investors

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:56.148
Then it is closed

00:02:56.148 --> 00:02:59.714
He can't create any more shares

00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:01.383
or cancel any more shares

00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:02.813
But what can happen

00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:03.881
so you might say

00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:04.829
well in a closed-end fund

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.433
How do these people let's say you're holding

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:07.932
one of these shares

00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:10.063
let's say that you're holding one share

00:03:10.063 --> 00:03:11.332
right over here

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:12.182
what happens if you want to

00:03:12.182 --> 00:03:16.099
If you need to buy a house, or if you owe money to somebody

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.481
so you want to get the value of your share back

00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:20.731
and the answer with a closed-end fund

00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:24.382
is that you would then go sell your share to someone else

00:03:24.382 --> 00:03:26.921
so this right here you can trade it

00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.648
You can trade it

00:03:28.648 --> 00:03:30.731
and you would trade it just you would

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:31.965
trade the stock of any company

00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:33.635
And in fact when you go and buy or sell

00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:36.064
a stock of IBM, most of the time

00:03:36.064 --> 00:03:38.131
you're just buying or selling it from someone else

00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:39.854
You're not transacting with IBM

00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:40.850
the company

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.165
You're trading in the secondary market

00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:45.188
you're not dealing with the actual corporation

00:03:45.188 --> 00:03:47.632
so that's where the investor

00:03:47.632 --> 00:03:49.130
get's their liquidity

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.132
and when we say liquidity

00:03:50.132 --> 00:03:51.914
it allows them to convert it into cash

00:03:51.914 --> 00:03:53.947
because they can trade it

00:03:53.947 --> 00:03:55.352
So the big difference

00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:58.626
open-ended fund: when an investor wants their money back

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:03.301
they have to deal with the fund itself

00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:05.215
the fund will buy back their share

00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:07.149
If some wants to invest in a fund

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:08.601
the fund will sell them the share

00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:10.481
so they're always dealing with the fund itself

00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:12.048
in a closed-end fund

00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:15.249
once the fund is created it's share pool is fixed

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:17.716
and if someone wants to buy or sell a share

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.302
it happens in the secondary market

00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:21.066
so they're buying and selling from each other

00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:23.601
they're not dealing with the actual fund manager

00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:25.544
The disadvantage from the fund manager here

00:04:25.544 --> 00:04:26.999
is it's much less flexible

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.065
in terms of growing or shrinking the fund

00:04:29.065 --> 00:04:31.781
The advantage is this fund manager

00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:33.799
doesn't have to keep cash around

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:36.933
in case the share holders want to redeem

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:39.616
In the open-ended fund we saw that the manager

00:04:39.616 --> 00:04:42.171
has to keep some cash around in case one of these

00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:43.466
investors wants their money back

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:45.881
here - the closed-end fund - he knows that no one

00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:46.982
can get their money back right here

00:04:46.982 --> 99:59:59.999
so he or she can invest as they see fit
