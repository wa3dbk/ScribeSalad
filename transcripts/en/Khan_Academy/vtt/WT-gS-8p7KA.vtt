00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.385
So the videos that I've been making

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:03.990
using these Python examples,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.531
I've been using Python 2,

00:00:08.531 --> 00:00:10.995
which is kind of the standard version of Python

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:12.546
that most of the implementations are in

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:14.390
at the time of making this video.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.692
But there is also a Python 3,

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:22.374
which is kind of the state of the art version of Python,

00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:25.010
or I guess you could say it's the newest version of Python.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.990
But it's not backwards compatible.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.695
When I say backwards compatible,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.524
it means that if you are running Python 3,

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:34.846
it will not necessarily be able to interpret everything

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:36.992
that is written in Python 2.

00:00:36.992 --> 00:00:38.985
So that's what we mean by backwards compatibility:

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:43.972
You can't take a program that was written in Python 2—

00:00:43.972 --> 00:00:44.990
so let's take a program—

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.834
that's the program right there—

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:50.015
and let's say it runs fine in Python 2.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.831
If you take that same program

00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:54.529
and try to run it in a Python 3 interpreter,

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:55.994
it's not going to work.

00:00:55.994 --> 00:00:56.843
So this means,

00:00:56.843 --> 00:01:03.011
so this is not backwards compatible.

00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:04.225
If this did work,

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:07.018
then Python 3 would be "backwards compatible".

00:01:07.018 --> 00:01:07.995
And the whole reason—

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:10.018
well you know this is actually a nice understanding of

00:01:10.018 --> 00:01:11.537
what even backwards compatibility means—

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.025
but the whole point of making this video is

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:16.543
the program that I ran in the last video

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:20.554
will work in Python 2,

00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:22.690
but it will not work in Python 3.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.010
And the reason why it doesn't work in Python 3 is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.538
Python 3 has a different version...

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:32.992
...of this input function over here.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:39.538
In Python 2, if you use the input function just like I used it—

00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:46.005
I put a message here for the user of what to input

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.552
and when the user inputs something,

00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:54.009
it'll be returned to the program fully evaluated.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.698
So in this case, if the user enters a number,

00:01:56.698 --> 00:01:58.375
I get the number as a number.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:07.190
So I literally get the evaluated expression.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.395
So like we saw in the last few examples,

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.002
if the user puts in a 4,

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.995
then the number 4 will be put in the variable "number".

00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:17.543
If the user inputs literally 3 + 4,

00:02:17.543 --> 00:02:23.523
then the number 7 will be put into the variable "number".

00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:24.682
In Python 3

00:02:24.682 --> 00:02:27.015
the input function does something slightly different

00:02:27.015 --> 00:02:29.533
and it's enough to break this program

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:32.013
if you were to try to run it in Python 3.

00:02:32.013 --> 00:02:34.538
In Python 3,

00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:38.987
the input function doesn't return the evaluated expression,

00:02:38.987 --> 00:02:41.005
it returns a string—

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:42.244
and this is a word you're going to...

00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:43.696
...hear a lot of in computer science,

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.379
and I'll explain it in multiple videos—

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:54.990
but it returns a string of what the user inputted.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.987
And you're saying "Sal, what is a string?"

00:02:57.987 --> 00:02:59.369
And this is actually a good introduction:

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:01.008
A string is a "string of characters".

00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:03.385
So, to—maybe—make the difference,

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:07.379
if I—if the user inputs—

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.536
right over here, this is coming from the user,

00:03:09.536 --> 00:03:15.700
if the user inputs—in the Python 2 version—2 × 6,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.369
then what will be stored in the variable "number"

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.385
will be the 2 × 6, so it will be 12,

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:23.995
it will actually be evaluated.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.390
In Python 3, if we just did this,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.995
and the user inputted 2 × 6—

00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:31.385
so once again the user inputs 2 × 6—

00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:33.526
then what's stored in the variable "number",

00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:36.535
what's returned from this function right over here,

00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:39.375
is not going to be 2 × 6 evaluated.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:44.990
It is going to be a string of characters that says "2 × 6".

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.021
So this is the string and a string is really—

00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:50.364
you can view it as a string of characters.

00:03:50.364 --> 00:03:53.369
you can kind of view it as some text

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:56.382
that's not actually interpreted in any way.

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:58.010
So it will actually return that string of characters,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.518
then you'd have that string of characters...

00:03:59.518 --> 00:04:00.979
...put here in "number"

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.379
and then the function here "range" would break down

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:04.979
because it's like I'm trying to take the range of...

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.395
...like a word, not like a number here.

00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:09.390
So thats why it would break in Python 3.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.985
So if you want that original function to work in Python 3,

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:15.969
what you have to do is put an—

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.969
so instead of just calling "input" like this,

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:19.395
you have to—and i will write it below this—

00:04:19.395 --> 00:04:25.054
you'd have to write "eval" and then write "input"—

00:04:25.054 --> 00:04:27.959
and then you write "input"

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:31.359
and then it quotes all of the stuff I wrote up here,

00:04:31.359 --> 00:04:34.375
colons, close quotes, close parentheses

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:38.515
and then close the eval() parentheses right over there.

00:04:38.515 --> 00:04:42.379
What eval() does is that it can take a string of characters,

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.385
it can take some text like this.

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:45.972
And it will evaluate it.

00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:47.529
So what happens is that

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:51.975
in Python 3 you'll get this string and when you eval it—

00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:56.538
so then you would do an eval() on this—

00:04:56.538 --> 00:04:59.395
so you're doing an eval() on the input()—

00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:00.682
the user puts some input,

00:05:00.682 --> 00:05:03.000
so then you're doing an eval() on what the user inputted,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.690
and then this will return 12.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.025
So in Python 2, the input function kind of does it all for you,

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:12.971
in Python 3 it returns a string

00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:14.995
and then you have to evaluate the string to get 12.

00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:17.371
So if you try to do this in Python 3 and it broke,

00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:18.687
that is the reason why,

00:05:18.687 --> 00:05:22.010
you have to put an eval() around it.
