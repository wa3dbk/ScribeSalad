00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.290
In the last video, I introduced
you to the notion of-- well,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.773
really we started with
the random variable.

00:00:05.773 --> 00:00:09.040
And then we moved on to the two
types of random variables.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.950
You had discrete, that took on
a finite number of values.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.480
And the these, I was going
to say that they tend to be

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.420
integers, but they don't
always have to be integers.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.880
You have discrete, so finite
meaning you can't have an

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.800
infinite number of values for
a discrete random variable.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.540
And then we have the
continuous, which can take

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.330
on an infinite number.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.370
And the example I gave
for continuous is, let's

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.635
say random variable x.

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:40.410
And people do tend to use-- let
me change it a little bit, just

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.340
so you can see it can be
something other than an x.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.250
Let's have the random
variable capital Y.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.180
They do tend to be
capital letters.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:01.700
Is equal to the exact
amount of rain tomorrow.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.320
And I say rain because I'm
in northern California.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.960
It's actually raining
quite hard right now.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.070
We're short right now,
so that's a positive.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.720
We've been having a drought,
so that's a good thing.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.150
But the exact amount
of rain tomorrow.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.370
And let's say I don't know
what the actual probability

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.480
distribution function for this
is, but I'll draw one and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.270
then we'll interpret it.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.210
Just so you can kind of think
about how you can think about

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.460
continuous random variables.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.465
So let me draw a probability
distribution, or they call

00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:37.520
it its probability
density function.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.940
And we draw like this.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:49.273
And let's say that there is--
it looks something like this.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.740
Like that.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.170
All right, and then I don't
know what this height is.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.680
So the x-axis here is
the amount of rain.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.740
Where this is 0 inches, this
is 1 inch, this is 2 inches,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.400
this is 3 inches, 4 inches.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.800
And then this is some height.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.665
Let's say it peaks out
here at, I don't know,

00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:22.540
let's say this 0.5.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.000
So the way to think about it,
if you were to look at this and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.650
I were to ask you, what is the
probability that Y-- because

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.090
that's our random variable--
that Y is exactly

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.040
equal to 2 inches?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.130
That Y is exactly
equal to two inches.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.810
What's the probability
of that happening?

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.920
Well, based on how we thought
about the probability

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.870
distribution functions for the
discrete random variable,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.150
you'd say OK, let's see.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.030
2 inches, that's the case
we care about right now.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.390
Let me go up here.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.920
You'd say it looks
like it's about 0.5.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.070
And you'd say, I don't
know, is it a 0.5 chance?

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.650
And I would say no, it
is not a 0.5 chance.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.800
And before we even think about
how we would interpret it

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.320
visually, let's just think
about it logically.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.070
What is the probability that
tomorrow we have exactly

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.450
2 inches of rain?

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.660
Not 2.01 inches of rain,
not 1.99 inches of rain.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:32.910
Not 1.99999 inches of rain,
not 2.000001 inches of rain.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.870
Exactly 2 inches of rain.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.740
I mean, there's not a single
extra atom, water molecule

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.240
above the 2 inch mark.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.990
And not as single water
molecule below the 2 inch mark.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.180
It's essentially 0, right?

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.310
It might not be obvious to you,
because you've probably heard,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.210
oh, we had 2 inches
of rain last night.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.810
But think about it,
exactly 2 inches, right?

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.300
Normally if it's 2.01
people will say that's 2.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.780
But we're saying no,
this does not count.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.700
It can't be 2 inches.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.660
We want exactly 2.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.660
1.99 does not count.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.580
Normally our measurements, we
don't even have tools that

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.920
can tell us whether it
is exactly 2 inches.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.700
No ruler you can even say
is exactly 2 inches long.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.690
At some point, just the way we
manufacture things, there's

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.250
going to be an extra atom
on it here or there.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.970
So the odds of actually
anything being exactly a

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.810
certain measurement to the
exact infinite decimal

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.180
point is actually 0.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.060
The way you would think about a
continuous random variable,

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.350
you could say what is the
probability that Y is almost 2?

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.600
So if we said that the absolute
value of Y minus is 2 is

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.280
less than some tolerance?

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.425
Is less than 0.1.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.540
And if that doesn't make sense
to you, this is essentially

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.720
just saying what is the
probability that Y is greater

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.600
than 1.9 and less than 2.1?

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.550
These two statements
are equivalent.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.240
I'll let you think
about it a little bit.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.930
But now this starts to make
a little bit of sense.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.580
Now we have an interval here.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.030
So we want all Y's
between 1.9 and 2.1.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.260
So we are now talking
about this whole area.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.520
And area is key.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.760
So if you want to know the
probability of this occurring,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.100
you actually want the area
under this curve from this

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.860
point to this point.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.030
And for those of you who have
studied your calculus, that

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.840
would essentially be the
definite integral of this

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.840
probability density function
from this point to this point.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.470
So from-- let me see, I've
run out of space down here.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.620
So let's say if this
graph-- let me draw it

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.480
in a different color.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:00.650
If this line was defined
by, I'll call it f of x.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.690
I could call it p
of x or something.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.320
The probability of this
happening would be equal to the

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.100
integral, for those of you
who've studied calculus, from

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.490
1.9 to 2.1 of f of x dx.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.400
Assuming this is the x-axis.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.220
So it's a very important
thing to realize.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.650
Because when a random variable
can take on an infinite number

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.820
of values, or it can take on
any value between an interval,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.500
to get an exact value, to
get exactly 1.999, the

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.950
probability is actually 0.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.370
It's like asking you what
is the area under a

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.820
curve on just this line.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.820
Or even more specifically,
it's like asking you

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.890
what's the area of a line?

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.445
An area of a line, if you
were to just draw a line,

00:06:48.445 --> 00:06:50.960
you'd say well, area
is height times base.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.440
Well the height has some
dimension, but the base,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.950
what's the width the a line?

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.190
As far as the way we've defined
a line, a line has no with,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.620
and therefore no area.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.460
And it should make
intuitive sense.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.850
That the probability of a very
super-exact thing happening

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.720
is pretty much 0.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.360
That you really have to say,
OK what's the probably

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.020
that we'll get close to 2?

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.070
And then you can
define an area.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.260
And if you said oh, what's
the probability that we get

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.450
someplace between 1 and 3
inches of rain, then of course

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.355
the probability is much higher.

00:07:20.355 --> 00:07:21.940
The probability is much higher.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.620
It would be all of
this kind of stuff.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.710
You could also say what's
the probability we have

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.400
less than 0.1 of rain?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.670
Then you would go here and
if this was 0.1, you would

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.170
calculate this area.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.590
And you could say what's the
probability that we have more

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.730
than 4 inches of rain tomorrow?

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.450
Then you would start here and
you'd calculate the area in the

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.125
curve all the way to infinity,
if the curve has area all

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:46.870
the way to infinity.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.590
And hopefully that's not an
infinite number, right?

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.530
Then your probability
won't make any sense.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.020
But hopefully if you take this
sum it comes to some number.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.930
And we'll say there's only a
10% chance that you have more

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.200
than 4 inches tomorrow.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.365
And all of this should
immediately lead to one light

00:08:04.365 --> 00:08:07.080
bulb in your head, is that the
probability of all of the

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.750
events that might occur
can't be more than 100%.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.050
Right?

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.230
All the events combined--
there's a probability of 1 that

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.290
one of these events will occur.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.910
So essentially, the whole
area under this curve

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.800
has to be equal to 1.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.620
So if we took the integral of f
of x from 0 to infinity, this

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.600
thing, at least as I've drawn
it, dx should be equal to 1.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.890
For those of you who've
studied calculus.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.570
For those of you who haven't,
an integral is just the

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.490
area under a curve.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.080
And you can watch the calculus
videos if you want to learn a

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.850
little bit more about
how to do them.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.160
And this also applies to
the discrete probability

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.291
distributions.

00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:49.670
Let me draw one.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.070
The sum of all of the
probabilities have

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.590
to be equal to 1.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.820
And that example with the
dice-- or let's say, since it's

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.800
faster to draw, the coin-- the
two probabilities have

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.850
to be equal to 1.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:11.060
So this is 1, 0, where x is
equal to 1 if we're heads

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.400
or 0 if we're tails.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.610
Each of these have to be 0.5.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.885
Or they don't have to be 0.5,
but if one was 0.6, the

00:09:17.885 --> 00:09:19.090
other would have to be 0.4.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.790
They have to add to 1.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.190
If one of these was-- you can't
have a 60% probability of

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.470
getting a heads and then a 60%
probability of getting

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.280
a tails as well.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.080
Because then you would have
essentially 120% probability

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.600
of either of the outcomes
happening, which makes

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.060
no sense at all.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.330
So it's important to realize
that a probability distribution

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.790
function, in this case for a
discrete random variable, they

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.160
all have to add up to 1.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.480
So 0.5 plus 0.5.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.990
And in this case the area
under the probability

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.500
density function also
has to be equal to 1.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.200
Anyway, I'm all
the time for now.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.520
In the next video I'll
introduce you to the idea

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.785
of an expected value.

00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:00.420
See you soon.
