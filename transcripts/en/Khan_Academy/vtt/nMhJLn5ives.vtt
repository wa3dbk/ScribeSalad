00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.690
I promised you that I'd give
you some more Pythagorean

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.720
theorem problems, so I will
now give you more Pythagorean

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.780
theorem problems.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.382
And once again, this is
all about practice.

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:28.020
Let's say I had a triangle--
that's an ugly looking right

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.030
triangle, let me draw another
one --and if I were to tell

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.750
you that that side is 7, the
side is 6, and I want to

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.250
figure out this side.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.510
Well, we learned in the last
presentation: which of these

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.990
sides is the hypotenuse?

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.470
Well, here's the right angle,
so the side opposite the right

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.600
angle is the hypotenuse.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.120
So what we want to do
is actually figure

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.730
out the hypotenuse.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.730
So we know that 6 squared
plus 7 squared is equal to

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.700
the hypotenuse squared.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.800
And in the Pythagorean theorem
they use C to represent the

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.470
hypotenuse, so we'll
use C here as well.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.030
And 36 plus 49 is
equal to C squared.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.510
85 is equal to C squared.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.760
Or C is equal to the
square root of 85.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.490
And this is the part that most
people have trouble with, is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.650
actually simplifying
the radical.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.290
So the square root of 85: can I
factor 85 so it's a product of

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.820
a perfect square and
another number?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.920
85 isn't divisible by 4.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.350
So it won't be divisible by 16
or any of the multiples of 4.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.940
5 goes into 85 how many times?

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.340
No, that's not perfect
square, either.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.030
I don't think 85 can be
factored further as a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.230
product of a perfect
square and another number.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.980
So you might correct
me; I might be wrong.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.570
This might be good exercise for
you to do later, but as far as

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.670
I can tell we have
gotten our answer.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.070
The answer here is the
square root of 85.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.250
And if we actually wanted to
estimate what that is, let's

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.810
think about it: the square root
of 81 is 9, and the square root

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.010
of 100 is 10 , so it's some
place in between 9 and 10, and

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.445
it's probably a little
bit closer to 9.

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.245
So it's 9 point something,
something, something.

00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:30.260
And that's a good reality
check; that makes sense.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.080
If this side is 6, this side
is 7, 9 point something,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.270
something, something makes
sense for that length.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.260
Let me give you
another problem.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.790
[DRAWING]

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.250
Let's say that this is 10 .

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.300
This is 3.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.090
What is this side?

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.060
First, let's identify
our hypotenuse.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.680
We have our right angle here,
so the side opposite the right

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.230
angle is the hypotenuse and
it's also the longest side.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.116
So it's 10.

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:05.390
So 10 squared is equal to
the sum of the squares

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.640
of the other two sides.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.256
This is equal to 3 squared--
let's call this A.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.890
Pick it arbitrarily.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.380
--plus A squared.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:23.860
Well, this is 100, is equal to
9 plus A squared, or A squared

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.720
is equal to 100 minus 9.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.560
A squared is equal to 91.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.390
I don't think that can be
simplified further, either.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.710
3 doesn't go into it.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.950
I wonder, is 91 a prime number?

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.880
I'm not sure.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.200
As far as I know, we're
done with this problem.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.890
Let me give you another
problem, And actually, this

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.500
time I'm going to include one
extra step just to confuse you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.240
because I think you're getting
this a little bit too easily.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.805
Let's say I have a triangle.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.990
And once again, we're dealing
all with right triangles now.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.130
And never are you going to
attempt to use the Pythagorean

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.780
theorem unless you know for a
fact that's all right triangle.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.810
But this example, we know
that this is right triangle.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.050
If I would tell you the length
of this side is 5, and if our

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.810
tell you that this angle is 45
degrees, can we figure out the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.410
other two sides of
this triangle?

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.220
Well, we can't use the
Pythagorean theorem directly

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.830
because the Pythagorean theorem
tells us that if have a right

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.750
triangle and we know two of the
sides that we can figure

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.140
out the third side.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.320
Here we have a right
triangle and we only

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.870
know one of the sides.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.080
So we can't figure out
the other two just yet.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.330
But maybe we can use this extra
information right here, this 45

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.120
degrees, to figure out another
side, and then we'd be able

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.280
use the Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.810
Well, we know that the
angles in a triangle

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.860
add up to 180 degrees.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.610
Well, hopefully you know
the angles in a triangle

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.630
add up to 180 degrees.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.320
If you don't it's my fault
because I haven't taught

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.720
you that already.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.310
So let's figure out what
the angles of this

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.080
triangle add up to.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.410
Well, I mean we know they add
up to 180, but using that

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.790
information, we could figure
out what this angle is.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.590
Because we know that this angle
is 90, this angle is 45.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:30.340
So we say 45-- lets call this
angle x; I'm trying to make it

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.870
messy --45 plus 90--
this [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.720
is a 90 degree angle --plus
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.520
And that's because the
angles in a triangle always

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.740
add up to 180 degrees.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:55.970
So if we just solve for x, we
get 135 plus x is equal to 180.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.550
Subtract 135 from both sides.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.190
We get x is equal
to 45 degrees.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.680
Interesting.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.800
x is also 45 degrees.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.380
So we have a 90 degree angle
and two 45 degree angles.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.710
Now I'm going to give you
another theorem that's not

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.920
named after the head
of a religion or the

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.560
founder of religion.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.730
I actually don't think this
theorem doesn't have a name at.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:26.920
All It's the fact that if I
have another triangle --I'm

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.980
going to draw another triangle
out here --where two of the

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.840
base angles are the same-- and
when I say base angle, I just

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.890
mean if these two angles are
the same, let's call it a.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.770
They're both a --then the sides
that they don't share-- these

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.610
angles share this side, right?

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.560
--but if we look at the sides
that they don't share, we know

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.240
that these sides are equal.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.810
I forgot what we call
this in geometry class.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.270
Maybe I'll look it up in
another presentation;

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.960
I'll let you know.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.040
But I got this far without
knowing what the name

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.370
of the theorem is.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.170
And it makes sense; you don't
even need me to tell you that.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.480
If I were to change one of
these angles, the length

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.660
would also change.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.310
Or another way to think about
it, the only way-- no, I

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.350
don't confuse you too much.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.820
But you can visually see that
if these two sides are the

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.670
same, then these two angles
are going to be the same.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.430
If you changed one of these
sides' lengths, then the angles

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.660
will also change, or the angles
will not be equal anymore.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.120
But I'll leave that for
you to think about.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.320
But just take my word for it
right now that if two angles in

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.400
a triangle are equivalent, then
the sides that they don't share

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.690
are also equal in length.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.820
Make sure you remember: not the
side that they share-- because

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.920
that can't be equal to anything
--it's the side that they don't

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.410
share are equal in length.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.990
So here we have an example
where we have to equal angles.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.020
They're both 45 degrees.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.910
So that means that the sides
that they don't share-- this is

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.230
the side they share, right?

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.210
Both angle share this side --so
that means that the side that

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.080
they don't share are equal.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.460
So this side is
equal to this side.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.520
And I think you might be
experiencing an ah-hah

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.020
moment that right now.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.380
Well this side is equal to this
side-- I gave you at the

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.050
beginning of this problem that
this side is equal to 5 --so

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.320
then we know that this
side is equal to 5.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.920
And now we can do the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.750
We know this is the
hypotenuse, right?

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:35.180
So we can say 5 squared plus 5
squared is equal to-- let's say

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.950
C squared, where C is the
length of the hypotenuse --5

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.010
squared plus 5 squared-- that's
just 50 --is equal

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.110
to C squared.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.370
And then we get C is equal
to the square root of 50.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:56.250
And 50 is 2 times 25, so C is
equal to 5 square roots of 2.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.220
Interesting.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.110
So I think I might have given
you a lot of information there.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.840
If you get confused, maybe you
want to re-watch this video.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.630
But on the next video I'm
actually going to give you more

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.095
information about this type of
triangle, which is actually a

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:11.550
very common type of triangle
you'll see in geometry and

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.470
trigonometry 45,
45, 90 triangle.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.930
And it makes sense why it's
called that because it has

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.930
45 degrees, 45 degrees,
and a 90 degree angle.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.460
And I'll actually show you
a quick way of using that

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.920
information that it is a 45,
45, 90 degree triangle to

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.520
figure out the size if you're
given even one of the sides.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.870
I hope I haven't confused you
too much, and I look forward

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.195
to seeing you in the
next presentation.

00:09:33.195 --> 00:09:35.120
See you later.
