00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.533
Part d: Find the total distance traveled by the particle over the time interval between

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:11.159
time t = 0 and t = 3, or 0 &lt;= t &lt;= 3.

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.267
So let's draw some axes here to just make sure

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:18.462
and you wouldn't obviously have to do this if you were doing it under time pressure during the actual

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:23.185
AP exam but my point here to make sure we all are understanding what's going on.

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:25.867
So when t = 0, where are we?

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:29.129
Well they tell us; x(0) is 0 so x is 0

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:35.298
and y(0) is -4 so we're at the point (0, -4).

00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:42.913
That's when t = 0 and in the last problem we figured out what happens when t = 3;

00:00:42.913 --> 00:00:45.133
we figured out that x is at 21.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.600
I'll just say that's 21 right over there.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.221
x(3) is 21 and y(3) was like -3 point something,

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.287
so that puts us right over here.

00:00:57.287 --> 00:01:04.708
So this is 21 and we figured this out in the last problem, I think it was -3.226,

00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:07.800
and so this is what happens when t = 3.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.482
And between these point who knows what the path is.

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:16.267
We could plot it if we wanted but it might look something like this, so who knows what it does, and we go like that.

00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:21.246
And so in are part d right here they're asking us "What is the total distance traveled?",

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:28.267
or another way to think about it is "What is the length of this path?"

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:35.000
And we could, there is a formula for arc length and if you know it, you could just apply it.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.508
It's not a bad thing to know going into the AP exam, especially under time pressure,

00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:43.010
but I always forget what it is, I'm almost 35 now,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.852
so I always like to re-derive it and there's always something a little bit satisfying about

00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:52.031
that too because we remind ourselves why the formula works.

00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:56.533
Well how do we figure a little bit of that arc length?

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.687
So actually let me do a little other part; I like this part more.

00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:03.969
So let's say, "How do we figure out a little bit of that arc length right over there?"

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.538
So let's say you have a little bit of that arc length that...

00:02:07.538 --> 00:02:09.918
I'm going to zoom in on that.

00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:18.600
Well you have a little bit of a small change in x over that arc length that I've blown up,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.379
so call that dx, and you have a small change in y as well, dy,

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.631
and we know from the Pythagorean theorem,

00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:32.662
if we get small enough you can approximate this as just the hypotenuse

00:02:32.662 --> 00:02:36.000
as this is the base, this is the height, and this is the hypotenuse.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.933
And so this is going to be, especially if you get these small enough, a line is going to be a pretty -

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:47.985
you could really approximate this arc by the hypotenuse

00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:51.769
right over here.

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.031
We know what this is from the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:59.298
This is going to be the square root of dx squared plus dy squared,

00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:02.157
straight up from the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:02.157 --> 00:03:05.415
Now, how do we write these as functions of t?

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:14.067
Well we know that dx/dt is equal to x'(t)

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:18.590
or if we treat differentials kind of like numbers, and you can most of the time, this is not very rigorous,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:29.185
but you that that dx is equal to x'(t) dt and we know that dy of t or dy/dt,

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:32.677
we know this is the same thing at the derivative of y with respect to t;

00:03:32.677 --> 00:03:39.754
y'(t) multiply both sides by dt you get dy = y'(t) dt.

00:03:39.754 --> 00:03:45.154
And all I'm doing here is essentially reproving or re-deriving the arc length formula.

00:03:45.154 --> 00:03:55.418
So we know that this right over here is just a small little arc length so we could call that dL or da for small arc length.

00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:58.682
Or actually we don't have to worry about what we call that right now.

00:03:58.682 --> 00:04:02.298
But this expression for that very little small arc length right over there;

00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:08.529
if I rewrite it in terms of this and this, what I have on the right-hand side,

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.825
and I want to do that so that I can get everything in terms of t,

00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:15.890
I get it is equal to the square root of dx squared...

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:25.052
Well dx squared is the same thing as (I'll do it in that magenta color) x'(t) dt squared

00:04:25.052 --> 00:04:37.682
and then you have plus dy squared, and dy squared is just this stuff: y'(t) dt squared.

00:04:37.682 --> 00:04:45.529
And so this little arc length is this right over here, and then you can actually factor out a dt squared,

00:04:45.529 --> 00:05:03.369
so this is going to be equal to dt squared times x'(t) squared plus (I'll do this in green) y'(t) squared.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:07.067
And then of course you can factor out the dt out of the radical sign now.

00:05:07.067 --> 00:05:09.805
The square root of dt squared is just dt

00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:14.638
so all of this simplifies to (I'll write it in yellow)

00:05:14.638 --> 00:05:20.041
this part right over here is x'(t) squared

00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:24.766
and this part right over here is y'(t) squared,

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:28.291
and then we factor out the dt.

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:34.723
Now this is all just a way to derive what this little small d-arc or this little small arc length is

00:05:34.723 --> 00:05:38.333
but we don't want to find just a small arc length, we want to sum over all of them,

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:41.975
so what we want to do is integrate the dt's,

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:45.836
take the infinite sum of these infinitely small pieces right over here,

00:05:45.836 --> 00:05:53.667
these infinitely small arc lengths from t = 0 to t = 3.

00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:56.364
And so now we just do it.

00:05:56.364 --> 00:06:01.344
And so they tell us what x'(t) is and y'(t) is.

00:06:01.344 --> 00:06:02.692
Let me just rewrite the expression.

00:06:02.692 --> 00:06:13.926
This is going to be equal to the integral from 0 to 3 of the square root of x'(t) squared;

00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:20.867
the problem they give us what x'(t) is, its 4t + 1.

00:06:20.867 --> 00:06:32.933
So its 4t + 1 squared plus y'(t) squared...

00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:42.148
the derivative of y with respect to t is sine of t squared

00:06:42.148 --> 00:06:47.177
and we need to square that as well and then dt.

00:06:47.177 --> 00:06:51.271
And this is not a simple thing to find the antiderivative of,

00:06:51.271 --> 00:06:56.169
but lucky for us we are allowed to use our calculators in this part of the AP exam.

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:01.067
And so all you have to do at this point, we've already done really the hard work,

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:03.856
is use this definite integral function.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:14.164
It's in our catalog right over here and you can go straight to the 'f's and go a page down.

00:07:14.164 --> 00:07:21.123
We need to find the definite integral, we have to punch this into our calculator, of the square root of,

00:07:21.123 --> 00:07:26.405
(and I'll write it as x's just because the x button is much easier to get to than trying to put a variable t in there),

00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:44.215
so the square root of 4x plus 1 squared plus sine of x squared

00:07:44.215 --> 00:07:49.437
(instead of writing a t here, I'm just writing an x here, just to clarify what I'm doing)

00:07:49.437 --> 00:07:52.443
and then we want to square that,

00:07:52.443 --> 00:07:54.557
let's see, that closes that parentheses,

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.533
and then I need to close the radical parentheses right over there.

00:07:57.533 --> 00:08:00.225
I want to say that my variable of integration is x

00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:04.298
I could have put t's here and set up my variable of integration as t, there's not any difference there

00:08:04.298 --> 00:08:09.877
and then I'm going between 0 and 3.

00:08:09.877 --> 00:08:17.892
And so, let's let the calculator do all the work here and we get...

00:08:17.892 --> 00:08:20.933
its taking a little time.

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:24.067
We get 21.091.

00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:29.292
So this is equal to 21.091 and that's the entire arc length.

00:08:29.292 --> 99:59:59.999
That's the distance that this particle traveled.
