00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.450
I've got a function f and it's
a mapping from the set

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.340
x to the set y.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.180
And let's just say for the sake
of argument, let's say

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.430
that f is invertible.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.960
What I want to know is what
does this imply about this

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.460
equation right here.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.320
The equation f of
x is equal to y.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.580
I want to know that for every
y that's a member of our

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.500
co-domains.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.420
So for every y, let me write
this down, for every y that's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.830
a member of my co-domain is
there a unique, in all caps

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:54.730
UNIQUE, solution x that's
a member of our domain.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.030
Such that, and I could write
such that well, I'll just

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.990
write it out.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.140
I was going to write the mathy
way, but I think it's nicer to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.510
write in the actual
words sometimes.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.110
Such that f of x
is equal to y.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.810
So if we just, let me
just draw everything

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.410
out a little bit.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.640
We have our set x right here.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.900
This is x.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.180
We have our co-domain y here.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.420
We know that f, if you take some
point here, let's call

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.450
that a, it's a member of x and
you apply the function f to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.210
it, it will map you to some
element in set y.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.870
So that's f of a right there.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.550
This is, so far, what
this tells us.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.560
Now I want to look at this
equation here, and I want to

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.280
know that if I can pick any y
in this set any lower-case y

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.590
in this set y.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.490
So let's say I pick
something here.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.150
Let's say that's b.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.370
I want to know is there a
unique solution to the

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.690
equation f of x is equal to b.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.920
Is there a unique solution?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.110
So one, I guess, you have to
think, is there a solution.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.600
So is there a solution to
saying, look is there some x

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.210
here that if I apply the
transformation f to it that I

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.140
get there, and I also want
to know is it unique.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.800
For example, if this is the only
one that is unique, but

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.750
it's not unique if there's some
other guy, if there is

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.690
more than one, solution.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.680
If there is some other guy
in x that if I apply the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.080
transformation I also go to b.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.795
This would make it non-unique,
not unique.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.000
So what I want to concern
ourselves with in this video

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.780
is somehow, is invertibility
related to the idea of a

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.500
unique solution to this for
any y in our co-domain.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.820
So let's just work through our
definitions of invertibility

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.310
and see if we can get anywhere
constructive.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.940
So by definition, f is
invertible implies that there

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.340
exists this little backward
looking, three-looking thing,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.580
this means there exists.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.670
I think it's nice to be exposed
sometimes to the mathy

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.380
notations Let me just
write that.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:26.070
That means there exists some
function, let's call it f

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:39.910
inverse, that's a mapping from
y to x, such that, and

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.530
actually the colons are also the
shorthand for such that,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.780
but I'll write it out.

00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:57.090
Such that the composition of f
inverse with f is equal to the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.130
identity on x.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.910
So, essentially, it's saying
look, if I apply f to

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.060
something in x then I apply f
inverse to that, I'm going to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.160
get back to that point which is,
essentially, equivalent.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.560
Or it isn't just essentially
equivalent, it is equivalent

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.850
to just applying the identity
function, So that's i x.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.769
So you just get what
you put into it.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.722
Such that this inverse function,
the composition of

00:04:19.722 --> 00:04:21.320
the inverse with the function,
is equal to

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.730
the identity function.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.650
And that the composition of the
function with the inverse

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.540
function is equal to the
identity function on y.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.800
So if you started y and you
apply the inverse, then you

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.260
apply the function to that,
you're going to end up back at

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.490
y at that same point.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.880
And that's equivalent
to just applying

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.350
the identity function.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.860
So this is what invertibility
tells me, this is how I

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.990
defined invertibility
in the last video.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.400
Now we concerned ourselves-- so
we are concerned with this

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400
equation up here.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.650
We're concerned with the
equation, I will write it in

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.920
pink, f of x is equal to y.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.930
And what we want to know for
any y, or any lower-case

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.790
cursive y in our big set
y, is there a unique

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.050
x solution to this.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.760
So, what we can do is we know
that f is invertible.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.600
I told you that from
the get-go.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.930
So given that f is invertible,
we know that there is this f

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.240
inverse function, and I can
apply that f inverse function.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.880
It's a mapping from y to x.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.240
So, I can apply it to
any element in y.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.280
So for any y, let's say that
this is my y right there.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.670
So I can apply my f
inverse to that y.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.520
And I'm going to go over here
and, of course, y is

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.260
equal to f of x.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.470
These are the exact
same points.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.560
So let's apply our f inverse
function to this.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.790
So if I apply the f inverse
function to both sides of the

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.850
equation, this right here's an
element in y, and this is the

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.850
same element in y.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.100
Right?

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.570
They are the same element.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.630
Now, if I apply the mapping, the
inverse mapping, to both

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.740
of that, that's going to take
me to some element in x.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.070
So let's do that.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:19.990
So, if I take the inverse
function on both sides of this

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.150
equation, where some element
over here in y, and I'm taking

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.650
the inverse function to get to
some element in x, what's this

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.330
going to be equal to?

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.940
Well, on the right-hand side,
we could just write the f

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.440
inverse of y.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.850
That's going to be some
element over here.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.150
But what does the left-hand
side of this equation

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.470
translate to?

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.810
The definition of this inverse
function is that when you take

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.520
the composition with f, you're
going to end up with the

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.410
identity function.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.820
This is going to be equivalent
to-- let me write it this way.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.330
This is equal to the composition
of f inverse with

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.790
f of x, which is equivalent to
the identity function being

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.120
applied to x.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.090
And then the identity function
being applied to x is what?

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.970
That's just x.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.310
This thing right here
just reduces to x.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.750
This reduces to x.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.040
So, we started with the idea
that f is invertible.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.340
We use the definition of
invertibility that there

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.760
exists this inverse function
right there.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.140
And then we essentially apply
the inverse function to both

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.590
sides of this equation and say,
look you give me any y,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.340
any lower-case cursive y in this
set y, and I will find

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.100
you a unique x.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.660
This is the only x that
satisfies this equation.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.760
Remember how do I know
it's the only x?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.130
Because this is the only
possible inverse function.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.740
Only one inverse function
which is true.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.550
I proved that to you
in the last video.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.880
That if f is invertible,
it only has one

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.050
unique inverse function.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.030
We tried before to have maybe
two inverse functions, but we

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.140
saw they have to be
the same thing.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.590
So since we only have one
inverse function and it

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.940
applies to anything in this big
upper-case set y, we know

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.800
we have a solution.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.630
And because it's only one
inverse function, and

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.980
functions only map to one value
in this case, then we

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.470
know this is a unique
solution.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.680
So let's write this down.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.660
So we've established that if f
is invertible, I'll do this in

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:35.409
orange, then the equation f of
x is equal to y for all.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.470
That little v that it looks
like it's filled up with

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:44.660
something, for all y, the member
of our set y, has a

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.910
unique solution.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.370
And that unique solution, if you
really care about it, is

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.710
going to be the inverse
function applied to y.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.440
It might seem like a bit of a
no brainer, but you can see

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.436
you have to be a little bit
precise about it in order to

00:09:07.436 --> 00:09:08.460
get to the point you want.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.740
Let's see if the opposite
is true.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.680
Let's see if we assume-- let's
see if we start from the

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:23.010
assumption, that for all y that
is a member of our set Y,

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:29.530
that the solution, that the
equation f of x, is equal to y

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:36.490
has a unique solution.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.440
Let's assume this and see if it
can get us the other way.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.690
If given this, we can
prove invertibility.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.060
So let's think about
the first way.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.650
So we're saying that for any y--
let me draw my sets again.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:59.210
So this is my set X and this
is my set Y right there.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.440
Now we're working for the
assumption that you can pick

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.670
any element in Y right here,
and then the equation right

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.550
here has a unique solution.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.700
Let's call that unique
solution.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.220
Well, we could call
it whatever.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.610
But a unique solution x.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.130
So you can pick any point here,
and I've given you,

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.810
we're assuming now, that, look,
you pick a point in Y, I

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.880
can find you some point
in X such that f of

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.360
x is equal to y.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.040
And not only can I find
that for you,

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.580
that is a unique solution.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.390
So given that, let me define
a new function.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.450
Let me define the function s.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.890
The function s is a mapping
from y to x.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:47.740
It's a mapping from y to x and s
of, let's say s of y, where,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.420
of course, y is a member
of our set capital-Y.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:11:09.540
s of y is equal to the unique
solution in x to f of x is

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.310
equal to y.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.060
Now, you're saying, hey, Sal, it
looks a little convoluted.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.010
But think about it.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.980
This is a completely valid
function definition.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.470
Right?

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.520
We're starting with the idea
that you give me any y here.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.260
You give me any member of this
set, and I can always find you

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.010
a unique solution to
this equation.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.450
Well OK, so that means that any
guy here can be associated

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.280
with a unique solution in the
set X, where the unique

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.610
solution is the unique
solution to

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.920
this equation here.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.160
So, why don't I just define a
function that says, look I'm

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.380
going to associate every member
y with its unique

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.210
solution to f of x
is equal to y.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.760
That's how I'm defining this
function right here.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.430
And, of course, this is
a completely valid

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.920
mapping from y to x.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.630
And we know that this only has
one legitimate value because

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.830
this, any value y, any
lower-case value y, in this

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.430
set has a unique solution
to f of x is equal to y.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.430
So this can only equal
one value.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.680
So it's well defined.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:15.670
So let's apply, let's take some
element here, let me do a

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.050
good color, let's
say this is b.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.520
And b is a member of y.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.970
So let's find, so let's just map
it using our new function

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:24.450
right here.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:29.650
So let's take it, and map it,
and this is s of b right here.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:35.390
s of b which is a member of x
Now, we know that s of b is a

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.450
unique solution by definition.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.650
I know it seems a little
circular, but it's not.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.600
We know that s of
b is a solution.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:56.720
So we know that s of b is the
unique solution to f of x is

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.530
equal to b.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.670
Well, if this is the case, if
this is good, we just got this

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.640
because this is what
this function does.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.350
It maps every y to the unique
solution to this equation.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.910
Because we said that every
y has a unique solution.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.810
So, if this is the case,
then what happens if I

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.150
take f of s of b.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.190
Well, I just said this is the
unique solution to this.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.250
So if I put this guy in here,
what am I going to get?

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.410
I'm going to get b.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:31.810
Or other way of saying this is
that the composition of f with

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:37.730
s applied to b is equal to b.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.440
Or another way to say it, is
that we take the composition

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.290
of f with s, this is the same
thing, because if I apply s to

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.090
b, and then I apply f back to
that, that's the composition,

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.170
I just get back to b.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.100
That's what's happening here.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.370
So this is the same thing as
the identity function on y

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.730
being applied to b.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:58.400
So it's equal to b.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.520
So we can say that the
composition-- we can say that

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.670
there exists, and we know that
this function exists, or that

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.700
we can always construct this.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.450
So we already know
that this exists.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.650
This existed by me constructing
it, but I've,

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.960
hopefully, shown you that
this is well defined.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.100
That from our assumption that
this always has a unique

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.710
solution in x for any y here, I
can define this in a fairly

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:24.330
reasonable way.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.700
So it definitely exists.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.230
And not only does it exist,
but we know that the

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.020
composition of f with this
function that I just

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:42.710
constructed here is equal to
the identity function on y.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.460
Now let's do another
little experiment.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.240
Let's take a particular-- let
me just draw sets again.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.190
This is our set X.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.790
Let me take some member
of set X, call it a.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.880
Let me take my set
Y right there.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.350
And so we can apply the function
to a and we'll get a

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.210
member of set Y.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.960
Let's call that right there.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:15.880
Let's call that f of
a right there.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.120
Now, if I apply my magic
function here that always, I

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.170
can give you any member of set Y
and I'll give you the unique

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.800
solution in X to
this equation.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.400
So, let me apply that to this.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.290
Let me apply s to this.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.440
So, if I apply s to this it'll
give me the unique solution.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.580
So, let me write this down.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:44.050
So if I apply s to this, I'm
going to apply s to this-- and

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.050
maybe I shouldn't point it back
at that, I don't want to

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.400
imply that it necessarily
points back at that.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.490
So, let me apply s
that, s to this.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.200
So what is this going
to point to?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.040
What is that point going
to be right there?

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.790
So that's going to be s of this
point, which is f of a,

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.840
which we know is the
unique solution.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:15.570
So, this is equal to the
unique solution to the

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:23.670
equation f of x is equal
to this y right here.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.360
Or this y right here is
just called f of a.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.240
Right?

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.820
Remember, the mapping s just
mapped you from any member of

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.010
a to the unique solution
to the equation f of

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.600
x is equal to that.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.650
So this is the mapping from f of
a to the unique, so this s

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.340
of f of a is going to be a
mapping to the-- or this right

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.360
here, is going to be the
unique solution to the

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.880
equation f of x is equal
to this member of y.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.740
And what's the remember
y I called?

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.760
It's called f of a.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.120
Well, you could go say this in
a very convoluted way, but if

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.880
I were to just, before you
learned any linear algebra, if

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.470
I said look if I have the
equation f of x is

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.020
equal to f of a.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.160
What is the unique solution
to this equation?

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.290
What does x equal?

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.693
x would have to be equal to a.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.030
So the unique solution to the
equation f of x is equal to f

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.810
of a is equal to a.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:31.590
And we know that there's only
one solution to that because

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.170
that was one of our starting
assumptions.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.660
So this thing is equal to a.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:42.080
Or we could write s of
f of a is equal to a.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:47.640
Or that the composition of s
with f is equal or applied to

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.350
a is equal to a.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:54.920
Or that the composition of s
with f is just the identity

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.320
function on the set x.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:57.570
Right?

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.390
This is a mapping right
here from x to x.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.630
So we could write that the
composition of s with f is the

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.700
identity on x.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.480
So, what have we done so far?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.970
We started with the idea that
you pick any y in our set

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:18.290
capital-Y here and we're going
to have a unique solution x

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.550
such that this is true.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.490
Such that f of x
is equal to y.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.560
That's what the assumption
we started off with.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.080
We constructed this function
s that immediately maps any

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.810
member here with its unique
solution to this equation.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:31.540
Fair enough.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.040
Now from that, we said this
definitely exists.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.850
Not only does it exist, but
we figured out that the

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.310
composition of f with our
constructed function is equal

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.530
to the identity on the set y.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.290
And then we also learned that
s-- the composition of s with

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.110
f is the identity
function on x.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.180
Let me write this.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.940
So we learned this, and we
also learned that the

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:58.380
composition f with s is equal
to the identity on y.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.040
And s clearly exists because I
constructed it, and we know

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.010
it's well defined because every
y-- for every y here

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.300
there is a solution to this.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:13.720
So given that I was able to find
for my function f, I was

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.760
able to find a function that
these two things are true.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.580
This is by definition.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.830
What it means to
be invertible.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.840
Remember, so this means
that f is invertible.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.510
Remember f being invertible,
in order for f to be

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:34.780
invertible, that means there
must exist some function from,

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:39.250
so if f is a mapping from to x
to y, invertibility means that

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.720
there must be some function f
inverse that is a mapping from

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:51.500
y to x such that, so I can write
there exists a function,

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:58.610
the inverse function composed
with our function should be

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:03.240
equal to the identity on x.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.070
And the inverse and the function
in the composition of

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.300
the function, with the inverse
function, should be the

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.340
identity on y.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.370
Well, we just found
a function.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.530
It exists, and that
function is s.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.950
Where both of these
things are true.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.200
We can say that s is
equal to f inverse.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.910
So f is definitely invertible.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.380
So, hopefully, you found
this satisfying.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.220
This proof is very subtle and
very nuanced because we keep

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.340
bouncing between our
sets X and Y.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.760
But what we've shown is that if
f, in the beginning part of

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.290
this video, we show that if f
is invertible then there is

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:45.450
for any y a unique solution to
the equation f of x equals y.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.560
And the second part of the
video, we showed that the

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:54.650
other way is true, That if-- let
me put it this way, that

00:20:54.650 --> 00:21:04.840
if for all Y, a member of
capital Y, there is a unique

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:15.870
solution to f of x is equal to
x, then f is invertible.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:20.260
So the fact that both of these
assumptions imply each other,

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.120
we can write our final
conclusion of the video.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:29.540
That f being invertible, if f,
which is a mapping from x to y

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:35.770
is invertible, this is true if
and only if, and we could

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.540
write that either as
a two-way arrow.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.000
Or we could write if for if and
only if so both of these

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.380
statements imply each other.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:49.900
If and only if for all y, for
every y that is a member of

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:59.300
our set y there exists a
unique-- I can actually write

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:07.720
that like that means there's
exists a unique x for the-- or

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:17.970
let me write this way there
exists a unique solution to

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:27.050
the equation f of
x is equal to y.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.880
So that was our big takeaway
in this video.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.440
That invertibility of a function
implies there's a

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.630
