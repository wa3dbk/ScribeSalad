00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.040
Welcome to the second
presentation on functions.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.370
So let's take off where
we left off before.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.510
I still apologize -- in
retrospect that that

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.770
whole foul food example.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.460
Well maybe it was helpful, so
I'm going to leave it there.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.050
Let's do some more problems.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.050
I think the best thing is to
keep doing problems with you

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.050
and I think you'll see the
example, and hopefully

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.960
you'll actually see that
functions are kind of fun.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.230
Let's do some more problems.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.840
Let's start off with an
example, not too different

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.630
than what we saw before.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:47.210
Let's say that g of x is
equal to 1 if x is even, and

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:56.030
it equals 0 if x is odd.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:15.595
And let's say f of x is equal
to x plus 3 times g of x.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.860
And let's say -- I'm going to
make it really complicated --

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.130
well, actually I'm not going
to make it any more

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.990
complicated now.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.680
So let's try some problems.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.800
So let's give an example.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.080
What is f of 5.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.180
Well, it's really pretty
straightforward.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.560
We take this 5 and we replace
it for x in the function f.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.890
So f of 5 is equal to 5 plus
3 times g of 5, right?

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.190
We just literally took this
5 and replace it everywhere

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.360
where we see an x.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.070
If instead of a 5, I had like a
dog here, it would be f of dog

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.590
would equal dog plus
3 times g of dog.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.700
Not that that would necessarily
make any sense, but

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.970
you get the idea.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.530
So f of 5 equals 5
plus 3 times g of 5.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.290
But what does that equal?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.000
So the 5 stays the same, plus 3
times -- well what's g of 5?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.750
Well, if we put 5 here,
if 5 is even we do 1,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.730
if five is odd we do 0.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.480
Well 5 is odd so it's a 0.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.270
So g of 5 is equal to 0.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.700
So this is 3 times 0.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.550
So this equals just 5,
right, because 3 times

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.400
0 is equal to 5.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.050
Well what would be f of 6?

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:42.090
Well, f of 6 would equal
6 plus 3 times g of 6.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.540
And once again, that equals 6
plus -- well, this time g of

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.560
6 is, well, 6 is even, so 1.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.370
So g of 6 is equal to 1.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.300
So this equals 6
plus 3 times 1.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.080
So this equals 6 plus
3 which equals 9.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.820
I think you might be
getting the idea now.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.140
At first when you see a problem
with a lot of these functions,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.770
it seems very confusing.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.910
But if you just keep taking
what's inside of the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.960
parentheses and replacing that
for x and just keep moving

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.690
along that way, you make a lot
of progress on these problems.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.260
Let's try a harder one.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:27.370
Let's say I said that f of x
is equal to x squared plus 1.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:45.440
Let's say that g of x is equal
to 2x plus f of x minus 3.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.325
And h of x is equal to 5x.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.440
Now I'm going to give
you a tough problem.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.620
What is h of g of x?

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.500
No.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.660
What is h of g of -- let's
pick a number -- let's say 3?

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.130
h of g of 3.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.310
Actually, we'll do examples in
the future where we actually

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.520
could leave the x there
and we'll solve for it.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.810
But let's say this particular
example, what is h of g of 3?

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.050
At first you might say wow,
this is crazy, Sal, I don't

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.650
know how to even start here.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.200
But you just take
it step-by-step.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.170
What can we figure out?

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.350
Can we figure out
what g of 3 is?

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.540
Well sure.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.220
We could take the 3 and put
it into the function g and

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.000
see what it spits out.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.460
So let's work on g of 3 first.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.400
So, g of 3 equals -- well it's
2 times 3, right, we're just

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.450
replacing wherever we
see an x with a 3.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:56.970
So it's 2 times 3, so that's
6, plus f of -- what, we'll

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.640
just replace the x again.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.140
3 minus 3, right?

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.560
So this g of 3 is equal
to 6 plus f of what?

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.500
3 minus 3 is 0.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.200
Now we have to figure
out f of 0 is.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.030
We have a definition here for
f, so we just figure it out.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.040
f of 0 is equal to -- well,
you replace the 0 here.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.810
So you get 0 squared,
which is 0 plus 1.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.130
So it's f of 0 is 1.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.910
So you take that and you
replace it for f of 0.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.360
So you get g of 3 is
equal to 6 plus 1.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.820
So g of 3 is equal to 7, right?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.490
Now we know what g
of 3 is equal to.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.470
We can substitute
that back here.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.430
So that's the same thing -- we
know g of 3 is equal to 7,

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.920
so that's the same
thing as h of 7.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.360
And h of 7 is just equal
to 5 times 7 equals 35.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.060
So I think you're probably a
little confused here, and I

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.270
would have been if I
was in your shoes.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.610
But the important thing is when
you first see this problem

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.730
you're like what can
I tackle first?

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.640
h of g of 3, it seems
very confusing.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.390
Well, g of 3, can
I tackle that?

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.610
Sure.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.295
I have a definition of what
the function g does when

00:06:21.295 --> 00:06:24.280
it's given an x, or in
this case, was given a 3.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.190
And that's what we did.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.990
We figured out what
g of 3 was first.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.410
And g of 3, we just have to do
the 3, and we said well that's

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.850
6 plus f of 3 minus 3, right?

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.240
Because we just replaced
that x with that 3.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.630
And we just kept solving.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.070
We figured out what
f of 0 is up here.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.050
And we got g of 3 equals 7.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.290
Then we substituted that
back in right here.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.200
We got h of 7 is equal to 35
because it was 5 times 7.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.700
Let's do some more problems.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.670
Actually, let's do another
example with the same

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:00.880
set of functions.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.980
I don't want to keep confusing
you with new functions.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:08.260
Let me it erase this
as fast as I can.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.925
I think I'm getting faster
at this erasing business.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.210
You can sit and think a little
bit about what we just

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.110
did while I erase.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.530
So let's do another problem.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:56.530
What is f of h of 10?

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:05.080
Well, first we want to figure
out what h of 10 is, right?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.510
Well, we could do it
in a different way

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.170
as we'll see later.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.100
But we can figure out what
h of 10 is pretty easily.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.460
We take the 10,
substitute it in for x.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.830
h of 10 is equal to 5 times x.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.910
In this case x is 10
so it equals 50.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.910
So we know h of 10 equals 50.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.010
So we know h of 10 equals
50, so we substitute

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.820
that back in here.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.080
So we say f of h of 10 is
the same thing as f of 50.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.890
And then f of 50 is, I think
pretty straightforward

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:35.660
at this point.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.110
You just take that 50 and
replace it back here.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.150
Well, it's 50 squared plus 1.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.690
Well, 50 squared
is 2,500 plus 1.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.410
That equals 2,501.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:09:01.930
What is g of h of 1?

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:08.920
Well, we take h of 1, h of 1 is
5, so this is equal to g of 5.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.840
And g of 5, we just replace the
5 here, so g of 5 is equal to 2

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.810
times 5 plus f of 5 minus 3.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.230
We just take wherever we saw
an x and replace it with a 5.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:25.520
Well, that's equal to 2 times
5 is 10, plus f of 5 minus 3.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.730
Well 5 minus 3 is 2.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.950
Plus f of 2.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.470
What's f of 2?

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.902
Well, 2 squared plus 1 is
5, right? f of 2 is 5

00:09:34.902 --> 00:09:36.630
-- 2 squared plus 1.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.400
So that equals 10 plus
5 which equals 15.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.340
If you're still
confused, don't worry.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.990
I'm about to record some more
problems that will give you

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.780
even more examples of
function problems.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.680
See you in the next
presentation.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.980
Bye.
