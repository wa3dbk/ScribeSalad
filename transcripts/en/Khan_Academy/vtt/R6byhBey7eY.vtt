00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.370
Problem number 1.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.400
It gives a series--
2, 6, 14, 30.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.770
And they say in the sequence
above the first term is 2.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.540
Each number after the first if
obtained by adding 1 to the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.150
preceding number and then
doubling the result.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.840
So you add 1, so you
get 3, and then you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.240
double it you get 6.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.230
You add 1 to 6 to 7, right, this
is plus 1 and then you

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.500
multiply it by 2.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.030
You get 7 times 2 is 14.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.770
14 plus 1 is 15 times 2 is 30.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.380
And they want the sixth term.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.730
So then 30 plus 1 is 31 times
2 is 62 and then you add 1.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.290
We add 1 first. So
you get to 63.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.875
And then you multiply
that times 2.

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:49.140
That's what, 126.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.660
So that is choice E.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.910
Problem 2.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:06.540
If a times x plus y is equal to
45, and ax is equal to 15,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.290
what is ay equal?

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.630
So let's just distribute
this a here.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.640
You get ax plus ay
is equal to 45.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.350
They tell us ax is
equal to 15.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.730
So that is equal to 15--
ax is equal to 15.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.790
So you get 15 plus ay
is equal to 45.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.590
Subtract 15 from both sides and
you get ay is equal to 30.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.210
That's our answer.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.200
They want to know what ay is.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.820
You don't have to solve for
a or y, just ay, so

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.640
that's choice E.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.890
Next problem.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.460
Before drawing this let me read
it so I can figure out

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.560
what I have to draw.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.780
On the speedometer above what is
the speed in miles per hour

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.580
indicated by the needle
position?

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.010
So let me see if I
can draw this.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.860
So they give the bottom one
like that, that's given in

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.580
feet per second.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.540
And then the next one
up is this one,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.960
that's miles per hour.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.170
And then the top one is
kilometers per hour.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.340
I'm going to write it on this
side, although they write it

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.640
up here-- kilometers per hour.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.800
And then they indicate-- and on
the miles per hour thing--

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.700
I don't know what you actually
call this measurement.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.290
So there's 30 and then there's
one slash, two slash, three

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.350
slash, and then they go to 60.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.720
And then the line that they
draw is right here.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.010
It goes like that.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.550
And they say in the speedometer
above what is the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.460
speed in miles per
hour indicated

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.510
by the needle position.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.290
And the reason why I didn't do
much detail on this line or on

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.090
this line is because this one's
kilometers per hour and

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.880
this is feet per second.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.890
So I don't care about those, I
just care about the miles per

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.970
hour, and that is this one.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.520
And let's see, they
drew it here.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.690
So how big is each
of these slashes?

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.510
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.460
So each of these go 1/4 of the
distance between 30 and 60.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.200
Each of them goes 1/4
of the distance.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.200
So you could say, for example,
this is halfway between 30 and

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.540
60, so this is going to be 45.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.940
And so what's halfway between
30 and 45, which is

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.490
where the thing is?

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.920
Well 45 is 15 more than 30, so
this is going to be 7 and 1/2

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.050
more than 30.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.040
So this point right here
is going to be 37.5.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.820
And how do I know that?

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.060
If you just say, well if I just
take 30 divided by 4-- 1,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.050
2, 3, 4-- each of these are
going to be 7.5-- right, 30

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.940
divided by 4 is equal to 7.5.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.520
Or you could say well this
middle one's definitely going

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.120
to be 45 because 45 is right
in between 30 and 60.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.360
And then what's right in
between 30 and 45?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.760
Well that's 37.5 again.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.320
So the speedometer's indicating
37.5 miles per

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.160
hour, that's choice B.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.560
Next problem, problem 4.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.390
How many different positive
three-digit integers can be

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.910
formed if the three digits, 4,
5 and 6, must be used in each

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.160
of the integers.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.220
So they're essentially saying
how many combinations can you

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.480
get of the number 456?

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.310
So I could write out all those
combinations if you like.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.870
I mean you could 456, 465--
right, those are all of the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.650
ones that if you have
4 in front.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.670
Then if you have 5 in front,
you have 546 or

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.180
you can have 564.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.210
I just switched them.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.920
And if you have 6 in front you
could have 645 or 654.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.170
So those are 6.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.880
The other way I think
about it is I have

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.270
three numbers, right?

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.860
I can put one of three in
the first position.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.880
I can put one of two in
the second position.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.250
And then I would have one left
over in the last position.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.790
I'd have three choices
to put in the first

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.680
number, 4, 5 or 6.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.890
Then after I put one in that
first position I have two

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.300
left, so there's two more
possibilities, and then I have

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.290
one left over for the
third position.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.410
So you could also think
of it this way.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.520
You could just write
them out-- 1,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.440
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 numbers.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.360
Or you could use that latter
technique I just talked about

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.180
and it would be 3 times
2 times 1, which is

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.720
also equal to 6.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.970
Next problem.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.120
Let me draw what they
have drawn.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.570
Well I'll try my best. This
line goes like this.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.270
And then there's
a dotted line.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.610
Let me just see if
I can do that.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.490
The hard part of these problems
is drawing them.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.380
Good thing you don't have
to do that on the SAT.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.490
The three-dimensional figure
represented above consists of

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.520
rectangular and triangle
faces.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.270
Fair enough, triangular faces.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.720
Each rectangular face
has area r.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.430
So this is a rectangular face
here, there's three

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.110
rectangular faces.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.190
So area of the rectangle
is equal to r.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.980
And each triangular
face is area t.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.130
So area of each of the triangle
is equal to t.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.350
What is a total surface
area of the figure in

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.410
terms of r and t?

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.510
So how many rectangular
surfaces are there?

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.470
Well there's this one in back.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.350
It's kind of behind the thing.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.550
You have this base that
I'll drawn in magenta.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.610
This is the base rectangular
surface.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.510
And then you have this one
that's closest to us, which I

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.760
could-- this one-- that's the
closest. So you have three

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.560
rectangular surfaces.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.895
So it's 3 times r, because each
rectangular surface has

00:06:59.895 --> 00:07:01.110
an area or r.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.230
And then how many of
the triangular

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.130
surfaces do you have?

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.020
You have the one in the back,
back here, and then you have

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.210
the one of the front
right here.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.220
So you have two triangular
surfaces.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.010
So it's 3 times the rectangular
areas plus 2 times

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.770
the triangular areas because
there's two triangular areas.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.980
So 3r plus 2t, and
that's choice B.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.230
Next problem.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.150
Problem 6.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:35.100
If n is a positive integer and
n plus 1 over 2 to the n is

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:42.380
equal to 1/2, n equals what?

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.530
So let's think about
how we can do this.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.110
Let's multiply both sides of
this equation by 2 to the n.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.130
So if you multiply both sides of
the equation times 2 to the

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:59.090
n, you get n plus 1 is equal
to 1/2 times 2 to the n.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.940
Let me think about this
a little bit.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.210
Let's see, 1/2 times
2 to the n.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.150
1/2 is the same thing as
2 to the negative 1.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:14.000
So this is n plus 1 is equal
to-- let me think about this.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.920
n plus 1 is equal to 2 to the
negative 1 times 2 to the n.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.680
So n plus 1 is equal
to 2-- sorry.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.260
2 to the n minus 1.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.430
Huh.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.950
So that's where I can get it.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.090
Really at this point, the best
thing I can think of is just

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.600
trying out the choices and
see which one works.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.080
If you look at choice A, 1--
actually, we could just do it

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.679
from the original,
that's faster.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.850
1 plus 1 over 2 to the n is
equal to 2 over 2 to the 1,

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:46.820
which is equal to 1.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.790
So it's not 1/2, so it's
not a equals 1.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.970
Choice B is 2.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:57.950
So it would be 2 plus 1, which
is 3 over 2 squared, which

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.510
equals 3/4.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.700
So that's not the answer.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.230
If you look at choice
C, choice C is 3.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:10.450
So 3 plus 1 is 4 over
2 to the third.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.670
That's 4 over 8 equals 1/2.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.260
So it's choice C.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.780
And I'm trying to figure out
if there's a way that you

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.900
could solve for that easier
other than trying out the

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.500
numbers, but for some reason
it's not popping into my head.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.010
Let me know a message if
you figure it out.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.170
But I also do these under
time pressure.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.450
But I will see you in
the next video.
