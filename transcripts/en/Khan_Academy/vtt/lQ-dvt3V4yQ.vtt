00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.180
Let's do one more
example dealing

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.120
with displacement,
velocity, and time.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.220
So we have if Marcia travels for
1 minute at 5 meters per second

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.490
to the south, how much
will she be displaced?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.170
Let me do it this way.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:29.270
We know that velocity
is equal to displacement

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.030
divided by time.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.490
And it's really, once
again, it is change in time.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.860
But we'll just say time.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.714
That's implicitly
change in time.

00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:38.380
And if you manipulate
this a little bit,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.390
you really just multiply
both sides by time.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.980
You just multiply both
sides by the variable t.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.309
You get displacement.

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.350
Because this cancels out.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.100
You get displacement.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.420
And I'll flip this around.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.780
What's on the right-hand
side, I'll write on the left.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.730
So you get displacement
is equal to time

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.120
times velocity or
velocity times time.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.970
Is equal to velocity times
time or velocity times

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.450
change in time.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.000
So over here, they're
asking us for displacement.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.500
They're asking us how much
did Marcia get displaced?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.390
And they're saying that
she travels for 1 minute.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.894
So this 1 minute right over
here, this is her time.

00:01:18.894 --> 00:01:21.060
Sometimes you could view
that as her change in time.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.660
Or it really is
her change in time.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.150
If it said 0 minutes on her
stopwatch when she started,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.400
at the end it'll say 1 minute.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.170
Or if it said 5
minutes, if maybe it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.330
was 3:05 when she
started, it would be 3:06

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.080
when she finished.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.712
So it was really
the change in time.

00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:36.420
Once again, I won't
write the delta there

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.446
just because this is the way
you most frequently see it.

00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:41.820
But I want to tell
you that these

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.560
are the same thing for the
purpose of this problem

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.790
because sometimes you'll
see the delta there.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.940
So the 1 minute, so the t
right over here is 1 minute.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.030
At 5 meters per
second to the south.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.450
This right over here
is the velocity.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.820
They give us the magnitude,
which is 5 meters per second.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.330
Or you could say
that's the speed.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.610
And they also give us the
direction, to the south.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:19.860
So this right over here is 5
meters per second to the south.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.810
So we might just say, look, if
we want displacement, that's

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:33.190
just going to be equal to 5
meters per second to the south

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.630
times 1 minute.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.915
The problem here
is that when we're

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:43.290
talking about
displacement, we're

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.180
going to think about a magnitude
of how much it's moved.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.360
So it'll be a
distance of some kind.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.220
And some direction.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.890
We have our direction
here, but we

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.786
don't want any
other units there.

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:54.410
And if we just multiply
this over here,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.966
we have 1 minute over here.

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:57.590
But we have seconds
in the denominator.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.360
You can't just cancel out
a minute and a second.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.000
So you can't just
say that you're

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.430
going to get 5 and have
some weird thing here.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.900
So in order for it
to all work out,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.310
you have to either convert
the 5 meters per second to 5

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.590
meters per minute.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.580
Or let me phrase
that another way.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.470
You have to convert
the 5 meters per second

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.520
to some amount of
meters per minute,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.530
not 5 meters per minute.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.654
It's going to be different.

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:19.560
Or you convert the
1 minute to seconds.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.260
So at least in my
mind, it's easier

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.450
to convert 1 minute to seconds.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.120
So let's do that.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.230
So this is the same thing.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.679
1 minute times.

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:30.220
And we want to get
rid of the minute.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.350
And the minute is essentially
in the numerator right now.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.470
We could put this over 1.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.550
But it's essentially
in the numerator.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.883
So we want to divide by minutes.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.790
And we want to
multiply by seconds.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.290
We want seconds
in the numerator.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.210
And so how many seconds
are there per minute?

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.602
You have 60 seconds
for every 1 minute.

00:03:50.602 --> 00:03:52.435
And so you have a minute
cancelling out with

00:03:52.435 --> 00:03:53.380
the minutes.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.060
And so now you have
5 meters per second

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.950
to the south times 60 seconds.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.170
This is now cool because you
have seconds and seconds.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.020
I wrote "sec" there,
but this is also sec.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.520
So now you have
seconds over seconds.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.850
Those cancel out.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.730
And so your
displacement is going

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.820
to be equal to 5 times 60.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.779
And then your units
left are meters.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.210
All the time units have
cancelled out and then

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.410
it's meters to the south.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.870
So meters to the south.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:41.100
And this is equal to 5 times
60 is 300 meters to the south.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.690
And we are done.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.840
That's how much she
has been displaced.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.470
If they just wanted
the distance,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.380
you could say that she
traveled 300 meters.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.110
Just that part.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.250
The magnitude of
the displacement,

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.700
that is the distance
that she traveled.
