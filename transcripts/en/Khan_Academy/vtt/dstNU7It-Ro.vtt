00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
Simplify the rational
expression

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.160
and state the domain.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.290
Once again, we have a trinomial
over a trinomial.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.930
To see if we can simplify
them, we need to

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.920
factor both of them.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.430
That's also going to help us
figure out the domain.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.035
The domain is essentially
figuring out all of the valid

00:00:17.035 --> 00:00:20.270
x's that we can put into this
expression and not get

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.530
something that's undefined.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.540
Let's factor the numerator
and the denominator.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.590
So let's start with the
numerator there, and since we

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.200
have a 2 out front, factoring
by grouping will probably be

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.680
the best way to go, so let's
just rewrite it here.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.190
I'm just working on the
numerator right now.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.290
2x squared plus 13x plus 20.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.270
We need to find two numbers,
a and b, that if I multiply

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.955
them, a times b, needs to be
equal to-- let me write it

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:51.455
over here on the right.

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:57.320
a times b needs to be equal to
2 times 20, so it has to be

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.220
equal to positive 40.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.110
And then a plus b has
to be equal to 13.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.990
The numbers that jump out
at me immediately

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.340
are 5 and 8, right?

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.430
5 times 8 is 40.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.660
5 plus 8 is 13.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.570
We can break this 13x into a
5x and an 8x, and so we can

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.790
rewrite this as 2x squared.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.760
It'll break up the 13x into--
I'm going to write the 8x

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.880
first. I'm going to
write 8x plus 5x.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.120
The reason why I wrote the 8x
first is because the 8 shares

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.810
common factors with the
2, so maybe we can

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.400
factor out a 2x here.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.850
It'll simplify it
a little bit.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.210
5 shares factors with the 20, so
let's see where this goes.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.450
We finally have a plus
20 here, and now

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.220
we can group them.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.980
That's the whole point of
factoring by grouping.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.230
You group these first two
characters right here.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.320
Let's factor out a 2x, so this
would become 2x times-- well,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.400
2x squared divided by 2x
is just going to be x.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.235
8x divided by 2x is going
to be plus 4.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.840
Let's group these
two characters.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.919
And if we factor out a
5, what do we get?

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:15.050
We get plus 5 times x plus 4.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.950
5x divided by 5 is x, 20
divided by 5 is 4.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.900
We have an x plus 4 in
both cases, so we

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.590
can factor that out.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.850
We have x plus 4 times two
terms. We can undistribute it.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.430
This thing over here will be x
plus four times-- let me do it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.940
in that same color--
2x plus 5.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.480
And we've factored
this numerator

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.485
expression right there.

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:50.490
Now, let's do the same thing
with the denominator

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.960
expression.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.160
I'll do that in a different--
I don't want

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.010
to run out of colors.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.090
So the denominator is right over
here, let's do the same

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.750
exercise with it.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.550
We have 2x squared
plus 17x plus 30.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.480
Let's look for an a and a b.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.220
When I multiply them, I get
2 times 30, which is 60.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.280
And an a plus a b, when
I add them, I get 17.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.230
Once again, 5 and
12 seem to work.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.040
So let's split this up.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.540
Let's split this up
into 2x squared.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:35.570
We're going to split up the 17x
into a 12x plus a 5x and

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.950
that adds up to 17x.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.040
When you multiply 12 times 5,
you get 60, and then plus 30.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.620
Then on this first group right
here, we can factor out a 2x,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.460
so if you factor out a 2x, you
get 2x times x plus 6.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.500
In that second group, we can
factor out a 5, so you get

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.750
plus 5 times x plus 6.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.880
Now, we can factor out an x plus
6, and we get we get x

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.970
plus 6 times 2x plus 5.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.470
We've now factored the numerator
and the denominator.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.930
Let's rewrite both of these
expressions or write this

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.370
entire rational expression with
the numerator and the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.770
denominator factored.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.210
The numerator is going to
be equal to x plus 4

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.630
times 2x plus 5.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.220
We figured that out
right there.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:52.060
And then the denominator is
x plus 6 times 2x plus 5.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.205
It might already jump out at you
that you have 2x plus 5 in

00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:55.390
the numerator and the
denominator, and we

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.570
can cancel them out.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.620
We will cancel them out.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.840
But before we do that, let's
work on the second part of

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.860
this question.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.010
State the domain.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.680
What are the valid x values
that we could put in here?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.700
A more interesting question is
what are the x values that

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.290
will make this rational
expression undefined?

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.580
It's the x values that will make
the denominator equal to

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.470
0, and when will the denominator
equal to 0?

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.120
Well, either when x plus 6 is
equal to 0, or when 2x plus 5

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.540
is equal to 0.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.830
We could just solve
for x here.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.530
Subtract 6 from both sides,
and you get x is equal to

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.670
negative 6.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.510
If you subtract 5 from both
sides, you get 2x is equal to

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.650
negative 5.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.337
Divide both sides by 2.

00:05:36.337 --> 00:05:40.520
You get x is equal
to negative 5/2.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.080
We could say the domain-- let
me write this over here.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:58.440
The domain is all real numbers
other than or except x is

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.580
equal to negative 6 and x is
equal to negative 5/2.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.410
The reason why we have to
exclude those is those would

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.880
make this denominator-- either
way you're right.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.150
It's going to go make the
denominator equal to 0, and it

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.150
would make the entire rational
expression undefined.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.400
We've stated the domain.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.080
Now let's just simplify the
rational expression.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.490
We've already said that x cannot
be equal to negative

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.310
5/2 or negative 6, so let's just
divide the numerator and

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.990
the denominator by 2x plus 5.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.580
Or just looking at the 2x plus
5, we know that 2x plus 5

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.630
won't be 0, because x won't be
equal to negative 5/2, and so

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.480
we can cancel those out.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.380
The simplified rational
expression is just x plus 4

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.020
over x plus 6.
