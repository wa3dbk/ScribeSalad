00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.730
So you might be wondering why I
went off into permutations and

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.550
combinations in the probability
playlist, and I think you'll

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.560
learn in this video.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.626
So let's say I want to figure
out the probability-- I'm going

00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:14.200
to flip a coin eight times
and it's a fair coin.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.710
And I want to figure out
the probability of getting

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.480
exactly 3 out of 8 heads.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.740
So I say 3/8 heads, but 3 of my
flips are going to be heads and

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.050
the rest are going to be tails.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.720
So how do I think about that?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.460
Well, let's go back to one
of the early definitions

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.910
we used for probability.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.810
And that says, the probability
of anything happening is the

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.300
probability of the number of
equally probable events into

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.040
which what we're
stating is true.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.590
So in which the number of
events-- I guess trials or

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.390
situations-- in which we
get 3 heads, and exactly 3

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.200
heads, we're not saying
greater than 3 heads.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.770
So 4 heads won't count and 2
heads won't count, 5 heads

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.480
won't-- only 3 heads.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.320
And then, over the total number
of equally probable trials--

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.476
not trials, total number of
equally possible outcomes.

00:01:13.476 --> 00:01:15.880
I should be using
the word outcomes.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.640
So just with the word outcomes
it should be the total number

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.070
of outcomes in which what
we're saying happens.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.050
So we get 3 heads over the
total possible outcomes.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.705
So let's do the
bottom part first.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.210
What are the total possible
outcomes if I'm flipping

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.070
a fair coin eight times?

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.980
Well, the first time I flip
it I either get heads or

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.620
tails, so I get 2 outcomes.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.230
And then when I flip it
again I get 2 more come

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.970
for the second one.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.810
And then, how many
total outcomes?

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.790
Well, that's 2 times 2 because
I could have got 2 in the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.570
first, 2 in the second flip.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.560
And then essentially we
would multiply 2 times

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.210
the number of flips.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.280
So that's 5, 6, 7, 8, and
that equals 2 to the eighth.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.400
So the number of outcomes is
just going to be 2 to the

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.860
total number of flips.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.020
And hopefully that
make sense to you.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.400
If not, you might want
to re-watch some of

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.440
the earlier videos.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.280
But that's the easy part.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.690
So there's 2 to the eighth
possible outcomes when you

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.340
flip a fair coin eight times.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.060
So how many of those outcomes
are going to result

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.761
in exactly 3 heads?

00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:25.200
Let's think of it this way.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.980
Let's give a name to
each of our flips.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.340
Let's give a name to them.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.260
So let me make a little column,
we'll call these the flips.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.890
This is my flips column.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.020
And I could name them anything.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.280
I could name them
Larry, Curly, Moe.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.010
I could name them-- well, I
would need 5 more names for

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.840
them, but I could name them the
7 dwarfs or the 8 dwarfs really

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.000
because I have 8 flips.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.860
I'll number the flips.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.530
Flip 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.270
And I'm the god of probability.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.260
And essentially, I need to just
pick 3 of these flips that

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.890
are going to result in heads.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.340
So another way to think about
it is, these could be 8 people

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.680
and I could pick which of
these-- how many ways can I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.710
pick 3 of these people
to put into the car?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.760
How many ways can I pick 3 of
these people to sit in chairs.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.510
And it doesn't matter the
order that I pick them in.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.770
It doesn't matter if I say the
people that are going to get in

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.280
the car are going to
be people 1, 2, 3 3.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.970
Or if I say 3, 2, and 1,
or if I say 2, 3, and 1.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.030
Those are all the
same combination.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.290
So similarly, if I'm just
picking flips and I have

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.070
to say, OK, 3 of these
flips are going to get

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.830
into the heads car.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.830
Heads is like they're sitting,
they're people sitting down.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.040
I don't want to
confuse you too much.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.320
But essentially I'm
just going to choose 3

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.340
things out of the 8.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.580
So I'm essentially just saying,
how many combinations can I get

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.810
where I pick 3 out of these 8.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.800
And so that should immediately
ring a bell that we're

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.290
essentially saying, out of 8
things we're going to choose 3.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.650
How many combinations of 3
can we pick of 8 and that we

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.590
went over in the last video.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.500
And let's do it with
the formula first.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.950
So let me write the formula up
here just so you remember it,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.230
but I also want to give you the
intuition again,

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.510
for the formula.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.430
So in general, we said, n
choose k, that is equal to n

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:37.130
factorial over k factorial
times n minus k factorial.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.640
So in this situation that
would equal 8 factorial over

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.360
3 factorial times what?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.510
8 minus k-- times 5 factorial.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.790
Or another way of writing this,
this would be 8 times 7 times 6

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.880
times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2
times 1 over-- I'll just write

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.050
3 factorial for a second.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.520
Then times 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.440
And of course, that and that
cancel out and all you're

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.400
left with is 8 times 7
time 6 over 3 factorial.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.000
And I did this for reason
because I want you to re-get

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.100
the intuition at least for
this part of the formula.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.790
That's essentially just saying,
how many permutations can I--

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.210
how many ways can I pick
3 things out of 8?

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.420
And that's essentially saying,
well, before I pick anything

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.860
I could pick 1 of 8.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.230
Then I have 7 left to pick
from for the second spot.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.650
And then I have 6 left to
pick for the third spot.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.670
And so that's essentially
the number of permutations.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.910
But since we don't care what
order we picked them in, we

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.350
need to divide by the number of
ways we can rearrange 3 things,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.960
and that's where the 3
factorial comes from.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.460
And so hopefully I didn't
confuse you, but if I did you

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.560
can go back to this formula
for the binomial coefficient.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.090
But it's good to
have the intuition.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.910
And then once we're
at this point we can

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.460
just calculate this.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.050
Well, what's this?

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.720
This is 8 times 7 times
6 over 3 factorial of

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.720
3 times 2 times 1.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.090
So that's 6.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.130
The 6 cancels out,
so it's 8 times 7.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.760
So there's 8 times
7, or what is that?

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.060
56.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.800
That's equal to 56.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.140
So there's 56 different ways
to pick 3 things out of 8.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.180
Or if I have 8 people there's
56 ways of picking 3 people to

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.030
sit in the car or however
you want t view it.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.430
But if I have 8 flips there's
56 ways of picking 3 of

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.270
those flips to be heads.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.480
So let's go to our original
probability problem.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.180
What is the probably that
I get 3 out of 8 heads?

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:53.030
Well, it's the number of ways
I can pick 3 out of those 8,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.170
so it equals 56, over the
total number of outcomes.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.430
The total number of outcomes
is 2 to the eighth.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.100
Another way I could write
that-- 56, let me unseparate.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.670
That's 8 times 7 over
2 to the eighth.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.140
8 is 2 to the third.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.660
Let me erase some of this.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.940
Not with that color.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.690
Let me erase that.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.400
Let me erase all of
this just so I space.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.050
And I will switch
colors for variety.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.750
Let me use the small pen.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.590
OK, so I'm back.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.750
All right, so 8 is the same
thing as 2 to the third times

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.760
7-- this is all just
mathematical simplification,

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.940
but it's useful-- over
2 to the eighth.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.430
And so, if we just divide both
sides-- the numerator and the

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.075
denominator by 2 to the
third, this becomes 1.

00:07:46.075 --> 00:07:48.830
This becomes 2 to the fifth.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:58.460
And so it becomes 7/32.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.070
Is that right?

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:06.160
So if I were to pick 3 out of
8-- yep, I think that is right.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.510
And so what does that
turn out to be?

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.442
Let me get my calculator.

00:08:10.442 --> 00:08:10.910
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.260
to make careless mistakes.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:13.680
Let's see.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.126
My calculator seems
to have disappeared.

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:18.140
Let me get it back.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.530
There it is.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.140
OK.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:32.070
7 divided by 32 is
equal to 0.21875.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:37.370
Which is equal to 21.-- you
know, if I were to round

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.820
roughly-- 21.9% chance.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.820
So there's a little bit better
than 1 in 5 chance that I get

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.420
exactly 3 out of the
8 flips as heads.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.840
Hopefully I didn't confuse you
and now you can apply that

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.730
to pretty much anything.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.720
You could say, well, what is
the probability of getting-- if

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.430
I flip a fair coin-- of getting
exactly 7 out of 8 heads?

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.780
Or you could say, what's
the probability of getting

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.470
2 out of 100 heads?

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.370
And you could use it the exact
same way we did this problem.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.410
I'll see you in the next video.
