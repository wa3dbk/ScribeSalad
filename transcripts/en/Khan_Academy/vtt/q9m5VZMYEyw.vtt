00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.520
I copied and pasted the next
view because they had a little

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.600
bit of a drawing, so I thought,
better than me

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.420
drawing it myself.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.140
So we're on problem number 13
and I cut it off a little bit.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.360
What is the volume of
the figure below?

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.670
Well, the volume is just
the width times the

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.550
height times the depth.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.580
So the volume is just going to
be-- the width is x plus 4

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.340
times x plus 1 times x plus 6.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.510
X plus 4 times x plus 1.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.810
We can do this in our head, but
I always find it easier to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.780
do it this way. x plus
1 times x plus 1.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.260
1 times 4 is 4.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.420
1 times x is x.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.630
And then you have the x place.
x times 4 is 4x, x

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.250
times x is x squared.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.010
Fair enough.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.270
So that equals x squared
plus 5x plus 4.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630
Now, we have to multiply that
times x plus 6, right?

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.690
We did x plus 4 and x plus 1,
and this was a 6. x plus 6,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.850
that's this side.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.730
So now we multiply this
times x plus 6.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.270
6 times 4 is 24.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.900
6 times 5x is 30x.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.315
6 times x squared
is 6x squared.

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:19.910
I hope you can read
what I'm writing.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.770
Scroll down a little bit.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.920
Now we do the x's place.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.130
I'll do it in a different color
because I think I'm

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.921
going to run out of--
so x times 4 is 4x.

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:32.020
x times 5x is 5x squared.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.795
x times x squared is
x to the third.

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:40.210
Have to run into
the white area.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.760
So this is x to the third.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.750
What's 6 plus 5?

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.580
Plus 11x squared plus
30x-- no, no, sorry.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.720
30 plus 4 is plus 34x plus 24.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.610
So x to the third, all of these
choices are x to the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.820
third, plus 11x squared,
so it's either b

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.000
your d, plus 34x.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.730
That's that one.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.570
Plus 34x plus 24.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.330
So the choice is b.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.235
Next problem All right.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.670
8a to the third plus
c to the third.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.770
Which of these choices?

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.760
So that's interesting.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.960
This is not a trivial thing
to just factor.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.290
We'll have to do some
intuition here.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.950
Well, let's think about it.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.010
In order to have a positive
number for the a term, every

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.800
time we're multiplying, we have
to have a positive, so

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.710
this is 2a times 2a times 2a.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.810
That would get us to
8a to the third.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.490
But there's something
interesting about choice a,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.210
why I already feel like
canceling out choice a.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.930
Choice a is essentially
2a plus c to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.570
the third power right?

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.580
Choice a is 2a plus c
to the third power.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.280
And every time you multiply
this out, every time you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.410
multiply 2a plus c times itself,
you're going to add

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.810
more terms. No terms are
going to cancel out.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.900
I mean, if you were to square
this, you're going to get,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.240
just to show you, you
get 4a squared

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.570
plus 4ac plus c squared.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.800
And then to get the third power,
you'd multiply that

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.790
times 2a plus c.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.990
So you're going to
get this thing.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.420
You're actually going to get
four terms. Choice a is

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.240
definitely not the case.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.795
In order for one of these to
simplify to this, we're going

00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:31.950
to have to have some positives
and negatives there to cancel

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.462
out terms as you expand
these polynomials.

00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:36.700
So let's look at the other
choices and see if

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.540
they make any sense.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.890
2a times-- and I like looking
at the a terms and what

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.190
generates the c cubed terms and
maybe we can cancel out

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.040
some things.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.370
2a times 4a squared, that's
8a to the third.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.200
But minus c times c squared,
that's minus c to the the

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.590
third, right?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.840
So I don't even have to worry
about multiplying

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.590
this whole thing out.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.290
I know because the c cubed term
is going to come only

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.090
from this term multiplied
by this term.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.450
There'll be other terms that
hopefully will cancel out, but

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.280
we know that choice b cannot be
the choice because minus c

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.660
times c squared is minus c to
the third, and this is a plus

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.480
right here.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.190
So we know b can't be
the right answer.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.779
Let's see, choice c.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:19.810
I can use the same logic.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.260
We have a minus c and
we have a plus c.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.280
We have a plus c here.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.770
We would have to have two plus
c's in order for this to work,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.370
so this can't be the answer.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.900
So just by deductive reasoning,
I can say it's

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.730
probably choice d, but I'm going
to prove it to you since

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.170
we're here to learn, not to just
answer things correctly.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.060
So if I were to multiply those
two numbers, I have 4a squared

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.720
minus 2ac plus c squared,
and I'm multiplying that

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.580
times 2a plus c.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.510
So I'm going to mix up all of
the terms a little bit, but

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.920
you will get the idea.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.890
So the important thing when
you're multiplying, you could

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.700
do this in your head, is that
you multiply each of these

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.390
terms times each of those.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.800
So c times all of that plus
this times all of of that.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.750
So c times all of that
is c times c squared.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.100
I'm not doing it in the right
place notation like I did last

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.090
time because it gets a little
more confusing now.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.010
But c times c squared
is c to the third.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.650
c times minus 2ac is
minus 2ac squared.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.570
c times 4a squared
is 4a squared c.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.940
And now we can do this one.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.380
2a times c squared.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.730
I'm going to put it in this
place because it turns into ac

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.910
squared, right? ac squared
and I have a 2.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.166
So 2a times c squared
is 2ac squared.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.920
2a times minus 2ac, you get a
minus 4a squared c, so it's

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.980
minus 4a squared c.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.170
This is a plus here.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.520
And then 2a times 4a squared
is 8a to the third.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.510
And luckily enough, let's see,
they get 8a to the third.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.750
This cancels out, this cancel
out, and you get

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.130
plus c to the third.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.210
So we were right by doing our
deductive reasoning, that

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.830
choice d was the answer.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.170
Next problem.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.420
I've run out of space.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.210
Let me see what the next
problem even is.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.740
Actually, where was I?

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.990
OK, I see.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.500
OK, problem 15.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.234
The total area of a rectangle
is 4x to the

00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:47.205
fourth minus 9y squared.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.660
Which factors could represent
the length times the width?

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.060
OK, so essentially you're saying
the length times the

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.765
width is going to be equal to
the area, which is 4x to the

00:06:59.765 --> 00:07:04.610
fourth minus 9y squared.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.350
So to some degree, we have to
factor this into multiple

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.290
expressions.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.730
And the first thing you should
always look at when you have

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.790
to factor any type of an
expression, especially if

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.060
there's only two terms in the
expression, does it fit the

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.080
form a squared minus
b squared?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.980
Because if it does, you can
factor this into a plus b

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.900
times a minus b.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.580
And if you don't trust that
these equal each other, I've

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.250
made multiple videos about it,
but just multiply them. a plus

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.390
b times a minus b is equal to
a squared minus b squared.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.630
And luckily, this fits
that format, right?

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:46.650
If a squared was equal to 4x to
the fourth, then what's a?

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.410
a would be equal
to 2x squared.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:57.325
And if b squared is equal to 9y
squared, then b is equal to

00:07:57.325 --> 00:08:00.620
the square root of that,
which is 3y.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.670
And so this definitely
is equal to a

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.300
squared minus b squared.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.200
So this expression right here
can be factored into a plus b

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.170
times a minus b.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:17.160
So a plus b is 2x squared
plus 3y times a minus b.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.250
2x squared minus 3y.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.810
Let's see, which
choice is that?

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.920
2x squared plus 3y?

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.870
OK, they switched the order.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:32.510
Choice a says 2x squared minus
3y times 2x squared plus 3y,

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.179
which is the same thing.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.929
You can switch orders when
you're multiplying, so the

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.140
answer is a.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.610
Next problem, problem 16.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.400
I'll switch colors
arbitrarily.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:51.850
Problem 16: Which product of
factors is equivalent to-- let

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.680
me copy and paste this because
this is an interesting-- so

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.860
let me copy and paste
this problem.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.450
OK, I've copied it, and now
let me paste it here.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.570
OK, which product of factors
is equivalent to that thing

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:09.010
over there?

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.340
So let's simplify that.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.090
That's my first impulse.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.060
No, no, no, we don't even
have to simplify it.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.960
This fits our same pattern,
right, if we can fit the

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.730
pattern a squared
minus b squared.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.550
So look at this thing.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:27.060
This has x plus 1 squared
minus y squared.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.560
So if we said that a is equal to
x plus 1 and b is equal to

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.950
y, then we fit the pattern.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.530
This is a squared
minus b squared.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.320
So then this thing can just
factor into a plus b

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.620
times a minus b.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.950
So what's a plus b?

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.440
It's x plus 1 plus y.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.530
That's a plus b.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:56.320
And then a minus b is
x plus 1 minus y.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.030
And that is choice d.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.890
That problem was easier than I
thought I was going to be.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.510
Choice d, right there.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.710
And I'm out of time again.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.990
I'll see you in the
next video.
