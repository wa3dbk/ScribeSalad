00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.430
Sorry for starting the
presentation with a cough.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.220
I think I still have a little
bit of a bug going around.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.980
But now I want to continue
with the 45-45-90 triangles.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.190
So in the last presentation we
learned that either side of a

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.830
45-45-90 triangle that isn't
the hypotenuse is equal to the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.600
square route of 2 over 2
times the hypotenuse.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.850
Let's do a couple
of more problems.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.680
So if I were to tell you that
the hypotenuse of this

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.010
triangle-- once again,
this only works for

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.760
45-45-90 triangles.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.870
And if I just draw one 45
you know the other angle's

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.780
got to be 45 as well.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.960
If I told you that the
hypotenuse here is,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.690
let me say, 10.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.510
We know this is a hypotenuse
because it's opposite

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.340
the right angle.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.680
And then I would ask you
what this side is, x.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.300
Well we know that x is equal
to the square root of 2 over

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.490
2 times the hypotenuse.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.440
So that's square root
of 2 over 2 times 10.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.700
Or, x is equal to 5
square roots of 2.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.990
Right?

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.910
10 divided by 2.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.160
So x is equal to 5
square roots of 2.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.630
And we know that this side
and this side are equal.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.900
Right?

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.490
I guess we know this is an
isosceles triangle because

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.280
these two angles are the same.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.770
So we also that this
side is 5 over 2.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.830
And if you're not
sure, try it out.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.460
Let's try the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.050
We know from the Pythagorean
theorem that 5 root 2 squared,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.420
plus 5 root 2 squared is equal
to the hypotenuse squared,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.090
where the hypotenuse is 10.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.130
Is equal to 100.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.170
Or this is just 25 times 2.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.855
So that's 50.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.590
But this is 100 up here.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.380
Is equal to 100.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.780
And we know, of course,
that this is true.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.620
So it worked.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.290
We proved it using the
Pythagorean theorem, and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.740
that's actually how we
came up with this formula

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.260
in the first place.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.820
Maybe you want to go back to
one of those presentations

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.590
if you forget how we
came up with this.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.890
I'm actually now going
to introduce another

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.620
type of triangle.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.160
And I'm going to do it the same
way, by just posing a problem

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.490
to you and then using the
Pythagorean theorem

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.980
to figure it out.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.780
This is another type
of triangle called a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.140
30-60-90 triangle.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.220
And if I don't have time
for this I will do

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.120
another presentation.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.965
Let's say I have a
right triangle.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.710
That's not a pretty one,
but we use what we have.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.920
That's a right angle.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.260
And if I were to tell you that
this is a 30 degree angle.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.940
Well we know that the
angles in a triangle

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.730
have to add up to 180.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.570
So if this is 30, this is 90,
and let's say that this is x.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.400
x plus 30 plus 90 is equal to
180, because the angles in

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.310
a triangle add up to 180.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.770
We know that x is equal to 60.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.600
Right?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.870
So this angle is 60.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.370
And this is why it's called a
30-60-90 triangle-- because

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.320
that's the names of the three
angles in the triangle.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.320
And if I were to tell you that
the hypotenuse is-- instead of

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.130
calling it c, like we always
do, let's call it h-- and I

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.020
want to figure out the other
sides, how do we do that?

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.700
Well we can do that
using pretty much the

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.210
Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.410
And here I'm going to
do a little trick.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.780
Let's draw another copy of this
triangle, but flip it over

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.990
draw it the other side.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.950
And this is the same triangle,
it's just facing the

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.690
other direction.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.910
Right?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.040
If this is 90 degrees
we know that these two

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.140
angles are supplementary.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.890
You might want to review the
angles module if you forget

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.980
that two angles that share kind
of this common line would

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.000
add up to 180 degrees.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.680
So this is 90, this
will also be 90.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.390
And you can eyeball it.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.010
It makes sense.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.040
And since we flip it, this
triangle is the exact

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.890
same triangle as this.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.130
It's just flipped
over the other side.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.400
We also know that this
angle is 30 degrees.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.510
And we also know that this
angle is 60 degrees.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.190
Right?

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.450
Well if this angle is 30
degrees and this angle is 30

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.490
degrees, we also know that this
larger angle-- goes all the way

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.230
from here to here--
is 60 degrees.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.770
Right?

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.760
Well if this angle is 60
degrees, this top angle is 60

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.920
degrees, and this angle on the
right is 60 degrees, then we

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.910
know from the theorem that we
learned when we did 45-45-90

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.860
triangles that if these two
angles are the same then the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.030
sides that they don't share
have to be the same as well.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.440
So what are the sides
they don't share?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.490
Well, it's this side
and this side.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.720
So if this side is h
then this side is h.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.200
Right?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.680
But this angle is
also 60 degrees.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.600
So if we look at this 60
degrees and this 60 degrees, we

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.760
know that the sides that they
don't share are also equal.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.800
Well they share this side, so
the sides that they don't share

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.370
are this side and this side.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.460
So this side is h, we also
know that this side is h.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.270
Right?

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.470
So it turns out that if you
have 60 degrees, 60 degrees,

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.680
and 60 degrees that all the
sides have the same lengths, or

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.810
it's an equilateral triangle.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.670
And that's something
to keep in mind.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.080
And that makes sense too,
because an equilateral triangle

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.830
is symmetric no matter
how you look at it.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.030
So it makes sense that all of
the angles would be the same

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.370
and all of the sides would
have the same length.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.420
But, hm.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.090
When we originally did this
problem we only used half of

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.050
this equilateral triangle.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.970
So we know this whole side
right here is of length h.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.670
But if that whole side is of
length h, well then this side

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.530
right here, just the base of
our original triangle-- and I'm

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.480
trying to be messy on purpose.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.490
We tried another color.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.180
This is going to be
half of that side.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.460
Right?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.890
Because that's h over 2,
and this is also h over 2.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.770
Right over here.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.990
So if we go back to our
original triangle, and we said

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.730
that this is 30 degrees and
that this is the hypotenuse,

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.540
because it's opposite the right
angle, we know that the side

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.350
opposite the 30 degree side
is 1/2 of the hypotenuse.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.140
And just a reminder,
how did we do that?

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.840
Well we doubled the triangle.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.570
Turned it into an
equilateral triangle.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.490
Figured out this whole
side has to be the same

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.490
as the hypotenuse.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.760
And this is 1/2 of
that whole side.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.420
So it's 1/2 of the hypotenuse.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.090
So let's remember that.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.060
The side opposite the 30 degree
side is 1/2 of the hypotenuse.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.530
Let me redraw that on another
page, because I think

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.120
this is getting messy.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.880
So going back to what
I had originally.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.570
This is a right angle.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.700
This is the hypotenuse--
this side right here.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:05.080
If this is 30 degrees, we just
derived that the side opposite

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.830
the 30 degrees-- it's like what
the angle is opening into--

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.180
that this is equal to
1/2 the hypotenuse.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.300
If this is equal to 1/2
the hypotenuse then what

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.450
is this side equal to?

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.660
Well, here we can use the
Pythagorean theorem again.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.685
We know that this side squared
plus this side squared-- let's

00:07:25.685 --> 00:07:31.470
call this side A-- is
equal to h squared.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:43.330
So we have 1/2 h squared plus A
squared is equal to h squared.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.370
This is equal to h squared
over 4 plus A squared,

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.690
is equal to h squared.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.630
Well, we subtract h
squared from both sides.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:08:01.270
We get A squared is equal to h
squared minus h squared over 4.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:07.930
So this equals h squared
times 1 minus 1/4.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:14.150
This is equal to 3/4 h squared.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.110
And once going that's
equal to A squared.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.710
I'm running out of space,
so I'm going to go all

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.730
the way over here.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:27.170
So take the square root of both
sides, and we get A is equal

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.920
to-- the square root of 3/4
is the same thing as the

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:36.270
square root of 3 over 2.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.510
And then the square root
of h squared is just h.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.350
And this A-- remember,
this is an area.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.990
This is what decides the
length of the side.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.630
I probably shouldn't
have used A.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:53.070
But this is equal to the square
root of 3 over 2, times h.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.670
So there.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.320
We've derived what all the
sides relative to the

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.320
hypotenuse are of a
30-60-90 triangle.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.360
So if this is a 60 degree side.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.750
So if we know the hypotenuse
and we know this is a 30-60-90

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.080
triangle, we know the side
opposite the 30 degree side

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.500
is 1/2 the hypotenuse.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.010
And we know the side opposite
the 60 degree side is the

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.410
square root of 3 over 2,
times the hypotenuse.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.250
In the next module I'll show
you how using this information,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.120
which you may or may not want
to memorize-- it's probably

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.950
good to memorize and practice
with, because it'll make you

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.850
very fast on standardized
tests-- how we can use this

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.740
information to solve the sides
of a 30-60-90 triangle

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.900
very quickly.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.780
See you in the next
presentation.
