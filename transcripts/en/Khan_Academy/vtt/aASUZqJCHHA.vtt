00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.840
Look at the two thermometers
below.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.450
Identify which is Celsius and
which is Fahrenheit, and then

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.600
label the boiling and freezing
points of water on each.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.490
Now, the Celsius scale
is what's used in

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.740
the most of the world.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.990
And the easy way to tell that
you're dealing with the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.810
Celsius scale is on the Celsius
scale, 0 degrees is

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.960
freezing of water at standard
temperature and pressure, and

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.300
100 degrees is the boiling point
of water at standard

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.570
temperature and pressure.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.180
Now, on the Fahrenheit scale,
which is used mainly in the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:01:02.360
United States, the freezing
point of water is 32 degrees,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.300
and boiling of water
is 212 degrees.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.670
As you could tell, Celsius,
the whole scale came from

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.160
using freezing as 0 of regular
water at standard temperature

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.990
and pressure and setting
100 to be boiling.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.120
On some level, it makes a little
bit more logical sense,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.790
but at least here in the U.S.,
we still use Fahrenheit.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.450
Now let's figure out which of
these are Fahrenheit and which

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.990
are Celsius.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.460
Now remember, regardless of
which thermometer you're

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.120
using, water will always
actually boil at the exact

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.850
same temperature.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.070
So Fahrenheit, 32 degrees, this
has to be the same thing

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.050
as Celsius 0 degrees.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.410
So let's see what happens.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.370
So when this temperature right
here is 0, this one over here,

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.650
it looks like it's negative
something.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.700
So this one right here doesn't
look like Celsius.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.610
Here, if we say this is Celsius,
this looks pretty

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.530
close to 32 on this one.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.660
Let me do that in
a darker color.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.780
So this one right here looks
like Celsius, and this one

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.300
right here looks like
Fahrenheit.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.550
And the way I was able to tell
is that the 0 degrees Celsius

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.759
needs to be the same thing
as 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.940
In both cases, this is
where water freezes,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.355
the freezing point.

00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:19.000
That is water freezing.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.900
And let's make sure
we're right.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.330
So if this is the Celsius scale,
this is where water

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.370
will boil, 100 degrees Celsius,
and that looks like

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.060
it is right about 212
on the other scale.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.210
So right there is where water
is boiling at standard

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.280
temperature and pressure.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.070
So this thing on the right,
right here, I guess I'll

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.890
circle it in orange,
that is Celsius.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.960
And then the one on the left,
I'll do it in magenta, the one

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.370
on the left is Fahrenheit.
