00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.580
In one game, a code made using
different colors is created by

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.340
one player, the codemaker,
and the other player, the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.670
codebreaker, tries to
guess the code.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.150
The codemaker gives hints about
whether the colors are

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.840
correct and in the
right position.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.890
All right.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.910
The possible colors are blue--
let me underline these in the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:31.340
actual colors-- blue, yellow,
white, red, orange and green.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.370
Green is already written in
green, but I'll underline it

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.120
in green again.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.780
And green.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.530
How many 4-color codes
can be made if the

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.970
colors cannot be repeated?

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.040
To some degree, this whole
paragraph in the beginning

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.590
doesn't even matter.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.120
If we're just choosing from--
let's see, we're choosing

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.170
from-- how many colors
are there?

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.230
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 colors,
and we're going to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.500
pick 4 of them.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.750
How many 4-color codes
can be made if the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.350
colors cannot be repeated?

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.470
And since these are codes, we're
going to assume that

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:15.050
blue, red, yellow and green,
that this-- that that is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:23.380
different than green, red,
yellow and blue.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.940
We're going to assume that these
are not the same code.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.970
Even though we've picked the
same 4 colors, we're going to

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.130
assume that these are 2
different codes, and that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.410
makes sense because we're
dealing with codes.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.080
So these are different codes.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.750
So this would count as 2
different codes right here,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.120
even though we've picked
the same actual colors.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.530
The same 4 colors,
we've picked them

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.310
in different orders.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.290
Now, with that out of the way,
let's think about how many

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.700
different ways we can
pick 4 colors.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.530
So let's say we have
4 slots here.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.920
1 slot, 2 slot, 3 slot
and 4 slots.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.290
And at first, we care only
about, how many ways can we

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.830
pick a color for that slot right
there, that first slot?

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.740
We haven't picked
any colors yet.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.410
Well, we have 6 possible colors,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.310
So there's going to be 6
different possibilities for

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.680
this slot right there.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.240
So let's put a 6 right there.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.520
Now, they told us that the
colors cannot be repeated, so

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.960
whatever color is in this slot,
we're going to take it

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.260
out of the possible colors.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.660
So now that we've taken that
color out, how many

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.430
possibilities are when we go
to this slot, when we go to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.640
the next slot?

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.030
How many possibilities
when we go to the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.240
next slot right here?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.280
Well, we took 1 of the 6 out for
the first slot, so there's

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.300
only 5 possibilities here.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.140
And by the same logic when we
go to the third slot, we've

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.480
used up 2 of the slots-- 2 of
the colors already, so there

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.940
would only 4 possible
colors left.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.940
And then for the last slot, we
would've used up 3 of the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.840
colors, so there's only
3 possibilities left.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.350
So if we think about all of the
possibilities, all of the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.790
permutations-- and permutations
are when you

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.880
think about all the
possibilities and you do care

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.910
about order; where you say that
this is different than

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.750
this-- this is a different
permutation than this.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.420
So all of the different
permutations here, when you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.190
pick 4 colors out of a possible
of 6 colors, it's

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.680
going to be 6 possibilities for
the first 1, times 5 for

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.900
the second bucket, times 4 for
the third or the third bucket

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.130
of the third position,
times 3.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.950
So 6 times 5 is 30, times
4 is times 3.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.776
So 30 times 12.

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:40.950
So this is 30 times 12, which is
equal to their 360 possible

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.680
4-color codes.
