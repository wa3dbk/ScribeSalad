00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.730
Find the place value
of 3 in 4,356.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.190
Now, whenever I think about
place value, and the more you

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.720
do practice problems on this
it'll become a little bit of

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.600
second nature, but whenever I
see a problem like this, I

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.320
like to expand out what 4,356
really is, so let me rewrite

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.880
the number.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.940
So if I were to write it--
and I'll write it

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.210
in different colors.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:33.420
So 4,356 is equal to--
and just think about

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.360
how I just said it.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:48.190
It is equal to 4,000 plus
300 plus 50 plus 6.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.600
And you could come up with that
just based on how we said

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.810
it: four thousand, three
hundred, and fifty-six.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.060
Now another way to think about
this is this is just like

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:07.520
saying this is 4 thousands
plus-- or you could even think

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.880
of "and"-- so plus 3 hundreds
plus 50, you could think of it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.040
as 5 tens plus 6.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.420
And instead of 6, we could
say plus 6 ones.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.620
And so if we go back to the
original number 4,356, this is

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.440
the same thing as 4--
I'll write it down.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.230
Let me see how well I can-- I'll
write it up like this.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:51.020
This is the same thing is 4
thousands, 3 hundreds, 5 tens

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.670
and then 6 ones.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.820
So when they ask what is the
place value of 3 into 4,356,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.120
we're concerned with
this 3 right here,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.260
and it's place value.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.090
It's in the hundreds place.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.970
If there was a 4 here, that
would mean we're dealing with

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.850
4 hundreds.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.850
If there's a 5, 5 hundreds.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.260
It's the third from the right.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.410
This is the ones place.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.500
That's 6 ones, 5 tens,
3 hundreds.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.190
So the answer here is it is
in the hundreds place.
