00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.020
Write six hundred forty-five
million five hundred

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.150
eighty-four thousand
four hundred

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.600
sixty-two in standard form.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.000
So let's tackle this
piece by piece.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.059
So the first part we
have six hundred

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.703
and forty-five million.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.580
So let's think about that.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.900
So we have six hundred
and forty-five.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.790
But it's not just six
hundred forty-five.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.540
We have six hundred forty-five
millions.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.960
So we could view that as
645 times 1,000,000.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.410
One million is one followed
by six zeroes.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.940
So this piece right here is
this right over here.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.840
That is six hundred and
forty-five million.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.350
And what is that when
we write it out?

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.675
If we were to multiply this
out, this is equal to-- it

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:57.800
would be 645 times this 1 with
six zeroes behind it.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.920
So this would be equal to 600--
I'll write it like this.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.690
This is equal to 645, and then
we have our six zeroes.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.560
One, two, three, one,
two, three.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.860
That's just this part
of the number.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.510
And I'm going to do it kind
of slow and do all of the

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.710
different parts of the problem,
but once you get some

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.610
practice, you'll find that these
are a bit second nature,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.240
and you won't have to go through
all of these steps.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.240
You'll just be able to
write the number.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.790
Now, let's move on
to the next part.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.680
We have five hundred
and eighty-four.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.010
Let me write that down.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.300
Well, I'll write it like this.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.070
584 thousand.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.100
So let me write the thousand.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.760
So 584 thousand.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.300
So it's 584 times 1,000.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.870
And what's that going
to look like?

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.600
So that's this whole
part right here.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.400
So 584 times 1,000
is equal to what?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.840
Well, it's going to be 584 with
three zeroes behind it,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.863
or you could view it as 584
times the 1, and then you're

00:02:01.863 --> 00:02:04.010
going to have three zeroes
in the final answer.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.620
So it's going to be 584,000.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.400
We have our three zeroes
at the end.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.030
584, three zeroes.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.250
So that's that part.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.910
And then finally, we have four
hundred sixty-two, and that's

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.960
just 462, straight up.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.330
You could view it as 462 ones.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.280
So then you just
have 462, which

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.280
obviously equals just 462.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.430
Now our number is all
of these combined.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.450
It is 645,000,000 and
584,000 and 462.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.000
So one way to think about it
is that you could add these

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.330
three numbers.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:03:08.300
So if we were to add them,
we get 645,584,462.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.570
Now, I said it'll become a
little bit of second nature to

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.230
you in a little bit, and the way
to think about that, the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.040
easiest way to think about that,
is millions will have

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.600
six zeroes behind them,
thousands will have three

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.290
zeroes behind them, and just
regular numbers have no zeroes

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.350
behind them.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.940
So what you can do when you
kind of want to learn it

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.020
second nature, you'll just look
at the six hundred and

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.060
forty-five million, so you'll
write 645, and you'll kind of

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.320
keep in the back of your mind
that you're going to have to

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.310
have six more digits to
the right of this.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.720
And then you say five hundred
and eighty-four thousand, so

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.030
then you have your five hundred
and eighty-four

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.320
thousand, so then you write that
down, 584,000, keeping in

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.620
mind that you're going to
need three digits to

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.530
the right of that.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.470
And so if they didn't tell us
462, we would just put three

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.270
zeroes here, and that would also
fulfill the six zeroes we

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.490
need behind 645,000,000.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.830
But then they tell us 462, so we
just write that right here.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.350
462.
