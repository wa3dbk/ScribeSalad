00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.970
We've talked a lot about
linear transformations.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.070
What I want to do in this video,
and actually the next

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.550
few videos, is to show you how
to essentially design linear

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.230
transformations to do things
to vectors that you

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.850
want them to do.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.140
So we already know that
if I have some linear

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:23.780
transformation, T, and it's a
mapping from Rn to Rm, then we

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.850
can represent T-- what T does
to any vector in x, or the

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.350
mapping of T of x in Rn to Rm--
we could represent it as

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.570
some matrix times the vector
x, where this would

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.200
be an m by n matrix.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.710
And we know that we can always
construct this matrix, that

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.830
any linear transformation
can be represented by

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.840
a matrix this way.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.160
And we can represent it by
taking our identity matrix,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.570
you've seen that before, with
n rows and n columns, so it

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.650
literally just looks
like this.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.970
So it's a 1, and then it has n
minus 1, 0's all the way down.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.600
Then it's a 0, 1, and
everything else is

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.890
0's all the way down.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.110
And so essentially you just
have 1's down as diagonal.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.580
It's an n by n matrix.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.860
All of these are 0's,
just like that.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.700
You take your identity matrix
and you perform the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.550
transformation on each
of its columns.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.890
We call each of these columns
the standard basis Rn.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.180
So this is column e1,
this is column e2,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.890
and it has n columns.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.040
en.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.490
And each of these columns are
of course members of Rn

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.650
because this is n rows
and n columns matrix.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.140
And we know that A, our matrix
A, can be represented as the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.040
transformation being operated
on each of these columns.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.670
So the transformation on e1, and
the transformation on e2,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.930
so forth and so on,
all the way to the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.880
transformation to en.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.290
And this is a really useful
thing to know because it's

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.320
very easy to operate any
transformation on each of

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.060
these basis vectors that only
have a 1 in its corresponding

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.580
dimension, or with respect to
the corresponding variable,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.360
and everything else is 0.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.380
So all of this is review.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.430
Let's actually use this
information to construct some

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.180
interesting transformations.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.740
So let's start with some
set in our Rn.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.880
And actually everything I'm
going to do is going to be in

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.070
R2, but you can extend a lot
of this into just general

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.130
dimensions.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.390
But we're dealing with
R2 right here.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.610
Obviously, it's only 2
dimensions right here.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.470
Let's say we have a triangle
formed by the points, let's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.480
say the first point
is right here.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.860
Let's say it's the point 3, 2.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.760
And then you have the point,
let's say that your next point

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.960
in your triangle, is the point,
let's just make it the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.210
point minus 3, 2.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.170
I shouldn't have written
that as a fraction.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.510
I don't know why I did that.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.950
3, 2.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.430
Then you have the point
minus 3, 2.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.300
And that's this point
right here.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.710
Minus 3, 2.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.320
And then let's say, just for
fun, let's say you have the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.660
point, or the vector-- the
position vector, right?

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.910
3, minus 2.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.470
Which is right here.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.170
Now each of these are position
vectors, and I can draw them.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.790
I could draw this 3, 2 as in
the standard position by

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.820
drawing an arrow like that.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.500
I could do the minus 3,
2 in its standard

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.760
position like that.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.960
And 3, minus 2 I could
draw like that.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.170
But more than the actual
position vectors, I'm more

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.960
concerned with the positions
that they specify.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.150
And we know that if we take
the set of all of the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.640
positions or all of the position
vectors that specify

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.050
the triangle that is essentially
formed by

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.700
connecting these dots.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.660
The transformation of this set--
so we're going to apply

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.850
some transformation of that--
is essentially, you can take

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.310
the transformation of each of
these endpoints and then you

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.080
connect the dots in
the same order.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.870
And we saw that several
videos ago.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.925
But let's actually design
a transformation here.

00:04:30.925 --> 00:04:33.770
So let's say we want to-- let's
just write down and

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.180
words what we want to
do with whatever we

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.430
start in our domain.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.100
Let's say we want to reflect
around the x-axis.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.390
Reflect around-- well
actually let's

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.380
reflect around the y-axis.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.670
We essentially want
to flip it over.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.230
We want to flip it
over that way.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.690
So I'm kind of envisioning
something that'll look

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.475
something like that when
we flip it over.

00:05:02.475 --> 00:05:04.740
So we're going to reflect
it around the y-axis.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:14.490
And let's say we want to stretch
in y direction by 2.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.730
In y direction times 2.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.080
So what I envision, we're
going to flip

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.440
it over like this.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.670
What I just drew here.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.775
And then we want to stretch
it, so we're going

00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:26.710
to first flip it.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.020
That's kind of a step 1.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.930
And then step 2 is we're
going to stretch it.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.890
So instead of looking like this,
it'll be twice as tall,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.760
so it'll look like this.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.960
Without necessarily
stretching the x.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.570
So how can we do that?

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.990
So the first idea of reflecting

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.580
around the y axis, right?

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.030
So what we want is, this point,
that was a minus 3 in

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.370
the x-coordinate right there, we
want this point to have its

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.720
same y-coordinate.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.910
We want it to still
have a 2 there.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.510
And I'm calling the second
coordinate here our

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.100
y-coordinate.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.690
I could call that our x2
coordinate, but we're used to

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.810
dealing with the y coordinate
when we graph things.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.280
So I'll just keep calling
it the y-coordinate.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.670
But we want is this negative
3 to turn to a positive 3.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.680
Because we want this point
to end up over here.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.300
And we want this positive 3
here to end up becoming a

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.090
negative 3 over here.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.980
And we want this positive 3 for
the x-coordinate to end up

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.770
as a negative 3 over there.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.480
So you can imagine all
we're doing is we're

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.070
flipping the sign.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.160
This reflection around y, this
is just equivalent to flipping

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.810
the sign, flipping the sign
of the x-coordinate.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.950
So this statement right here is
equivalent to minus 1 times

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.110
the x-coordinate.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.050
So let's call that times x1.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.440
Because this is x1.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.480
And then stretching in
the y direction.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.190
So what does that mean?

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.180
That means that whatever height
we have here-- so this

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.735
next step here is whatever
height we have here-- I want

00:06:58.735 --> 00:07:00.240
it to be 2 times as much.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.030
So right here this coordinate
is 3, 2.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.210
If I didn't do this first
step first, I'd want

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.450
to make it 3, 4.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.860
I want to make it 2 times
the y-coordinate.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.870
So the next thing I want to do
is I want to 2 times-- well I

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.830
can either call it, let me just
call it the y-coordinate.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.720
It's a little bit different
convention that I've been

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.540
using, but I'm just calling
these vectors-- instead of

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.520
calling them x1, and x2, I'm
saying that my vectors in R2--

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.950
the first term I'm calling the
x term, or the x entry, and

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.010
the second term I'm calling
the y entry.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.980
But it's the same idea that
we've been doing before.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.460
I'm just switching to this
notation because we're used to

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.260
thinking of this as the y-axis
access as opposed to the x1

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.150
and x2 axis.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.910
So how do we construct
this transformation?

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.000
I mean, I can write it down in
kind of transformation words.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.140
I could say-- I could define
my transformation as T

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.220
of some vector x.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.380
Let me write it this way.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:05.690
T of some vector x, y is going
to be equal to-- I want to

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.260
take minus 1 times the x, so
I'm going to minus the x.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.860
And I'm going to multiply
2 times the y.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.950
So that's how I could just write
it in transformation

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.780
language, and that's pretty
straight forward.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.740
But how would I actually
construct a matrix for this?

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.310
So what you do is, you
just take your--

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.620
we're dealing in R2.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.450
So you start off with the
identity matrix in R2, which

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.840
is just 1, 0, 0, 1.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.809
And you apply this
transformation to each of the

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.596
columns of this identity
matrix.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.789
So if you apply the
transformation to this first

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.700
column, what do you get?

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.130
So what we're going to do is
to create a new matrix, A.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.030
And say that is equal to the
transformation of-- let me

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:59.340
write it like this--
Transformation of 1, 0.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.710
That is going to be our new
column, we're just going to

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.130
transform this column.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.720
And the second column is going
to be the transformation of

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.340
that column.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.130
So it's a transformation
of 0, 1.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.570
Just like that.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.340
And so what are these
equal to?

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.850
The transformation of 1, 0.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.830
So let me write it down
here in green.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.120
So A is equal to?

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.150
What's the transformation
of 1, 0 where x is 1?

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.060
Where we just take the minus
of the x term, so

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.930
we get minus 1.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.100
And then 2 times the y term.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.830
So 2 times 0 is just 0.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.160
Now do the second term.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.920
The minus of the 0 term
is just minus 0.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.560
So that just stays 0.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.740
Then you multiply 2
times the y term.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.235
So 2 times y is going to be
equal to 2 times 1, so it's

00:09:47.235 --> 00:09:48.830
equal to 2.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.140
So now we can describe this
transformation-- so now we

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.960
could say the transformation
of some vector, x, y.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.460
We can describe it as a
matrix-vector product.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:08.040
It is equal to minus 1, 0,
0, 2, times our vector.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.510
Times x, y.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.880
And let's apply it to verify
that it works.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.370
To verify that our
matrix works.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.470
So this first point, and I'll
try to do it color coded,

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.490
let's do this first
point right here.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.370
This is minus 3, 2.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.910
So that's minus 3, 2.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:32.200
So what is minus 3, 2-- I'll
do it right over here.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.740
I could just look at that.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:44.080
So what minus 1, 0, 0,
2, times minus 3, 2?

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.070
Well this is just a straight
up matrix-vector product.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:52.570
Minus 1 times minus 3 is
positive 3 plus 0 times 2.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.700
So plus 0.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.260
So this is 3.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.010
And then 0 times minus 3 is 0.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.230
Plus 2 times 2.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.510
This is 3, 4.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:07.410
So that point right there will
now become the point 3, 4.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.180
It now becomes that
point right there.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.690
Let's look at this point right
here, the point 3, 2.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.090
So let's take our transformation
matrix, minus

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:23.220
1, 0, 0, 2, times 3, 2.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:29.010
This is equal to minus 1 times
3 is minus 3 plus 0 times 2.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.205
So it's just minus 3.

00:11:30.205 --> 00:11:32.940
And you have 0 times
3, which is 0.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.830
Plus 2 times 2, which is 4.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.440
0 plus-- so you got
that point.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.590
So this point, by our
transformation, T, becomes

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.970
minus 3, 4.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.430
So minus 3, 4.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.530
And I kind of switch
in my terminology.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.460
I said, becomes, or you could
say it's mapped to if you want

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.510
to use the language that I used
when I introduced the

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.620
ideas of functions and
transformation.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.720
This point is mapped to
this point in R2.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.550
And then finally let's look at
this point right here, apply

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.090
our transformation matrix
that we've engineered.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:12.590
Let's multiply minus 1, 0, 0,
2, times this point right

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.730
here, which is 3, minus 2.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.960
Which is equal to minus
1 times 3 is minus 3.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.810
And then 0 times minus
2 is just 0.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.220
So this just becomes minus 3.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.300
And then 0 times 3 is 0.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.290
2 times minus 2 is minus 4.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.470
So minus 3, minus 4.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:39.320
So this point right here becomes
minus 3, minus 4.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.400
Becomes that point
right there.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.670
And we know that the set in R2
that connects these dots, by

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.640
the same transformation, will
be mapped to the set in R3

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.750
that connects these dots.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.480
We've seen that already.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.920
I think that was 3 videos ago.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.410
So the image of this set that
I've drawn here, this triangle

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.360
is just a set of points
specified by a set of vectors.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.460
The image of that set of
position vectors specifies

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.060
these points right here.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.480
Specifies the points that
I'm drawing right here.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.440
Let me see if I'm
doing it right.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.490
There you go, just like that.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.450
And low and behold, it has done
what we wanted to do.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.830
We flipped it over, so that we
got this side onto the other

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:25.920
side, like that.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.490
And then we stretched it.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.060
And we stretched it in
the y direction.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.200
And we we see that it has
stretched by a factor of 2.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.340
We flipped it first, and
then we stretched it

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.700
by factor of 2.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.940
And, in general, any of these
operations can be performed--

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.040
I mean, you can always go
back to the basics.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.520
You can always say, look I can
write my transformation in

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.340
this type of form, then
I can just apply

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.590
that to my basis vectors.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.420
Or the columns in my
identity matrix.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.070
But a general theme is any of
these transformations that

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.725
literally just scale in either
the x or y direction, and when

00:14:00.725 --> 00:14:03.640
I-- or, well, you could
say, scale.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.970
They can either shrink
or expand

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.280
in the x or y direction.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.400
Or flip in the x or y direction,
creating a

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.280
reflection.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.460
These are going to be
diagonal matrices.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.740
Diagonal matrices.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.430
And why are they diagonal
matrices?

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.870
Because they only have non-zero

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.395
terms along their diagonals.

00:14:27.395 --> 00:14:28.840
This is the 2 by 2 case.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.270
If I did a 3 by 3, it would be
0's everywhere, except along

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.210
the diagonal.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.020
And it makes a lot of sense
because this first term is

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.890
essentially what you're
doing to the x1 term.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.130
The second term is what you're
doing to the x2 term.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.900
Or the y term in our example.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.640
If I had multiple terms, if this
was a 3 by 3, that would

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.680
be what I would do to
the third dimension.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.900
Then the next term would
be what I would

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.020
do the fourth dimension.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.430
So you could expand this idea
to an arbitrary Rn.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.370
Anyway, the whole point of this
video is to introduce you

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.550
to this idea of creating
custom transformations.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.150
And I think you're already
starting to realize that this

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.540
could be very useful if you
want to do-- especially in

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.610
computer programming-- if
you're going to do some

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.330
graphics or create some type
of multi-dimensional games.
