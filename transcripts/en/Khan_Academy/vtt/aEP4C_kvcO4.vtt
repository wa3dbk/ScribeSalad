00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.630
Now that you've been introduced
into some of the other

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.665
functions that we can take a
derivative of, we can now

00:00:05.665 --> 00:00:07.700
apply them using the chain
and the product rule.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.770
So let's do some
fun derivatives.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.750
And I think derivatives is
all about exposure, it's

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.690
all about practice.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.780
So I just encourage you to do
as much practice as possible.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.540
And it's actually in some ways
a pretty mechanical thing to do

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.190
and it's easier than a lot of
the math that you've

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.740
learned before.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.360
Just maybe initially
looks a little abstract.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:37.590
So let's say that f of x is
equal to let's say the sin

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.910
of 3x to the fifth plus 2x.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.520
So what is f prime of x?

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.940
What is the derivative
of this function?

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.410
Well, we use the
chain rule again.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.860
We take the derivative
of the inside.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.140
So what's the derivative
of the inside?

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:03.800
Well, that's just 5 times 3 is
15 x to the fourth plus 2.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.100
And then we take the derivative
of the larger function.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.030
In the last presentation
we learned the derivative

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.700
of sin is what?

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.600
It's cosine.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.370
So it's times the cosine of
this expression right here.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.010
3x to the fifth plus 2x.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.330
Pretty painless, no?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.380
Let's mix it up even more.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.030
Let's say that-- let me
switch colors just to

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.700
not be monotonous.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.290
I'll pick powder blue.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.530
Very nice.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.450
Let's say that y-- and I'm
going to switch notation on

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.700
purpose that you get used to
the various notations

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.150
you can use.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.310
Let's say that y is equal to--
let me think of something

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:59.580
good-- e to the x times
cosine to the fifth of x.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.460
That looks daunting to me.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.570
Let's see if we can break
it down using the product

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.550
and the chain rules.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.760
We want to figure out dy/dx.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.740
We want to figure out
the rate at which y

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.680
changes relative to x.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.500
Or the derivative.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.750
Find the derivative
of both sides.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.800
Well, let's use
the product rule.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.830
Well, we're going to have
to use the chain and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.130
the product rules.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.060
So first we take the derivative
of this first term, and once

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.320
again we learned in the last
presentation the most amazing

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.070
fact, one of the most amazing
facts in the universe that the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.670
derivative of either
the x is what?

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.480
It is e to the x.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.490
Blows my mind.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.330
e to the x.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.560
Once again I've taken the
derivative, and it's

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.720
the same expression.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.050
Amazing.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.070
And then I multiply it
times a second expression.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.420
Cosine to the fifth of x.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.800
And now to that I add
the derivative of the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.730
second expression.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.500
Now this will be a little
bit more interesting.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.150
So this is cosine
of x to the fifth.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.780
This is just another way
of writing cosine of

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.310
x to the fifth power.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.930
And I think that'll make it a
little bit more clear, that

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.050
this cosine superscript
5, this is really just

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.120
cosine to the fifth x.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.980
This means cosine
of x to the fifth.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.730
So now the derivative is
a little bit clearer.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.750
We can use the chain rule--
and once again, we're just

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.270
working on this right half.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.060
We take the derivative
of the inside.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.480
What's the derivative
of cosine of x?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.760
Yep you're right.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.230
Well, I don't know, I didn't
hear you so I don't know.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.175
I'll assume you're right.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:32.070
The derivative of cosine of x
is minus sin of x, and that's

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.526
something you should memorize,
although you should prove

00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:35.085
it to yourself as well.

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:39.360
So we take the derivative
of the inside minus sin.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.680
Derivative of cosine of x is
minus sin of x, and then we

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.900
take the derivative
of the outside.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.220
We're just doing
the chain rule.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.190
So it's 5 cosine to
the fourth of x.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.640
So there we took the derivative
of this piece, and then we have

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.830
to multiply times
this first piece.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.340
So that times e to the x.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.130
Interesting.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.230
You can simplify this if you
want, but you get the point.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.030
I mean simplifying it from
this point is really

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.460
just kind of algebra.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.990
And I think you get the idea.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.590
Actually everything
we're doing is algebra.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.340
If you realize it looks like
something fairly complicated,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.870
but we just use the chain
and the product rules.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.850
Let's do some more.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.600
I will now switch to magenta.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.260
We want to take the derivative
dy/dx of-- let's see,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.300
some big expression.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.570
let me do something creative.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:49.920
Let's say the natural log
of x over 3x plus 10.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.500
So the natural log of
x over 3x plus 10.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.470
So you could use the quotient
rule if you took the time to

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.770
memorize it, which I've never
taught you because it's really

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.550
just the product rule.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.240
So I like to just rewrite
this as the product rule.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.310
So they're the same thing.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.280
Once again we're taking the
derivative, so I'm not going to

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.830
keep rewriting this, but this
is the same thing as taking the

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:21.825
derivative of the natural log
of x times 3x plus ten to

00:05:21.825 --> 00:05:23.700
the negative 1 power.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.695
3x plus 10 in the denominator
is the same thing as 1 over 3x

00:05:26.695 --> 00:05:29.720
plus 10, which is the same
thing as 3x plus 10 to

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.990
the negative 1 power.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.610
Now we can use the combination
of the product and the

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.800
chain rules, and we
can solve this sucker.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.160
So let's do it.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.150
So we take the derivative of
this first term the natural log

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.142
of x-- and we learned in the
last presentation the

00:05:46.142 --> 00:05:49.330
derivative of the natural log
of x is 1/x, which is

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.980
pretty cool in of itself.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.560
And we multiply that
times a second term.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:00.480
So time 3x plus 10 to
the negative 1 power.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.270
And to that we add the
derivative of the second term,

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.430
and we're going to multiply
that times the first term.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.370
So first we're going to have
to use the chain rule.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.710
We take the derivative
of the inside.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.800
Well the derivative of
the inside's easy.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.990
The derivative of 3x x plus 10.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.900
That's just 3.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.750
And then we take the derivative
of the whole thing,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.010
so it's negative 1.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.930
That's 3 times negative
1 times that whole

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.340
expression to the minus 2.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.800
3x plus 10.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.420
And of course this whole thing
times the natural log of x.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.980
We could simplify that.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.290
Let's see.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.170
This is 1/x and 3x plus
10 to negative 1.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:48.090
So we could rewrite this
as 1 over x 3x plus 10.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.200
Let's see.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.550
Plus 3 times minus 1.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.808
So we could say that's the
same thing as minus 3 ln of

00:06:57.808 --> 00:07:03.910
x over 3x plus 10 squared.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.620
I think you see how I
got from here to here.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.180
I just manipulated the
exponents and multiplied some

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.760
numbers, et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.080
Let's do one more.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.250
Just hit the point home.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.710
You really have the tools now
at your disposal to do a

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.180
lot of derivative problems.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.640
Probably most of the derivative
problems you'll face in the

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.770
first 1/2 year of calculus.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.870
I'm going to switch to green.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.720
Let's say y-- actually
I'm tired of y.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:44.550
Let's say that p is equal
to-- I don't know.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:51.510
Sin of x over cosine of x.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.996
Let's figure out what dp/dx.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.110
The rate at which
p changes to x.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:04.510
So once again this is the same
thing as sin of x times cosine

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.600
of x to the negative 1.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.140
So we can just do the
product and chain rules.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.200
So the derivative
of the first term.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.370
Derivative of sin of x
is cosine of x, times

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.990
the second term.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:23.270
Times cosine of x
to the minus 1.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.560
And then to that we add the
derivative of the second term.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.460
We have to use the
chain real here.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.590
So we take the derivative
of the inside.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:35.070
Well derivative of cosine
x is minus sin of x.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.910
And then times the
derivative of the outside.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:46.580
well that's minus 1 cosine of x
to the minus 2, and then we

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.810
multiply that times the
first term, sin of x.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.890
So let's simplify that.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.080
So this is cosine of x
divided by cosine of x.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.320
You see how this cancels out?

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.830
This is cosine of x over cosine
of x, so this is equal to 1.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.160
Cosine of x divided
cosine of x is 1.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:11.830
And then this minus sin cancels
out with this minus sin, and

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:16.165
we have sin times sin
over cosine squared.

00:09:16.165 --> 00:09:17.480
So this is equal to 1.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.440
I'm going kind of fast because
I'm about to run out of time,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.720
but I think you get
what I'm doing.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:28.470
So this is sin squared x over
cosine squared x, which

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.430
is actually equal to--
what's sin over cosine?

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.800
1 plus 10 squared x.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.480
And if you know your trig
identities, that equals 1

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.980
over cosine squared of x.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.890
And, of course, what we just
proved is that the derivative

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.200
of the tangent of x is equal
to the secant squared of x.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.930
I hope I thoroughly confused
you in that last problem.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:54.730
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
