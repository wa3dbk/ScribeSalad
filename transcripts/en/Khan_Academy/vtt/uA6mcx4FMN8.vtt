00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.580
We're on problem 58.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.040
The graph of the equation y is
equal to x squared minus 3x

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.300
minus 4 is shown below.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.270
Fair enough.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.380
For what value or values
of x is y equal to 0?

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.350
So they're essentially
saying is, when does

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.470
this here equal 0?

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.030
They want to know when
does y equal 0?

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.590
So what values of x
does that happen?

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.180
And we could factor this and
solve for the roots, but they

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.970
drew us the graph, so let's
just inspect it.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.270
So when does y equal 0?

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.180
So let me draw the line
of y is equal to 0.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.590
So that's right here.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.130
Let me draw it as a line.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.160
y equals 0.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.970
That's y equals 0 right there.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.240
So what values of x
makes y equal 0?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.970
If I can see this properly,
it's when x is equal to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.330
negative 1 and when
x is equal to 4.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.715
So x is equal to negative
1 or 4.

00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:53.480
And if we substitute either of
these values into this right

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.240
here, we should get
y is equal to 0.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.850
And let's see.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.850
The choices, do they have
negative 1 and 4?

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.180
Yep, sure enough.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.150
Negative 1 and 4 right there.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.450
Next question, 59.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.720
Let me copy and paste it.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.190
OK, I've copied it.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.450
I'll paste it below.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.300
I'll do it right
on top of this.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.730
There you go.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.280
59.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.560
Let me erase this stuff
right here.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.960
This is unrelated
to this problem.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.970
So they are asking-- let me get
the pen right-- which best

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.060
represents the graph of
y is equal to minus x

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.470
squared plus 3?

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.020
So here, just to get an
intuition of what parabolas

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.205
look like, because these are all
parabolas, or the graph of

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:48.010
a quadratic equation.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.230
So if I had the graph of y is
equal to x squared, what does

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.010
that look like?

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.380
Let me just draw a quick and
dirty x- and y-axis.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.510
And I think you're familiar
with what that looks like.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.750
So if I were to just draw y is
equal to x squared, that looks

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.855
something like this.

00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:07.750
It looks something like this.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.210
It will look something
like that.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.930
I think you're familiar
with it.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.270
Because you're taking x squared,
you always get

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.160
positive values.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.930
Even if you have a negative
number squared that still

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.870
becomes a positive.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.740
And it's symmetric around the
line x is equal to 0.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.180
That's the graph of y
equals x squared.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.910
Now let me ask you a question.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.600
What is the graph of y is equal
to minus x squared?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.370
Let me do that.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.680
y is equal to minus x squared.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.430
So it's essentially the same
thing as this graph, but it's

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.150
going to be the negative
of whatever you get.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.860
So here, x squared is always
going to be positive.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.510
You square any real number
and you're going to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.670
get a positive number.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.370
Here, you square any real
number, this part right here

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.070
becomes positive.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.430
But then you take the
negative of it.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.470
So this is always going to
be a negative number.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.520
So x equals 0 is still going to
be there, but regardless of

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.667
whether you go in the positive
x direction or the negative x

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:01.550
direction, this is going
to be positive.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.460
But then you put the
negative sign, it's

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.330
going to become negative.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.806
So the graph is going
to look like this.

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:08.580
The graph is going to
look like that.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.650
I didn't draw that well, let
me give that another shot.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.100
The graph is going to
look like that.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.270
It's essentially like the mirror
image of this one if

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.210
you were to reflect
it on the x-axis.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.820
This is y equals minus
x squared.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.150
So now you're pointing
it down.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.440
The u goes-- opens
up downward.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.990
And hopefully that makes
a little bit of sense.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.200
And now, what happens if
you do plus or minus 3?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.650
So what is y is equal
to x squared plus 3?

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.820
Not minus x squared plus 3,
but just x squared plus 3.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.410
So if you start with x squared,
now every y value for

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.450
every given x is just going
to be 3 higher.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.390
So it's just going to shift
the graph up by 3.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.910
It's going to look like that.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.190
So if you go from x squared to
x squared plus 3, you're just

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.690
shifting up by 3.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.890
Similar, if you go from minus
x squared to minus x squared

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.200
plus 3, which is what they gave
us in the problem, you're

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.375
just going to shift
the graph up by 3.

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:05.550
So I'll do that in
this brown color.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.500
So it's just going to take this
graph, which is minus x

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.590
squared and you're going
to shift it up by 3.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.840
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.200
It's going to look something
like that.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.610
So let's see, out of all the
choices they gave us, it

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.740
should be opening downward and
it should have its y-intercept

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.520
at y is equal to 3.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.950
If you put x is equal to
0, y is equal to 3.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.750
So let's see.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.290
It's opening downwards.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.650
So these two are the only two
that are opening downwards.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.620
And the y-intercept should
be at 3 because we

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.780
shifted it up by 3.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.900
So this is the choice B.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.470
Problem 60.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.400
Which quadratic funtion, when
graphed, has x-intercepts of 4

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.180
and minus 3?

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.860
So x-intercepts of 4 and minus
3 means that when you

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.880
substitute x of either of
these values into the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.450
equation, you get
y is equal to 0.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.630
Because when y is equal to 0,
you're at the x-intercepts.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.370
This is when y equals to 0.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.620
So that's what they mean
by x-intercepts.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.240
So how do we set up an equation
where if I put in one

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.170
of these numbers I'm
going to get 0?

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:16.090
Well, if I make it the product
of x minus the first root and

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.790
x minus the second root.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.040
So x minus minus
3 is x plus 3.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.720
So think about it.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.790
If you put 4 here for x, you
get 4 minus 4, which is 0.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:27.940
Times 4 plus 3 is 7.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.080
So 0 times 7 is 0.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.350
So that works.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.880
And then, for minus 3.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.780
Minus 3 minus 4 is minus 7.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.960
But then minus 3
plus 3 is a 0.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.880
So either of these, when you
substitute it into this

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.820
expression, you get 0.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.185
Let's see, which
choice is that?

00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:49.210
x minus 4 times x plus 3.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:57.590
Have the x-intercepts
of 4 and minus 3.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.350
Right.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.610
This should be right.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.920
They're being tricky
right here.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.620
So x plus 3 is there.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.330
I see that in a couple
of them, right?

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.990
But I don't see the x
minus 4 anywhere.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.910
But that's because we can
multiply this by any constant.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.350
Because 0 times some number
times some constant is still

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.440
going to be 0.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.270
So if you look at this one
right here, 2x minus 8.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.030
We could factor out a 2.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.460
That's the same thing as
2 times x minus 4.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.720
So choice B is x plus 3,
times x minus 4, times

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.100
some constant 2.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.740
So choice B is our answer.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.560
If this is equal to 0 when x is
equal to 4 minus 3, this--

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.220
any constant, x minus 4 times x
plus 3--I that's still going

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.260
to be equal to 0.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.915
Because when x is equal
to 4, this is going

00:06:47.915 --> 00:06:48.740
to be equal to 0.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.450
So 0 times anything times
anything else

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.190
is going to be 0.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.070
Same thing with x is
equal to minus 3.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.710
So they just put a 2 here.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.600
That's a good problem.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.910
It made you realize that you
could put a constant in there

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.110
and it's a little tricky.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.360
Next problem.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:16.130
OK, so they want to know-- let
me copy and paste it-- how

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.650
many times does the graph of y
equals 2x squared minus 2x

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.170
plus 3 intersect the x-axis?

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.450
So the easiest thing-- because
maybe it doesn't intersect the

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.420
x-axis at all.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.450
Maybe if you use a quadratic
equation

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.650
there are no real solutions.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.280
So let's just apply
the quadratic.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.670
So the roots or the times that--
I guess the x values

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:42.650
that solve this equation, 2x
squared minus 2x plus 3 is

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.030
equal to 0.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.540
And these are the x
values where you

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.730
intersect the x-axis.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.500
And why do I say that?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.820
Because the x-axis is the
line y is equal to 0.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.200
So I set y equal to
0 and I get this.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.530
And we know from the quadratic
equation the solution to this

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.680
is negative b-- let me do
this in another color.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.210
So negative b.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.500
So minus minus 2 is 2.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.370
Plus or minus the square
root of b squared.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.100
Minus 2 squared is 4.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:16.320
Minus 4 times a, which is 2.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.220
Times c, times 3.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.860
All of that over 2a.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.670
2 times 2, which is 4.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.840
Now they don't want
us to figure out

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.500
the roots or anything.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.420
They just want to know,
how many times does it

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.570
intersect the axis?

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.750
So let's think about this.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.140
What happens under this
radical sign?

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.350
We have 4 times 2
times 3 is 24.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:37.970
So this becomes 2 plus or
minus 4 minus 24 over 4.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.960
This is minus 20.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.010
So you end up with minus 20
under the radical sign.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.220
And we know if we're dealing
with real numbers, if we want

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.430
real solutions, you can't take
the square root of minus 20.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.040
So this actually has no
solutions or, another way to

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.700
put it is, there is no x values
where y is equal to 0.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.720
Or another way to put it
is, this never does

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.820
intersect the x-axis.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.680
So it's A.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.270
none.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.970
What gave that away was the fact
that when you apply the

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.750
quadratic equation, you get a
negative number under the

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.410
radical sign.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.570
So if we're dealing
with real numbers,

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.340
there's no answer there.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.590
Next question.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:27.700
62.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.260
An object that is projected
straight down-- oh, this is

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.070
good, this is projectile
motion-- is projected straight

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.650
downward with initial velocity
v feet per second, Travels a

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.400
distance of s v times t plus
16t squared, where t equals

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.580
time in seconds.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.520
If Ramon is standing on a
balcony 84 feet above the

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.170
ground and throws a penny
straight down with an initial

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.760
velocity of 10 feet per second,
in how many seconds

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.330
will it reach the ground?

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.840
OK, so he's 84 feet
above the ground.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.450
Let's draw a diagram.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.800
He's 84 feet.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.180
This is 84 feet above
the ground.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.580
It says, how many seconds will
it reach the ground?

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.500
So we essentially want to know
how many seconds will it take

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.080
it to travel? s is
distance, right?

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.560
So s is equal to 84 feet.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.690
It has to go down 84 feet.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.490
Let's see if we can
figure this out.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.240
Now this is something that might
be a little bit-- so how

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.620
long does it take it to go 84
feet, I guess is the best way

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.540
to think about it.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:31.490
So we say 84 is equal to
velocity times-- your initial

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.870
velocity times time.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.090
And your initial velocity
is 10 feet per second.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.710
So it's 10 feet per second.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.150
Everything is in feet I think.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.010
Right, everything is--
v feet per second.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.110
Initial velocity of
v feet per second.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.100
So 10 feet per second
times time.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.870
I just substituted what
they gave us.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.670
10 for v.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.920
Plus 16t squared.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.590
And now I just solve
this quadratic.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.070
That is a t right there.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.450
So let me put everything on the
same-- let me subtract 84

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.080
from both sides and I'll
rearrange a little bit.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:11.700
So you get 16t squared plus 10t
minus 84 is equal to 0.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.720
Well I swapped the sides.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.940
I put these on the left.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.730
Well, let me just show
you what I did.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.710
I swapped the sides.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:23.180
So I made this 16t squared
plus 10t equals 84.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.110
I just swapped them.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.910
And then I subtracted 84 from
both sides to get this.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.650
And now we just have to
solve when t equals 0.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.190
So I guess the first thing we
could do is we could simplify

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.840
this a little bit.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.080
Everything here is
divisible by 2.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.886
So this is 8t squared plus-- I'm
just dividing both sides

00:11:39.886 --> 00:11:41.150
of this equation by 2.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.930
Plus 5t minus what?

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.670
Minus 42 is equal to 0.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.200
And then we can use the
quadratic equation.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.200
So what are the solutions? t
is equal to negatives b.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:02.980
So minus 5 plus or minus the
square root of b squared, so

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.880
25, minus 4 times a.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.360
times 8, times c.
c is minus 42.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.720
So instead of times minus
42, let's put a plus

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.540
here and do plus 42.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.610
Just a negative times a negative
is a positive.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.540
All of that, over 2 times a.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.652
2a is 16.

00:12:24.652 --> 00:12:26.150
So let's see where
that gets me.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:32.030
So I t is equal to minus 5 plus
or minus the square root.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.550
What is this?

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.330
25 plus-- let's see.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.440
4 times 8 times 42.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.580
That's 32 times 42.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:46.840
32 times 42.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.590
2 times 32 is 64.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:50.340
Put a 0.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.250
4 times 2 is 8.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:56.970
4 times 3 is 12.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:05.810
You end up with 4,
14, 3 and 1.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:06.880
So this is 1,344.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.530
And we're going to
add this 25 here.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.200
So let me see.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.620
Plus 1,344.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.800
All of that over 16.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:13.970
Let's see.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.640
1,344 plus 25.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.280
So it's minus 5 plus or
minus the square root

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.370
of-- what is this?

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.150
1,369 over 16.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.230
And actually, I don't
know what the square

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.430
root of 1369 is.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.040
Let me get the calculator.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.040
Let me open it up.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.060
Give me one second.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.540
Accessories, calculator.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.510
All right.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:48.630
So 1,369.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.410
37.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.390
Look at that.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.440
OK, so it's minus 5
plus or minus 37.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.440
That's the square
root of 1,369.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.600
So minus 5 plus or minus 37 over
16 is equal to the time.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.020
Now we don't have to worry about
the minus because that's

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.950
going to give us a
negative number.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.110
Minus 5 minus 37 over 16.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.780
We don't want a negative time,
we want a positive time.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.080
So let's just do the positive.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.240
So minus 5 plus 37.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.450
Let's see.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.830
Minus 5 plus 37 over 16.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.340
So that's 32/16, which
equals to 2 seconds.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.290
And that's choice A.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.590
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
