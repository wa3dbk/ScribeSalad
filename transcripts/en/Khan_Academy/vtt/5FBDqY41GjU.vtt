00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:02.748
We've got a scale here, and as you see,

00:00:02.748 --> 00:00:04.975
the scale is balanced.

00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:07.681
And we have a question to answer.

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.176
We have this mystery mass over here.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.414
It's a big question mark on this blue mass.

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:18.954
And we also have a bunch of 1 kilogram masses.

00:00:18.954 --> 00:00:21.879
These are all each a 1kg mass.

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:23.622
And my question to you is:

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:26.948
What could we do to either side of this scale

00:00:26.948 --> 00:00:28.740
in order to figure out

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.027
what the mystery mass is?

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:31.561
Or maybe we can't figure it out at all?

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.200
Is there something that we can do

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.569
either removing or adding these things,

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:36.827
so that we can figure out

00:00:36.827 --> 00:00:38.541
what this mystery mass is?

00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:41.499
I will give you a couple of seconds to think about it.

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:47.433
To figure out what this mystery mass is,

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:51.550
we essentially just want this on one side of this scale

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.033
But that by itself is not enough.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.500
We could just remove these three,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.823
but that won't do the job, because

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:57.633
if we just remove these three,

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.433
then the left side of this scale

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.535
is clearly going to have less mass,

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:04.633
and it will go up, and the right side will go down.

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.225
And that will not give us much information.

00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:08.433
It would just tell us that this blue thing

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:11.967
has a lower mass than what is over here.

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:14.232
So just removing this will not help us much.

00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:17.166
I won't let us know that this is equal to that.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.699
What we have to do if we want to keep the scale balanced,

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:22.232
is that we have to remove the same amount of mass

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:24.699
from both sides of the scale.

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:27.499
So, if we want to remove 3 things here,

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:33.020
(let me try my best to remove 3 things here)

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.085
(I will just erase it)

00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:38.632
If we want to remove 3 things there,

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.499
If we did this by itself,

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.354
just removed these 3 things,

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:44.565
the two sides would not have an equal mass anymore.

00:01:44.565 --> 00:01:46.510
this side would have a lower mass.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.343
So we have to remove 3 from both sides.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:51.665
If we want to make sure our scale is balanced,

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:54.497
we have to remove 3 from both sides.

00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:57.431
If we started off with the scales balanced,

00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:59.838
and then we removed 3 from both sides,

00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:01.742
the scale will still be balanced

00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:03.832
and then we would have a clear idea

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.154
of what the mass of this object actually is.

00:02:06.154 --> 00:02:08.151
Now, with 3 removed from both sides,

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.612
the scale will still be balanced,

00:02:10.612 --> 00:02:12.238
and we know that this mass

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:13.956
is equal to whatever is left over here.

00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:18.031
It is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:20.318
- and if we're assuming they are kilograms -

00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:22.965
we'll know that the question mark mass

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:25.798
question mark is equal to 7 kilograms.

00:02:25.798 --> 00:02:30.535
So this is a seven kilogram mass.
