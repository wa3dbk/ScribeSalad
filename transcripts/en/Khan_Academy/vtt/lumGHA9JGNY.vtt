00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
We're on problem number five.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.985
Let's see, we have a pie graph
here of survey results.

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:15.030
And let's see, that looks like
almost a straight line.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.030
Dividing it in half there.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.690
And then this gets divided
in half again.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.635
It looks like that, roughly.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.010
It looks like that.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.479
And then this is slightly
bigger like that.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.960
All right, and this tells
us x is less than 20

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.090
for 30% of the time.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.740
I don't even know what
these represent.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.430
x is greater than or equal
to 60 25% of the time.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.670
x is between 40 and less than
60, this is 25% of the time.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.500
So it can equal 40, but
it's less than 60.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.019
And then it's greater than or
equal to 20 and less than 40

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.475
20% of the time.

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:07.835
That's the survey results.

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:11.120
The chart above shows the
results when 1,000 people were

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.610
asked how old are you?

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.210
The age they gave is
represented by x.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.960
How many people said their
age was less than 40?

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.240
So x is less than 40.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.780
Well, this category right here
is x is between 20 and 40, so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:37.070
it's this one plus all the
people who said that they were

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.940
younger than 20 because if
you're less than 20, you're

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.130
definitely less than
40 as well, so it's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.970
both of these combined.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.490
And this is 30%, this is 20%.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.620
So if you combine it, it's 30%
plus 20% equals 50% of the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.105
entire population asked.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:58.760
And 1,000 people were asked,
so 50% times 1,000, well,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.690
that's straightforward.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.960
That equals 500 people.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.490
And that's choice D.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.840
Next problem, problem 6.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.630
Which of the following could
be the remainders when four

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.320
consecutive positive integers
are each divided by 3?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.550
Interesting.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.650
So let's say we have x plus 1,
x plus 2, x plus 3, right?

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.216
These are four consecutive
positive integers.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.940
Well, let's assume that
this first one is

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.830
divisible by 3, right?

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.850
Let's say that x divided by 3,
there's no remainder, so the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.260
remainder is 0.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.780
So when this number's divisible
by this number, x is

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.450
divisible by 3, so now when
you divide x plus 1 by 3,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.200
you're going to have
1 left over.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.660
Similarly, you're going
to have 2 left over.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.810
Here, you're not going to
3 left over, right?

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.440
Because if x is divisible by
3, then x plus 3 is also

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.670
divisible by 3, right?

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.150
You're going to have a cycle.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.700
It's going to go back to
a remainder of zero.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.250
So this is a possible
situation.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.360
And similarly, if x had a
remainder of 1, then x plus 1

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.880
would have a remainder of 2.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.790
Then x plus 2 would have a
remainder of 0, and then this

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.360
would have a remainder
of 1 again.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.800
So I don't know, let's
look at the choices.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.810
Are any of these out there?

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.310
Well, sure.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.510
This is choice D, actually.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.440
The first thing we did, choice
D was 0, 1, 2, 0, which is D.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.770
And the key here is realizing
that you can't have a

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.210
remainder of 3 or 4 when you're
dividing by 3, right?

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.170
Your remainder can only
be 0, 1 or 2.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.780
So with that realization alone,
you can cancel out all

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.460
the choices that have
a 3 or a 4 in it.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.150
You can't have a remainder
of 3 or 4 if

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.510
you're dividing by 3.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.250
And you can try that
out, right?

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.810
Because if you have a remainder
by 3, that means you

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.310
could divide one more 3 into
the number and have a

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.500
remainder of 0.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.670
So you could cancel
out A, B, C and E.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.900
You can actually cancel
out everything.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.430
So you would have just had to
have that one realization, and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.079
you would have said the choice
is D because you can't have a

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.970
remainder of 3 or 4 if
you're dividing by 3.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.430
Next problem, problem 7.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.710
If y is inversely proportional
to x, so that means that y is

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.620
proportional to the inverse of
x, so it's equal to some

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.910
constant times 1/x.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.390
Because that's what inversely
proportional means.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.030
If we said proportional, it'd
be y equals k times x, but

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.050
it's inversely proportional.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.120
And they tell us that
y is 15 when x is 5.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.320
So y is 15 is equal to
k times 1/5, right?

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.300
y is 15 when x is equal to 5.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.810
Let's see, let's multiply
both sides of this by 5.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.290
So you get 5 times 15 is 75
is equal to k, right?

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.890
So y is equal to 75/x.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.900
I just rewrote this.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.910
What is the value of
y when x is 25?

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.210
So y is equal to 75.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.430
x is now 25.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.780
What's 75 divided by 25?

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.150
Well, it's 3.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.680
And that's choice C.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.930
Problem 8.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:50.950
If 2x plus z is equal to 2y,
and 2x-- and then they also

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:57.880
tell us that 2x plus 2y
plus z is equal to 20.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.005
What is the value of y?

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.170
y is equal to what?

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.820
So there's something
interesting here.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:14.330
we can rewrite this second
equation as subtract 2y from

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.430
both sides of this equation
right here, and you get 2x

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.560
plus z is equal to 20
minus y, right?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.880
So essentially, you have a 2x
plus z here, and you have a 2x

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.540
plus z here.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.920
Let's make a new variable.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.120
You don't have to do this step,
but I think this'll

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.550
simplify things.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.880
Let's call the variable Q.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.280
Let's say Q is equal
to 2x plus z.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.360
That's where they're trying
to confuse you.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.230
They're giving you two equations
with three unknowns.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.520
And you're like, how can I
solve for one of them?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.610
Well, what's interesting is they
have-- you're solving for

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.240
one of them, and then the
relationship has a 2x plus z

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.480
in both equations.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.830
So if you say Q is equal to 2x
plus z, everything starts to

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.990
make sense because then this top
equation will become Q is

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.360
equal to 2y.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.780
And what will this bottom
equation be?

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.560
That would be Q is equal
to 20 minus y, right?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.040
And now you could set these
equal to each other.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.670
2y is equal to 20 minus y.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:25.960
Add y to both sides, you
get 3y is equal to 20.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.210
Am I doing that right?

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.740
3y is equal to 20?

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.005
You add y to both sides.
y is equal to 20/3.

00:07:34.005 --> 00:07:35.690
And they don't have
that choice, so I

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.810
must have made a mistake.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.915
Let me redo the problem.

00:07:39.915 --> 00:07:41.260
I must've made a mistake.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.680
Problem 8.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.600
So they're telling us 2x plus
z is equal to 2y, and then

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:56.140
they tell us 2x plus 2y
plus z is equal to 20.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.290
What is the value of y?

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:02.510
OK, the second equation can be
written as 2x plus z is equal

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.010
to 20 minus 2y.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.470
And this top equation is still
2x plus z is equal to 2y.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.510
Oh, I see.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.870
I had dropped a y someplace.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.450
So this must equal this,
because they both

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.530
equal 2x plus z.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.630
I don't even have to do all
that substitution Q.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.830
I think that you can see that 2x
plus z equals this, 2x plus

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.130
z equals this, so this
must equal this.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.030
So 2y is equal to 20 minus 2y.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:35.000
Add 2y to both sides, you
get 4y is equal to 20,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.820
y is equal to 5.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.100
And that is choice A.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.500
I'll see you in the
next video.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.090
Oh, whoops!

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.350
I didn't delete.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.600
Sorry.
