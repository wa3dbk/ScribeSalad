00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.770
Welcome back.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.750
So we have this green spring
here, and let's see,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.910
there's a wall here.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.080
This connected to the wall.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.690
And let's say that this is where
the spring is naturally.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.560
So if I were not to push on the
spring, it would stretch

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.040
all the way out here.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.410
But in this situation, I pushed
on the spring, so it

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.560
has a displacement
of x to the left.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.450
And we'll just worry about
magnitude, so we won't worry

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.770
too much about direction.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.680
So what I want to do is think
a little bit-- well, first I

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.710
want to graph how much force
I've applied at different

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.920
points as I compress
this spring.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.140
And then I want to use that
graph to maybe figure out how

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.270
much work we did in compressing
the spring.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.300
So let's look at-- I know I'm
compressing to the left.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.990
Maybe I should compress to the
right, so that you can-- well,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.050
we're just worrying about the
magnitude of the x-axis.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.960
Let's draw a little
graph here.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.050
That's my y-axis, x-axis.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.350
So this axis is how much I've
compressed it, x, and then

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.170
this axis, the y-axis, is how
much force I have to apply.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.850
So when the spring was initially
all the way out

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.180
here, to compress it a little
bit, how much force

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.670
do I have to apply?

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.950
Well, this was its natural
state, right?

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.190
And we know from-- well, Hooke's
Law told us that the

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.570
restorative force-- I'll write
a little r down here-- is

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.400
equal to negative K, where K is
the spring constant, times

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.010
the displacement, right?

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.580
That's the restorative force,
so that's the force that the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.470
spring applies to whoever's
pushing on it.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.260
The force to compress it is just
the same thing, but it's

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.980
going in the same direction
as the x.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.310
If I'm moving the spring, if I'm
compressing the spring to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.310
the left, then the force I'm
applying is also to the left.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.030
So I'll call that the force
of compression.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.290
The force of compression
is going to be

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.270
equal to K times x.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.440
And when the spring is
compressed and not

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.680
accelerating in either
direction, the force of

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.320
compression is going
to be equal to

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.730
the restorative force.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.120
So what I want to do here is
plot the force of compression

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.450
with respect to x.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.320
And I should have drawn it the
other way, but I think you

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.810
understand that x is increasing
to the left in my

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.760
example, right?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.270
This is where x is equal
to 0 right here.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.220
And say, this might be x is
equal to 10 because we've

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.030
compressed it by 10 meters.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.530
So let's see how much
force we've applied.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.120
So when x is 0, which is right
here, how much force do we

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.300
need to apply to compress
the spring?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.600
Well, if we give zero force, the
spring won't move, but if

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.640
we just give a little, little
bit of force, if we just give

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.370
infinitesimal, super-small
amount of force, we'll

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.980
compress the spring just
a little bit, right?

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.530
Because at that point, the force
of compression is going

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.340
to be pretty much zero.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.830
So when the spring is barely
compressed, we're going to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.380
apply a little, little bit of
force, so almost at zero.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.330
To displace the spring zero,
we apply zero force.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.630
To displace the spring a little
bit, we have to apply a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.290
little bit more force.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.830
To displace soon. the spring 1
meter, so if this is say, 1

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.870
meter, how much force
will we have to

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.380
apply to keep it there?

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.690
So let's say if this is
1 meter, the force of

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.630
compression is going to
be K times 1, so it's

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.880
just going to be K.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.790
And realize, you didn't apply
zero and then apply K force.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.650
You keep applying a little
bit more force.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.410
Every time you compress the
spring a little bit, it takes

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.670
a little bit more force to
compress it a little bit more.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.950
So to compress it 1 meters,
you need to apply K.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.770
And to get it there, you have to
keep increasing the amount

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.735
of force you apply.

00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:10.330
At 2 meters, you would've been
up to 2K, et cetera.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.900
I think you see a
line is forming.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.650
Let me draw that line.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.480
The line looks something
like that.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.920
And so this is how much force
you need to apply as a

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.210
function of the displacement of
the spring from its natural

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.190
rest state, right?

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.530
And here I have positive x going
to the right, but in

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.790
this case, positive
x is to the left.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.470
I'm just measuring its
actual displacement.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.460
I'm not worried too much about
direction right now.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.320
So I just want you to think
a little bit about what's

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.350
happening here.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.330
You just have to slowly keep
on-- you could apply a very

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.920
large force initially.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.820
If you apply a very large force
initially, the spring

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.620
will actually accelerate much
faster, because you're

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.150
applying a much larger force
than its restorative force,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.210
and so it might accelerate and
then it'll spring back, and

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.910
actually, we'll do a little
example of that.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.260
But really, just to displace the
spring a certain distance,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.730
you have to just gradually
increase the force, just so

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.530
that you offset the
restorative force.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.780
Hopefully, that makes sense,
and you understand that the

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.280
force just increases
proportionally as a function

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.250
of the distance, and
that's just because

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.700
this is a linear equation.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.430
And what's the slope of this?

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.250
Well, slope is rise
over run, right?

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.350
So if I run 1, this is
1, what's my rise?

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.340
It's K.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.590
So the slope of this
graph is K.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.400
So using this graph, let's
figure out how much work we

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.400
need to do to compress
this spring.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.650
I don't know, let's
say this is x0.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.115
So x is where it's the
general variable.

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:42.840
X0 is a particular
value for x.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.390
That could be 10 or whatever.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.360
Let's see how much
work we need.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.380
So what's the definition
of work?

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.750
Work is equal to the force
in the direction of your

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.770
displacement times the
displacement, right?

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.550
So let's see how much
we've displaced.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.370
So when we go from zero
to here, we've

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.810
displaced this much.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.950
And what was the force
of the displacement?

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.890
Well, the force was gradually
increasing the entire time, so

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.330
the force is going to be be
roughly about that big.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.920
I'm approximating.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.960
And I'll show you that you
actually have to approximate.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.480
So the force is kind of that
square right there.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.560
And then to displace the next
little distance-- that's not

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.830
bright enough-- my force is
going to increase a little

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.770
bit, right?

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.120
So this is the force, this
is the distance.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.000
So if you you see, the work I'm
doing is actually going to

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.880
be the area under the
curve, each of

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.890
these rectangles, right?

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.080
Because the height of the
rectangle is the force I'm

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.340
applying and the width is
the distance, right?

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.960
So the work is just going to
be the sum of all of these

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.740
rectangles.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.450
And the rectangles I drew are
just kind of approximations,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.590
because they don't get
right under the line.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.590
You have to keep making the
rectangle smaller, smaller,

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.660
smaller, and smaller, and just
sum up more and more and more

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.360
rectangles, right?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.880
And actually I'm touching on
integral calculus right now.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.130
But if you don't know
integral calculus,

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.950
don't worry about it.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.310
But the bottom line is the work
we're doing-- hopefully I

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.290
showed you-- is just going to
be the area under this line.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.910
So the work I'm doing to
displace the spring x meters

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.020
is the area from here to here.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.430
And what's that area?

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.590
Well, this is a triangle, so we
just need to know the base,

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.810
the height, and multiply
it times 1/2, right?

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.530
That's just the area
of a triangle.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.050
So what's the base?

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.860
So this is just x0.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.520
What's the height?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.360
Well, we know the slope is K, so
this height is going to be

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.750
x0 times K.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.370
So this point right here
is the point x0, and

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.610
then x0 times K.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.840
And so what's the area under the
curve, which is the total

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.090
work I did to compress
the spring x0 meters?

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:09.500
Well, it's the base, x0, times
the height, x0, times K.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.280
And then, of course, multiply by
1/2, because we're dealing

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.420
with a triangle, right?

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.230
So that equals 1/2K
x0 squared.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.050
And for those of you who know
calculus, that, of course, is

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.910
the same thing as the
integral of Kx dx.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.080
And that should make sense.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.180
Each of these are little dx's.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.490
But I don't want to go too
much into calculus now.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.340
It'll confuse people.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.950
So that's the total work
necessary to compress the

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.950
spring by distance of x0.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.659
Or if we set a distance
of x, you can just get

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.340
rid of this 0 here.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.770
And why is that useful?

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.700
Because the work necessary to
compress the spring that much

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.800
is also how much potential
energy there is

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.340
stored in the spring.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:57.750
So if I told you that I had a
spring and its spring constant

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:03.890
is 10, and I compressed it 5
meters, so x is equal to 5

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:08.800
meters, at the time that it's
compressed, how much potential

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.780
energy is in that spring?

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.940
We can just say the potential
energy is equal to 1/2K times

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.790
x squared equals 1/2.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:25.050
K is 10 times 25, and
that equals 125.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.920
And, of course, work and
potential energy

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.980
are measured in joules.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.110
So this is really what you
just have to memorize.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.240
Or hopefully you don't
memorize it.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.700
Hopefully, you understand where
I got it, and that's why

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.030
I spent 10 minutes doing it.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.940
But this is how much work is
necessary to compress the

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.030
spring to that point and how
much potential energy is

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.790
stored once it is compressed
to that point, or actually

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.490
stretched that much.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.520
We've been compressing,
but you can

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.690
also stretch the spring.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.730
If you know that, then we can
start doing some problems with

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.060
potential energy in springs,
which I will

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.110
do in the next video.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.360
