00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.390
What we're going to do in this
video is graph some lines

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.330
using the x- and y-intercepts
of the line.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.060
So first of all, a line is
defined by two points.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.760
If you find two points-- if
you're able to plot two points

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.020
on a line, then you can connect
them and keep going in

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.050
both directions.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.410
And you will have
drawn the line.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.750
What I'm going to do in this
video-- the two points I'm

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.620
going to pick are the intercepts
of the lines.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.380
There's two of them.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.040
There's the x-intercept and then
there's the y-intercept.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.510
These are the points
where the lines

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.860
intersect the x- and y-axes.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.240
And just to make it clear, this
right here is the x-axis

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.540
on my graph paper.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.090
That right there is my x-axis.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.340
It just keeps going.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.030
That's my x-axis.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.770
This right here, in the
middle, going up

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.880
and down, is my y-axis.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.845
That right there is my y-axis.

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:05.250
I don't think you can see
what I just wrote.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.690
That is the y-axis
right there.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.780
So let me show you what I mean
by x- and y-intercepts.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.010
So let's do part (a).

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.240
I'll do it in a different color,
not the same color as

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.510
my intercepts.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.610
Part (a), we have the equation
y is equal to 2x plus 3.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.550
So first of all, let's think
about what happens when x is

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.800
equal to 0.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.980
When x is equal to 0,
what is y equal to?

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.280
y is going to be equal to
two times 0 plus 3.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.210
Well, 2 times 0,
that's just 0.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.730
So y is equal to 0 plus
3 or y is equal to 3.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.830
So the point x is equal to
0, y is equal to 3, that

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.670
satisfies this equation.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.680
Or it's on the line defined
by this equation.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.680
So the point 0, 3.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.890
Let me plot that.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.810
The point 0, 3.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.790
Now notice, this point-- this is
when x is equal to 0, this

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.750
sits on our y-axis.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.100
We call this right here
a y-intercept.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.800
It is when x is equal to 0.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.220
But it's called a y-intercept
because it sits on the y-axis.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.030
This is where the line
intercepts the y-axis.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.330
Now let's do the same
for the x-axis.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.830
Let's set y equal to 0.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.020
So if y is equal to 0, we have
0 is equal to 2x plus 3.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.380
We could subtract 3 from both
sides of that equation.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.960
And you get negative
3 is equal to 2x.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.190
We can divide both sides by 2.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.680
And you get negative
3/2 is equal to x.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.000
And negative 3/2, that's the
same thing as negative 1 1/2.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.050
So we know that the point
negative 3/2, 0, right?

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.110
The second scenario,
y is equal to 0.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.810
We know that this set of values
of x and y also satisfy

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.450
this equation.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.540
Or that this point also
sits on the line.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.180
So negative 3/2-- remember
that's the same thing as

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.780
negative 1 1/2.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.060
That's right there. y is 0.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.590
So that's that second point
we just figured out.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.440
When y is 0, we're dealing
with our x-intercept.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.090
We're intercepting the x-axis.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.300
That is the x-intercept
right there.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.850
If I wanted to draw the line,
it'll look like this.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.320
Very roughly, I'll connect those
points and then just

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.020
keep going.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.770
Keep going in both directions.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.790
Keep going in both directions
forever and then I will have

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.870
drawn my line.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.920
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.040
I don't want to make it
too messy over here.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.160
Let me clear all this stuff
out of the way.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.550
Let me clear this out
of the way as well.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.560
You could always pause it, if
you want to gaze at it-- oh I

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.490
shouldn't have done that, I got
rid of my-- well you can

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.640
see still the axes.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.440
I'll redraw the axes.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.790
I'll redraw it right there.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.410
Good enough.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.410
That's one, my x-axis.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.880
That is my y-axis right
over there.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.110
Let me do part (b).
(b) looks like an

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.390
interesting one right there.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.860
(b) has 6 times x minus 1 is
equal to 2 times y plus 3.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.080
So let's look at the situation
when x is equal to zero.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.090
When x is equal to 0, that
equation up there becomes 6

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.080
times negative 1.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.540
Right?

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.590
Because this is 0.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.860
So 6 times negative 1 is
negative 6 is equal to 2-- let

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.400
me distribute this--
2y plus 6.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.720
I multiplied 2 times the
y and times the 3.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.220
And then we can subtract 6 from
both sides, so that you

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.080
get negative 12.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.650
Negative 12 is equal to 2y.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.315
I subtracted 6 from both sides
to essentially move this 6 on

00:05:01.315 --> 00:05:02.780
to the left-hand side.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.450
You subtract 6 here,
this disappears.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.910
You subtract 6 from here,
you get negative 12.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.020
Divide both sides by 2, you get
negative 6 is equal to y.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.110
So our first point that we know
is on the line is a point

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.300
x is equal to 0, y is
equal to negative 6.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.950
That is our y-intercept.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.570
Now let's see what happens
when y is equal to 0.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.960
Go back to the original
equation.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.330
We have-- let me write that a
little bit different-- when y

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.260
is equal to 0, we have
6 times x minus 1.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.290
Let me just distribute that.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.220
So 6x minus 6 is equal
to 2 times y.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.630
Well, y is just going to be 0.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.430
So it's going to be 2 times 3.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.480
This whole thing is
going to be 3.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.550
It's going to be equal to 6.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.310
So let's subtract 6 from both
sides-- or let's add 6 to both

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.060
sides of this equation.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.800
I want to get rid of
that right there.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.380
So I need to add 6
to make that 0.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.000
So we get 6x is equal to-- you
add 6 to the right-hand side,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.390
you get 12.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.010
And you get x-- divide both
sides by 6, you get

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.630
x is equal to 2.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.660
So our other intercept is x is
equal to 2, y is equal to 0.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.060
So we have x is equal to
2, y is equal to 0.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.030
Right there.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.300
That is our x-intercept.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.430
And then our actual line, we
just connect the dots.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.860
It will look something
like that.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.770
Obviously, you have trouble
drawing a straight line, but I

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.840
think you got the idea.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.380
Two points define a line.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.320
Let me do one more of these.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.870
I could probably do it
up here, in this

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.220
real estate up here.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.340
Let's do part d.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.360
You can do part c if you
want extra practice.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.380
So part d, we have x plus
y is equal to 8.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.230
This is actually very,
very straightforward.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.500
When x is equal to 0,
what is y equal to?

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.370
If this is 0, all we have
left is y is equal to 8.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.030
And then when y is
0, what is x?

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.860
Well, you can just almost
cover this up.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.090
Then you just get x plus
0 is equal to 8.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.750
x is equal to 8.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.280
So that was pretty
straightforward right there.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.870
So we have one point, 0, 8.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.830
So 0, 8.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.010
That is the y-intercept.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.040
And then we have
the point 8, 0.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.060
8, 0.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.470
That is the x-intercept.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.252
And then we can connect
the dots.

00:07:37.252 --> 00:07:41.460
It looks something like that.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.310
Now let's do this problem
down here.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.080
At a local grocery store,
strawberries cost $3.00 per

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.810
pound and bananas cost
$1.00 per pound.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:59.555
If I have $10 to spend between
strawberries and bananas, draw

00:07:59.555 --> 00:08:03.140
a graph to show the combination
of each I can buy

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.320
and spend exactly $10.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.990
Let me draw my axes.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.030
Make sure that these are
nice and filled in.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.880
So that remember is my
horizontal access.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.070
But just for fun, instead of
calling it the x-axis, I'm

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.235
going to call it the
strawberry-axis.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.640
Actually let me call it s, the
s-axis, where s is for

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.330
strawberries.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.666
Let s equal the number
of strawberries.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.419
I think you know where
I'm going.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.830
b will be number of bananas.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.830
Let me do my b-axis.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.340
I'm going to plot the number
bananas on the vertical axis.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.760
So this right there,
that is the b-axis.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.095
b for bananas.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.860
Strawberries cost $3.00.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.380
OK, this isn't the number
of strawberries.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.790
This is the number of pounds.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.040
Let me clear that up.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.430
This is pounds of
strawberries.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.990
We're not going by the number
of strawberries.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.920
We're going by pounds
of strawberries.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.660
This is pounds of bananas.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.680
All right.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.480
Strawberries cost $3.00
per pound, bananas

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.080
cost $1.00 per pound.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.800
So how much am I
going to spend?

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.690
I'm going to spend $3.00 times
the number of strawberries

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.860
because they're $3.00.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.230
All right, I'm going to spend
$3.00 times the number pounds

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.750
of strawberries because it's
$3.00 per pound plus $1.00

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.810
times the number of
pounds of bananas.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.330
And they say I have $10.00
to spend on both.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.040
So that's going to
be equal to $10.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.010
So 3 times the pounds of
strawberries plus the pounds

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.650
of bananas are going
to be equal to 10.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.710
1b, that's the same thing as b,
so I can rewrite this as 3s

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.160
plus b is equal to 10.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.610
Now let's plot this.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.235
Let's look at the situation
where I get no strawberries.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.120
So my pounds of strawberries
are 0.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.280
What does this equation
become?

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.860
It becomes 3 times 0 plus
b is equal to 10.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.700
That's just 0.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.550
So b will be equal to 10.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.300
So I would have the point 0
pounds of strawberries, I

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.380
could get 10 pounds
of bananas.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.650
So if I get 0 pounds of
strawberries, I can get 10

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.710
pounds, right there,
of bananas.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.510
Now what about the
other scenario?

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.330
What about the scenario where
I get no bananas?

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.400
I get 0 pounds of bananas.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.610
Now let's substitute
back here.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.120
We have 3 times my pounds of
strawberries plus 0 pounds of

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.780
bananas will equal 10.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.410
That's just a 0.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.470
Divide both sides by 3.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.960
I could-- if I get no bananas--
I can get 10/3

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.400
pounds of strawberries.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.480
Or this is equal to 3 1/3.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.170
So it would have the point 3 1/3
pounds of strawberries, 0

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.890
pounds of bananas.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.240
So 3 1/3 pounds of

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.290
strawberries, 0 pounds of bananas.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.110
And then we can connect
the line.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.010
This whole line I'm going to
draw, I am just going to draw

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.090
it in the first quadrant.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.880
Because I can't have
negative bananas.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.760
I'm not going to sell
pounds of bananas.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.210
And I can't have negative
strawberries.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.620
We're not talking about
selling strawberries.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.810
So I can only buy
these things.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.150
This is the amount
that I'm buying.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:38.010
So let me to connect the
dots right there.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.700
This is neat because this line
shows all of the possible

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.580
combinations of pounds of
strawberries and bananas.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.700
For example, this point right
here-- I don't know if I'm

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.360
drawing it exactly-- it looks
like if I get about 5 pounds

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.200
of bananas, I can get a little
under 2 pounds of

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.350
strawberries.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.110
That's what that tells me.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:06.460
If I get 3 pounds of
strawberries, if I get exactly

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.010
3 pounds of strawberries, I can
get 1 pound of bananas.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.720
Every point here represents
a combination that

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.040
I can get for $10.
