00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:02.957
Hedge funds are talked a lot about in the press

00:00:02.957 --> 00:00:06.784
and usually with a slightly suspicious or negative tone

00:00:06.784 --> 00:00:08.807
so what I want to do in this video is think about

00:00:08.807 --> 00:00:10.354
or give us a way of thinking about

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:13.742
whether a hedge fund, or really any financial type of organization

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:16.607
or institution is good or bad,

00:00:16.607 --> 00:00:19.200
and I won't try to take one side or the other

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.941
just give you some type of things to think about.

00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:25.075
So the first thing that sometimes is complained about

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:26.542
when people talk about hedge funds,

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:28.075
is that the compensation structure,

00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:31.743
because the hedge fund gets 20% of the profits

00:00:31.743 --> 00:00:34.991
but if the fund were to kind of blow up and go to zero

00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:39.025
the hedge fund manager isn't on the line for 20% of the losses

00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:42.474
people would argue that that encourages hedge fund managers

00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:48.582
to take disproportionate levels of risk

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:51.398
and that is true to some degree

00:00:51.398 --> 00:00:54.809
but one thing that is true about hedge funds is that usually

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.239
it's expected that the manager or the general partner

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.098
has some of their own skin in the game

00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:05.736
so as an example, I drew a Pete Capital Fund 1

00:01:05.736 --> 00:01:08.211
the manager committed 10% of the funds

00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:10.350
and what's more important, as apposed to just the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.617
percentage of the total fund is

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:15.868
what percentage of Pete's total net worth is in the fund?

00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:18.036
Some fund managers will put a significant amount

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.933
of their own personal net worth in the fund

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.818
so even though they get 20% of the upside,

00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:25.201
if the fund were to really do horribly,

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.935
if it were to blow up,

00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:29.498
that manager usually will really be on the line

00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:31.535
and that's usually the job of the limited partners here

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:35.035
we've mentioned before that versus a mutual fund

00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:38.219
the limited partners of a hedge fund need to be sophisticated,

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.855
they need to be accredited investors, they need to have a certain net worth

00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:43.689
they need to show that they understand these type of instruments

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.305
and so it's really the job of the limited partners

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:48.153
and it's really in their interest

00:01:48.153 --> 00:01:50.424
to make sure that they're investing in a fund

00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:53.037
where one, Pete looks like a credible guy,

00:01:53.037 --> 00:01:56.337
Pete has some skin in the game, and hopefully

00:01:56.337 --> 00:01:58.967
a substantial amount of skin in the game relative

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:00.984
to Pete's net worth.

00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:03.672
Pete has a reputation, and then they have to decide

00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:05.805
their own comfort level with how transparent

00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:08.386
Pete is, a lot of hedge funds won't tell their investors a lot of

00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:10.608
what they're doing with this $100,000,000

00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:12.424
sometimes they'll give a little bit more information

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:13.572
or a little bit less,

00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:16.316
that could be a negative obviously, because who knows?

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:19.026
Maybe they're going to Las Vegas and they're gambling away this money

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:21.134
but that's where the reputation of the manager matters a lot

00:02:21.134 --> 00:02:25.169
but also the secrecy actually could be good for the limited partners

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:30.523
because sometimes if everyone knows exactly what's happening inside of the fund

00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:32.196
and that information goes out,

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:34.800
there could be other people that could somehow

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.403
trade against the fund, or make the same investments of the fund

00:02:37.403 --> 00:02:40.119
or if this was a large fund, go ahead of that fund

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.548
and try to buy whatever this fund was trying to buy ahead of time

00:02:43.548 --> 00:02:46.333
so there's kind of pros and cons to the secrecy,

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.966
but that risk is definitely there,

00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:53.028
and, you know, one thing that I guess is probably interesting to point out

00:02:53.028 --> 00:02:57.187
is that this idea of getting a percentage of the upside

00:02:57.187 --> 00:03:01.484
but having very limited downside is not unique to hedge funds

00:03:01.484 --> 00:03:04.716
in fact, this is probably true of most corporate executives,

00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:08.080
in fact, most corporate executives probably don't have as much skin in the game

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.003
we've all heard about golden parachutes and all of the rest

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:16.415
if CEOs do really well, they usually get huge, huge, huge bonuses,

00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:20.233
if they do horribly and they get fired, they still get golden parachutes

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.639
and that actually probably doesn't happen to hedge fund managers,

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.599
so this idea of a percentage of the upside

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.605
without the same percentage of the downside

00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:29.291
isn't unique to hedge funds managers,

00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:32.303
it happens to corporate executives, it happens to

00:03:32.303 --> 00:03:35.334
heads of banks, it happens to bankers generally

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:37.252
where they get these huge bonuses in a year

00:03:37.252 --> 00:03:38.999
but in the next year, if the bank goes out of business

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:42.271
no one asks them to kind of give back their bonuses.

00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:47.278
So I'm not going to defend it, I'm just going to say that it's not unique to hedge funds.

00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:50.561
Now the other kind of notion that sometimes people

00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:55.677
talk relative to a hedge fund is this idea of secrecy

00:03:55.677 --> 00:03:59.427
because it is not regulated, the hedge fund manager

00:03:59.427 --> 00:04:02.346
kind of has its choice of what they do over here

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:04.917
and this secrecy, you know, I'll put a little asterix over here,

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:08.627
because in order for these people to be willing to commit their fund

00:04:08.627 --> 00:04:10.950
the hedge fund manager has to tell them something about

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.616
what he's up to, so it's up to the hedge fund manager.

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:17.044
But some people work that the secrecy

00:04:17.044 --> 00:04:18.991
the secrecy that the hedge fund has,

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:21.609
combined with the fact that they're allowed to invest

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.226
in more, I guess you could say, exotic things

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:26.192
they don't have to, and I want to be very clear

00:04:26.192 --> 00:04:29.053
a lot of hedge funds, even though they have this whole structure

00:04:29.053 --> 00:04:33.125
with the 2% management fee, and the 20% carried interest,

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:35.389
a lot of hedge funds, their actual investments

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.325
might look very similar to a lot of mutual funds

00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:41.009
in fact, some of them might be more conservative

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.165
than many mutual funds, so it's not necessarily the case

00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:45.984
that hedge funds are doing crazy things over here.

00:04:45.984 --> 00:04:48.819
But some of them are, and so that combination

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.276
of the secrecy, that they might be speculating on this or that

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:55.750
or buying all sorts of crazy derivatives contracts

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.056
that makes people feel that hey, there might be something shady

00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:00.926
going on over here.

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:04.577
And, the way I think about it is, if the hedge fund is relatively small

00:05:04.577 --> 00:05:07.436
and $100,000,000 would actually be small in the scale of a hedge fund

00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:09.101
or I guess another way to think about it:

00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:11.835
if the assets that are controlled are relatively small

00:05:11.835 --> 00:05:14.846
because with sophisticated derivatives, with $100,000,000

00:05:14.846 --> 00:05:17.101
you can actually control much more than

00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:20.598
$100,000,000 in notional assets, but if the notional assets

00:05:20.598 --> 00:05:24.112
that the hedge fund controls are relatively small

00:05:24.112 --> 00:05:29.625
then the secrecy, and kind of the, whatever the hedge fund might do

00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:32.911
it really just puts the investors of the hedge fund at risk

00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:34.580
and so it's really these people's job,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.779
it doesn't put society as a whole at risk

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.873
the time when hedge funds get dangerous,

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:43.961
or potentially get dangerous, or the most cited example of this

00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:46.729
is long-term capital management in the late 90s

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.046
Let me write that down, LTCM, I'll do a whole series of videos on this eventually

00:05:51.046 --> 00:05:54.664
but long-term capital management controlled so much

00:05:54.664 --> 00:05:56.241
in notional funds, now we're talking about in the

00:05:56.241 --> 00:05:59.483
hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars

00:05:59.483 --> 00:06:07.555
that this fund became too big to fail

00:06:07.555 --> 00:06:10.169
and I think you know from the recent financial crisis

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.638
that this doesn't happen only to hedge funds

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:14.382
and so you have this general notion

00:06:14.382 --> 00:06:16.254
that when any financial institution

00:06:16.254 --> 00:06:19.853
starts kind of controlling trillions of dollars

00:06:19.853 --> 00:06:21.583
or hundreds of billions of dollars,

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:24.613
it can start a cascade through the entire financial system

00:06:24.613 --> 00:06:28.452
that's not a good thing. This is not a good thing,

00:06:28.452 --> 00:06:31.996
this is not good, because when something is too big to fail

00:06:31.996 --> 00:06:33.318
people don't let it fail

00:06:33.318 --> 00:06:35.624
and that goes against everything that we know about capitalism.

00:06:35.624 --> 00:06:38.199
Capitalism, when people do well, let them do well,

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.819
but when people fail, let them fail.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.420
The thing I want to point out is that this is not unique to hedge funds

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.239
AIG which is probably one of the main culprits of the last financial crisis

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:54.377
they were an insurer, do you have the rating agencies,

00:06:54.377 --> 00:06:55.970
they weren't too big to fail

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.898
but they helped kind of validate some of these other

00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:01.697
too big to fail actors. You had all of these banks

00:07:01.697 --> 00:07:03.256
that were too big to fail.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.184
So I think the general principle here is that

00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:07.176
a hedge fund can be good, it can be bad,

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:10.168
what's unique about them relative to a mutual fund

00:07:10.168 --> 00:07:12.452
is that they tend to be a little bit more private

00:07:12.452 --> 00:07:16.376
they have more support, they should have more sophisticated investors

00:07:16.376 --> 00:07:18.036
but what they do with their money might be

00:07:18.036 --> 00:07:22.015
um, exactly the same thing as what a mutual fund

00:07:22.015 --> 00:07:24.523
might do, it might even be more conservative than a mutual fund,

00:07:24.523 --> 00:07:28.917
it might take on, it might use sophisticated instruments to take on less risk

00:07:28.917 --> 00:07:30.353
than a mutual fund,

00:07:30.353 --> 00:07:32.905
and I think the takeaway, or at least in my mind,

00:07:32.905 --> 00:07:35.747
is that any of these things, hedge funds,

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:39.670
insurance companies, banks, even some corporations,

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.627
they become bad when they become so big

00:07:42.627 --> 00:07:47.011
that failure doesn't just hurt their investors,

00:07:47.011 --> 99:59:59.999
it hurts all of society.
