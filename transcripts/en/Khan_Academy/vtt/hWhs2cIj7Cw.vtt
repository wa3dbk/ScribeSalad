00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.520
Everything we've been doing in
linear algebra so far, you

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.930
might be thinking, it's kind of
a more painful way of doing

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.470
things that you already
knew how to do.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.850
You've already dealt
with vectors.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.970
I'm guessing that some of you
all have already dealt with

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.220
vectors in your calculus or
your pre-calculus or your

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.260
physics classes.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.880
But in this video I hope to show
you something that you're

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.340
going to do in linear algebra
that you've never done before,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.170
and that it would have been very
hard to do had you not

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.840
been exposed to these videos.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.810
Well I'm going to start with,
once again, a different way of

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.970
doing something you already
know how to do.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.190
So let me just define some
vector here, instead of making

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.550
them bold, I'll just draw it
with the arrow on top.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.620
I'm going to define my vector
to be-- I can do with the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.920
arrow on top or I can just
make it super bold.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.660
I'm just going to define my
vectors, it's going to be a

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.280
vector in R2.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.230
Let's just say that my vector
is the vector 2, 1.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.200
If I were to draw it in
standard position,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.100
it looks like this.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.665
You go two to the right,
up one, like that.

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:04.400
That's my, right there,
that is my vector v.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.850
Now, if I were to ask you, what
are all of the possible

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.970
vectors I can create?

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.300
So let me define a set.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.960
Let me define a set, s, and
it's equal to-- all of the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.460
vectors I can create, if I were
to multiply v times some

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.280
constant, so I multiply some
constant, some scalar, times

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.880
my vector v, and just to maybe
be a little bit formal, I'll

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.995
say such that c is a member
of the real numbers.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.800
Now what would be a graphical
representation of this set?

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.370
Well, if we draw them all in
standard position, c could be

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.280
any real number.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.270
So if I were to multiply,
c could be 2.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.390
If c is 2, let me
do it this way.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.460
If I do 2 times our vector,
I'm going to get

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.080
the vector 4, 2.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.550
Let me draw that in standard
position, 4, 2.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.390
It's right there.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.240
It's this vector right there.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.350
It's collinear with
this first vector.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.640
It's along the same line, but
just goes out further 2.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.540
Now I could've done another.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.660
I could have done 1.5
times our vector v.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.660
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.890
And maybe that would be,
that would be what?

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.240
That'd be 1.5 times 2,
which is 3, 1.5.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.630
Where would that
vector get me?

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.160
I'd go one 1.5 and then I'd
go 3, and then 1.5,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.380
I'd get right there.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.680
And I can multiply
by anything.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.390
I can multiply 1.4999
times vector v, and

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.750
get right over here.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.220
I could do minus 0.0001
times vector v.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.210
Let me write that down.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.550
I could do 0.001 times
our vector v.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.810
And where were that put me?

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.680
It would put me little super
small vector right there.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.430
If I did minus 0.01, it would
make a super small vector

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.810
right there pointing
in that direction.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.126
If I were to do minus 10, I
would get a vector going in

00:03:03.126 --> 00:03:07.000
this direction that goes
way like that.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.760
But you can imagine that if
I were to plot all of the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.800
vectors in standard position,
all of them that could be

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.250
represented by any c in real
numbers, I'll essentially

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.550
get-- I'll end up drawing a
bunch of vectors where their

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.880
arrows are all lined up along
this line right there, and all

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.830
lined up in even in negative
direction-- let me make sure I

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.440
draw it properly-- along
that line, like that.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.670
I think you get the idea.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.256
So it's a set of collinear
vectors.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:36.560
So let me write that down.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.850
And if we view these vectors as
position vectors, that this

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.710
vector represents a point in
space in R2-- this R2 is just

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.540
our Cartesian coordinate plane
right here in every

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.840
direction-- if we view this
vector as a position vector--

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.800
let me write that down-- if
we view it as kind of a

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.495
coordinate in R2, then this set,
if we visually represent

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:14.280
it as a bunch of position
vectors, it'll be represented

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.900
by this whole line over here.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.750
And I want to make that point
clear because it's essentially

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.600
a line, of slope 2.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.150
Right?

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.410
Sorry, slope 1/2.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.080
Your rise is 1.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.620
Your rise is 1 for
going over 2.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.060
But I don't want to go
back to our Algebra 1

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.840
notation too much.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.730
But I want to make this point
that this line of slope 2 that

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.780
goes through the origin, this
is if we draw all of the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.110
vectors in the set as in their
standard form, or if we draw

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.710
them all as position vectors.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.610
If I didn't make that
clarification, or that

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.090
qualification, I could have
drawn these vectors anywhere.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.370
Right?

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:00.190
Because this 4, 2 vector, I
could have drawn over here.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.720
And then, to say that it's
collinear probably wouldn't

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.510
have made as much visual
sense to you.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.330
But I think this collinearity of
it makes more sense to you

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.130
if you say, oh, let's draw them
all in standard form.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.030
All of them start at the origin,
and then their tails

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.270
are at the origin, and their
heads go essentially to the

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.370
coordinate they represent.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.390
That's what I mean by their
position vectors.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.200
They don't necessarily have to
be position vectors, but for

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.830
the visualization in this video,
let's stick to that.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.530
Now I was only able to represent
something that goes

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.020
through the origin
with this slope.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.580
So you can almost view that
this vector kind of

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.570
represented its slope.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.820
You almost want to view it as a
slope vector, if you wanted

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.280
to tie it in to what you
learned in Algebra 1.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.480
What if we wanted to represent
other lines

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.190
that had that slope?

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:53.470
What if we wanted to represent
the the same line, or I guess

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.350
a parallel line-- that goes
through that point over there,

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.120
the point 2 comma 4?

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.250
Or if we're thinking in position
vectors, we could say

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:19.105
that point is represented
by the vector, and we

00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:20.900
will call that x.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.130
It's represented by
the vector x.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.330
And the vector x is
equal to 2, 4.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.040
That point right there.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.600
What if I want to represent the
line that's parallel to

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.030
this that goes through
that point 2, 4?

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.040
So I want to represent
this line right here.

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:43.470
I'll draw it as parallel
to this as I can.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.080
I think you get the idea, and it
just keeps going like that

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.130
in every direction.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.120
These two lines are parallel.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.280
How can I represent the set of
all of these vectors, drawn in

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.620
standard form, or all of the
vectors, that if I were to

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.400
draw them in standard form,
would show this line?

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.490
Well, you can think
about it this way.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.650
If every one of the vectors that
represented this line, if

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.480
I start with any vector that was
on this line, and I add my

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:20.070
x vector to it, I'll show up
at a corresponding point on

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.250
this line that I
want to be at.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.500
Right?

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.960
Let's say I do negative 2 times
my original, so minus 2

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.160
times my vector v, that
equaled what?

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.870
Minus 4, minus 2, so that's
that vector there.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:47.160
But if I were to add x to it, if
I were to add my x vector.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.040
So if I were to do minus 2 times
my vector v, but I were

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.670
to add x to it, so plus x.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.360
I'm adding this vector 2 comma
4 to it, so from here I'd go

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.860
right 2 and up 4,
so I'd go here.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.130
Or visually you could just
say, heads to tails, so I

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.550
would go right there.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.610
So I would end up at a

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.990
corresponding point over there.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.020
So when I define my set, s, as
the set of all points where I

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.220
just multiply v times the
scalar, I got this thing that

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.650
went through the origin.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.120
But now let me define
another set.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:28.580
Let me define a set l, maybe l
for line, that's equal to the

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:34.669
set of all of vectors where the
vector x, I could do it

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:39.510
bold or I'll just draw an
arrow on it, plus some

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.230
scalar-- I could use c, but
let me use t, because I'm

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.540
going to call this a
parametrization of the line--

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:59.070
so plus some scalar, t times my
vector v such that t could

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.380
be any member of the
real numbers.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.310
So what is this going to be?

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.120
This is going to be
this blue line.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.820
If I were to draw all of these
vectors in standard position,

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.460
I'm going to get my blue line.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.670
For example, if I do minus 2,
this is minus 2, times my

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.160
vector v, I get here.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.730
Then if I add x, I go there.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:25.770
So this vector right here that
has its endpoint right there--

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.680
its endpoint sits
on that line.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.330
I can do that with anything.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.980
If I take this vector, this is
some scalar times my vector v,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.990
and I add x to it, I end up
with this vector, whose

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.700
endpoint, if I view it as a
position vector, it's endpoint

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.950
dictates some coordinate
in the xy plane.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.740
So it will [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.560
that point.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.330
So I can get to any
of these vectors.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.720
This is a set of vectors right
here, and all of these vectors

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.430
are going to point-- they're
essentially going to point to

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.446
something-- when I draw them
in standard form, if I draw

00:09:57.446 --> 00:09:59.650
them in standard form-- they're
going to point to a

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.110
point on that blue line.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.630
Now you might say, hey Sal, this
was a really obtuse way

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.210
of defining a line.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.320
I mean we do it in Algebra 1,
where we just say, hey you

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.540
know, y is equal to mx plus b.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.200
And we figure out the slope by
figuring out the difference of

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.360
two points, and then we do
a little substitution.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.670
And this is stuff you learned
in seventh or eighth grade.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.270
This was really straightforward.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:27.170
Why am I defining this obtuse
set here and making you think

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.170
in terms of sets and vectors
and adding vectors?

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.495
And the reason is, is because
this is very general.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.440
This worked well in R2.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.380
So in R2, this was great.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.860
I mean, we just have to worry
about x's and y's.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.620
But what about the situation, I
mean notice, in your algebra

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.470
class, your teacher never really
told you much, at least

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.430
in the ones I took, about how do
you present lines in three

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.050
dimensions?

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.310
Maybe some classes go there,
but they definitely didn't

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.635
tell you how do you represent
lines in four dimensions, or a

00:10:58.635 --> 00:10:59.720
hundred dimensions.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.690
And that's what this is
going to do for us.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.750
Right here, I defined x and
v as vectors in R2.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.320
They're two-dimensional vectors,
but we can extend it

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.950
to an arbitrary number
of dimensions.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.610
So just to kind of hit the point
home, let's do one more

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.670
example in R2, where, it's kind
of the classic algebra

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.650
problem where you need to find
the equation for the line.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.170
But here, we're going
to call it the set

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.090
definition for the line.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.060
Let's say we have two vectors.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:39.410
Let's say we have the vector a,
which I'll define as-- let

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.630
me just says it's 2, 1.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.550
So if I were draw it in standard
form, it's 2, 1.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.620
That's my vector
a, right there.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:56.530
And let's say I have vector
b, let me define vector b.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.890
I'm going to define it as,
I don't know, let me

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:05.110
define it as 0, 3.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.563
So my vector b, 0-- I don't
move to the right at

00:12:07.563 --> 00:12:08.300
all and I go up.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.575
So my vector b will
look like that.

00:12:12.575 --> 00:12:14.760
Now I'm going to say that these
are position vectors,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.930
that we draw them in
standard form.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.670
When you draw them in standard
form, their endpoints

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.030
represent some position.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.150
So you can almost view these
as coordinate points in R2.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.880
This is R2.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.950
All of these coordinate axes
I draw are going be R2.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:33.270
Now what if I asked you, give
me a parametrization of the

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.710
line that goes through
these two points.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.380
So essentially, I want the
equation-- if you're thinking

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.180
in Algebra 1 terms-- I want the
equation for the line that

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.565
goes through these two points.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.910
So the classic way, you would
have figured out the slope and

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:51.830
all of that, and then
you would have

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.360
substituted back in.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.300
But instead, what we can do is,
we can say, hey look, this

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.760
line that goes through both of
those points-- you could

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.080
almost say that both of those
vectors lie on-- I guess

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.320
that's a better-- Both of these

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.220
vectors lie on this line.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.430
Now, what vector can be
represented by that line?

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:18.630
Or even better, what vector,
if I take any arbitrary

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:24.040
scalar-- can represent any other
vector on that line?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.950
Now let me do it this way.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.280
What if I were to take-- so this
is vector b here-- what

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.520
if I were to take b minus a?

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.880
We learned in, I think it was
the previous video, that b

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.800
minus a, you'll get this
vector right here.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.620
You'll get the difference
in the two vectors.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.340
This is the vector b
minus the vector a.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.400
And you just think about it.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.500
What do I have to add
to a to get to b?

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.860
I have to add b minus a.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.460
So if I can get the vector b
minus a-- right, we know how

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:52.940
to do that.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.210
We just subtract the vectors,
and then multiply it by any

00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.380
scalar, then we're going to get
any point along that line.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.490
We have to be careful.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.220
So what happens if we take t,
so some scalar, times our

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.570
vector, times the vectors
b minus a?

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.740
What will we get then?

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.120
So b minus a looks like that.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.610
But if we were to draw it in
standard form-- remember, in

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.240
standard form b minus a would
look something like this.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:26.500
Right?

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.340
It would start at 0, it would be
parallel to this, and then

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.060
from 0 we would draw
its endpoint.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.830
So if we just multiplied some
scalar times b minus a, we

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:38.600
would actually just get
points or vectors

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.320
that lie on this line.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.520
Vectors that lie on that
line right there.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.250
Now, that's not what
we set out to do.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.300
We wanted to figure out an
equation, or parametrization,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.360
if you will, of this
line, or this set.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.810
Let's call this set l.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.780
So we want to know what
that set is equal to.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:03.020
So in order to get there, we
have to start with this, which

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.630
is this line here, and
we have to shift it.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.370
And we could shift it either by
shifting it straight up, we

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.960
could add vector b to it.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.550
So we could take this
line right here, and

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.150
add vector b to it.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.520
And so any point on here
would have its

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.640
corresponding point there.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.950
So when you add vector b, it
essentially shifts it up.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.660
That would work.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.720
So we could, say, we could
add vector b to it.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.100
And now all of these points
for any arbitrary-- t is a

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.050
member of the real numbers, will
lie on this green line.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.430
Or the other option we could
have done is we could have

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.250
added vector a.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.230
Vector a would have taken any
arbitrary point here and

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.380
shifted it that way.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:43.600
Right?

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.160
You would be adding
vector a to it.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.360
But either way, you're going to
get to the green line that

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.100
we cared about, so you could
have also defined it as the

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:55.390
set of vector a plus this line,
essentially, t times

00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:01.860
vector b minus a, where t is
a member of the reals.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.290
So my definition of
my line could be

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.130
either of these things.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:11.510
The definition of my line could
be this set, or it could

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.850
be this set.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.240
And all of this seems all very
abstract, but when you

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.940
actually deal with the numbers,
it actually becomes

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.670
very simple.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:22.230
It becomes arguably simpler than
what we did in Algebra 1.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.210
So this l, for these particular
case of a and b,

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.480
let's figure it out.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.680
My line is equal to-- let me
just use the first example.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:37.740
It's vector b, so it's the
vector 0, 3 plus t, times the

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.940
vector b minus a.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.260
Well what's b minus a?

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:51.670
0 minus 2 is minus 2, 3, minus
1 is 2, for t is a

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.090
member of the reals.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.110
Now, if this still seems kind
of like a convoluted set

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.530
definition for you, I could
write it in terms that you

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.190
might recognize better.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.290
If we want to plot points, if
we call this the y-axis, and

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:09.949
we call this the x-axis,
and if we call this the

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:13.339
x-coordinate, or maybe more
properly that the x-coordinate

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:17.109
and call this the y-coordinate,
then we can set

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:17.940
up an equation here.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.199
This actually is the x-slope.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.369
This is the x-coordinate,
that's the y-coordinate.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:27.510
Or actually, even better,
whatever-- actually, let me be

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.620
very careful there.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:36.090
This is always going to end up
becoming some vector, l1, l2.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.490
Right?

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.790
This is a set of vectors, and
any member of this set is

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.950
going to look something
like this.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.900
So this could be li.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.910
So, this is the x-coordinate,
and this is the y-coordinate.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.900
And just to get this in a form
that you recognize, so we're

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.330
saying that l is the set of
this vector x plus t times

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:05.110
this vector b minus a here.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.200
If we wanted to write it in kind
of a parametric form, we

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.070
can say, since this is what
determines our x-coordinate,

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:18.420
we would say that x is equal to
0 plus t times minus 2, or

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.120
minus 2 times t.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.090
And then we can say that y,
since this is what determines

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:34.800
our y-coordinate, y is equal to
3 plus t times 2 plus 2t.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.630
So we could have rewritten that
first equation as just x

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:43.790
is equal to minus 2t, and
y is equal to 2t plus 3.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.570
So if you watch the videos on
parametric equations, this is

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.390
just a traditional parametric
definition of

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:53.020
this line right there.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.860
Now, you might have still viewed
this as, Sal, this was

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.580
a waste of time, this
was convoluted.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.100
You have to define these
sets and all that.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.020
But now I'm going to show you
something that you probably--

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.490
well, unless you have done
this before, but I guess

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.320
that's true of anything.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.680
But you probably haven't
seen in your

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.260
traditional algebra class.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.420
Let's say I have two points, and
now I'm going to deal in

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.910
three dimensions.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.520
So let's say I have
one vector.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.025
I'll just call it point
1, because these

00:19:18.025 --> 00:19:19.080
are position vectors.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.530
We'll just call it position 1.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.350
This is in three dimensions.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:28.090
Just make up some numbers,
negative 1, 2, 7.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.850
Let's say I have Point 2.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.540
Once again, this is in three
dimensions, so you have to

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.050
specify three coordinates.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.530
This could be the x, the y,
and the z coordinate.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.420
Point 2, I don't know.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.580
Let's make it 0, 3, and 4.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.120
Now, what if I wanted to find
the equation of the line that

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.670
passes through these
two points in R3?

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.920
So this is in R3.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.020
Well, I just said that the
equation of this line-- so

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.540
I'll just call that, or the set
of this line, let me just

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.510
call this l.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.660
It's going to be equal to-- we
could just pick one of these

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.720
guys, it could be P1, the
vector P1, these are all

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.370
vectors, be careful here.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:18.310
The vector P1 plus some random
parameter, t, this t could be

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.870
time, like you learn when you
first learn parametric

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.750
equations, times the difference
of the two vectors,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.860
times P1, and it doesn't matter
what order you take it.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.870
So that's a nice thing too.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.860
P1 minus P2.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.450
It could be P2 minus P1--
because this can take on any

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:40.580
positive or negative value--
where t is a member of the

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.120
real numbers.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.690
So let's apply it to
these numbers.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:44.780
Let's apply it right here.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.530
What is P1 minus P2?

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:54.860
P1 minus P2 is equal to-- let
me get some space here.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:59.650
P1 minus P2 is equal, minus
1 minus 0 is minus 1.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:04.740
2 minus 3 is minus 1.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.540
7 minus 4 is 3.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.140
So that thing is that vector.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.450
And so, our line can be
described as a set of vectors,

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:18.280
that if you were to plot it in
standard position, it would be

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.440
this set of position vectors.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.700
It would be P1, it would be--
let me do that in green-- it

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.520
would be minus 1, 2, 7.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:39.010
I could've put P2 there, just as
easily-- plus t times minus

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:45.360
1, minus 1, 3, where, or such
that, t is a member of the

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.690
real numbers.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.770
Now, this also might not
be satisfying for you.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.650
You're like, gee, how do I plot
this in three dimensions?

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.860
Where's my x, y's, and z's?

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.850
And if you want to care about
x, y's, and z's, let's say

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:05.860
that this is the z-axis.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.360
This is the x-axis, and
let's say the y-axis.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.050
It kind of goes into our board
like this, so the y-axis comes

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.300
out like that.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.750
So what you can do, and actually
I probably won't

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.540
graph, so the determinate for
the x-coordinate, just our

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.030
convention, is going to be
this term right here.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.520
So we can write that x--
let me write that down.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.190
So that term is going to
determine our x-coordinate.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:36.420
So we can write that x is equal
to minus 1-- be careful

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.840
with the colors-- minus 1,
plus minus 1 times t.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.600
That's our x-coordinate.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.800
Now, our y-coordinate is going
to be determined by this part

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.280
of our vector addition because
these are the y-coordinates.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.000
So we can say the y-coordinate
is equal to-- I'll just write

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.800
it like this-- 2 plus
minus 1 times t.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.690
And then finally, our
z-coordinate is determined by

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.290
that there, the t shows up
because t times 3-- or I could

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.940
just put this t into
all of this.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:20.115
So that the z-coordinate is
equal to 7 plus t times 3, or

00:23:20.115 --> 00:23:22.680
I could say plus 3t.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.640
And just like that, we have
three parametric equations.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.110
And when we did it in R2, I did
a parametric equation, but

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.550
we learned in Algebra 1,
you can just have a

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.870
regular y in terms x.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.830
You don't have to have a
parametric equation.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.420
But when you're dealing in R3,
the only way to define a line

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.810
is to have a parametric
equation.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.380
If you have just an equation
with x's, y's, and z's, if I

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:46.580
just have x plus y plus z is
equal to some number, this is

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.210
not a line.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.110
And we'll talk more
about this in R3.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.360
This is a plane.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.910
The only way to define a line
or a curve in three

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:01.020
dimensions, if I wanted to
describe the path of a fly in

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.950
three dimensions, it has to
be a parametric equation.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.890
Or if I shoot a bullet in three
dimensions and it goes

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.850
in a straight line, it has to
be a parametric equation.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.650
So these-- I guess you could
call it-- these are the

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:15.600
equations of a line in
three dimensions.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.050
So hopefully you found
that interesting.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:20.340
And I think this will be the
first video where you have an

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.450
appreciation that linear algebra
can solve problems or

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.480
address issues that you
never saw before.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.930
And there's no reason why we
have to just stop at three,

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.410
three coordinates, right here.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.410
We could have done this
with fifty dimensions.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:35.200
We could have defined a line in
fifty dimensions-- or the

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.450
set of vectors that define a
line, that two points sit on,

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.060
in fifty dimensions-- which is
very hard to visualize, but we

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.340
can actually deal with
it mathematically.
