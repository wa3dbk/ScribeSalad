00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.570
The whole process of natural
selection is to some degree

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.690
dependent on the idea of
variation, that within any

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.450
population of a species, you
have some genetic variation.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.630
So, for example, let's say I
have a bunch of-- well, this

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.500
is a circle species, and one guy
is that color, and then I

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.960
got a bunch more, maybe some
are that color-- oh, that's

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.080
the same color-- that one, and
that one, and that one.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.630
And for whatever reason,
sometimes there are no

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.030
environmental factors that will
predispose one of these

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.800
guys to be able to survive and
reproduce over the other, but

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.530
every now and then, there might
be some environmental

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.620
factor, and it makes maybe, all
of a sudden, this guy more

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.090
fit to reproduce.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.170
And so for whatever reason, this
guy is able to reproduce

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.820
more frequently and these
guys less frequently.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.140
And some of them get killed,
or whatever, or eaten by

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.460
birds, or whatever, or they're
just not able to reproduce for

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.070
whatever reason, and then maybe
these guys are something

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.860
in between.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.960
So over time, the frequency of
the different traits you see

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.400
in this population
will change.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.710
And if they are drastic enough,
maybe these guys start

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.910
becoming dominant and start not
liking these guys, because

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.330
they're so different
or whatever else.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.110
We could see a lot of
different reasons.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.460
This could eventually turn
into a different species.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.760
Now, the obvious question is
what leads to this variation?

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.520
In a population what leads to
this-- in fact, even in our

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.710
population, what leads to one
person having dirty blonde

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.490
hair, one person having brown
hair, one person having black

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.630
hair, and we have the spectrum
of skin complexions and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.590
heights is pretty
much infinite.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.900
What causes that?

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.930
And then one thing that I kind
of point to, we talked about

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.500
this a little bit in
the DNA video, is

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.440
this notion of mutations.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.310
DNA, we learned, is just a
sequence of these bases.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.430
So adenine, guanine, let's say
I've got some thymine going.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.990
I have some more adenine,
some cytosine.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.780
And that these code, if you have
enough of these in a row,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.030
maybe you have a few hundred
or a few thousand of these,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.720
these code for proteins or
they code for things that

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.020
control other proteins,
but maybe you have a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.770
change in one of them.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.330
Maybe this cytosine for whatever
reason becomes a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.270
guanine randomly, or maybe these
got deleted, and that

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.820
would change the DNA.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.150
But you could imagine, if I
went to someone's computer

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.220
code and just randomly started
changing letters and randomly

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.480
started inserting letters
without really knowing what

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.790
I'm doing, most of the time,
I'm going to break the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.060
computer program.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.800
Most of the time, the great
majority of the time, this is

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.050
going to go nowhere.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.390
It'll either do nothing, for
example, if I go into

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.240
someone's computer program and
if I just add a couple of

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.190
spaces or something, that might
not change the computer

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.200
program, but if I start getting
rid of semicolons and

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.610
start changing numbers and all
that, it'll probably make the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.840
computer program break.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.050
So it'll either do nothing or
it'll actually kill the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.600
organisms most of the time.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.730
Mutations: sometimes, they might
make the actual cell

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.060
kind of run amok, and we'll do a
whole maybe series of videos

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.920
on cancer, and that itself
obviously would hurt the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.840
organism as well as a whole,
although if it occurs after

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.500
the organism has reproduced, it
might not be something that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.750
selects against the organism
and it also

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.930
wouldn't be passed on.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.790
But anyway, I won't go
detailed into that.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.470
But the whole point is that
mutations don't seem to be a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.470
satisfying source
of variation.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.350
They could be a source or kind
of contribute on the margin,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.910
but there must be something more
profound than mutations

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.970
that's creating the diversity
even within, or maybe I should

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.280
call it the variation, even
within a population.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.800
And the answer here is
really it's kind of

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.710
right in front of us.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.300
It really addresses kind of one
of the most fundamental

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.260
things about biology, and it's
so fundamental that a lot of

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.790
people never even question
why it is the way it is.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.910
And that is sexual
reproduction.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.670
And when I mean sexual
reproduction, it's this notion

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.870
that you have, and pretty much
if you look at all organisms

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.680
that have nucleuses-- and we
call those eukaroytes.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.780
Maybe I'll do a whole video on
eukaryotes versus prokaryotes,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.050
but it's the notion that if you
look universally all the

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.190
way from plants-- not
universally, but if you look

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.640
at cells that have nucleuses,
they almost universally have

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.640
this phenomenon that you have
males and you have females.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.510
In some organisms, an organism
can be both a male and a

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.920
female, but the common idea
here is that all organisms

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.530
kind of produce versions of
their genetic material that

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.960
mix with other organisms'
version of

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.140
their genetic material.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.410
If mutations were the only
source of variation, then I

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.900
could just bud off other Sals.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.640
Maybe just other Sals would just
bud off from me, and then

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.550
randomly one Sal might be a
little bit different and

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.320
whatever else.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.630
But that would, as we already
talked about, most of the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.730
time, we would have very little
change, very little

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.500
variation, and whatever
variation does occur because

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.160
of any kind of noise being
introduced into this kind of

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.650
budding process where I just
replicate myself identically,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.100
most of the time it'll
be negative.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.790
Most of the time, it'll
break the organism.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.660
Now, when you have sexual
reproduction, what happens?

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.380
Well, you keep mixing and
matching every possible

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:35.750
combination of DNA in a kind
of species pool of DNA.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.510
So let me make this a little
bit more concrete for you.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.780
So let me erase this horrible
drawing I just did.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.300
So we all have-- let me stick
to humans because

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.550
that's what we are.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.700
We have 23 pairs of chromosomes,
and in each pair,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.210
we have one chromosome from our
mother and one chromosome

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.550
from our father.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.470
So let me draw that.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.890
So I'll draw my father's
chromosomes in blue.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:15.270
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15--

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.280
I'm running out of space.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:25.410
Let me do more here-- 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and then

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.770
I'll throw another one
here that looks

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.970
a little bit different.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.660
I'll throw one here that looks
like a Y, and we'll talk more

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.340
about the X's and the
Y chromosomes.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.870
Then I have 23 chromosomes
from my mother.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.470
And not to be stereotypical,
but maybe I'll do that in a

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.220
more feminine color.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.360
Let's see, so I have 23
chromosomes from my mother.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:56.480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.740
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.730
So what's going on here?

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.870
I have 23 from my mother.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.620
I have 23 from my father.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.070
Now, each of these chromosomes,
and I made them

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.320
right next to each other.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.870
So let me zoom in on
one pair of these.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.390
So let's say we look at
chromosome number-- I'll just

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.340
call this chromosome number 3.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.150
So let me zoom in on chromosome
number 3.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.330
I have one from my mother
right here.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.650
Actually, maybe I'll
do it this way.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:43.230
Remember, chromosome is just a
big-- if you take the DNA, the

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.930
DNA just keeps wrapping around,
and it actually wraps

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.100
around all these proteins, and
it creates this structure, but

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.430
it's just a big-- when you see
it like that, you're like, oh,

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.860
maybe the DNA-- no, but this
could have millions of base

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.010
pair, so maybe it'll look
something like that.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:01.100
It's a densely wrapped version
of-- well, it's a long string

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.230
of DNA, and when it's normally
drawn like this, which is not

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.640
always the way it is, and we'll
talk more about that,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.240
they draw it as densely
packed like that.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.170
So let's say that's
from my mother and

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.990
that's from my father.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:21.120
Now, let's call this
chromosome 3.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.680
They're both chromosome 3.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.270
And what the idea here is that
I'm getting different traits

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.410
from my father and
from my mother.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.990
And I'm doing a gross
oversimplification here, but

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.620
this is really just to
give you the idea of

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.070
what's going on.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.820
This chromosome 3, maybe
it contains this

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.460
trait for hair color.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:45.930
And maybe my father had-- and
I'll use my actual example.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.470
My father had very
straight hair.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:53.530
So someplace on this chromosome,
there's a gene for

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:54.470
hair straightness.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.210
Let's say it's a little
thing right there.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.610
And remember, that gene could
be thousands of base pairs,

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.540
but let's say this is
hair straightness.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.360
So my father's version of that
gene, he had the allele for

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:05.800
straightness.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.230
And remember, an allele is just
a version of a gene, so

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.800
I'll call it the allele straight
for straight hair.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.770
Now, this other chromosome that
my mother gave me, this

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.150
essentially, and there are
exceptions, but for the most

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.750
part, it codes for the same
genes, and that's why I put

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.860
them next to each other.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.210
So this will also have the gene
for hair straightness or

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.520
curlyness, but my mom
does happen to

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.600
actually have curly hair.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.250
So she has the gene right
there for curly hair.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.700
The version of the gene
here is allele curly.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.610
The gene just says, look, this
is the gene for whether or not

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.600
your hair is curly.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.500
Each version of the gene
is called an allele.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.640
Allele curly.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.690
Now, when I got both of these in
my body or in my cells, and

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.040
this is in every cell of my
body, every cell of my body

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.080
except for, and we'll talk in
a few seconds about my germ

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.330
cells, but every cells other
than the ones that I use for

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:12.060
reproduction have this complete
set of chromosomes in

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.330
it, which I find amazing.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.690
But only certain chromosomes--
for example, these genes will

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.360
be completely useless in my
fingernails, because all of a

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.760
sudden, the straight and the
curly don't matter that much.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.880
And I'm simplifying.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.980
Maybe they will on some
other dimension.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.700
But let's say for simplicity,
they won't

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.850
matter in certain places.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.240
So certain genes are expressed
in certain parts of the body,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.600
but every one of your body
cells, and we call those

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.980
somatic cells, and we'll
separate those from the sex

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:45.050
sells or the germs that we'll
talk about later.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.060
So this is my body cells.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.220
So this is the great majority
of your cells, and this is

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.030
opposed to your germ cells.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.080
And the germ cells-- I'll just
write it here, just so you get

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.950
a clear-- for a male, that's
the sperm cells, and for

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.210
female that's the egg
cells, or the ova.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:09.310
But most of my cells have a
complete collection of these,

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.370
and what I want to give you
the idea is that for every

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.200
trait, I essentially have two
versions: one from my mother

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.630
and one from my father.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.065
Now, these right here are called
homologous chromosomes.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:32.840
What that means is every time
you see this prefix homologous

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.850
or if you see like Homo sapiens
or even the word

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:41.110
homosexual or homogeneous,
it means same, right?

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.640
You see that all the time.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.990
So homologous means that they're
almost the same.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:52.230
They're coding for the most part
the same set of genes,

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.100
but they're not identical.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.950
They actually might code for
slightly different versions of

00:11:58.950 --> 00:11:59.660
the same gene.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.920
So depending on what versions
I get, what is actually

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.120
expressed for me, so my
genotype-- let me introduce

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.940
another word, and
I'm overwhelming

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.490
you with words here.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:17.630
So my genotype is exactly what
alleles I have, what versions

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.170
of the gene.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.210
So I got like the fifth version
of the curly allele.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.850
There could be multiple versions
of the curly allele

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.490
in our gene pool.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.820
And maybe I got some version
of the straight allele.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.980
That is my genotype.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:36.170
My phenotype is what my hair
really looks like.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.720
So, for example, two people
could have different genotypes

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.880
with the same-- they might
code for hair that looks

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.560
pretty much the same,
so it might have a

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.870
very similar phenotype.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:48.980
So one phenotype can be

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.640
represented by multiple genotypes.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.690
So that's just one thing to
think about, and we'll talk a

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.780
lot about that in the future,
but I just wanted to introduce

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.380
you to that there.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.200
Now, I entered this whole
discussion because I wanted to

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.430
talk about variation.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.570
So how does variation happen?

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:09.130
Well, what's going to happen
when I-- well, let

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:09.640
me put it this way.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.290
What's going to happen
when I reproduce?

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.990
And I have. I have a son.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.160
Well, my contribution to my son
is going to be a random

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.530
collection of half
of these genes.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.830
For each homologous pair, I'm
either going to contribute the

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.740
one that I got from my mother or
the one that I got from my

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.250
father, right?

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:37.360
So let's say that the sperm cell
that went on to fertilize

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:43.440
my wife's egg, let's say it
happened to have that one,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.400
that one, or I could
just pick one from

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.830
each of these 23 sets.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.020
And you say, well, how many
combinations are there?

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:56.240
Well, for every set, I could
pick one of the two homologous

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.550
chromosomes, and I'm going
to do that 23 times.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.360
2 times 2 times 2, so that's
2 to the twenty third.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:09.220
So 2 to the 23 different
versions that I can contribute

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.800
to any son or daughter that I
might have. We'll talk about

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.310
how that happens when we talk
about meiosis or mitosis, that

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.660
when I generate my sperm cells,
sperm cells essentially

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:26.590
takes one-- instead of having
23 pairs of chromosomes in

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.540
sperm, you only have
23 chromosomes.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.760
So, for example, I'll take one
from each of those, and

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.030
through the process of meiosis,
which we'll go into,

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.200
I'll generate a bunch
of sperm cells.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:44.740
And each sperm cell will have
one from each of these pairs,

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.440
one version from each
of those pairs.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.980
So maybe for this chromosome I
get it from my dad, from the

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.370
next chromosome, I get
it from my mom.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.840
Then I donate a couple more
from-- I should've drawn them

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.820
next to each other.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.580
I donate a couple more
from my mom.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.540
Then for chromosome number 5,
it comes from my dad, and so

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.200
on and so forth.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.200
But there's 2 to the
twenty-third combinations

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.240
here, because there
are 23 pairs that

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.290
I'm collecting from.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.530
Now, my wife's egg is going to
have the same situation.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.600
There are 2 to the 23 different
combinations of DNA

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.730
that she can contribute just
based on which of the

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.590
homologous pairs she
will contribute.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.390
So the possible combinations
that just one couple can

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:34.990
produce, and I'm using my life
as an example, but this

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.980
applies to everything.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.430
This applies to every species
that experiences sexual

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.190
reproduction.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:46.280
So if I can give 2 to
twenty-third combinations of

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.620
DNA and my wife can give 2 to
the 23 combinations of DNA,

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:55.240
then we can produce 2 to the
forty-sixth combinations.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.220
Now, just to give an idea of how
large of a number this is,

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.560
this is roughly 12,000 times the
number of human beings on

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.490
the planet today.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.210
So there's a huge amount of
variation that even one couple

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.270
can produce.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:12.260
And if you thought that even
that isn't enough, it turns

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.560
out that amongst these
homologous pairs, and we'll

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.510
talk about when this happens in
meiosis, you can actually

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.630
have DNA recombination.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.450
And all that means is when these
homologous pairs during

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.730
meiosis line up near each other,
you can have this thing

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:32.340
called crossover, where all of
this DNA here crosses over and

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.430
touches over here, and all
this DNA crosses over and

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.200
touches over there.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.550
So all of this goes there and
all of this goes there.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:44.010
What you end up with after the
crossover is that one DNA, the

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.980
one that came from my mom, or
that I thought came from my

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.980
mom, now has a chunk that came
from my dad, and the chunk

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:55.150
that came from my dad, now has a
chunk that came from my mom.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.700
Let me do that in
the right color.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.110
It came from my mom like that.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.980
And so that even increases the
amount of variety even more.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.329
So you can almost now, instead
of talking about the different

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.140
chromosomes that you're
contributing where the

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.359
chromosomes are each of these
collections of DNA, you're now

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.579
talking about-- you can almost
go to the different

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:13.700
combinations at the gene level,
and now you can think

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.410
about it in almost infinite
form of variation.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.910
You can think about all of the
variation that might emerge

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.720
when you start mixing and
matching different versions of

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.560
the same gene in a population.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.150
And you don't just
look at one gene.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.350
I mean, the reality is that
genes by themselves very

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.290
seldom code for a specific-- you
can very seldom look for

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.330
one gene and say, oh, that is
brown hair, or look for one

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.330
gene and say, oh, that's
intelligence, or that is how

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.550
likable someone is.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.020
It's usually a whole set of
genes interacting in an

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.840
incredibly complicated way.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.430
You know, hair might be coded
for by this whole set of genes

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.720
on multiple chromosomes and
this might be coded for a

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.880
whole set of genes on multiple
chromosomes.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.630
And so then you can start
thinking about all of the

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.690
different combinations.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.500
And then all of a sudden, maybe
some combination that

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.190
never existed before all of a
sudden emerges, and that's

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.450
very successful.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.020
But I'll leave you to think
about it because maybe that

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.770
combination might be passed on,
or it may not be passed on

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.580
because of this recombination.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.480
But we'll talk more about
that in the future.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.720
But I wanted to introduce this
idea of sexual reproduction to

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:21.690
you, because this really is the
main source of variation

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.080
within a population.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.730
To me, it's kind of a
philosophical idea, because we

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:31.580
almost take the idea of having
males and females for granted

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.080
because it's this
universal idea.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.400
But I did a little reading on
it, and it turns out that this

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.310
actually only emerged about 1.4
billion years ago, that

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.820
this is almost a useful trait,
because once you introduce

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.360
this level of variation, the
natural selection can start--

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.300
you can kind of say that when
you have this more powerful

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.910
form of variation than just pure
mutations, and maybe you

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.540
might have some primitive form
of crossover before, but now

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.220
that you have this sexual
reproduction and you have this

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.980
variation, natural selection
can occur in a

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.320
more efficient way.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.510
So that species that were able
to reproduce and essentially

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.650
recombine their DNA and mix and
match it in this way were

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:13.060
able to produce more variety and
were able to essentially

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.120
be selected for their
environment in a more

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.740
efficient way so they started
to essentially outnumber the

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.050
ones that couldn't, so it
became a kind of very

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.720
universal trait.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.760
But you could have imagined a
world, and there are science

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.180
fiction books written about
this, where you have three

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.160
genders, where you have gender
one, two, three.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.410
You could have 10 genders.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:36.040
It just happens to be that on
Earth, this notion of having

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.750
two genders turned out to be a
very efficient and stable way

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.640
of introducing variation
into a population.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.070
So, hopefully, you found
that interesting.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.140
In the next video, I'll go more
into the detail of how

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.790
exactly meiosis and
mitosis works.
