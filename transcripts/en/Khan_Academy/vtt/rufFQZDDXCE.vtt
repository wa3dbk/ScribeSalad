00:00:01.096 --> 00:00:04.407
For acute angle E, so that's this angle

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:05.143
right over here,

00:00:05.143 --> 00:00:06.352
it tells that sin of E is 5 over

00:00:06.352 --> 00:00:09.601
the square root of 41, and cotangent of E is

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.853
equal to 8/10. Find the values of the

00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:15.137
other four trigonometric ratios. So for

00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:17.272
the trig ratios, I like to use SOH-CAH-TOA

00:00:17.272 --> 00:00:20.263
to remember what the definitions of the trig ratios were

00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:21.100
So let me write this down,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.845
SOH, CAH

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:26.069
I'll write CAH in a different color,

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.537
SOH, CAH

00:00:28.537 --> 00:00:29.606
that's not a different color

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:30.515
I'm trying-

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:32.604
I'm having trouble changing colors!

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:35.355
SOH, CAH, TOA.

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:36.845
SOH, CAH, TOA.

00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:40.404
So, SOH tells us that sine of an angle

00:00:40.404 --> 00:00:41.604
in this case we care about angle E,

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:44.933
is equal to the opposite over the hypotenuse.

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.076
If we look at angle E, what is the opposite?

00:00:47.076 --> 00:00:48.804
Well, we go across the triangle

00:00:48.804 --> 00:00:50.681
the opposite is right over there.

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:53.515
That is the opposite so it would be equal to

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:55.800
5 over the hypotenuse.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.801
Well, the hypotenuse is opposite the right-angle,

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.867
and it's the longest side of the triangle, it's side DE

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:04.269
and has length of square-root of 41.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.853
Square-root of 41.

00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:07.770
So that's consistently the information they gave us

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.869
so this was kind of redundant information,

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.267
we could have figured that out just from

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:13.432
the diagram.

00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:15.136
But at least we got that out of the way.

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:16.773
Now let's think about,

00:01:16.773 --> 00:01:20.145
now let's think about the reciprocal of the sine of E,

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:23.679
which is the co-secant of E.

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.536
Co-secant of E

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:28.354
which is the reciprocal sine which is

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.351
hypotenuse over the opposite.

00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:31.271
and we could-

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:32.535
we don't even have to look at the triangle

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:33.767
we could just say the reciprocal

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:35.605
which would be the square-root of 41 over 5.

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:39.470
Or you could look back at this and try to figure that out.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.934
Now let's think about the cosine.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:44.203
What is the cosine?

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:48.770
What is the cosine of E going to be equal to?

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.736
Well, first think of what the definition is.

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:53.203
Cosine of E is going to be what?

00:01:53.203 --> 00:01:54.773
Well, CAH tells us that this is going to be

00:01:54.773 --> 00:01:58.688
equal to the adjacent over the hypotenuse.

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:02.098
Well, if we look over here, we know what the hypotenuse is.

00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:04.268
The hypotenuse the same.

00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:09.349
The hypotenuse is the square-root of 41.

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.801
What is the adjacent side?

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:13.210
What length does the adjacent side have?

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.018
Well, for angle E, the adjacent side is side FE

00:02:16.018 --> 00:02:18.203
and we don't know what that is right over here.

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:20.203
So that is the adjacent side and

00:02:20.203 --> 00:02:21.354
we don't know what that is

00:02:21.354 --> 00:02:22.770
So I'll just write 'a'.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.355
'a' for how they marked it on this,

00:02:24.355 --> 00:02:26.683
or you could also do this 'a' for 'adjacent.

00:02:26.683 --> 00:02:27.737
So right now we're just gonna

00:02:27.737 --> 00:02:30.069
leave it with the variable 'a' over the square-root of 41

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.199
maybe we can get a little bit more information

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.603
that helps us to figure out what 'a' is

00:02:34.603 --> 00:02:37.535
over the course of this problem.

00:02:37.535 --> 00:02:39.891
If you wanna figure out what the secant of E is,

00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:41.809
well, that's just the inverse of the cosine

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.137
it's hypotenuse over adjacent,

00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:47.473
so it's going to be the square-root of 41 over 'a'.

00:02:47.473 --> 00:02:51.139
Whatever 'a' is. Hopefully we can figure that out.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.473
Now let's use TOA.

00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:57.936
That tells us that the tangent of E is equal to the opposite over the adjacent.

00:02:57.936 --> 00:03:01.388
Well, what's the opposite side to angle E?

00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:05.224
Well, it's side- it has length 5, it's side DF

00:03:05.224 --> 00:03:06.675
The opposite is 5.

00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:08.670
And we still don't know the length of the adjacent side.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.804
That's this side of length 'a'.

00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:13.674
So I'll just write 'a', right over there.

00:03:13.674 --> 00:03:15.535
Now what about cotangent?

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:18.209
Well, cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent.

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.401
So it's adjacent over opposite or in this case,

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:24.616
'a' over 5.

00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:28.109
Adjacent over opposite; 'a' over 5.

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.358
Well, what do they already tell us?

00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:34.032
And using that, can you figure out what 'a' is?

00:03:34.032 --> 00:03:37.286
Well, they already told us that cotangent of E

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:40.203
is equal to 8/10.

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:41.604
There's a little clue here that this is not

00:03:41.604 --> 00:03:43.074
reduced fully; 8/10.

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:44.473
8 and 10 share common factors.

00:03:44.473 --> 00:03:47.269
So they already tell us that cotangent of E is 8/10.

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.605
So if we use the definition of cotangent of E we get 'a' over 5,

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:56.014
and they tell us that that is going to be equal to 8/10.

00:03:56.014 --> 00:03:59.939
So we can write, we have an equation now to solve for 'a'.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.003
And if we solve for 'a' now we can figure out all of the other,

00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:05.088
all of the other ratios.

00:04:05.088 --> 00:04:06.469
So let's do that.

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:09.843
So we have 'a' over 5 is equal to,

00:04:09.843 --> 00:04:11.268
-we'll simplify this in a little bit-

00:04:11.268 --> 00:04:13.437
what is 8/10 if you simplify it?

00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:16.354
Well, we have 8 by- we have a common factor of 2-

00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:19.140
if you divide 8 by 2 you get 4,

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.933
we divide 10 by two, we get 5.

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:24.468
So we get 'a' over 5 is equal to 4/5.

00:04:24.468 --> 00:04:26.935
And so this is actually- we could cross-multiply or

00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:29.077
multiply both sides by 5 and you would get

00:04:29.077 --> 00:04:30.203
-either way-

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:33.204
you would get that 'a' is equal to 4.

00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:35.771
Let's do that, just to show you you can do it systematically.

00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:39.203
And you're left with 'a' is equal to 4 which is great

00:04:39.203 --> 00:04:42.803
because we can now say that the cotangent of E,

00:04:42.803 --> 00:04:46.101
yes it's 8/10 which is the same thing as 4/5.

00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:47.472
We could say that the tangent of E

00:04:47.472 --> 00:04:48.768
-instead of saying it's 5 over 'a'-

00:04:48.768 --> 00:04:51.936
we can now say that it's 5 over 4.

00:04:51.936 --> 00:04:54.670
And now what would the cosine of E be?

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.536
Well, it was 'a' over (square-root of) 41,

00:04:56.536 --> 00:04:58.938
now it is -let me do that in a different color-

00:04:58.938 --> 00:05:01.329
now it is 4 over the square-root of 41.

00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:05.431
And what is the secant of E now?

00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:08.184
Well, it was square-root of 41 over 'a',

00:05:08.184 --> 00:05:12.871
now it's square-root of 41 over 4.

00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:15.437
Because now we know the value of 'a'.

00:05:15.437 --> 00:05:18.373
And we can verify that 'a' is equal to 4

00:05:18.373 --> 00:05:20.019
by using the Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.436
In fact, we could've solved it that way.

00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:24.095
But the whole point, I'm suspecting, of this problem,

00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:27.266
is to actually establish this (a = 4)

00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:28.767
using this (cotangent of E= 8/10) information

00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:30.813
even although we could have done it using the Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:30.813 --> 00:05:33.068
But let's just verify that this 'a=4' satisfies

00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:34.936
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:36.999
So if we take this side right over here,

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:40.603
we got 4 squared plus 5 squared

00:05:40.603 --> 00:05:44.471
should be equal to the square-root of 41 squared.

00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:46.880
Should be equal to the hypotenuse squared.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.964
Square-root of 41 squared.

00:05:48.964 --> 00:05:50.804
So 4 squared is 16,

00:05:50.804 --> 00:05:52.736
5 squared is 25,

00:05:52.736 --> 00:05:54.135
so does this actually meet-

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:56.939
does this actually satisfy the Pythagorean theorem?

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:00.402
So 16 plus 25,

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.805
square-root of 41 squared is 41,

00:06:02.805 --> 00:06:06.623
16 plus 25 is indeed 41.

00:06:06.623 --> 00:06:09.538
So at least it's consistent with the Pythagorean theorem,

00:06:09.538 --> 00:06:12.000
and we are done!
