00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.430
Let's see if we can build a bit
on some of our work with

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.040
linear transformation.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.290
I have two linear
transformations.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.190
I have the transformation S,
that's a mapping, or function,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.870
from the set X to the set Y.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:24.690
And let's just say that X
is a subset of of Rn.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.736
Y is a subset of Rm.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.670
Then we know S is a linear
transformation.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.430
It can be represented by a
matrix vector product.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.080
We can write S of X.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.620
Let me do it in the same color
as I was doing it before.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.270
We can write that S of some
vector X, is equal to some

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.170
matrix A times X.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.460
The matrix A, it's going to be
X, whatever X we input into

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.720
the function, although we
take the mapping of.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.460
It's going to be in this set,
right here, is going to be a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.560
member of Rn.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.500
This is going to
be right here.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.929
Let me do it like this.

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:10.490
X is going to be
a member of Rn.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.340
Well, it's actually going to be
a member of X, which is a

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.690
subset of Rn.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.060
I'm just trying to figure out
what the dimensions of matrix

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.310
A are going to be.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.810
This is going to have n
components right here.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.530
Matrix A has to have
n columns.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.740
Matrix A is going to be, let's
just say, is an m by n matrix.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.560
Fair enough.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.550
Let's say we have another
linear transformation.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.870
Let me draw what I've
done so far.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.760
We have sum set X, right
here, that is set X.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.920
It is a subset of Rn.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.600
Rn, I can draw out there.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.140
We have this mapping, S, or this
linear transformation,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.360
from X to Y.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.610
It goes to a new set,
Y, right here.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.870
Y is a member of Rm.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.590
The mapping X, right here.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.710
You take some element here,
and you apply the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.920
transformation S.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.630
I've told you it's a linear
transformation.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.710
You'll get to some value in
set Y, which is in Rm.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.590
I said that the matrix
representation of our linear

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.130
transformation is going to
be an m by n matrix.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.350
You're going to start with
something that has n entries,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.200
or a vector that's
a member of Rn.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.750
You want to end up with
a vector that's in Rm.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.750
Fair enough.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.050
Now, let's say I have another
linear transformation, T.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.520
It's a mapping from the
set Y to the set Z.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.770
Let me draw.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.790
I have another set here
called set Z.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.230
I can map from elements of Y, so
I could map from here, into

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.420
elements of Z using the linear
transformation T.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.370
Similar to what I did before.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.010
We know that Y is
a member of Rm.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.040
You know that this is a subset,
not a member, more of

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.070
a subset of Rm.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.240
These are just arbitrary
letters.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.770
It could be 100 or
5, or whatever.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.020
I'm just trying to
stay abstract.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.480
Z is a member, I'm running out
of letters, let's say Z is a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.480
member of Rl.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.680
Z is a member of Rl.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.760
Then, what's the transformation
T, what's it's

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.520
matrix representation
going to be.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.780
You know it's a linear
transformation.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.270
I told you that.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.890
We know it can be represented
in this form.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:47.180
We could say that T of X, where
X is a member of Rm, is

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.700
going to be equal to some
matrix B times X.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.720
What are the dimensions of
matrix B going to be.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.040
X is going to be a member of Rm,
so B is going to have to

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.760
have m columns.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.480
And then it's a mapping into a
set that's a member of Rl.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.080
It's going to map from members
of Rm to members of Rl.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.460
It's going to be
l by m matrix.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.089
When you see this, a very
natural question might arise

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.940
in your head.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.220
Can we construct some mapping
that goes all the way, that

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.250
goes all the way, from set
X all the way to set T.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.330
Maybe we'll call that the
composition of-- I mean we can

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.870
create that mapping using a
combination of S and T.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.800
Let's just make up some word.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.790
Let's just call T, with this
little circle S, let's just

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.420
call this a mapping from
X all the way to Z.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:05:03.220
We'll call this the composition
of T with S.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.280
We're essentially just combining
the two functions in

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.260
order to try to create some
mapping that takes us from T,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.290
from set X, all the
way to set Z.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.440
We still haven't defined this.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.820
How can we actually
construct this.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.590
A natural thing might be to
first apply transformation S.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.510
Let's say that this is our X
we're dealing with right here.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.990
Maybe the first thing we want to
do is apply S, and that'll

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.880
give us an S of X.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.030
That will give us this value,
right here, that's in set Y.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.750
And then what if we were to take
that value and apply the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.210
transformation T to it?

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.540
We would take this value, and
apply the transformation T to

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.370
it, to maybe get
to this value.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.610
This would be the linear
transformation T applied to

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:56.370
this value, this member of the
set Y, which is in Rm.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.630
We are just going to apply that
transformation to this

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.810
guy, right here, which was the
transformation S applied to X.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.380
This might look fancy, but all
this is, remember this is just

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.640
a vector, right here,
in the set Y, which

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.350
is a subset of Rm.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.930
This is a vector that is in X.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.290
When you apply mapping,
you get another

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.750
vector that's in Y.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.870
You apply the linear
transformation T to that, then

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.270
you get another vector
that's at set Z.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.815
Let's define the composition
of T with S.

00:06:24.815 --> 00:06:27.640
This is going to be
a definition.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.182
Let's define the composition of
T with S to be-- first we

00:06:32.182 --> 00:06:35.840
apply S to some vector in X.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.610
Apply S to some vector
in X to get us here.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.310
Then we apply T to that vector
to get us to set Z.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.440
To get us to set-- so we apply
T to this thing right there.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.530
The first question might be,
is this even a linear

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.080
transformation?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.300
Is the composition of two linear
transformations even a

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.550
linear transformation?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.020
Well there are two requirements
to be a linear

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.620
transformation.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.170
The sum of the linear
transformation of the sum of

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.410
two vectors, should be the
linear transformation of each

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.650
of them summed together.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.500
I know when I just say that
verbally, it probably doesn't

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.270
make a lot of sense.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.860
Let's try to take the
composition, the composition

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:29.760
of T with S of the sum
of two vectors in X.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.450
I'm taking the vectors
x and the vectors y.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.700
By definition, what
is this equal to?

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:43.280
This is equal to applying to
linear transformation T to the

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.070
linear transformation S,
applied to our two

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.190
vectors, x plus y.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.130
What is this equal to?

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.540
I told you at the beginning of
the video, that S is a linear

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.720
transformation.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.890
So by definition, of a linear
transformation, one of our

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.940
requirements, we know that S of
x plus y is the same thing

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:11.400
as S of x plus S of y, because
S is a linear transformation.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.120
We know that is true.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.210
We know that we can replace this
thing right there with

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.900
that thing right there.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.220
We also know that T is a
linear transformation.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.940
Which means that the
transformation applied to the

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:29.750
sum of two vectors is equal to
the transformation of each of

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.370
the vectors summed up.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:37.289
The transformation of S of x, or
the transformation applied

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.320
to the transformation of S
applied to x, I know the

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:49.200
terminology is getting confused,
plus T of S of y.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.320
We can do this because we
know that T is a linear

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.350
transformation.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.650
But what is this right here?

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.260
All this statement right here is
equal to the composition of

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:06.720
T with S, applied to x, plus the
composition of T with S,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.960
applied to y.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.320
Given that both T and S are
linear transformations, we got

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.580
our first requirement.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.520
That the composition applied to
the sum of two vectors is

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.470
equal to the composition
applied to each of the

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.940
vectors summed up.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.660
That was our first requirement
for linear transformation.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.930
Our second one is, we need
to apply this to a scalar

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.270
multiple of a vector in X.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:36.030
So, T of S, or let me say it
this way, the composition of T

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:41.090
with S applied to some scalar
multiple of some vector x,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.790
that's in our set X.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.630
This is a vector x,
that's our set X.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.510
This should be a capital X.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.220
This is equal to what.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.740
Well, by our definition of our
linear, of our composition,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.620
this is equal to the
transformation T applied to

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:03.760
the transformation S, applied
to c times our vector x.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.570
What is this equal to?

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.380
We know that this is a linear
transformation.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.910
Given that this is a linear
transformation, that S is a

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.060
linear transformation, we know
that this can be rewritten as

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:19.860
T times c times S
applied to x.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.470
This little replacing that I
did, with S applied to c times

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.600
x, is the same thing as
c times the linear

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.170
transformation applied to x.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.630
This just comes out of the
fact that S is a linear

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.330
transformation.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.370
We've done that multiple
times.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.170
Now we have T applied
to some scalar

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.470
multiple of some vector.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.460
We can do the same thing.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.570
We know that T is a linear
transformation.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.990
We know that this is equal to,
I'll do it down here, this is

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:51.960
equal to c times T applied to
S applied to some vector x

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.370
that's in there.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.780
What is this equal =?

00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:00.990
This is equal to the constant c
times the composition T with

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.400
S of our vector x right there.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.930
We've met our second requirement
for linear

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.530
transformation.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.940
The composition as we've defined
it is definitely a

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.190
linear transformation.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.400
This means that the composition
of T with S can be

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.400
written as some matrix-- let
me write it this way-- the

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.490
composition of T with
S applied to, or the

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.580
transformation of, which is
a composition of T with S,

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:40.210
applied to some vector x, can
be written as some matrix

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.800
times our vector x.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.130
And what will be the dimensions
of our matrix?

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.990
We're going from a n dimension
space, so this is going to

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.210
have n columns, to a
l dimension space.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.290
So this is going
to have l rows.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.160
This is going to be
an l by n matrix.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.870
I'll leave you there
in this video.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.750
I realize I've been making too
many 20 minutes plus videos.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.010
The next video, now that we
know this is a linear

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.205
transformation, and that we know
that we can represent it

00:12:07.205 --> 00:12:09.180
as a matrix vector product.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.990
We'll actually figure out how
to represent this matrix,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.490
especially in relation to the
two matrices that define our

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.910
transformations, S and T.
