00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.880
In this video, I want to prove
some of the basic properties

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.370
of the dot product, and you
might find what I'm doing in

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.400
this video somewhat mundane.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.330
You know, to be frank, it
is somewhat mundane.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.510
But I'm doing it for
two reasons.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.570
One is, this is the type of
thing that's often asked of

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.670
you when you take a linear
algebra class.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.530
But more importantly, it gives
you the appreciation that we

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.810
really are kind of building up
a mathematics of vectors from

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.250
the ground up, and you really
can't assume anything.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.780
You ready to prove everything
for yourself.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.520
So the first thing I want to
prove is that the dot product,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.930
when you take the vector dot
product, so if I take v dot w

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.000
that it's commutative.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.350
That the order that I take the
dot product doesn't matter.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.140
I want to prove to myself that
that is equal to w dot v.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.300
And so, how do we do that?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.580
Well, and this is the general
pattern for a lot of these

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.320
vector proofs.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.710
Let's just write out
the vectors.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.460
So v will look like v1, v2,
all the way down to vn.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.330
Let's say that this
is equal to v.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.350
And let's say that w is
equal to w1, w2, all

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.990
the way down to wn.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.590
So what does v dot w equal?

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.840
v dot to w is equal to--
I'll switch colors

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.210
here-- v1 times w1.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:37.600
Plus v2 w2 plus all
the way to vn wn.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.730
Fair enough.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.190
Now what does w dot v equal?

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.880
Well w dot v-- you know, when I
had made the definition, you

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.300
just multiply the products.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.930
But I'll just do it in the order
that they gave it to us.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.340
So it equals w1 v1 plus w2 v2.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.430
Plus all the way to wn vn.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.970
Now, these are clearly equal to
each other because if you

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.729
just match up the first term
with the first term, those are

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.510
clearly equal to each other.
v1 w1 is equal to w1 v1.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.810
And I can say this now because
now we're just dealing with

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.530
regular numbers.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.470
Here we were dealing with
vectors and we were taking

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.030
this weird type of
multiplication

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.300
called the dot product.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.360
But now I can definitely say
that these are equal because

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.310
this is just regular
multiplication.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.925
And this is just a commutative
property.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.600
Let me see if I'm spelling
commutative.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.040
We learned this in-- I don't
know when you learned this, in

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.950
second or third grade.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.890
So you know that those are equal
and by the same argument

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.360
you know that these
two are equal.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.200
You could just rewrite each of
these terms just by switching

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.810
that around.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.160
That's just from basic
multiplication of scalar

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.250
numbers, of just regular
real numbers.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.810
So that's what tells us that
these two things are equal or

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.230
these two things are equal.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.330
So we've proven to ourselves
that order doesn't matter when

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.100
you take the dot product.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.020
Now the next thing we could take
a look at is whether the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.520
dot product exhibits the
distributive property.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.850
So let me just define another
vector x here.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.000
Another vector x and you
can imagine how I'm

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.200
going to define it.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.770
x1, x2, all the way
down to xn.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.580
Now, what I want to see if the
dot product deals with the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.200
distributive property the way I
would expect it to, then if

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.320
I were to add v plus w and
then multiply that by x.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.030
And first of all, it shouldn't
matter what

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.970
order I do that with.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:42.590
I just showed it here.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.080
I could do x dot this thing.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.380
It shouldn't matter because
I just showed you it's

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.420
commutative.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.370
But if the distribution works,
then this should be the same

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.230
thing as v dot x plus w dot x.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.290
If these were just numbers
and this was just regular

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.306
multiplication, you would
multiply by it by each of the

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:01.280
terms, and that's what
I'm showing here.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.670
So let's see if this is true
for the dot product.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.300
So what is v plus w?

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.480
v plus w is equal to-- we just
add up each of their

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.730
corresponding terms. v1 plus
w1, v2 plus w2, all the way

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.460
down to vn plus wn.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.670
That's that right there.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:39.340
And then when we dot that with
x1, x2, all the way down to

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.900
xn, what do we get?

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:54.330
Well we get v1 plus w1 times
x1 plus v2 plus w2 times x2

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:01.080
plus all the way to vn
plus wn times xn.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.400
I just took the dot product
of these two.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.380
I just multiplied corresponding
components and

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.430
then added them all up.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.670
That was the dot product.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.270
This is v plus w dot x.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.360
Let me write that down.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.330
This is v plus w dot x.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.220
Now, let's work on these
things up here.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.140
Let me write it over here.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.600
What is v dot x?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.670
v dot x, we've seen
this before.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.110
This is just v1 x1.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.390
No vectors now.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.650
These are just actual
components.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.820
Plus v2 x2, all the
way to vn xn.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.950
What is w dot x?

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:52.100
w dot x is equal to w1 x1 plus
w2 x2, all the way to wn xn.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.550
Now what do you get when you
add these two things?

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.840
And notice, here I'm adding
two scalar quantities.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.350
That's a scalar.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.900
That's a scalar.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.250
We're not doing vector
addition anymore.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.340
So this is a scalar quantity and
this is a scalar quantity.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.820
So what do I get when
I add them?

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:18.640
So v dot x plus w dot x is equal
to v1 x1 plus w1 x1 plus

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:28.940
v2 x2 plus w2 x2, all the
way to vn xn plus wn xn.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.360
I know, it's very monotonous.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.870
But you could immediately see
we're just dealing with

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.850
regular numbers here.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.575
So we can take the x's out
and what do you get?

00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:38.600
Let me write it here.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.390
This is equal to-- we could
just take the x out,

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.850
factor the x out.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:49.710
v1 plus w1, x1 plus v2 plus
w2 x2, all the way

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.130
to vn plus wn xn.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.340
Which we see this is
the same thing as

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.000
this thing right here.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.460
So we just showed that this
expression right here, is the

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.380
same thing as that expression
or the distribution-- the

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.010
distributive property seems to
or does apply the way we would

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.470
expect to the dot product.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.880
I know this is so mundane.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.270
Why are we doing this?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.260
But I'm doing this to show you
that we're building things up.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.540
We couldn't just assume this.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.200
But the proof is pretty
straightforward.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.460
And in general, I didn't do
these proofs when I did it for

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.940
vector addition and scalar
multiplication, and I really

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.070
should have. But you can prove
the commutativity of it.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.740
Or for the scalar multiplication
you could prove

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.600
that distribution works for it
doing a proof exactly the same

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.100
way as this.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.030
A lot of math books or linear
algebra books just leave these

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.860
as exercises to the student
because it's mundane, so they

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.160
didn't think it was
worth their paper.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.190
But let me just show you, I
guess, the last property,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.300
associativity, the associative
property.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.430
So let me show you.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.570
If I take some scalar and
I multiply it times

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.710
v, some vector v.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.640
And then I take the dot product
of that with w, if

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.560
this is associative the way
multiplication in our everyday

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.100
world normally works, this
should be equal to-- and it's

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.020
still a question mark because
I haven't proven it to you.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:18.010
It should be equal to
c times v dot w.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:18.820
So let's figure it out.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.780
What's c times the vector v?

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:27.730
c times the vector v is c times
v1, c times v2, all the

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.560
way down to c times vn.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.460
And then the vector w, we
already know what that is.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.440
So dot w is equal to what?

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.870
It's equal to this times
the first term of w.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:49.580
So c v1 w1 plus this times the
second term of w, c v2 w2, all

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.970
the way to c vn wn.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.590
Fair enough.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.450
That's what this side
is equal to.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.060
Now let's do this side.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.970
What is v dot w?

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.440
I'll write it here.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.880
We've done this multiple
times.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:10.780
This is just v1 w1 plus v2
w2, all the way to vn wn.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.110
I'm getting tired of doing this
and you're probably tired

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.920
of watching it, but it's good
to go through the exercises.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.500
You know, if someone asked you
to do this now, you'll be able

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.380
to do this.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.210
Now what is c times this?

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:26.120
So if I multiply some scalar
times this, that's the same

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.460
thing as multiplying some
scalar times that.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.650
So I'm just multiplying a scalar
times a big-- this is

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.890
just the regular distributive
property of just numbers, of

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.320
just regular real numbers.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.510
So this is going to be equal to
c v1 w1 plus c v2 w2 plus

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.760
all the way to c vn wn.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.480
And we see that this is
equal to this because

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.040
this is equal to this.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.200
Now the hardest part of this--
I remember when I first took

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.300
linear algebra, I found when
the professor would assign,

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.740
you know, prove this.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.110
I would have trouble doing it
because it almost seems so

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.830
ridiculously obvious.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.460
That hey, well, obviously
if you just look at the

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.690
components of them, it just
turns into multiplying of each

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.700
individual component and adding
them up and those are

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.320
associative, so that's
obviously--

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.500
what's there to prove?

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.360
And it only took me a little
while that they just wanted me

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.920
to write that down.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.900
They didn't want something
earth shattering.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.400
They just wanted me to show
when you go component by

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.610
component and all you have to
do is assume kind of the

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.840
distributive or the associative
or the commutative

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.800
property of regular numbers,
that you could prove the same

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.770
properties also apply in a very
similar way, to vectors

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:34.880
and the dot product.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.480
So hopefully you found this
reasonably useful and I'll see

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.260
you in the next video where we
could use some of these tools

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.050
to actually prove some
more interesting

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.010
properties of vectors.
