00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Let's keep going.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.230
We're on problem number six
on page 278 of the data

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.450
sufficiency sample questions.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.800
So let's see.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.390
They've drawn a little figure.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.410
And they say, in the
figure above,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.850
lines k and m are parallel.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.310
I guess I better draw
lines k and m.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.250
That's line k.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.970
That's line m.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.410
And then they have a
transversal line.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.990
And we've gone over all of this
in the geometry playlist.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.600
You might want to review
it if this looks

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.250
completely foreign to you.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.370
And so this is line k.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.400
This is line m.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.250
And they're calling this angle
right here x degrees.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.760
This line here is z degrees.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.540
And then this angle here--
did I say line?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.340
That's an angle.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.030
This angle here is y degrees.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.640
And the question is-- question
number six-- in the figure

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.480
above, if lines k and m are
parallel -- so they're both

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.709
parallel -- what is
the value of x?

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.140
OK.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.100
In statement number one
they tell us that y is

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.480
equal to 120 degrees.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.920
So if y is equal to 120-- let me
do this one in magenta-- so

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.050
this is based on this
is equal to 120.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.610
What can we figure out?

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.290
Well, this y is supplementary
to z, right?

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.910
So when you add these two angles
together, it's 180

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.610
degrees, right?

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.590
Because you're completing
kind of a whole

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.010
1/2 arc, or 1/2 circle.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.300
So z would be 60 degrees.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.770
And then you could say that --
there's all these words that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.090
people use in geometry class.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.110
But if you have two parallel
lines and a transversal, then

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.220
these opposite inside angles
are going to be the same.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.180
So you know that x is
equal to 60 degrees.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.670
Another way you could have done
it, you could have said,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.390
OK, if y is equal to 120
degrees, then y and this angle

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.150
right here are also
supplementary, right?

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.780
Because they complete
this whole arc.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.190
So y plus this angle have
to be equal to 180.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.350
So this angle would
also be 60.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.530
And then you use what you
learn in geometry class.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.230
That corresponding angles on a
transversal intersecting two

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.610
parallel lines, that
they're also equal.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.200
So you'd also get to the
same conclusion.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.660
That x is equal to 60.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.890
So either way, statement number
one alone is enough to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.740
figure out x.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.360
Now, what did they give us
for statement number two?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.730
And I'll do that in
a different color.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.190
Statement number two.
z is equal to 60.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.510
Well, this actually gives us the
same information as that.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.810
Because if we know that z is
equal to 60, then we know that

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.690
y is going to be equal to 120,
even if the book never told us

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.550
this the first time.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.310
So z is equal to 60 is the
same information as

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.750
y is equal to 120.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.850
And so you can make the exact
same argument as you did for

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.350
the first one.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.620
So actually point number two
alone is also enough to figure

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.290
out that x is equal to 60.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.960
You actually didn't even
have to figure it out.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.410
An important skill, eventually,
when you're when

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.060
you're taking the GMAT, is to
be able just look at it and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.290
say, oh, I can figure that
out, and then move on.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.830
Instead of actually having
to figure out that

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.920
x is equal to 60.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.652
But anyway.

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:14.660
soon.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.230
So this one is, either of them
alone are sufficient.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.510
So that's d.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.900
OK.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.150
Problem number seven.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.690
What percentage of a
group of people are

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.430
women with red hair?

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.320
So women with red hair,
percentage.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.570
So statement number one tells
us, of the women in the group,

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.740
5% have red hair.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:50.780
5% of women have red hair.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.870
That alone doesn't tell me what
percentage of the entire

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.300
group are women with red hair,
because I don't know how large

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.980
the whole group is.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.790
There could be 20 women, and
there could be 10 million men.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.450
Or there could be 20
women and no men.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.340
So that still doesn't help me
with what percentage of the

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.050
group are women with red hair.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.360
Statement number two tells us,
of the men in the group, 10%

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.220
have red hair.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.390
So 10% of men have red hair.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.510
That's really useless.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.850
Once again, I don't know
how big the group is.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.660
Think about it.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.500
If I have 20 women, then that
tells me that there's one

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.390
woman with red hair.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.690
And I don't know I have
20 women, right?

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.270
But I still don't know how
many men there are.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.010
If there are 20 women and one
has red hair, there could be a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.950
million men.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.130
There could be no man.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.160
In which case this answer would
turn out very different.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.850
What percentage of the group
are women with red hair?

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.030
So both of these combined are
fairly useless questions.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.250
And actually, let me draw a Venn
diagram, because I think

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.660
it's useful.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.120
So the entire group is
both women and men.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.890
I'll draw a Venn rectangle
instead.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.930
So that's women and men.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.960
So some percentage of-- we
don't know how many women

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.730
there are, and how many men.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.590
So this area is women.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.780
That's the number of women.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.310
And this is the number of men.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.800
And this first point tells
us that 5% of the

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.720
women have red hair.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.400
So it just tells us that 5% of
this area is red, right?

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.300
Which is maybe, I don't
know, I'll eyeball it.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.380
It's like that.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.760
And then this says 10% of
the men have red hair.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.350
So maybe that area looks
something like that.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.370
So we know the ratio of
this to this box.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.530
And we know the ratio of this
to this box is 10%.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.160
But we don't know the ratio of
this to the entire universe,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.360
because we don't know how many--
we don't know what the

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.330
total population sizes,
so we'll never be able

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.320
to figure it out.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.150
Anyway, so that is e.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.620
All right.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.670
Problem number eight.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.470
Maybe I missed something.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.720
Problem eight.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.250
If r and s are positive
integers, you r is what

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.780
percent of s?

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:38.540
So r, s, positive integers.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.420
And we want to know r is
what percent of s?

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.490
So essentially, we just want to
figure out what r over s is

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.210
equal to, right?

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.370
This'll give us some decimal.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.080
And then you multiply by 100,
and you know the percentage.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.800
So if you can figure out this,
you can figure out the

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.350
percentage of r is what
percentage of s.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.960
So statement number one.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.716
They tell us that r
is equal to 3/4s.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.450
Well, let's just do a little
algebraic manipulation.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.240
We're trying to get r over
s, so let's divide

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.390
both sides by s.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.350
So you get r over s is
equal to 3 over 4.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.110
So there we got it.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.220
We got the answer.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.920
That was a helpful data point.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.960
All we needed was that
data point, actually.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.290
Let's see what the second
data point gives us.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.520
Data point two.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.000
r divided by s-- well, they
wrote it like this; they wrote

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.160
it the way you did in second
grade-- r divided by s is

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.220
equal to 75 over 100.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.400
Well, that's just another way
of just writing r over s is

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.720
equal to 75 over 100,
which is exactly the

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.870
same thing as this.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.120
So these are actually equivalent
statements, almost.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.400
So each of them independently
are enough to figure out r

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.760
over s, or what percentage
r is of s.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.300
All right.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.940
Problem number nine.

00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:03.340
I'll draw a line here, I don't
want to get too messy.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.416
Is it true that a is
greater than b?

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:15.460
I sometimes find these
statements slightly humorous.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.250
Is it true that a is
greater than b?

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.720
All right.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.160
The first statement is,
2a is greater than 2b.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.330
So I don't know if you remember
from algebra, but you

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.520
can operate on inequalities
the exact same way you can

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.640
operate on equalities, or I
guess you call them equations.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.100
And you just have to remember
that if you multiply or divide

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.830
by a negative number, that
you have to swap

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.169
the inequality sign.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:47.670
Well, luckily in this case, we
could divide both sides by a

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.400
positive number.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.320
So if you multiplying or
dividing by a positive on both

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.660
sides, you don't have to
change the inequality.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.230
So just divide both
sides by 2.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.120
And you can test that with
numbers, just to see why that

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.680
make sense.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.900
So you divide both sides by 2.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.190
And you get a is
greater than b.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.020
So that's all we needed.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.290
We just needed statement one.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.520
Now let's see what statement
two does for us.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:13.390
Statement two tells us
that a plus c is

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.240
greater than b plus c.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.850
Well, once again, we can
subtract c from both sides of

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.190
this equation, or from both
sides of this inequality,

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.190
without changing the
inequality sign.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.540
So you subtract c
from both sides.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.920
And once again, you get
a is greater than b.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.740
So each of these statements
independently are enough for

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.940
us to figure out that it
is true, that a is

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.740
greater than b.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.040
Let's do one more.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.780
Actually, I've run out of
chalkboard space, so I might

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.160
as well just wait until
the next video.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.410
