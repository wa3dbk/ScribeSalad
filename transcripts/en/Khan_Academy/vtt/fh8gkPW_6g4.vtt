00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:08.500
Round 423,275 to the
nearest thousand.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.360
So let me rewrite it: 423,275.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.080
And so the thousands place is
the 3 right here, and so if we

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.920
were round it up to the nearest
thousand, we would go

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.990
to 420-- let me write it so we
just focus on the 3-- we would

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:39.160
go up to 424,000 if we wanted
to round up, 424,000, and if

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.950
we wanted to round down,
we would go to 423,000.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.990
We would get rid of the 275.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.010
423,000.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.510
So this is our choice.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.140
Round up to 424,000 or round
down to 423,000.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.560
And to figure it out, we just
look at the digit one place to

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.070
the right of the 3, so we look
at the 2 right there.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.350
If that digit is 5 or greater,
you round up.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.100
So this is 5.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.220
So if this is greater than
or equal to 5, 5 or

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.880
greater, you round up.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.550
If it's less than 5,
you round down.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.460
2 is definitely less than 5, so
we just round down, so it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.600
is 423,000.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.260
Now just to visualize what
this means to the nearest

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.380
thousand, if I were to do a
number line-- and you don't

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.930
have to do this.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.470
We've gotten the answer, but
just to have a little bit

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.390
better visualization of it,
if I were to increment by

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:52.360
thousands, you might have
422,000, 423,000.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.940
You have 424,000, and then
maybe over here, you have

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.690
425,000, and you could
keep going.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.820
Now 423,275 is going to be
someplace right around here.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.730
And so when we round to the
nearest thousand, we have to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.120
pick between that and that.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.480
We see that it much closer to
423,000 than to 424,000, so we

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.500
round it right there.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.220
But you just use the rules we
just came up with, and we

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.220
rounded down to 423,000.
