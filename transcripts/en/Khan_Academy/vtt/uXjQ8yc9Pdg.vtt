00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.340
The last video was very
abstract in general, and

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.980
I used you know, f of x
and g of t, and h of t.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.720
What I want to do in this video
is do an actual example.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.730
Let's say I have f of xy.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.325
Let's say that f of
xy is equal to xy.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:20.595
And let's say that we have
a path in the xy plane, or

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:21.775
a curve in the xy plane.

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:29.480
And I'm going to define my
curve by x being equal to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.430
cosine of t, and y being
equal to sine of t.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.090
And we're going to go from--
you know, we have to define

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.740
what are our boundaries in our
t --and we're going to go from

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.800
t is equal to 0-- or t is going
to be greater than or equal to

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.930
0 --and then less
than or equal to.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.340
We're going to deal in
radians, pi over 2.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.370
If this was degrees, that
would be 90 degrees.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.440
So that's our curve.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.860
And immediately you might
already know what this type

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.770
of a curve looks like.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.900
And I'm going to draw that
really fast right here in and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.110
we'll try to visualize this.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.120
I've actually drafted
ahead of time so that

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.590
we can visualize this.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.530
So this curve right here, if I
were to just draw it in the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.530
standard xy plane-- do that in
a different color so we can

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.430
make the curve green; let's say
that is y, and this is right

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.400
here x --so when t is equal
to 0, x is going to be

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.310
equal to cosine of 0.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.620
Cosine of 0 is 1, y is going to
be equal to sine of 0, which

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.500
is 0, so t is equal to 0.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.650
We're going to be at x equal to
1, that's cosine of 0, and y is

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.706
sine of 0, or y is going to
be 0, so we're going

00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:40.500
to be right there.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.380
That's what t is equal
to; t is equal to 0.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.990
When t is equal to pi of 2,
what's going to happen?

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.000
Cosine of pie over 2--
that's the angle; cosine

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.270
of pi over 2 --is 0.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.010
Sine of pi over 2 is 1.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.270
We're going to be
at the point 0, 1.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.410
So this is when we're at
t is equal to pi over 2.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.340
You might recognize what we're
going to draw is actually the

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.080
first quadrant of the unit
circle; when t is equal to pi

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.530
over 4, or 45 degrees, we're
going to be at square root

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.240
of 2, square root of 2.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.860
You can try it out for
yourself, but we're just

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.360
going to have a curve
that looks like this.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.050
It's going to be the
top right of a circle,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.915
of the units circle.

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:20.280
It's going to have radius 1.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.670
And we're going to go in that
direction, from t is equal to

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.830
0, to t is equal to pi over 2.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.300
That's what this
curve looks like.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.240
But our goal isn't here just to
graph a parametric equation.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.680
What we want to do is raise a
fence out of this kind of base

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.685
and rise it to this surface.

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:41.570
So let's see if we can do that
or at least visualize it first,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.740
and then we'll use the tools
we used in the last video.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.210
So right here I've graphed this
function, and I've rotated it a

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.230
little bit so you can
see [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.010
case.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.080
This right here-- let me get
some dark colors out --that

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.680
right there is the x axis, that
in the back is the y axis, and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.560
the vertical axis
is the z axis.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.330
And this is actually 2, this
is 1 right here, y equal 1

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.310
is right there, so this
is graphed that way.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.030
So if I were to graphs this
contour in the xy plane, it

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.900
would be under this graph and
it would go like something like

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.110
this--- let me see if I can
draw it --it would look

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.730
something like this.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.800
This would be on the xy plane.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.300
This is the same exact graph,
f of x is equal to xy.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.080
This is f of x; f of
xy is equal to xy.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.480
That's both of these,
I just rotated it.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.170
In this situation that right
there is now the x axis.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.380
I rotated to the left,
you can kind of imagine.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.080
That right there is the x axis,
that right there is the y

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.710
axis-- it was rotated closer
to me --that's the z axis.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.630
And then this curve, if I were
to draw in this rotation, is

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.260
going to look like this: when t
is equal to 0, we're at x is

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.420
equal to 1, y is equal to 0,
and it's going to form a unit

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.000
circle, or half or quarter
of a unit circle like that.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.745
And when t is equal to pi over
2, we're going to get there.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:08.590
And what we want to do
is find the area of the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.680
curtain that's defined.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.030
So let's see, let's raise
a curtain from this

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.730
curve up to f of xy.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.930
So if we keep raising walls
from this up to xy, we're

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.929
going to have a wall looks
something like that.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.590
Let me shade it in, color
it in so it looks a little

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.660
bit more substantive.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.530
So a wall that looks
something like that.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.850
If I were to try to do it here
this would be under the

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.560
ceiling, but the wall
look something like

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.680
that right there.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.440
We want to find
the area of that.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.400
We want to find the area of
this right here where the base

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.160
is defined by this curves, and
then the ceiling is defined by

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.550
this surface here, xy, which I
graphed and I rotated

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.270
in two situations.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.940
Now in the last video we came
up with a, well, you could

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.230
argue whether it's simple, but
the is, well, let's just take

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.000
small arc lengths-- change in
arc lengths, and multiply them

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.300
by the height at that point.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.910
And those small change in arc
lengths, we called them ds,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.050
and then the height is just
f of xy at that point.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.600
And we'll take an infinite sum
of these, from t is equal to 0

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.660
to t will equal pi over 2, and
then that should give us

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.640
the area of this wall.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.510
So we said is, well, to figure
out the area of that we're just

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.670
going to take the integral from
t is equal to o to t is equal

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.750
to pi over 2-- it doesn't make
a lot of sense when I write it

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.935
like this --of f of xy times--
or let me even better, instead

00:05:38.935 --> 00:05:41.300
of writing f of xy, let me just
write the actual function.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.110
Let's get a little
bit more concrete.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.710
So f of xy is xy times-- so the
particular xy --times the

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.520
little change in our arc
length at that point.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.030
I'm going to be very
hand-wavy here.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.290
This is all a little bit
review of the last video.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.890
And we figured out in the last
video this change in arc length

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.990
right here, ds, we figured out
that we could rewrite that as

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.250
the square root of the dx
versus-- or the derivative of x

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.480
with respect to t squared
--plus the derivative of y with

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.090
respect to t squared, and
then all of that times dt.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.790
So I'm just rebuilding
the formula that we

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.590
got in the last video.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.090
So this expression can be
rewritten as the integral

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:33.640
from t is equal to 0 to t is
equal to pi over 2 times xy.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.160
But you know what?

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.170
Right from the get go we
want everything eventually

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.070
be in terms of t.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.070
So instead of writing x
times y, let's substitute

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.170
the parametric form.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.720
So instead of x let's
write cosine of t.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.370
That is x.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.980
x is equal to cosine
of t on this curve.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.700
That's how we define x, in
terms of the parameter t.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.250
And then times y, which
we're saying is sine of t.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.360
That's our y; all I
did is rewrote xy in

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.310
terms of t times ds.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:16.170
ds is this; it's the square
root of the derivative of x

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.690
with respect to t squared plus
the derivative of y with

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.950
respect to t squared.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.630
All of that times dt.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.380
And now we just have to find
these two derivatives.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.670
And it might seem really hard,
but it's very easy for us to

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.180
find the derivative of x with
respect to t and the derivative

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.360
of y with respect to t.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.860
I can do it right or down here.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.320
Let me lose our graphs
for a little bit.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.600
We know that the derivative of
x with respect to t is just

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.620
going to be: what's the
derivative of cosine of t?

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.790
Well, it's minus sine of t.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.000
And the derivative of
y was respect to t?

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.670
Derivative of a sine of
anything is the cosine

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.125
of that anything.

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:59.450
So it's cosine of t.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.330
And we can substitute these
back into this equation.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.250
So remember, we're just trying
to find the area of this

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.020
curtain that has our curve here
as kind of its base, and

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.700
has this function, this
surface as it's ceiling.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.460
So we go back down here,
and let me rewrite

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.240
this whole thing.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.090
So this becomes the integral
from t is equal to o to t is

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.700
equal to pi over 2-- I don't
like this color --of cosine of

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:32.290
t, sine of t, cosine times
sine-- that's just the xy

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.900
--times ds, which is this
expression right here.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.110
And now we can write this as--
I'll go switch back to that

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.870
color I don't like --the
derivative of x with respect to

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:50.170
t is minus sine of t, and we're
going to square it, plus the

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.750
derivative of y with respect to
t, that's cosine of t, and

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.670
we're going to square it-- let
me make my radical a little bit

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.330
bigger --and then all
of that times dt.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.820
Now this still might seem like
a really hard integral until

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.510
you realize that this right
here, and when you take a

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.420
negative number and you squared
it, this is the same thing.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.300
Let me rewrite, do this
in the side right here.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:23.260
Minus sine of t squared plus
the cosine of t squared, this

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:31.310
is equivalent to sine of t
squared plus cosine

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.820
of t squared.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.090
You lose the sign information
when you square something;

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.430
it just becomes a positive.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.850
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.640
And this is the most
basic trig identity.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.690
This comes straight out of the
unit circle definition: sine

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.600
squared plus cosine squared,
this is just equal to 1.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.020
So all this stuff under
the radical sign is

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.710
just equal to 1.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.130
And we're taking the square
root of 1 which is just 1.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:59.120
So all of this stuff right
here will just become 1.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.890
And so this whole crazy
integral simplifies a good bit

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:08.240
and just equals the square root
of t equals 0 to t is equal to

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.540
pi over 2 of-- and I'm going to
switch these around just

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.440
because it will make it a
little easier in the next step

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:23.440
--of sine of t times
cosine of t, dt.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.060
All I did, this whole thing
equals 1, got rid of it,

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.340
and I just switched
the order of that.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.050
It'll make the next up a
little bit easier to explain.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.920
Now this integral-- You say
sine times cosine, what's

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.350
the antiderivative of that?

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.080
And the first thing you should
recognize is, hey, I have a

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.790
function or an expression here,
and I have its derivative.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.040
The derivative of
sine is cosine of t.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.460
So you might be able to a u
substitution in your head;

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.020
it's a good skill to be
able to do in your head.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.620
But I'll do it very
explicitly here.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.040
So if you have something
that's derivative, you

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.890
define that something as u.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:11:00.160
So you say u is equal to sine
of t and then du, dt, the

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.650
derivative of u with respect
to t is equal to cosine of t.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.190
Or if you multiply both sides
by the differential dt, if

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.960
we're not going to be too
rigorous, you get du is

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.140
equal to cosine of t, dt.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.720
And notice right
here I have a u.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.860
And then cosine of t, dt,
this thing right here, that

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.470
thing is equal to d of u.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.030
And then we just have to
redefine the boundaries.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.350
When t is equal to 0-- I mean
so this thing is going to turn

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.760
into the integral --instead of
t is equal to 0, when t is

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.550
equal to 0 what is u equal to?

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.280
Sine of 0 is 0, so this
goes from u is equal to 0.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.850
When t is pie over 2
sine of pi over 2 is 1.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.260
So when t is pi over
2, u is equal to 1.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.940
So from is equal to 0
to u is equal to 1.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.000
Just redid the boundaries
in terms of u.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.280
And then we have instead
of sign of t, I'm

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.930
going to write u.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.810
And instead of cosine of t, dt,
I'm just going to write du.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.060
And then this is a super-easy
integral in terms of u.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:09.320
This is just equal to: the
antiderivative of u is u 1/2

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.820
times u squared-- we just
raised the exponent and then

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.970
divided by that raised exponent
--so 1/2 u squared, and we're

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.640
going to evaluate
it from 0 to 1.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:25.570
And so this is going to be
equal to 1/2 times 1 squared

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:32.140
minus 1/2 times 0 squared,
which is equal to 1/2 times 1

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.820
minus 0, which is equal to 1/2.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.750
So we did all that work and
we got a nice simple answer.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.630
The area of this a curtain-- we
just performed a line integral

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:48.430
--the area of this curtain
along this curve right here

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:53.380
is-- let me do it in a
darker color --on 1/2.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.080
You know, if this was in
centimeters, it would be

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.540
1/2 centimeters squared.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.710
So I think that was you know,
a pretty neat application

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.460
of the line integral.
