00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.910
Sarah has $48.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.050
She wants to save 1/3 of
her money for a trip.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.990
How many dollars should
she set aside?

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
So we essentially want to think
about what 1/3 of 48 is.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.170
Use 48 as the denominator
and find an

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.480
equivalent fraction to 1/3.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.070
So what they want us to do in
this problem is they want us

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.500
to say, OK, we want 1/3 of her
money, but we want to write

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.530
this as an equivalent fraction
where we have 48 in the

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.100
denominator.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.590
So this is equal to something,
some blank up here.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.425
This is equal to something
over 48.

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:44.120
So how can we get it to that
something over 48?

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.160
So let's think about what
this means for a second.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.430
So 1/3, if we were to draw
1/3, it looks like this.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.980
You could imagine a box
or a pie, I guess.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.690
So let's say that this is my
pie, and I have it split into

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.840
three pieces.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.860
So let me split it into
three even pieces.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.020
And 1/3 is one of those
three pieces.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.550
That is what 1/3 means.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.140
Now, if we want express this as
a fraction over 48, how can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.740
we do that?

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.220
Well, we're going to
have to split this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.280
thing into 48 pieces.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.350
How can we split something
into 48?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.540
Well, 3 times 16 is 48, so if we
split each of these into 16

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.810
pieces-- and it's going
to be hard to draw

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.300
here, but you can imagine.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.130
Let's see, you split it into
two, now we've split it into

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.620
four, now you split
it into eight.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.280
You're just going to end up with
a bunch of lines here,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.360
but you can imagine, you can
just split each of these.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.120
If you split each of these into
enough, you would have 16

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.140
pieces, so those would
be 16 right there.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.050
You would have 16 right there
and you have 16 right there.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.740
And I can just keep doing it.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.280
Let me do it in the
green over here.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.780
So if we just kept splitting
it up, we would get 48,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.050
because you have this first
third would be 16 pieces, the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.700
second third would be 16,
and then this third

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.820
third would be 16 pieces.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.470
Altogether, you would
have 48 pieces.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.110
Now, that 1/3, what does
that represent?

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.230
Well, that represents
16 of the 48.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.450
It represents these
16 right here.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.370
It represents these 16 right
there, so 1 over 3 is the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.090
exact same thing.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:41.120
So 1 over 3 is the exact same
thing as 16 over 48.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.420
Now, we did it just by thinking
about it kind of

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.890
intuitively what 1/3 of 48 is,
but one way to do it more-- I

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.600
guess a process for doing it--
we would say, well, look, to

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.840
get the denominator, the bottom
number, from 3 to 48,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.020
we multiply by 16.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.790
3 times 16 is 48.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.760
And that's literally the process
of going from 3 pieces

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.960
to 48 pieces.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.460
We have to multiply by 16.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.500
We have to turn each of our
pieces into 16 pieces.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.990
That's what we did.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.030
Now, you can't just multiply
only the denominator by 16.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.650
You have to multiply the
numerator by the same number.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.750
And so if each of my pieces
now become 16 pieces, then

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.730
that one piece will
now become 16.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.370
So one way to think about it,
you just say, well, 3 times 16

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.920
is 48, so 1 times 16 will be my
numerator, so it'll be 16.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.180
So 1/3 is equal to 16/48.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.040
And another way you could think
about it, which you'll

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.930
learn in more detail later on,
is we want 1/3 of 48, right?

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.060
That's how much she wants to
save. 1/3 of 48 is equal to

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.950
1/3 times 48.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.130
And when you multiply-- let me
write it like this-- 1/3 times

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.370
48, and you could rewrite
48 as a fraction 48/1.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.510
It literally represents
48 wholes.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.380
And when you multiply fractions,
you can just

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.470
multiply the numerators.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.370
So this is equal to 48 over--
and then you just multiply the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.300
denominators.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.970
48/3, 1 times 48 is 48.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.560
We'll see this in more
detail in the future.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.480
Don't worry about it
if it confuses you.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.350
In the denominator, 3 times 1 is
3, and 48 divided by 3, or

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.320
48/3, is equal to 16.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.960
So 1/3 of 48 is 16,
or 16/48 is 1/3.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.310
Hopefully, that make
sense to you.
