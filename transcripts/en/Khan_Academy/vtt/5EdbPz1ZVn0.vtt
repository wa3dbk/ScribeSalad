00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
In this video, I want to do a
couple more word problems

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.060
dealing with graphs of lines.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.010
So here we have a
gym is offering

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.900
a deal to new members.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.040
Customers can sign up by paying
a registration fee of

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:22.690
$200 and then a monthly
fee of $39.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.940
This is registration.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.120
How much will this membership
cost a member by

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.890
the end of the year?

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.710
So let's figure out an equation
that determines how

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.470
much total we will pay.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.680
p is equal to the amount that
we're going to pay in total

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.230
for our membership.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.300
So no matter how many months we
use the gym, just to start

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.020
using the gym, we have to pay
$200 in registration.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.100
I'll just write-- everything
we'll assume is in dollars

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.830
--so I'll write $200.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.800
And then we're going to have
to pay $39 for every month

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.400
we're there.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.200
So then we're going to take
the number of months we're

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.430
there and multiply
that times 39.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.130
Notice if we stay there 1 month,
we'll have to pay 1

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.550
month times $39.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.230
And we would have already paid
the $200 registration fee.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.310
So it'll be $239.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.440
If we stay 2 months, we pay the
$200 registration fee and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.110
then we pay 39 times 2 months,
which is what?

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.180
Like 78 or something.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.600
So it would be $278.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.630
So just to tie this altogether
with linear equations and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.430
graphs of them, let's
graph this relation.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.840
Remember the graph of
a line can be y is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.700
equal to mx plus b.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.500
That's one of the forms. So to
put this line in this form or

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.490
this equation in this form, we
can just rearrange the 39m and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:55.210
the 200 and you get p is
equal to 39m plus 200.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.300
So what's the slope and what's
the y-intercept?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.360
You might get confused and say,
hey there's an x there

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.670
and a y, but now you're doing
it with p's and m's.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.699
Just remember this is the
independent variable and this

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:10.780
is the dependent variable.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.200
Here this is the independent
variable.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.170
How many months?

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.210
You pick a number of months
and I'll tell you what the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.490
total cost of your membership
is going to be.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.250
It's the same thing.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.280
This is like the
x right there.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.790
This is like the y
just like that.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.570
Just using our pattern match,
this right here is the-- we

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.810
could say it's the vertical
intercept or the p-intercept

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.030
or the-- I'm tempted to call
it the y-intercept.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.970
But we're really intersecting
the p-axis instead of the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.430
y-axis there.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.210
This right here is our slope.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.770
So let's graph this function.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.710
I won't do it too accurately.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.550
I just want to do a hand
drawn graph just

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.820
to give you an idea.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.450
We could just stay in
the first quadrant.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.860
We're not going to stay negative
months and the gym is

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.840
never going to pay us money.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.852
So right off the bat,
we're going to have

00:02:58.852 --> 00:03:05.610
to pay the gym $200.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.040
$200 for 0 months.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.380
Then for every month, we're
going to have to

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.450
spend an extra $39.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.380
So the slope is 39.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.800
Let's say this is 1
month right there.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.050
This is in months.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.380
And this axis is price,
the p-axis.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.040
So this is like the
p-intercept or the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.190
y-intercept.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.940
So after 1 month, how much are
we going to have to pay?

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.000
Well our slope is 39, so if we
move 1 month forward, we're

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.730
going to go up by 39.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.630
So this will, right here,
that will be 239.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.880
If we go another month,
it'll be 278.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.880
This is kind of a weird labeling
of an axis, but I

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.190
think you get the idea.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.800
So the graph of how much it'll
cost us as per month will look

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.630
something like this.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.510
So they say, how much will
a membership cost by

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.340
the end of the year?

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.060
12 months.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.840
We would have to go 2, 3, all
the way out to 12 months,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.750
which might be here.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.565
So then our graph is going
to be out here someplace.

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:07.650
But we could just figure
it out algebraically.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.830
At the end of the year,
m will be equal to 12.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.090
When m is equal to 12, how
much is our membership?

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.870
The price of our membership
is going to be our $200

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.829
membership fee plus 39
times the number of

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.110
months, times 12.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.760
What's 39 times 12?

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.500
2 times 9 is 18.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.930
2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 70.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.680
I have a 0.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.630
1 times 9 is 9.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.680
1 times 3-- we want
to ignore this.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.910
1 times 3 is 3.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.340
So we have 8.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.720
7 plus 9 is 16.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.370
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.230
So the price of our membership
is $200 plus 39 times 12,

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.120
which is $468.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.240
So it's equal to $668 at
the end of our year.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.200
So if you went all the way out
to 12, you would have to plot

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.360
668 someplace here on
our line, if we just

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.290
kept going out there.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.310
Let's do one more of these.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.070
Bobby and Petra are running a
lemonade stand and they charge

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.430
$0.45 for each glass
of lemonade.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.650
In order to break even,
they must make $25.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.410
How many glasses of lemonade
must they sell to break even?

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.980
So let me just do
it with y and x.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.875
y is equal to the amount
they make.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.460
Not max-- the amount
they make.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.850
Let x is equal to the number
of glasses they sell.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.180
What is y as a function of x?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.040
So y is equal to-- well for
every glass they sell, they

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.090
get $0.45 --so it's equal
to $0.45 times

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.800
the number of glasses.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.760
There's not any kind of minimum
fee that they need to

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.440
charge or they don't say any
kind of minimum cost that they

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.430
have to spend to
run this place.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.480
How much in order to
break even for

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.170
each a glass of lemonade?

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.020
They need to make $25.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.300
So in order to break even,
they must make $25.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.570
So how many glasses of lemonade
do they need to sell?

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.360
y needs to be equal to $25.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.530
How many glasses do
they need to sell?

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.230
Well you just set
this equation.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:55.310
You say 0.45x has to
be equal to 25.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:03.860
We can divide both
sides by 0.45.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.440
On the left-hand side, you're
just left with an x.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:14.875
You get x is equal to-- What
is 25 divided by 0.45?

00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:21.050
It is equal to-- They would
have to sell exactly 55.55

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.150
glasses or 56 if I round.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.310
55.5 repeating glasses.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.520
But you can't sell half a glass
or we're assuming you

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.340
can't sell half a glass.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.372
So the answer to that, they
must sell 56 glasses.

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.960
Because you can't sell half
a glass, I'm assuming.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.250
So they need to sell 56
glasses to break even.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.530
Just to graph this.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.930
Once again, we'll hang out in
the first quadrant because

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.620
everything is going
to be positive.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.750
Every glass they make $0.45.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.570
Let's say that they sell--
So this is the

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.390
number of glasses, x.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.010
This is how much they make.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:04.500
Let me go by increments of 5.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.730
5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.810
Actually I need to go by even
larger increments to get to

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.530
the point that we're
talking about.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.520
Let me go increments of 10.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:21.270
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.320
So that's the number
of glasses.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.700
When they sell 0 glasses,
they make $0.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.940
That's their y-intercept.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.740
y is equal to 0.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.260
When they sell 10 glasses,
they make $4.50.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.610
So this is 4.50.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.640
This is 9.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.230
Actually let me just
do it like this.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:50.500
Let me just mark only
the multiples of 9.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:59.610
Let's say 9, 18, 27, 35.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.700
When they sell 10 glasses,
they're going to make $4.50.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.170
10 times 0.45.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.540
That's right there.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.240
20 glasses, they're going
to make $9.00.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.670
We can keep going there.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.940
40 glasses, they're
going to make $18.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.810
You see their slope.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.220
When you move 10, you're going
to have to go up 4.50.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.860
This graph is going to look
something like that.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.520
Should be a straight line.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.430
Then if you want to see their
break even, their break even

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.125
has to be $25, which is
right about here.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.130
Their break even is $25
right around there.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.600
Let me draw the line a little
bit better than that.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.020
The line is going to
look like this.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:52.240
If the break even is $25-- it
would be right there --you see

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.720
that they have to sell
about 56 glasses.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.930
Obviously the way I drew this
isn't the super neatly drawn

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.010
graph, but hopefully it gives
you the general idea.
