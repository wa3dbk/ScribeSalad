00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.450
Welcome back.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.590
We're now in the final
test, test eight.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.660
And we'll start in Section
2, problem one.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.790
The total cost of three equally
priced mechanical

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.770
pencils is $4.50.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.210
If the cost per pencil is
increased by $0.50, how much

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.260
will five of these
pencils cost?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.600
So three pencils, three times
the cost of the pencil is

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.290
equal to $4.50.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.150
So pencil is equal to
$4.50 divided by 3.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.810
Just divide both sides
of that equation by 3

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.710
and that equals $1.50.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.340
Then they say the cost per
pencil is increased by $0.50.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.050
So we're going to go from $1.50
plus $0.50, so that'll

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.880
get us to $2,00 per pencil.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.990
How much will five of these
pencils cost at the new rate?

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.636
So it's $2.00 per pencil, times
5, and that's $10.00.

00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:01.980
And that's choice E.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.230
Problem two.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140
OK, the table above represents
a relationship

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.510
between x and y.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.555
So x can be-- x and y,
so it's 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.870
And then y, when x is
1, is 3, 7, 11, 15.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.510
Which of the following linear
equations describes the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.725
relationship?

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:36.530
So let's see if we can think of
something here on our own.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.510
Let's see, this looks like--
well, I don't know how you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.410
would get to 4 times-- let's see
the choices, actually, see

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.230
which ones work.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.660
So A is y is equal
to x plus 1.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.160
Try this out, x plus 1.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.640
1 plus 1 is 2, so that's
not right.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.180
They've got 3 here.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.670
So that fails.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.900
B, y is equal to x plus 4.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.020
When x is 1-- if it was x plus
4, then this would be 5.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.750
But this is 3, so that's
not right.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.120
Choice C, y is equal to 3x.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.410
That works here, right? x
is 1, y is 3 times 1.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.250
But it fails here, because
when x is 2, then

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.190
this should be 6.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.340
But it's 7, so this
isn't right.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.040
These are all wrong.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.440
Choice D, y is equal to 4x.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.710
Well, that fails on
this first one.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.320
When x is 1, if it was
4x, this would be 4.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.110
But it's not, so that fails.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.630
Choice E is probably going
to be our answer.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.720
Let's try.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.620
y is equal to 4x minus 1.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.360
So when x is 1, 4 times
1 is 4 minus 1 is 3.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.950
4 times 2 is 8 minus 1 is 7.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.920
4 times 3 is 12,
minus 1 is 11.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.395
4 times 4 is 16,
minus 1 is 15.

00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:00.370
So it works.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.830
Next problem, soon. problem 3.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.250
OK, they drew two circles.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.710
They look tangent
to each other.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.420
One circle looks like that.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.790
Let me see if my skills of
drawing tangent circles, how

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.350
good they are.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.606
You got one circle, and
not bad, not bad if I

00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:23.180
have to say so myself.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.140
And then they draw a line that
looks like from the center of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.140
one circle to the other.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.520
I'll do it in a different
color.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:38.020
So we are going from here
roughly to there.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.020
I know it doesn't look like
center to center, but I think

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.820
you get the idea.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.080
They're saying this
point here is A.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.300
This point right here is B.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.040
And then this point
right here is C.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.380
In the figure above, the two
circles are tangent at the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.125
point B, and AC is equal to 6,
so this whole distance is

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:58.920
equal to 6, and they're tangent
right here, so these

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.130
circles just touch point B.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.210
If the circumference of circle
with center A is twice the

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.250
circumference of the circle
with center C, what is the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.700
length of BC?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.260
So we want to know what BC is.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.200
So this circumference is twice
the length of this

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.529
circumference.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.260
So what's the formula
for circumference?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.650
Circumference is equal
to 2 pi r, right?

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.660
So let's say that this is r.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.030
Let's call this distance r.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.580
What do we know about
this distance?

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.320
Let's call that x,
I guess, right?

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.180
So if this distance is r, the
radius of the large circle is

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.220
r, its circumference is going
to be 2 pi r, right?

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.640
So what's the circumference
of the smaller circle?

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.940
Well, it's 1/2 of that.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.450
So c/2 is equal to 1/2 of the
big circle circumference is

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.765
equal to the circumference of
the smaller circle, which is 2

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:02.320
pi x, right?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.375
Because the radius is x.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:05.650
But what's c/2?

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.760
That's this divided by 2.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.050
So c/2 is the same thing
as this divided

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.020
by 2, which is what?

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.480
The 2 would just disappear,
so it equals pi r.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.080
You could take both pi's away,
and you get 2x is equal to r,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.350
or x is equal to r/2.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.100
And you really didn't
have to do that.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.920
You could just know that
circumference is directly

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.540
proportional to radius, unlike
area, which is proportional to

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.490
the square.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.750
So circumference is directly
proportional to radius.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.900
So if this circle has twice
the circumference as this

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.860
circle, its radius is also going
to be twice the radius

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.230
of this circle.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.350
But that's interesting now.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.660
So now we know that if this is
x, this distance here is x, BC

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.460
is x, this distance here is
going to be 2x, right?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.440
It's going to be 2 times
the small radius.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.580
And we know that when you add
all of them together, 2x plus

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.200
x, you get the whole length from
AC, A to C, and you so

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.590
that equals y.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.990
So you get 3x is equal
to 6 and then you get

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.460
x is equal to 2.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.830
And that's our answer,
because we wanted to

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.190
know just what x is.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.610
And so the really fast way of
doing this is, if you said,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.040
well, this is going to be
twice-- let's define x as this

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.480
small radius.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.140
And if this circle has twice the
circumference, it's going

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.000
to have twice the radius.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.490
So this would be 2x.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.530
And then you could just go
straight to this step without

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.620
having to do all of this.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:34.200
Next problem, problem 4.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.835
OK, they drew a bunch
of points.

00:06:35.835 --> 00:06:38.730
Let's see, a lot of
drawing for me.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.600
I'm a little tired.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.570
My goal is to finish these
problems this weekend, and

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.740
it's midnight and
past my bedtime.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.010
But I'm hanging in there and
trying to finish all of these.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.175
OK, so let's see, they have
point C, which is up here.

00:06:55.175 --> 00:06:57.120
And I don't know if I have
to be accurate with the

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.110
coordinates yet.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.610
Point B is roughly here.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.090
Point A is here.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.542
So then you have point E that's
right around here.

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:16.950
And then you have point D,
which is right there.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.310
What are they going to ask us?

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.550
Which of the letter points
in the figure above has

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:26.480
coordinates x, y, such that the
absolute value of x minus

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.600
the absolute value of
y is equal to 3?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.570
So we could just try out the
points, but they're really

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.250
just saying that no matter what
the x and y-- they say it

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.410
doesn't matter what
quadrant it is.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.850
We want the difference between
the x and the y to be 3.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.210
So the intuition here is that
the x is going to be larger

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.460
than the y, right?

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.800
Or the distance that x is away
from the origin is going to be

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.030
larger by 3 than the distance
that y is away from the

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.720
origin, right?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.840
Because the absolute value of x,
you kind of view it as the

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.800
distance x is from the origin,
and absolute value of y is the

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.790
distance y is from the origin.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.980
So which ones have a larger
distance x from the origin

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.910
than a y from the origin?

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.200
Well, it looks like D, right?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.920
D looks further in
this direction.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.360
Let me switch colors.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.110
D is further in this direction
than it is in this direction.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.370
And if we look at the other
choices, B also is like that.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.660
And so let's look at
the coordinates.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.970
Those are my prime
coordinates.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.920
If I actually look at the
graph, B looks like

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.700
it's 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.419
So this looks like minus
4 and minus 1.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.282
So B looks like minus
4, minus 1.

00:08:38.282 --> 00:08:40.049
And actually, that looks
like our answer, right?

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.049
Because what's the absolute
value of 4?

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:45.720
That's the absolute value of
minus 4 minus the absolute

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.440
value of minus 1.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.040
That equals 4 minus
1, which equals 3.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.170
So that is choice B.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.020
We didn't have to try D.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.870
Next problem.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.370
Actually, I'm coming
up on nine minutes.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.450
So I'll do the next problem
in the next video.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.870
I'll see
