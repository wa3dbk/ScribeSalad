00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.440
I think we're all reasonably
familiar with the three states

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.400
of matter in our
everyday world.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.680
At very high temperatures
you get a fourth.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.990
But the three ones that we
normally deal with are, things

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:22.920
could be a solid, a liquid,
or it could be a gas.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.960
And we have this general notion,
and I think water is

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.050
the example that always comes
to at least my mind.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.740
Is that solid happens
when things are

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.720
colder, relatively colder.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.540
And then as you warm up, you
go into a liquid state.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.390
And as your warm up even more
you go into a gaseous state.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.480
So you go from colder
to hotter.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.360
And in the case of water, when
you're a solid, you're ice.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.490
When you're a liquid, some
people would call ice water,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.490
but let's call it
liquid water.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.370
I think we know what that is.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.910
And then when it's in the gas
state, you're essentially

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.160
vapor or steam.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.810
So let's think a little bit
about what, at least in the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.500
case of water, and the analogy
will extend to

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.040
other types of molecules.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.180
But what is it about water that
makes it solid, and when

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.600
it's colder, what allows
it to be liquid.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.570
And I'll be frank, liquids are
kind of fascinating because

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.940
you can never nail them
down, I guess is the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.890
best way to view them.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.400
Or a gas.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.670
So let's just draw
a water molecule.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.750
So you have oxygen there.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.020
You have some bonds
to hydrogen.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.370
And then you have two extra
pairs of valence electrons in

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.320
the oxygen.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.290
And a couple of videos ago, we
said oxygen is a lot more

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.060
electronegative than
the hydrogen.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.330
It likes to hog the electrons.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.430
So even though this shows
that they're sharing

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.300
electrons here and here.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.840
At both sides of those lines,
you can kind of view that

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.720
hydrogen is contributing an
electron and oxygen is

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.020
contributing an electron on
both sides of that line.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.650
But we know because of the
electronegativity, or the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.700
relative electronegativity of
oxygen, that it's hogging

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.750
these electrons.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.310
And so the electrons spend a
lot more time around the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.610
oxygen than they do around
the hydrogen.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.880
And what that results is that
on the oxygen side of the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.190
molecule, you end up with a
partial negative charge.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.540
And we talked about
that a little bit.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.880
And on the hydrogen side of the
molecules, you end up with

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.475
a slightly positive charge.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.460
Now, if these molecules have
very little kinetic energy,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.860
they're not moving around a
whole lot, then the positive

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.910
sides of the hydrogens are very
attracted to the negative

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.430
sides of oxygen in
other molecules.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.970
Let me draw some
more molecules.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.980
When we talk about the whole
state of the whole matter, we

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.080
actually think about how the
molecules are interacting with

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.480
each other.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.120
Not just how the atoms are
interacting with each other

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.050
within a molecule.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.490
I just drew one oxygen, let
me copy and paste that.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.390
But I could do multiple
oxygens.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.820
And let's say that that hydrogen
is going to want to

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.310
be near this oxygen.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.410
Because this has partial
negative charge, this has a

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.670
partial positive charge.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.190
And then I could do another
one right there.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.930
And then maybe we'll have, and
just to make the point clear,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.110
you have two hydrogens
here, maybe an oxygen

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.500
wants to hang out there.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.410
So maybe you have an oxygen that
wants to be here because

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.710
it's got its partial
negative here.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.970
And it's connected to two
hydrogens right there that

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.590
have their partial positives.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.990
But you can kind of see
a lattice structure.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.510
Let me draw these bonds, these
polar bonds that start forming

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.420
between the particles.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.620
These bonds, they're called
polar bonds because the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.000
molecules themselves
are polar.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.459
And you can see it forms
this lattice structure.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.649
And if each of these molecules
don't have a

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.010
lot of kinetic energy.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.590
Or we could say the average
kinetic energy of this matter

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.500
is fairly low.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.040
And what do we know is average
kinetic energy?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.520
Well, that's temperature.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.840
Then this lattice structure
will be solid.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.800
These molecules will not move
relative to each other.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.070
I could draw a gazillion more,
but I think you get the point

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.480
that we're forming this kind
of fixed structure.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.100
And while we're in the solid
state, as we add kinetic

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.040
energy, as we add heat, what
it does to molecules is, it

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.860
just makes them vibrate
around a little bit.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.967
If I was a cartoonist, they way
you'd draw a vibration is

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:01.320
to put quotation marks there.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.190
That's not very scientific.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.700
But they would vibrate around,
they would buzz around a

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.300
little bit.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.580
I'm drawing arrows to show
that they are vibrating.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.300
It doesn't have to be just

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.810
left-right it could be up-down.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.170
But as you add more and more
heat in a solid, these

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.650
molecules are going to
keep their structure.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.640
So they're not going to move
around relative to each other.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.210
But they will convert that heat,
and heat is just a form

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.130
of energy, into kinetic energy
which is expressed as the

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.340
vibration of these molecules.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.020
Now, if you make these molecules
start to vibrate

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.560
enough, and if you put enough
kinetic energy into these

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.450
molecules, what do you think
is going to happen?

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.830
Well this guy is vibrating
pretty hard, and he's

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.340
vibrating harder and harder as
you add more and more heat.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.670
This guy is doing
the same thing.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.910
At some point, these polar bonds
that they have to each

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.800
other are going to start not
being strong enough to contain

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.780
the vibrations.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.040
And once that happens, the
molecules-- let me draw a

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.880
couple more.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.570
Once that happens, the molecules
are going to start

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.970
moving past each other.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.765
So now all of a sudden, the
molecule will start shifting.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.970
But they're still attracted.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.140
Maybe this side is moving here,
that's moving there.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.540
You have other molecules
moving around that way.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.120
But they're still attracted
to each other.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.450
Even though we've gotten the
kinetic energy to the point

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:31.320
that the vibrations can kind of
break the bonds between the

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.480
polar sides of the molecules.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.260
Our vibration, or our kinetic
energy for each molecule,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.550
still isn't strong enough to
completely separate them.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.000
They're starting to slide
past each other.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.840
And this is essentially what
happens when you're in a

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.260
liquid state.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.760
You have a lot of atoms that
want be touching each other

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.750
but they're sliding.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.050
They have enough kinetic energy
to slide past each

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.480
other and break that solid
lattice structure here.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.270
And then if you add even more
kinetic energy, even more

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.290
heat, at this point it's
a solution now.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.010
They're not even going to be
able to stay together.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.970
They're not going to be able
to stay near each other.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.260
If you add enough kinetic energy
they're going to start

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.080
looking like this.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.130
They're going to completely
separate and then kind of

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.330
bounce around independently.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.210
Especially independently if
they're an ideal gas.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.560
But in general, in gases,
they're no longer touching

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.980
each other.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.150
They might bump into
each other.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.060
But they have so much kinetic
energy on their own that

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.430
they're all doing
their own thing

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.300
and they're not touching.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.650
I think that makes intuitive
sense if you just think about

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.070
what a gas is.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.700
For example, it's hard
to see a gas.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.420
Why is it hard to see a gas?

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.660
Because the molecules are
much further apart.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.670
So they're not acting on the
light in the way that a liquid

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.310
or a solid would.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.390
And if we keep making that
extended further, a solid--

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.010
well, I probably shouldn't
use the example with ice.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.800
Because ice or water is one of
the few situations where the

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.960
solid is less dense
than the liquid.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.440
That's why ice floats.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.960
And that's why icebergs don't
just all fall to the

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.710
bottom of the ocean.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.090
And ponds don't completely
freeze solid.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.870
But you can imagine that,
because a liquid is in most

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.380
cases other than water,
less dense.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.130
That's another reason why you
can see through it a little

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:15.830
bit better.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.940
Or it's not diffracting-- well I
won't go into that too much,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.040
than maybe even a solid.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.950
But the gas is the
most obvious.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.920
And it is true with water.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.700
The liquid form is definitely
more dense than the gas form.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.830
In the gas form, the molecules
are going to jump around, not

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.830
touch each other.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.130
And because of that,
more light can

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.030
get through the substance.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.309
Now the question is, how do we
measure the amount of heat

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:44.940
that it takes to do
this to water?

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.800
And to explain that, I'll
actually draw a

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.990
phase change diagram.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.670
Which is a fancy way of
describing something fairly

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.710
straightforward.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.400
Let me say that this is the
amount of heat I'm adding.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.000
And this is the temperature.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.390
We'll talk about the states
of matter in a second.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.490
So heat is often denoted by q.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.080
Sometimes people will talk
about change in heat.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.680
They'll use H, lowercase
and uppercase H.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.450
They'll put a delta
in front of the H.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.430
Delta just means change in.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.980
And sometimes you'll hear
the word enthalpy.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.740
Let me write that.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.250
Because I used to say
what is enthalpy?

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.050
It sounds like empathy,
but it's

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.600
quite a different concept.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.280
At least, as far as my neural
connections could make it.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.810
But enthalpy is closely
related to heat.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.060
It's heat content.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.250
For our purposes, when you hear
someone say change in

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.550
enthalpy, you should really
just be thinking

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.690
of change in heat.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.850
I think this word was really
just introduced to confuse

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.860
chemistry students and introduce
a non-intuitive word

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.080
into their vocabulary.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.100
The best way to think about
it is heat content.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.130
Change in enthalpy is really
just change in heat.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.230
And just remember, all of these
things, whether we're

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.000
talking about heat,
kinetic energy,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.410
potential energy, enthalpy.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.590
You'll hear them in different
contexts, and you're like, I

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.550
thought I should be using
heat and they're

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.030
talking about enthalpy.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.300
These are all forms of energy.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.040
And these are all measured
in joules.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.100
And they might be measured
in other ways, but the

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.550
traditional way is in joules.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.800
And energy is the ability
to do work.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.720
And what's the unit for work?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.450
Well, it's joules.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.470
Force times distance.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.040
But anyway, that's
a side-note.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.590
But it's good to know
this word enthalpy.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.820
Especially in a chemistry
context, because it's used all

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.170
the time and it can be very
confusing and non-intuitive.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.830
Because you're like, I don't
know what enthalpy is in my

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.460
everyday life.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.170
Just think of it as heat
contact, because that's really

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:50.910
what it is.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.430
But anyway, on this
axis, I have heat.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.180
So this is when I have very
little heat and I'm

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.550
increasing my heat.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.405
And this is temperature.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.720
Now let's say at low
temperatures I'm here and as I

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.410
add heat my temperature
will go up.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.190
Temperature is average
kinetic energy.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.380
Let's say I'm in the
solid state here.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.460
And I'll do the solid
state in purple.

00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:23.590
No I already was using purple.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.490
I'll use magenta.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.810
So as I add heat, my temperature
will go up.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.040
Heat is a form of energy.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.070
And when I add it to these
molecules, as I did in this

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.070
example, what did it do?

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.620
It made them vibrate more.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.290
Or it made them have higher
kinetic energy, or higher

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.830
average kinetic engery, and
that's what temperature is a

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.860
measure of; average
kinetic energy.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.430
So as I add heat in the solid
phase, my average kinetic

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.650
energy will go up.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.710
And let me write this down.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:58.930
This is in the solid phase, or
the solid state of matter.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.060
Now something very interesting
happens.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.930
Let's say this is water.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:09.920
So what happens at
zero degrees?

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.910
Which is also 273.15 Kelvin.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:15.830
Let's say that's that line.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.320
What happens to a solid?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.550
Well, it turns into a liquid.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.600
Ice melts.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.960
Not all solids, we're talking
in particular about

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.540
water, about H2O.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.990
So this is ice in our example.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.670
All solids aren't ice.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.950
Although, you could think of
a rock as solid magma.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.200
Because that's what it is.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.150
I could take that analogy a
bunch of different ways.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:46.365
But the interesting thing that
happens at zero degrees.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.120
Depending on what direction
you're going, either the

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.730
freezing point of water or
the melting point of ice,

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.550
something interesting happens.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:00.840
As I add more heat, the
temperature does not to go up.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.440
As I add more heat, the
temperature does not go up for

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.120
a little period.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.150
Let me draw that.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.460
For a little period, the
temperature stays constant.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.970
And then while the temperature
is constant, it stays a solid.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.090
We're still a solid.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.580
And then, we finally
turn into a liquid.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.960
Let's say right there.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.525
So we added a certain amount
of heat and it

00:13:25.525 --> 00:13:26.590
just stayed a solid.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.180
But it got us to the
point that the ice

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.220
turned into a liquid.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.090
It was kind of melting
the entire time.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.690
That's the best way
to think about it.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.190
And then, once we keep adding
more and more heat, then the

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.440
liquid warms up too.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.650
Now, we get to, what
temperature becomes

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.770
interesting again for water?

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:56.700
Well, obviously 100 degrees
Celsius or 373 degrees Kelvin.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:57.940
I'll do it in Celsius
because that's what

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.230
we're familiar with.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.960
What happens?

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.890
That's the temperature at which
water will vaporize or

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.510
which water will boil.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.040
But something happens.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:13.300
And they're really getting
kinetically active.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.510
But just like when you went from
solid to liquid, there's

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.990
a certain amount of energy that
you have to contribute to

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.330
the system.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.140
And actually, it's a good
amount at this point.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.360
Where the water is turning
into vapor, but it's not

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.610
getting any hotter.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.280
So we have to keep adding heat,
but notice that the

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.230
temperature didn't go up.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.070
We'll talk about it
in a second what

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.120
was happening then.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.060
And then finally, after that
point, we're completely

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.070
vaporized, or we're
completely steam.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.890
Then we can start getting hot,
the steam can then get hotter

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.170
as we add more and more
heat to the system.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.770
So the interesting question, I
think it's intuitive, that as

00:14:55.770 --> 00:15:01.540
you add heat here, our
temperature is going to go up.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.820
But the interesting thing is,
what was going on here?

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.880
We were adding heat.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.810
So over here we were turning our
heat into kinetic energy.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.090
Temperature is average
kinetic energy.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.710
But over here, what was
our heat doing?

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.080
Well, our heat was was
not adding kinetic

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.130
energy to the system.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.900
The temperature was
not increasing.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.980
But the ice was going
from ice to water.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.110
So what was happening at that
state, is that the kinetic

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:29.220
energy, the heat, was being
used to essentially break

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.190
these bonds.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.080
And essentially bring
the molecules into a

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.660
higher energy state.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.840
So you're saying, Sal,
what does that mean,

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.640
higher energy state?

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.270
Well, if there wasn't all of
this heat and all this kinetic

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.910
energy, these molecules
want to be very

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.810
close to each other.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.230
For example, I want
to be close to the

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.590
surface of the earth.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.610
When you put me in a plane
you have put me in a

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.850
higher energy state.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.000
I have a lot more potential
energy.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.800
I have the potential to fall
towards the earth.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.630
Likewise, when you move these
molecules apart, and you go

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.570
from a solid to a liquid,
they want to fall

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:06.900
towards each other.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.850
But because they have so much
kinetic energy, they never

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.280
quite are able to do it.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.420
But their energy goes up.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.700
Their potential energy is higher
because they want to

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.960
fall towards each other.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.800
By falling towards each
other, in theory, they

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.010
could do some work.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:26.720
So what's happening here is,
when we're contributing heat--

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.530
and this amount of heat we're
contributing, it's called the

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.780
heat of fusion.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.010
Because it's the same amount
of heat regardless how much

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.240
direction we go in.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.350
When we go from solid to liquid,
you view it as the

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.450
heat of melting.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.040
It's the head that you need
to put in to melt

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.160
the ice into liquid.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.530
When you're going in this
direction, it's the heat you

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.800
have to take out of the
zero degree water to

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.040
turn it into ice.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.160
So you're taking that potential
energy and you're

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.050
bringing the molecules closer
and closer to each other.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:08.700
So the way to think about it
is, right here this heat is

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.530
being converted to
kinetic energy.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:15.020
Then, when we're at this phase
change from solid to liquid,

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.980
that heat is being used
to add potential

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.050
energy into the system.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.369
To pull the molecules
apart, to give them

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:22.420
more potential energy.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.060
If you pull me apart from the
earth, you're giving me

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.000
potential energy.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.040
Because gravity wants to pull
me back to the earth.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.640
And I could do work when I'm
falling back to the earth.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.770
A waterfall does work.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.210
It can move a turbine.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.625
You could have a bunch
of falling Sals move

00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:39.160
a turbine as well.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.050
And then, once you are fully a
liquid, then you just become a

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:43.440
warmer and warmer liquid.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.760
Now the heat is, once again,
being used for kinetic energy.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.010
You're making the water
molecules move past each other

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.190
faster, and faster,
and faster.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.630
To some point where they want
to completely disassociate

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.580
from each other.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.370
They want to not even slide
past each other, just

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.080
completely jump away
from each other.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.140
And that's right here.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.610
This is the heat of
vaporization.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.440
And the same idea
is happening.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.710
Before we were sliding next to
each other, now we're pulling

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.510
apart altogether.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.620
So they could definitely
fall closer together.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.510
And then once we've added this
much heat, now we're just

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.650
heating up the steam.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.990
We're just heating up
the gaseous water.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.770
And it's just getting hotter
and hotter and hotter.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.670
But the interesting thing there,
and I mean at least the

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:41.040
interesting thing to me when I
first learned this, whenever I

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.970
think of zero degrees water I'll
say, oh it must be ice.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.590
But that's not necessarily
the case.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.680
If you start with water and you
make it colder and colder

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.460
and colder to zero degrees,
you're essentially taking heat

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.440
out of the water.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.410
You can have zero degree
water and it hasn't

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.660
turned into ice yet.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.850
And likewise, you could have 100
degree water that hasn't

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.070
turned into steam yeat.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.200
You have to add more energy.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.800
You can also have 100
degree steam.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.700
You can also have zero
degree water.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.680
Anyway, hopefully that gives you
a little bit of intuition

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.740
of what the different states
of matter are.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.180
And in the next problem, we'll
talk about how much heat

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.130
exactly it does take to
move along this line.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.020
And maybe we can solve some
problems on how much ice we

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.620
might need to make
our drink cool.
