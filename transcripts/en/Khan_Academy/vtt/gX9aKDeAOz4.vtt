00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.590
I think we're now ready to
tackle the big picture and

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.090
what has our government
officials so

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.970
worried right now.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.000
So what I've done is, I've just
drawn the balance sheets

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.070
for a bunch of banks.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.090
Obviously, this is simplified.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.580
And I made all of their balance
sheets look the same.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.560
All of these banks, each of
these kind of represents the

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.470
balance sheet of a bank.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.940
And just to explain it, the
left-hand side of this balance

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.030
sheet, so this column right
here-- and maybe I can, at

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.560
least for the first bank,
mark it a little bit.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.310
So what I'm squaring off
in magenta, that's the

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.750
assets of that bank.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.270
What I'm squaring off
in blue, that's the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.580
liabilities of the bank.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.730
And what I wrote here is, it has
$4 billion of liabilities.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.380
Its assets, I divided it between
$3 billion of other

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.230
assets and $2 billion of CDOs.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.810
Because we want to focus on the
CDOs, because that's the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.320
crux of everything
that's going on.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.620
And we have $5 billion in
assets, $4 billion of

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.590
liabilities, so you have
$1 billion in equity.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.680
So that's what's left there.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.800
So this is just another visual
representation that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.120
liabilities plus equity
is equal to assets.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.220
Or assets minus liabilities
is equal to equity.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.940
And I've just copied and pasted
this one balance sheet

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.930
a bunch of times.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.390
I don't know whether we're
going to use all those.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.970
But let's just assume, for
simplicity, that a ton of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.680
banks in the system have this
identical balance sheet.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.750
Obviously, they don't have an
identical balance sheet.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.790
But all of their balance sheets
might have kind of

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.040
similar properties.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.880
This isn't always the case,
different banks have different

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.310
exposures to CDOs.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.240
Some of them have a lot, some
of them have a little bit.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.450
Some of them are valuing
them more

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.480
conservatively than others.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.370
But just for the sake of
simplicity, I've just made all

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.710
the banks in the situation where
the book value of the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.550
CDOs that they have on their
balance sheets is the larger

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.030
than their equity value.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.040
And I did that for a reason.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.890
Because it leads to the issue
of, are these banks facing

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.720
just a liquidity issue
or are they facing

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.220
just a solvency issue?

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.419
If you believe that these are
worth $3 billion, these

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.280
assets, these liabilities are
worth $4 billion, then the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.260
crux of whether it's a liquidity
or a solvency issue

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.200
all falls down as to whether
these are worth

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.420
$2 billion or not.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.140
For example, if these are worth
$2 billion, then you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.520
have $1 billion of equity.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.270
If these are worth $1.5 billion,
well maybe they're

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.460
being a little optimistic here,
but you'll still have

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.990
$0.5 billion of equity.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.600
So you're still solvent.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.080
And in that situation, in
theory, one is just if they

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.720
don't have the cash when some of
their debt comes due, they

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.140
should just be able to
borrow some money and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.960
get past that hurdle.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.110
And then in the future maybe
sell their assets and still

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.500
have positive equity.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.280
However, if the true value of
those CDOs, and this is kind

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.940
of a philosophical question,
what's the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.100
true value of anything?

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.870
And the best thing that we as
humans have been to be able to

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.290
come up with is a market.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.080
The market value tends to be the
best representation of the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.670
true value of something.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.630
Let's say the true value of this
is $1 billion or less,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.630
then we have a situation.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.800
For example, if these are worth
nothing, then we only

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.050
have $3 billion of assets, $4
billion of liabilities, we

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.510
have negative equity.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.790
This company is worth nothing.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.220
And to lend this bank or this
company any money would just

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.870
be throwing good money
after bad.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.600
Because that money is just going
to go into a black hole.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.050
Because one of the people who
this company owes money to is

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.730
probably not going to
see their money.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.260
And if you are the most junior
person lending the money--

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.700
which means that when all the
money is distributed if they

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.350
go into bankruptcy, you're the
last person to see the money--

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.780
then you're just throwing
good money after bad.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.920
So that's the issue.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.890
But I want you to see
the big picture now.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.870
Because if it was just an
issue with one bank it

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.740
wouldn't be a big deal.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.400
If it was just Bear Stearns
or if it was just Lehman

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.210
Brothers, not a big
deal, let the

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.960
greedy bankers go bankrupt.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.510
And they probably are doing
just fine with the bonuses

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.320
they've collected after sourcing
these CDOs for the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.020
past eight years or five
years or however long.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.130
But what I want to show you in
this video is what people are

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.730
talking about when they
say systemic risk.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.149
So these $4 billion in
liabilities, these are loans,

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.300
maybe from other banks.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.690
In fact, probably from
other banks.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.340
And those loans from other
banks, those are assets of

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.850
other banks.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.800
For example, let's say this
is Bank A, this is Bank B.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.156
Maybe a billion of these
are a loan from bank B.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.180
And if this is a loan from Bank
B, Bank B would have an

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.660
asset called loan to Bank A.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.850
On Bank B's balance sheet
we're calling this a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.160
loan to Bank A.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.500
This is one of its assets.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.380
And then one of its liabilities
will be a loan

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.730
from Bank B.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.050
So how can I say this?

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.310
They took this money and
they gave it to B.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.680
I'm sorry, B had money, gave it
to A in the form of a loan.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.590
And so that cash
ended up here.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.555
And they got an asset called
loan to Bank A.

00:05:07.555 --> 00:05:09.840
And this is a liability,
loan from Bank B.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.845
And they might have taken that
money and they might have lent

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:16.720
it to Bank C down here.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.970
I think you're starting to see
how this gets pretty hairy

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.075
very fast. So let's say that
Bank A, one of its $3 billion

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:32.990
in assets, is a loan
to Bank C.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.020
And so on Bank C's balance
sheet, it'll say

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.640
loan from Bank A.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.320
Or so we owe A $1 billion.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.120
And A says, C owes me $1
billion, and that's all fine.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.370
And then you see that oh,
we owe B $1 billion.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.550
And then we could
keep doing this.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.030
Or I could just even make this
into a circle already.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.850
So maybe Bank B has some money
that it owes to someone else.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.220
And let's say that someone else,
just for fun, just to

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.240
make this interesting-- I think
you can extrapolate and

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.230
think about how this gets
complicated very fast. Bank B

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.880
has borrowed money
from Bank C.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.600
So Bank C will have an asset
here that says, no I lent

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.850
money to Bank B.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.620
Fair enough.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.020
OK, so now we're in an
interesting situation.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.060
Let's say this loan, the
loan from Bank B to

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.330
Bank A comes due.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.723
And we've studied this
multiple times.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.180
And let's say for whatever
reason, all of these other

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.850
loans, they're not liquid.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.270
They're not due yet.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.315
So Bank A can't get rid
of these loans.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.910
So let's say this comes due,
this is $4 billion.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.690
They can't sell any of this.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:01.160
So Bank A has to come up with $1
billion somehow for Bank B.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.410
So that's the situation
we're dealing with.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.110
I'm just going to say
that they can't sell

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.060
any of these assets.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.280
So it all comes down
to the CDOs.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.350
So there's a couple
of issues here.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.760
If you think it is just an issue
of illiquidity, if these

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.010
are $2 billion of assets,
they're really worth $2

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.530
billion, but Bank A just
can't sell them.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.280
Because either there's
quote-unquote

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.390
nobody willing to buy.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.940
Although, I would argue if
no-one is willing to buy

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.950
something, then its true
value is probably zero.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.220
But let's just say Bank A says
no-one is willing to buy,

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.460
we're just illiquid, this is
really worth $2 billion.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.280
So one situation is they could
get a loan from someone.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.460
Maybe the Fed would be willing
to take this as collateral.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.140
So they would give this as
collateral to the Fed.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.230
Maybe the Fed will give them
a billion dollar loan.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.260
And then they can use
that to pay Bank B.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.950
Let's say that's off the table
because this is just smelly

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.100
enough collateral that not even
the Fed, which we now

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.960
realize is willing to do
anything to support the

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.970
markets, not even the Fed is
willing to give them a loan.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.520
Or enough of a loan to
pay off that loan.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.080
The other situation is maybe
they can get an equity

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.890
infusion from a sovereign
wealth fund.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.670
And we covered that a couple
of videos ago.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.960
Where the sovereign
wealth fund will

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.900
essentially inject some cash.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.400
It'll dilute the shares and then
you know maybe we had 500

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.370
million shares before.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.830
Now we'll have 2
billion shares.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:17.110
So the sovereign wealth fund
will take over roughly 80% of

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.810
the company.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.260
And in exchange for 80% of the
company, would give maybe $2

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.740
billion and then you could use
that to pay off this loan.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.160
But let's say that that's not
on the table anymore either.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.530
Because the sovereign
wealth funds have

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.040
gotten burned so much.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:31.990
So what happens?

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.010
Well we learned what happens.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.020
If you can't get a loan, a new
loan, to replace this loan, or

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.220
if you can't get an equity
infusion from kind of a

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.799
greater fool, what happens?

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.470
You go into bankruptcy.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.300
And this is what happened
to Lehman Brothers.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.540
Lehman Brothers went
into bankruptcy.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.010
No sovereign wealth fund, no one
else bought the company.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.810
And I should probably
do another

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.260
video on that scenario.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.330
And they couldn't get a loan.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.410
So they went bankrupt.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.210
I should call this Company
L actually.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.440
But I'll call it Company
A for now.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.810
Because I don't want
to impugn anyone.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.040
I actually don't think Lehman
was any worse or better than

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.350
any of the other players here.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.710
So when they go into bankruptcy,
something very

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.400
interesting happens.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.150
Now, Bank B, they were already
worried about these CDOs.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.660
These CDOs were already
an issue.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.320
And they were probably thinking,
boy when when Loan C

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.990
comes due, I'm going
to be in trouble.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.020
Or when Loan D, or F, or
whatever, I'm going to be in

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.280
trouble because I'm going to be
in that situation that I'm

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.620
essentially forcing Bank
A into right now.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.760
But now I have a new problem.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.320
This loan to Bank A isn't
getting paid off.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.320
And who knows?

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.640
Bank A is going to go
into bankruptcy.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.470
Maybe in bankruptcy we realize
that these are worth nothing.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.930
And if those are worth nothing,
then maybe I'm very

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.580
junior in seniority in terms of
where my loan is and maybe

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.080
I get nothing.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.840
Or I get a few pennies
on the dollar here.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.280
So maybe I thought this was $1
billion and I have to write

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.160
this down to $0.5 billion.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.620
So now I have two problems. I
have this and I have this.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.630
And once again, this is
a non liquid loan.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.470
Bank A is in bankruptcy.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.840
And if I wanted to somehow get
the value of this I have to

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.890
wait for all of Bank A's assets
to go into liquidation.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.620
And then whatever assets I get
I would have to sell it.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.020
So this is kind of
a frozen asset.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.380
So once again, I'm stuck holding
this non liquid asset.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.450
So now I have this non liquid
asset that's probably not

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.890
worth what I thought it was,
which was a loan to A.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.640
Then I also have these CDOs.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:35.050
And now, God forbid, let's
say that I had another

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.750
loan to Bank D.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.510
And now let's say Bank
D goes bankrupt.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.190
And then I have another
loan that's bad on

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.070
top of these CDOs.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.390
But the CDOs were the
crux of the issue.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.770
That's what caused
the situation.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:51.400
If Bank A could have only sold
this CDO for $2 billion, it

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.240
wouldn't have caused this
chain reaction.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.910
And Lehman Brothers really was
the thing that catalyzed this

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.700
whole chain of events.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.690
And then you can imagine now
Bank C is worried because now

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.010
Bank B has all of these illiquid
assets on top of

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.790
these CDOs and it starts
to look bad.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.110
And you can imagine, now it's
even less likely that when a

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.910
bank, let's say that Bank D is
the next one to go into a dire

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.900
situation, it's even less likely
that Bank D can get a

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.000
loan from a third bank.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.340
Because all the banks are
getting scared now.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.160
All the banks are saying,
I'm not going to

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.050
loan money to anyone.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.970
If I can get any cash from
anybody I'm just

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:26.840
going to keep it.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.260
So that when it's my turn, when
the market starts looking

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.230
at me, I at least have
a little cash.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.800
So everyone is frozen.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.150
Everyone wants to collect their
loans from everyone else

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.560
and no one wants to give
loans to anybody else.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.300
So that's the situation
we're in.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.320
And that's the difficulty
that the Fed is

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.160
somehow trying to unwind.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.780
And I realized I'm out
of time again.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.450
I will confront that issue
in the next video.
