00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.250
A line passes through the points
negative 3, 6 and 6, 0.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.390
Find the equation of this line
in point slope form, slope

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.860
intercept form, standard form.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.970
And the way to think about
these, these are just three

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.030
different ways of writing
the same equation.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.220
So if you give me one of them,
we can manipulate it to get

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.230
any of the other ones.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.890
But just so you know what these
are, point slope form,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.500
let's say the point x1, y1 are,
let's say that that is a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.160
point on the line.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.900
And when someone puts this
little subscript here, so if

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.750
they just write an x, that means
we're talking about a

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.690
variable that can take
on any value.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.770
If someone writes x with a
subscript 1 and a y with a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.150
subscript 1, that's like saying
a particular value x

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.450
and a particular value of y,
or a particular coordinate.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.030
And you'll see that when
we do the example.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.480
But point slope form says
that, look, if I know a

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.020
particular point, and if I know
the slope of the line,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.750
then putting that line in point
slope form would be y

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.209
minus y1 is equal to
m times x minus x1.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.830
So, for example, and we'll do
that in this video, if the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.170
point negative 3 comma 6 is on
the line, then we'd say y

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.510
minus 6 is equal to m times x
minus negative 3, so it'll end

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.120
up becoming x plus 3.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.115
So this is a particular
x, and a particular y.

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:25.130
It could be a negative
3 and 6.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.870
So that's point slope form.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.790
Slope intercept form is y is
equal to mx plus b, where once

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.810
again m is the slope, b is the
y-intercept-- where does the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.180
line intersect the y-axis--
what value does y take

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.680
on when x is 0?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.680
And then standard form is the
form ax plus by is equal to c,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.810
where these are just two
numbers, essentially.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.960
They really don't have
any interpretation

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.430
directly on the graph.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.710
So let's do this, let's figure
out all of these forms. So the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.900
first thing we want to do
is figure out the slope.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.610
Once we figure out the slope,
then point slope form is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.820
actually very, very, very
straightforward to calculate.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.120
So, just to remind ourselves,
slope, which is equal to m,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.110
which is going to be equal to
the change in y over the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.480
change in x.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.940
Now what is the change in y?

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.610
If we view this as our end
point, if we imagine that we

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.190
are going from here to
that point, what is

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.460
the change in y?

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.860
Well, we have our end point,
which is 0, y ends up at the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.300
0, and y was at 6.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.650
So, our finishing y point is 0,
our starting y point is 6.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.870
What was our finishing x
point, or x-coordinate?

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.810
Our finishing x-coordinate
was 6.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.690
Let me make this very clear, I
don't want to confuse you.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.720
So this 0, we have that 0, that
is that 0 right there.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.330
And then we have this 6, which
was our starting y point, that

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.580
is that 6 right there.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.000
And then we want our finishing x
value-- that is that 6 right

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.050
there, or that 6 right there--
and we want to subtract from

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.080
that our starting x value.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.800
Well, our starting x value is
that right over there, that's

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.910
that negative 3.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.880
And just to make sure we know
what we're doing, this

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.440
negative 3 is that negative
3, right there.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.500
I'm just saying, if we go from
that point to that point, our

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.640
y went down by 6, right?

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.960
We went from 6 to 0.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.650
Our y went down by 6.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.420
So we get 0 minus
6 is negative 6.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.070
That makes sense.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.150
Y went down by 6.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.180
And, if we went from that point
to that point, what

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.060
happened to x?

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.560
We went from negative 3 to
6, it should go up by 9.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.870
And if you calculate this, take
your 6 minus negative 3,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.550
that's the same thing as
6 plus 3, that is 9.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.120
And what is negative 6/9?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.060
Well, if you simplify it,
it is negative 2/3.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.950
You divide the numerator and
the denominator by 3.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.860
So that is our slope,
negative 2/3.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.800
So we're pretty much ready
to use point slope form.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.760
We have a point, we could pick
one of these points, I'll just

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.149
go with the negative 3, 6.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.269
And we have our slope.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.910
So let's put it in
point slope form.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.910
All we have to do is we say y
minus-- now we could have

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.030
taken either of these points,
I'll take this one-- so y

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:42.990
minus the y value over here, so
y minus 6 is equal to our

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:51.480
slope, which is negative
2/3 times x minus our

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.930
x-coordinate.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.490
Well, our x-coordinate, so x
minus our x-coordinate is

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.370
negative 3, x minus negative
3, and we're done.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.570
We can simplify it
a little bit.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:08.650
This becomes y minus 6 is equal
to negative 2/3 times x.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.610
x minus negative 3 is the
same thing as x plus 3.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.760
This is our point slope form.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.270
Now, we can literally just
algebraically manipulate this

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.500
guy right here to put it into
our slope intercept form.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.130
Let's do that.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.560
So let's do slope intercept
in orange.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.960
So we have slope intercept.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.040
So what can we do here
to simplify this?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.510
Well, we can multiply out the
negative 2/3, so you get y

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.150
minus 6 is equal to-- I'm just
distributing the negative

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.950
2/3-- so negative 2/3 times
x is negative 2/3 x.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.890
And then negative 2/3 times
3 is negative 2.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.150
And now to get it in slope
intercept form, we just have

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.270
to add the 6 to both sides so
we get rid of it on the

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.380
left-hand side, so let's
add 6 to both

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.400
sides of this equation.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.010
Left-hand side of the equation,
we're just left with

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.090
a y, these guys cancel out.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.830
You get a y is equal
to negative 2/3 x.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.810
Negative 2 plus 6 is plus 4.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.890
So there you have it, that is
our slope intercept form, mx

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.590
plus b, that's our
y-intercept.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.480
Now the last thing we need
to do is get it into

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.730
the standard form.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.840
So once again, we just have to
algebraically manipulate it so

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.500
that the x's and the
y's are both on

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.130
this side of the equation.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.140
So let's just add 2/3 x to both
sides of this equation.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.140
So I'll start it here.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.950
So we have y is equal to
negative 2/3 x plus 4, that's

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.540
slope intercept form.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:53.790
Let's added 2/3 x, so
plus 2/3 x to both

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.040
sides of this equation.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.060
I'm doing that so it I don't
have this 2/3 x on the

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.350
right-hand side, this
negative 2/3 x.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.010
So the left-hand side of the
equation-- I scrunched it up a

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.730
little bit, maybe more than I
should have-- the left-hand

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.890
side of this equation is what?

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:16.390
It is 2/3 x, because 2 over
3x, plus this y, that's my

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.220
left-hand side, is equal to--
these guys cancel out-- is

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.650
equal to 4.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.580
So this, by itself, we are in
standard form, this is the

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.790
standard form of the equation.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.030
If we want it to look, make it
look extra clean and have no

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.340
fractions here, we could
multiply both sides of this

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.860
equation by 3.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.400
If we do that, what do we get?

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.220
2/3 x times 3 is just 2x.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.440
y times 3 is 3y.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.700
And then 4 times 3 is 12.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.620
These are the same equations,
I just multiplied

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.760
every term by 3.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.190
If you do it to the left-hand
side, you can do to the

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.680
right-hand side-- or you have to
do to the right-hand side--

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.160
and we are in standard form.
