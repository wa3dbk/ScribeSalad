00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's explore another mechanism
that we can have

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:03.760
with the ketone.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.180
And actually, an aldehyde can
undergo a very similar or

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.230
actually the same type
of reaction.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.380
So let's say that I had a ketone
that looked like this.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.780
Let me draw my carbonyl group,
just like that, and then it is

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.390
bonded to a carbon
that is bonded to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.680
two other CH3 groups.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.320
And just to make it clear,
there's three hydrogens off of

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.500
this carbon there implicitly.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.590
But I'm going to draw the fourth
bond here, which is to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.180
a hydrogen, because this
hydrogen is going to be

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.630
important for this reaction.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.490
Now, we know that the
oxygen has two

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.200
lone pairs of electrons.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.590
Let me draw it up here.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.270
And let's just imagine it's
floating around in some water,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.340
and we know that in water
there is some

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.180
concentration of hydronium.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.540
And let's say that one of the
hydroniums is right over here.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.400
Hydronium is just positively
charged, so

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.920
this is right here.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.890
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.320
This is what water looks like.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.500
And if water gives away an
electron to a proton,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.790
it looks like this.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.430
It is hydronium, and then
it only has one

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.330
lone pair of electrons.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.890
It gave away one of the other
electrons in its other lone

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.670
pair to a proton.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.010
So you can imagine a reality,
where it's like, hey, I could

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.810
grab that proton from this
hydronium, and then this will

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.280
turn back into water, and in
that situation, the mechanism

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.485
would look like this.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.360
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.060
This blue electron gets given
to this proton, if they just

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.930
bump into each other just right,
and then the hydrogen's

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.650
electron gets taken
back by what will

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.540
become a water molecule.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.410
So if that happens, what do our
molecules now look like?

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.650
So now, what was a ketone looks
a little bit different

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.350
than a ketone.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.910
It looks like this.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.400
I changed it to a slightly
lighter color of green, so it

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.660
looks like that.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.390
We have our lone pair over here,
but we no longer have

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.570
this lone pair.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.990
At this end, we still have this
magenta electron, but now

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.889
it is in a covalent bond with
the blue electron, which was

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.490
now given to the hydrogen
proton.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.525
Let me scroll up a little bit.

00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:17.230
It was given to this hydrogen
proton up here.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.860
And then this hydronium
molecule, it took back an

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.280
electron, and now it is
just neutral water.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.360
It took back that magenta
electron, so now it has two

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.350
lone pairs again, so it
is just neutral water.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.730
Since this oxygen up here in the
carbonyl group gave away

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.165
an electron, it now has
a positive charge.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.680
But this is actually resonance
stabilized.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.670
You could maybe see that this
would be in resonance, or

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.760
another resonance form of this
would be-- if this guy's

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.290
positive, so he wants to gain an
electron, so maybe he takes

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.830
an electron from this carbon,
the carbon in the carbonyl

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.810
group right over there.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.420
So if you takes that electron,
then the other resonance form

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.370
would look like this.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.460
Let me doing it in
the same colors.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.150
You have now only a single bond
with this oxygen up here.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.430
This carbon down here is still
bonded to the same carbons,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.480
and then this carbon over here,
we could call this an

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.600
alpha carbon.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.110
This is an alpha carbon
to the carbonyl group.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.290
It still has a hydrogen on
it right over there.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.010
And this oxygen, since it gained
this magenta electron,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.260
now it has two lone pairs.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.660
It has this pair over there,
and then it gained this

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.200
electron and this electron, so
it has another lone pair.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.510
And, of course, it has the
bond to the hydrogen.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.660
Since it gained an electron,
it is now neutral.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.710
This carbon lost an electron,
so now it is positive.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.040
So now this carbon right over
here is positive, and these

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.020
two are two different resonance
forms, so they help

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.970
stabilize each other.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.480
And the reality is actually
someplace in between.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.950
I could actually draw it in
brackets to show that these

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.500
are two resonance structures.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.320
Now, you can imagine, just as
likely-- and actually, I

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.920
shouldn't just draw this as a
one-way arrow, because this

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.200
guy could take a hydrogen from
this hydronium, or a water

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.470
could take a hydrogen from this
guy, so this actually

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.680
could go in both directions.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.620
So let me make that clear.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.835
This could go in both
directions.

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:32.890
You could say that they're in
equilibrium with each other.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.740
You're just as likely to go in
that direction as you really,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.070
for the most part, are to go
on the other direction.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.060
But you can now imagine, this
has now turned from a carbonyl

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.740
group, this has now an OH group,
this has now turned

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.520
into an alcohol, although we
have this carbocation here,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.920
that this does not like
being positive.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.690
And so you could imagine where
this electron right here on

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.760
this hydrogen nucleus might want
to go really bad to this

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.720
carbocation, and it just needs
something to nab the proton

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.240
off for it to go there.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.970
And the perfect candidate
for that would

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.240
just be a water molecule.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.550
We have this water floating
around, so let me draw another

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.680
water molecule, just
like this.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.440
It has two lone pairs.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.290
It can act as a weak base.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.930
It can give one of
its electrons to

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.240
this hydrogen proton.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.830
If it does that at the exact
same time, bumps into it in

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.860
the exact same way, this
electron can then go to the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.960
carbocation.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.980
And if that happened, you could
go in either direction.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.130
This reaction is just as
likely to happen as the

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.150
reverse reaction, so we could
put this in equilibrium.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.990
But if that were to happen, then
what started off as our

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.510
ketone now looks like this.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.970
We have a bond to an OH group
just like this, and over

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.770
here-- actually, let me
draw the rest of it.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.130
We had our molecule that looked
like that, but now,

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.860
this electron gets giving back
to this carbocation.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.940
We now have a double bond here
between what was a carbonyl

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.780
carbon and our alpha carbon.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.130
So now we have this double
bond right over here.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.320
That hydrogen has been
taken by the water,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.680
and now that is hydronium.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.990
So let me draw the water
or the hydronium.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.270
So that water, it had that one
lone pair, and then the other

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.570
lone pair got broken up, because
it gave one of the

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.270
electrons to this hydrogen right
over here, and it went

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.850
back to being hydronium.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.700
So what happened here?

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:42.270
We started with a ketone, and
they sometimes will call this

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.040
the keto form of the molecule,
and then we ended up with

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.050
something called
the enol form.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:59.690
An enol comes from the fact that
it is an alkene that is

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.545
also an alcohol.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.110
You could even call
it an alkenol.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.960
It has a double bond, and on one
of the carbons that has a

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.960
double bond, it has
an OH group.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.870
And the whole reason I show you
this mechanism is, one,

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.870
just to show you a mechanism
that could happen with an

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.260
aldehyde or a ketone.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.590
This was a ketone, but if this
was a hydrogen right here,

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.570
this would have been occurring
with an aldehyde.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.380
But even more, this is a pretty
common mechanism that

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.950
you'll see in organic chemistry
classes, and

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.430
actually has a lot of functions

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.260
in biology, in general.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.670
And these two molecules, this
ketone and this enol form,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.920
these are called tautomers.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.400
And the keto form is actually
the much more stable form.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.800
In a solution, you won't see
much of the enol form, but

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.575
these can occur.

00:07:46.575 --> 00:07:50.440
It can spontaneously through
equilibrium get to

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.320
the actual enol form.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.870
And so you could imagine, these
are tautomers, so this

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.210
mechanism is actually called a
tautomerization, and these are

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.620
the keto and enol forms
of the tautomers.
