00:00:00.361 --> 00:00:01.961
- [Voiceover] So one common
type of problem that you see

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:04.062
in a number of multivariable
calculus classes

00:00:04.062 --> 00:00:06.502
will say something to the
effect of the following:

00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:09.462
find and classify all of
the critical point of,

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:12.822
and then you'll insert some
kind of multivariable function.

00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:15.702
So first of all, this
idea of a critical point

00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:18.782
basically means anywhere where
the gradient equals zero.

00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:20.500
So you're looking for
places where the gradient

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.742
of your function, at some kind of input,

00:00:22.742 --> 00:00:26.022
some specified input X and
Y that you're solving for,

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:27.700
is equal to zero.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.302
And as I talked about in
the last couple of videos,

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:31.062
the reason you might want
to do this is because

00:00:31.062 --> 00:00:32.502
you're hoping to maximize the function

00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:34.262
or to maybe minimize the function.

00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:37.660
And now the second requirement
of classifying those points,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.902
that's what the second
derivative test is all about.

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:42.542
Once you find something, or
the gradient equals zero,

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.142
you want to be able to determine,

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:46.140
is it a local maximum,
is it a local minimum

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.062
or is it a settle point?

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:49.902
So let's go ahead and
work through this example.

00:00:49.902 --> 00:00:51.780
The first thing we're gonna
need to do if we're solving

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.302
for when the gradient equals zero,

00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:54.822
and remember, when we say equals zero,

00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:56.702
we really mean the zero vector,

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:58.662
but it's just a convenient
way of putting it all

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:01.340
on one line, we take
both partial derivatives.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.902
So the partial derivative
with respect to X is,

00:01:05.902 --> 00:01:07.942
well, this first term,
when we take the derivative

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:10.582
of three X squared times
Y with respect to X,

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:14.665
the two hops down so we
have six times X times Y.

00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:18.302
Y cubed, well, Y looks like a constant

00:01:18.302 --> 00:01:21.622
so Y cubed looks like a
constant minus three X squared,

00:01:21.622 --> 00:01:22.780
so that two comes down.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.980
So we're subtracting off six times X.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.580
Six times X.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.340
And then again, this three Y squared term,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.262
Y looks like a constant so everything here

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:33.382
looks like a constant
with zero derivative,

00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:35.420
as far as the X direction is concerned.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.837
And we do partial of f with respect to Y,

00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:43.340
then this first term looks
like some sort of constant,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.342
three X squared.

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:46.582
X looks like a constant so
some kind of constant times Y.

00:01:46.582 --> 00:01:50.340
So the whole thing looks
like three X squared.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.020
The second term, minus X,
minus Y cubed, excuse me,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.502
looks like minus three
Y squared when we take

00:01:56.502 --> 00:01:57.622
the derivative.

00:01:57.622 --> 00:01:59.942
Minus three Y squared.

00:01:59.942 --> 00:02:02.742
And then this next term only
has an X so it looks like

00:02:02.742 --> 00:02:04.782
a constant as far as Y is concerned.

00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:07.062
And then this last term,
we take down the two

00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:08.742
because we're differentiating Y squared,

00:02:08.742 --> 00:02:12.909
and you'll get negative six
Y, negative six times Y.

00:02:14.062 --> 00:02:16.742
So when we are finding
the critical points,

00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:19.624
the first step is to set both
of these guys equal to zero.

00:02:19.624 --> 00:02:22.144
So this first one, when we
do set it equal to zero,

00:02:22.144 --> 00:02:25.184
we can typify a bit by
factoring out six X.

00:02:25.184 --> 00:02:29.351
So this really looks like six
X multiplied by Y minus one.

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:36.824
And then that's what we're
setting equal to zero.

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:39.024
And what this equation
tells us is that either

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.544
it's the six X term that equals zero,

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:46.304
in which case that would
mean X is equal to zero;

00:02:46.304 --> 00:02:49.944
or it's the case the Y
minus one equals zero,

00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:53.422
in which case that would
mean that Y equals one.

00:02:53.422 --> 00:02:55.382
So at least one of these
things has to be true.

00:02:55.382 --> 00:02:57.824
That's kind of the first
requirement that we found.

00:02:57.824 --> 00:02:59.462
Let me scroll down a little bit here.

00:02:59.462 --> 00:03:02.384
And for the second equation,
when we set it equal to zero,

00:03:02.384 --> 00:03:04.784
it's not immediately
straightforward how you would

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.904
solve for this in a nice
way in terms of X and Y,

00:03:07.904 --> 00:03:09.944
but because we've already
solved one, we can kind of

00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:13.144
plug them in and say, for
example, if it was the case

00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:15.342
that X is equal to zero,

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:17.384
and we kind of wanna see what
that turns our equation into,

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:19.224
then we would have, well, three X squared

00:03:19.224 --> 00:03:22.264
is nothing that would be zero
and we'd just be left with

00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:25.264
negative three Y squared minus six Y

00:03:27.344 --> 00:03:28.904
is equal to zero.

00:03:28.904 --> 00:03:31.784
And that, we can factor out a
bit, so I'm gonna factor out

00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:33.367
a negative three Y.

00:03:34.424 --> 00:03:37.184
So I'll factor out negative three Y,

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:40.304
which means that first
term just has a Y remaining

00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:43.584
and then that second term
has a two, a positive two,

00:03:43.584 --> 00:03:45.028
since I factored out negative three.

00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:48.388
So positive two and that equals zero.

00:03:48.388 --> 00:03:51.308
So what this whole situation
would imply is that either

00:03:51.308 --> 00:03:54.188
negative three Y equals
zero, which would be,

00:03:54.188 --> 00:03:56.508
which would mean Y equals zero;

00:03:56.508 --> 00:04:00.388
or it would be the case
the Y plus two equals zero,

00:04:00.388 --> 00:04:03.866
which would mean that Y
is equal to negative two.

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:05.868
So that's the first
situation where we plug in

00:04:05.868 --> 00:04:07.068
X equals zero.

00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:09.308
Now alternatively, there's the possibility

00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:13.746
that Y equals one, so we
could say Y equals one;

00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:16.588
and what that gives us
in the entire equation,

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:18.306
we still have that three X squared

00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:21.348
because we're kind of solving
for X now, three X squared,

00:04:21.348 --> 00:04:23.468
and then the rest of
it becomes, let's see,

00:04:23.468 --> 00:04:25.028
minus three times one squared,

00:04:25.028 --> 00:04:28.066
so minus three, we're
plugging in one for Y

00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:31.706
then we subtract off six,
plugging in that one for Y again,

00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:35.866
and that whole thing is
equal to three X squared

00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:38.428
then minus three minus six.

00:04:38.428 --> 00:04:40.761
So I'm subtracting off nine.

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.588
So from here, I can
factor out a little bit,

00:04:43.588 --> 00:04:47.755
and this will be three multiplied
by X squared minus three.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:53.308
And what that implies then,
since this whole thing

00:04:53.308 --> 00:04:56.390
has to equal zero, what that
implies is that X squared

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.470
minus three is equal to zero
so we have X is equal to

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.720
plus or minus the square root of three.

00:05:05.068 --> 00:05:06.310
And maybe I should kind of specify,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.390
these are distinct things that we found.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.670
One of them was in the
circumstance where X equals zero,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.470
and then the other was where
we found in the circumstance

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.390
where Y equals one.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.070
So this give us a grand
total of three different

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.830
critical points because
in the first situation,

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.070
where X equals zero, the
critical point that we have,

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.990
well, both of them are going to have

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.630
an X coordinate of zero in
them, X coordinate of zero;

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.632
and the two corresponding
Y coordinates are zero

00:05:30.632 --> 00:05:31.672
or negative two.

00:05:31.672 --> 00:05:34.422
So you have zero or negative two.

00:05:35.312 --> 00:05:37.152
There's kind of two possibilities.

00:05:37.152 --> 00:05:39.192
And then there's another
two possibilities here,

00:05:39.192 --> 00:05:42.032
where if Y is equal to one,

00:05:42.032 --> 00:05:43.870
when Y is equal to one,

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.552
we'll have X as positive or
negative square root of three.

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:49.072
So we have positive square
root of three and Y equals one,

00:05:49.072 --> 00:05:52.752
and then we have negative
square root of three

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:54.910
and Y equals one.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.472
So these, these are the critical points,

00:05:58.472 --> 00:05:59.805
critical points,

00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:03.832
which basically means
all partial derivatives

00:06:03.832 --> 00:06:05.352
are equal to zero.

00:06:05.352 --> 00:06:07.710
In then in the next video, I
will classify each of these

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.960
critical points using the
second partial derivative test.
