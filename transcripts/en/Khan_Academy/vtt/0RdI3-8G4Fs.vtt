00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome back.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.980
In this presentation, I
actually want to show you how

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.730
we can use the antiderivative
to figure out the

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.340
area under a curve.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.695
Actually I'm going to focus
more a little bit more

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:10.770
on the intuition.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.960
So let actually use an
example from physics.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.640
I'll use distance and velocity.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.550
And actually this could be a
good review for derivatives,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.590
or actually an application
of derivatives.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.610
So let's say that I
described the position

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.500
of something moving.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.160
Let's say it's x.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.520
Let's say that x is equal to,
I don't know, 16t squared.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.850
Right?

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.880
So s is distance.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.120
Let me write this
in the corner.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.220
I don't know why the
convention is to use s as

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.250
the variable for distance.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.400
One would think, well actually,
I know, why won't they use d?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.740
Because d is the letter used
for differential, I guess.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.800
So s is equal to distance,
and then t is equal to time.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.580
So this is just a formula that
tells us the position, kind of

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.210
how far has something
gone, after x many, let's

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.140
say, seconds, right?

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.620
So after like, 4 seconds, we
would have gone, let's say

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.750
the distance is in feet,
this is in seconds.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.690
After 4 seconds, we would
have gone 256 feet.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.660
That's all that says.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.250
And let me graph that as well.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.120
Graph it.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.620
That's a horrible line.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.430
Have to use the line tool,
might have better luck.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.730
It's slightly better.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.110
Actually, let me undo that too,
because I just want to do

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.200
it for positive t, right?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.480
Because you can't really
go back in time.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.340
For the purposes of this
lecture, you can't

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.520
go back in time.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.810
So that'll have to do.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.820
So this curve will essentially
just be a parabola, right?

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.720
It'll look something like this.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.790
So actually, if you
look at it, I mean you

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.100
could just eyeball it.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.590
The object, every second you
go, it's going a little

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.410
bit further, right?

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.990
So it's actually accelerating.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.880
And so what if we wanted to
figure out what the velocity

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.960
of this object, right?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.580
This is, let's see, this
is d, this is t, right?

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.630
And this is, I don't know
if it's clear, but this is

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.780
kind of 1/2 a parabola.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.900
So this is the
distance function.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.330
What would the velocity be?

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.170
Well the velocity is
just, what's velocity?

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.590
It's distance divided
by time, right?

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.490
And since this velocity
is always changing, we

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.570
want to figure out the
instantaneous velocity.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.620
And that's actually one of the
initial uses of what made

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.930
derivatives so useful.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.430
So we want to find the change,
the instantaneous change

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.450
with respect to time of
this formula, right?

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.350
Because this is the
distance formula.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.410
So if we know the instant rate
of change of distance with

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.310
respect to time, we'll
know the velocity, right?

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:02.040
So ds, dt, is equal to?

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.550
So what's the derivative here?

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.280
It's 32t, right?

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.320
And this is the velocity.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.660
Maybe I should switch back
to, let me write that,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.360
v equals velocity.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.880
I don't know why I switched
colors, but I'll stick

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.250
with the yellow.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.510
So let's graph this function.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.680
This will actually be a fairly
straightforward graph to draw.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.270
It's pretty straight.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.160
And then we draw the x-axis.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.390
I'm doing pretty good.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.790
OK.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:56.370
So this, I'll draw it in
red, this is this going

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.420
to be a line, right?

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.450
32t it's a line with slope 32.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.530
So it's actually a
pretty steep line.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.640
I won't draw it that steep
because I'm going to use

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.880
this for an illustration.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.855
So this is the velocity.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.580
This is velocity.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.330
This is that graph, and
this is distance, right?

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.970
So in case you hadn't learned
already, and maybe I'll do a

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.470
whole presentation on kind of
using calculus for physics, and

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.000
using derivatives for physics.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.460
But if you have to distance
formula, it's derivative

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.730
is just velocity.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.830
And I guess if you view
it the other way, if you

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.920
have the velocity, it's
antiderivative is distance.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.800
Although you won't know
where, at what position,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.770
the object started.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.080
In this case, the object
started at position of 0,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.420
but it could be, you know,
at any constant, right?

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.210
You could have started
here and then curved up.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.140
But anyway, let's just
assume we started at 0.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.170
So the derivative of distance
is velocity, the antiderivative

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.350
of velocity is distance.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.020
Keep that in mind.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.130
Well let's look at this.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.880
Let's assume that we were
only given this graph.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.520
And we said, you know,
this is the graph of the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.850
velocity of some object.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.930
And we want to figure out what
the distance is after, you

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.220
know, t seconds, right?

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.340
So this is the t-axis, this
is the velocity axis, right?

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.490
So let's say we were only given
this, and let's say we didn't

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.590
know that the antiderivative of
the velocity function is

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.250
the distance function.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.340
How would we figure out, how
would we figure out what

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.360
the distance would be
at any given time?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.530
Well let's think about it.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.080
If we have a constant, this
red is kind of bloody.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.150
Let me switch to
something more pleasant.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.340
If we have, over any small
period of time, right, or if we

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.090
have a constant velocity, when
you have a constant velocity,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.990
distance is just velocity
times time, right?

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.030
So let's say we had
a very small time

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.090
fragment here, right?

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.190
I'll draw it big, but let's
say this time fragment

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.640
it is really small.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.330
And let's called this very
small time fragment, let call

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.480
this delta t, or dt actually.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.120
The way I've used dt is like,
it's like a change in time

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.040
that's unbelievably
small, right?

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.490
So it's like almost
instantaneous, but not quite.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.410
Or you can actually view
it as instantaneous.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.710
So this is how much
time goes by.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.390
You can kind of view this as
a very small change in time.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.040
So if we have a very small
change of time, and over that

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.510
very small change in time,
we have a roughly constant

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.500
velocity, let's say the roughly
constant velocity is this.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.600
Right, this is the velocity, so
say we had over this very small

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.210
change in time, we have this
roughly constant velocity

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.210
that's on this graph.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.720
Actually, let me
take do it here.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.400
We have this roughly
constant velocity.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.870
So the distance that the object
travels over the small time

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.650
would be the small time
times the velocity, right?

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.150
It would be whatever the value
of this red line is, times the

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.340
width of this distance, right?

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.230
So what's another way?

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.950
Visually I kind of did
it ahead of time, but

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.900
what's happening here?

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.120
If I take this change in time,
right, which is kind of the

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.890
base of this rectangle, and I
multiply it times the velocity

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.750
which is really just the height
of this rectangle, what

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.510
have I figured out?

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.790
Well I figured out the area
of this rectangle, right?

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.390
Right, the velocity this
moment, times the change in

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.040
time at this moment, is
nothing but the area of

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.130
this very skinny rectangle.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.210
Skinny and tall, right?

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.080
It's almost infinitely skinny,
but it's, we're assuming for

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.040
these purposes it has some very
notional amount of width.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.990
So there we figured out the
area of this column, right?

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.510
Well, if we wanted to figure
out the distance that you

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:50.960
travel after, let's say, you
know, I don't know, let's say

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.010
t, let's say t sub
nought, right?

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.710
This is just a particular t.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.980
After t sub nought
seconds, right?

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.840
Well then, all we would have to
do is, we would have to just

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.010
figure, we would just do
a bunch of dt's, right?

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.900
You'd do another one here,
you'd figure out the area of

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.630
this column, you'd figure out
the area of this column, the

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.490
area of this column, right?

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.970
Because each of these areas
of each of these columns

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.690
represents the distance
that the object travels

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.610
over that dt, right?

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.506
So if you wanted to know how
far you traveled after t sub

00:08:28.506 --> 00:08:33.340
zero seconds, you'd essentially
get, or an approximation would

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.210
be, the sum of all
of these areas.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.110
And as you got more and more,
as you made the dt's smaller

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.430
and smaller, skinnier,
skinnier, skinnier.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.810
And you had more and more and
more and more of these

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.930
rectangles, then your
approximation will get pretty

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.700
close to, well, two things.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.320
It'll get pretty close to, as
you can imagine, the area

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.230
under this curve, or
in this case a line.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:01.870
But it would also get you
pretty much the exact amount

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.720
of distance you've traveled
after t sub nought seconds.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.410
So I think I'm running into the
ten minute wall, so I'm just

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.600
going to pause here, and I'm
going to continue this in

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.280
the next presentation.
