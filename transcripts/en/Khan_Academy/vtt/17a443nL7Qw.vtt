00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.740
Solve for x plus 8 is
less than or equal to 6

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.700
and graph the solution.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.480
So we have x plus 8 is
less than or equal to 6.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.810
So let's solve this
inequality for x.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.724
And the easiest way to isolate
an x on-- let's isolate

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:20.390
on the left-hand side
since it's already

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.130
there-- is to just
get rid of this 8.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.046
And the best way to get
rid of this positive 8

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:27.640
is to subtract 8 from both
sides So let's subtract 8

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.480
from both sides.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.795
That won't change the
direction of the inequality.

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:34.210
So the left-hand side--
x plus 8 minus 8.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.690
And you're just left with an x.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.350
The right-hand side-- 6
minus 8 is negative 2.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.910
And we still have the
less than or equal.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.260
So we solved the inequality.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.440
We have x is less than
or equal to negative 2.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.940
So let's draw that
on a number line.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.900
So that's my number line.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.440
Let's stick 0 over here.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.370
Maybe if we go 1,
and then we could

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.800
go negative 1,
negative 2, negative 3.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.612
And we could keep
going to the left.

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:02.070
And we want all of
the x's that are

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.610
less than or equal
to negative 2.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.690
Since it can be
equal to negative 2,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.850
we'll put a filled-in line
right here at negative 2,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.190
and all of the values
less than that.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.777
If it was just less than, if
there wasn't the equal sign,

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:17.860
we would have an open dot.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.890
But since this is
less than or equal to,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.390
we've closed this dot.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.620
And then we want all of
the values below that.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.380
And you could just sample a
few and verify for yourself

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.280
that they work.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.010
Based on this,
negative 3 should work.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.200
And if you took negative
3-- negative 3 plus 8

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.590
is 5, which is definitely
less than 6, so that works.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.870
And negative 1 shouldn't work.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.710
It's not included in
this set over here.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.160
So let's try that out.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.330
Negative 1 plus 8 is 7, which
is definitely not less than 6.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.150
So just sampling
some points, it seems

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.820
like we've got the
right solution.
