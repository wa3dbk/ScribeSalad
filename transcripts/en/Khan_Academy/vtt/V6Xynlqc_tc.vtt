00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.430
We're asked to convert these
linear equations into

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.870
slope-intercept form and then
graph them on a single

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.740
coordinate plane.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.590
We have our coordinate
plane over here.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.720
And just as a bit of a review,
slope-intercept form is a form

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.910
y is equal to mx plus b,
where m is the slope

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.510
and b is the intercept.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.050
That's why it's called
slope-intercept form.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.020
So we just have to algebraically
manipulate these

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.440
equations into this form.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.540
So let's start with line A,
so start with a line A.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.230
So line A, it's in standard form
right now, it's 4x plus

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.570
2y is equal to negative 8.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.160
The first thing I'd like to do
is get rid of this 4x from the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.880
left-hand side, and the best way
to do that is to subtract

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.460
4x from both sides
of this equation.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.420
So let me subtract 4x
from both sides.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.880
The left hand side of the
equation, these two 4x's

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.440
cancel out, and I'm just left
with 2y is equal to.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.480
And on the right-hand side I
have negative 4x minus is 8,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.430
or negative 8 minus 4, however
you want to do it.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.890
Now we're almost at
slope-intercept form.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.330
We just have to get rid of this
2, and the best way to do

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.770
that that I can think of is
divide both sides of this

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.220
equation by 2.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.250
So let's divide both
sides by 2.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.190
So we divide the left-hand side
by 2 and then divide the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.700
right-hand side by 2.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.750
You have to divide
every term by 2.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.980
And then we are left with y is
equal to negative 4 divided by

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.540
2 is negative 2x.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.070
Negative 8 divided by
2 is negative 4,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.480
negative 2x minus 4.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.900
So this is line A, let me
graph it right now.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.420
So line A, its y-intercept
is negative 4.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.100
So the point 0, negative
4 on this graph.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.790
If x is equal to 0, y is going
to be equal to negative 4, you

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.150
can just substitute
that in the graph.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.330
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.979
That's the point
0, negative 4.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.300
That's the y-intercept
for line A.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.770
And then the slope
is negative 2x.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.830
So that means that if I change
x by positive 1 that y goes

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.150
down by negative 2.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.460
So let's do that.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.250
So if I go over one in the
positive direction, I have to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.870
go down 2, that's what a
negative slope's going to do,

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.920
negative 2 slope.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.750
If I go over 2, I'm going
to have to go down 4.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.460
If I go back negative 1, so
if I go in the x direction

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.540
negative 1, that means in the y
direction I go positive two,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.620
because two divided by negative
one is still negative

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.850
two, so I go over here.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.390
If I go back 2, I'm
going to go up 4.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.300
Let me just do that.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.490
Back 2 and then up 4.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.120
So this line is going
to look like this.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.160
Do my best to draw it,
that's a decent job.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.550
That is line A right there.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.710
All right, let's do line B.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.310
So line B, they say 4x is equal
to negative 8, and you

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.850
might be saying hey, how do I
get that into slope-intercept

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.040
form, I don't see a y.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.190
And the answer is you won't be
able to because you this can't

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.900
be put into slope-intercept
form, but we can simplify it.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.240
So let's divide both sides
of this equation by 4.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.060
So you divide both sides
of this equation by 4.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.680
And you get x is equal
to negative 2.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.520
So this just means, I don't care
what your y is, x is just

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.190
always going to be equal
to negative 2.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.110
So x is equal to negative 2 is
right there, negative 1,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.850
negative 2, and x is just always
going to be equal to

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:59.620
negative 2 in both directions.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.180
And this is the x-axis,
that's the y-axis, I

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.660
forgot to label them.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.880
Now let's do this last
character, 2y is equal to

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.630
negative eight.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.310
So line C, we have 2y is
equal to negative 8.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.980
We can divide both sides of this
equation by 2, and we get

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.570
y is equal to negative 4.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.020
So you might say hey, Sal, that
doesn't look like this

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.130
form, slope-intercept
form, but it is.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.580
It's just that the slope is 0.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.960
We can rewrite this as y is
equal to 0x minus 4, where the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.260
y-intercept is negative
4 and the slope is 0.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.810
So if you move an arbitrary
amount in the x direction, the

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.570
y is not going to change,
it's just going to

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.760
stay at negative 4.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.760
Let me do a little bit neater.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.450
y is just going to stay
at negative 4.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.710
Or you can just interpret it as
y is equal to negative 4 no

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.950
matter what x is.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.490
So then we are done.
