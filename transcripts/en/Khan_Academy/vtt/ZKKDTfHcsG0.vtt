00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
 

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.160
Write the prime factorization
of 75.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.390
Write your answer using
exponential notation.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.970
So we have a couple of
interesting things here.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.410
Prime factorization, and they
say exponential notation.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.460
We'll worry about the
exponential notation later.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.560
So the first thing we have to
worry about is what is even a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.380
prime number?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.240
And just as a refresher, a
prime number is a number

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.130
that's only divisible by itself
and one, so examples of

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.880
prime numbers-- let me write
some numbers down.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.030
Prime, not prime.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.760
 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.840
So 2 is a prime number.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.850
It's only divisible
by 1 and 2.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.490
3 is another prime number.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.790
Now, 4 is not prime,
because this is

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.790
divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.580
We could keep going.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.220
5, well, 5 is only divisible
by 1 and 5, so 5 is prime.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.920
6 is not prime, because it's
divisible by 2 and 3.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.590
I think you get the
general idea.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.160
You move to 7, 7 is prime.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.470
It's only divisible
by 1 and 7.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.220
8 is not prime.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.440
9 you might be tempted to say
is prime, but remember, it's

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.420
also divisible by 3,
so 9 is not prime.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.970
Prime is not the same thing
as odd numbers.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.400
Then if you move to 10,
10 is also not prime,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.560
divisible by 2 and 5.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.220
11, it's only divisible
by 1 and 11, so 11 is

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.240
then a prime number.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.780
And we could keep going
on like this.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.570
People have written computer
programs looking for the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.260
highest prime and all of that.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.220
So now that we know what
a prime is, a prime

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.240
factorization is breaking up
a number, like 75, into a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.620
product of prime numbers.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.180
So let's try to do that.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.530
So we're going to start with
75, and I'm going to do it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.080
using what we call a
factorization tree.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.750
So we first try to find just the
smallest prime number that

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.890
will go into 75.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.430
Now, the smallest prime
number is 2.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.390
Does 2 go into 75?

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.705
Well, 75 is an odd number, or
the number in the ones place,

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:02.280
this 5, is an odd number.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.580
5 is not divisible by 2, so
2 will not go into 75.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.090
So then we could try 3.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.639
Does 3 go into 75?

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.440
Well, 7 plus 5 is 12.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.480
12 is divisible by 3, so
3 will go into it.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.440
So 75 is 3 times
something else.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.990
And if you've ever dealt with
change, you know that if you

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.890
have three quarters, you have
75 cents, or if you have 3

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.930
times 25, you have 75.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.560
So this is 3 times 25.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.720
And you can multiply this out
if you don't believe me.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960
Multiple out 3 times 25.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.470
Now, is 25 divisible by--
you can give up on 2.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.910
If 75 wasn't divisible by 2,
25's not going to be divisible

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.000
by 2 either.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.730
But maybe 25 is divisible
by 3 again.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.290
So if you take the digits
2 plus 5, you get 7.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.700
7 is not divisible by 3, so 25
will not be divisible by 3.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.480
So we keep moving up: 5.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.430
Is 25 divisible by 5?

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.980
Well, sure.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.590
It's 5 times 5.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.330
So 25 is 5 times 5.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.730
And we're done with our prime
factorization because now we

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.390
have all prime numbers here.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.270
So we can write that 75
is 3 times 5 times 5.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.640
So 75 is equal to 3
times 5 times 5.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.350
We can say it's 3 times 25.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.400
25 is 5 times 5.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.370
3 times 25, 25 is 5 times 5.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.460
So this is a prime
factorization, but they want

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.690
us to write our answer using
exponential notation.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.560
So that just means, if we have
repeated primes, we can write

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.920
those as an exponent.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.480
So what is 5 times 5?

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.380
5 times 5 is 5 multiplied
by itself two times.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.310
This is the same thing as
5 to the second power.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.380
So if we want to write our
answer using exponential

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.420
notation, we could say this is
equal to 3 times 5 to the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.110
second power, which is the
same thing as 5 times 5.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.934
