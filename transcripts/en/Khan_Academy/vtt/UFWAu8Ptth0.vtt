00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.200
We'll now move from the world
of first order differential

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.400
equations to the world
of second order

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.280
differential equations.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.800
And what does that mean?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.450
That means that we're now going
to start involving the

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.600
second derivative.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.510
And the first class that I'm
going to show you-- and this

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.360
is probably the most useful
class when you're studying

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.990
classical physics-- are
linear second order

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.080
differential equations.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.150
So what is a linear second order
differential equation?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.210
I think I touched on it a little
bit in our very first

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.760
intro video.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.820
But it's something that
looks like this.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.270
If I have a of x-- so some
function only of x-- times the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.110
second derivative of y, with
respect to x, plus b of x,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.420
times the first derivative of
y, with respect to x, plus c

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.200
of x, times y is equal to some
function that's only a

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.140
function of x.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.760
So just to review our
terminology, y is the second

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.910
order because the highest
derivative here is the second

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.170
derivative, so that makes
it second order.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.220
And what makes it linear?

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.770
Well all of the coefficients
on-- and I want to be careful

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950
with the term coefficients,
because traditionally we view

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.760
coefficients as always being
constants-- but here we have

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.880
functions of x as
coefficients.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.550
So in order for this to be a
linear differential equation,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.120
a of x, b of x, c of x and d
of x, they all have to be

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.770
functions only of x, as
I've drawn it here.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.580
And now, before we start
trying to solve this

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.730
generally, we'll do a special
case of this, where a, b, c

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.190
are constants and d is 0.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.890
So what will that look like?

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.100
So I can just rewrite that as
A-- so now A is not a function

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.790
anymore, it's just a number-- A
times the second derivative

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.070
of y, with respect to x, plus B
times the first derivative,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.230
plus C times y.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.600
And instead of having just a
fourth constant, instead of d

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.670
of x, I'm just going to
set that equal to 0.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.090
And by setting this equal to 0,
I have now introduced you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.010
to the other form
of homogeneous

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.180
differential equation.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.890
And this one is called
homogeneous.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.490
And I haven't made the
connection yet on how these

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.830
second order differential
equations are related to the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.200
first order ones that I just
introduced-- to these other

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.130
homogeneous differential
equations I introduced you to.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.720
I think they just happen to
have the same name, even

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.700
though they're not
that related.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.350
So the reason why this one is
called homogeneous is because

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.920
you have it equal to 0.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.750
So this is what makes
it homogeneous.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.250
And actually, I do see more of a
connection between this type

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.000
of equation and milk where all
the fat is spread out, because

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.320
if you think about it, the
solution for all homogeneous

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.295
equations, when you kind of
solve the equation, they

00:03:03.295 --> 00:03:04.240
always equal 0.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.010
So they're homogenized, I guess
is the best way that I

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.950
can draw any kind of parallel.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.390
So we could call this a second
order linear because A, B, and

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.290
C definitely are functions just
of-- well, they're not

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.310
even functions of x or y,
they're just constants.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.445
So second order linear
homogeneous-- because they

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:28.800
equal 0-- differential
equations.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.420
And I think you'll see that
these, in some ways, are the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.240
most fun differential
equations to solve.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.470
And actually, often the most
useful because in a lot of the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.760
applications of classical
mechanics, this is all you

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.420
need to solve.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.820
But they're the most fun to
solve because they all boil

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.660
down to Algebra II problems.
And I'll touch

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.960
on that in a second.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.660
But let's just think about
this a little bit.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.180
Think about what the
properties of these

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.130
solutions might be.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.870
Let me just throw
out something.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:01.500
Let's say that g of
x is a solution.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.650
So that means that A times g
prime prime, plus B times g

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.839
prime, plus C times
g is equal to 0.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.550
Right?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.200
These mean the same thing.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.490
Now, my question to you is,
what if I have some

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.040
constant times g?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.170
Is that still a solution?

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.620
So my question is, let's say
some constant c1 gx-- c1 times

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.860
g-- is this a solution?

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.560
Well, let's try it out.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.610
Let's substitute this into
our original equation.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.770
So A times the second derivative
of this would just

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.000
be-- and I'll switch colors
here; let me switch to brown--

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.970
so A times the second derivative
of this would be--

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.770
the constant, every time you
take a derivative, the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.900
constant just carries over-- so
that'll just be A times c1

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.640
g prime prime, plus-- the
same thing for the first

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:14.190
derivative-- B times c1 g prime,
plus C-- and this C is

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.430
different than the
c1 c-- times g.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.360
And let's see whether
this is equal to 0.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.190
So we could factor out that c1
constant, and we get c1 times

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:37.130
Ag prime prime, plus
Bg prime, plus Cg.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.460
And lo and behold,
we already know.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.950
Because we know that g of
x is a solution, we know

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.130
that this is true.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.080
So this is going to
be equal to 0.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.440
Because g is a solution.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.060
So if this is 0, c1 times 0
is going to be equal to 0.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.610
So this expression up here
is also equal to 0.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.870
Or another way to view it is
that if g is a solution to

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.720
this second order linear
homogeneous differential

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.790
equation, then some constant
times g is also a solution.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.770
So this is also a solution to
the differential equation.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.840
And then the next property I
want to show you-- and this is

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.110
all going someplace,
don't worry.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.410
The next question I want to ask
you is, OK, we know that g

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.010
of x is a solution to the
differential equation.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.510
What if I were to also
tell you that h

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.090
of x is also a solution?

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:42.700
So my question to you is, is g
of x plus h of x a solution?

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.330
If you add these two functions
that are both solutions, if

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.400
you add them together, is that
still a solution of our

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.970
original differential
equation?

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.150
Well, let's substitute this
whole thing into our original

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.090
differential equation, right?

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.620
So we'll have A times
the second

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.430
derivative of this thing.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.590
Well, that's straightforward
enough.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.580
That's just g prime prime, plus
h prime prime, plus B

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.500
times-- the first derivative of
this thing-- g prime plus h

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:25.370
prime, plus C times-- this
function-- g plus h.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.200
And now what can we do?

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.880
Let's distribute all
of these constants.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:34.440
We get A times g prime prime,
plus A times h prime prime,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.320
plus B times the first
derivative of g, plus B times

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.270
the first derivative of
h, plus C times g,

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.510
plus C times h.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.350
And now we can rearrange them.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.580
And we get A-- let's take this
one; let's take all the g

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.140
terms-- A times the second
derivative of g, plus B times

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.930
the first derivative, plus C
times g-- that's these three

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:07.090
terms-- plus A times the second
derivative of h, plus B

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:12.040
times the first derivative,
plus C times h.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.890
And now we know that both g
and h are solutions of the

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.130
original differential
equation.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:21.390
So by definition, if g is a
solution of the original

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.350
differential equation, and this
was the left-hand side of

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.850
that differential equation, this
is going to be equal to

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:32.520
0, and so is this going
to be equal to 0.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.429
So we've shown that this whole
expression is equal to 0.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.789
So if g is a solution of the
differential equation-- of

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.480
this second order linear
homogeneous differential

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.110
equation-- and h is also a
solution, then if you were to

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.720
add them together, the sum of
them is also a solution.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.070
So in general, if we show that
g is a solution and h is a

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.820
solution, you can add them.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.490
And we showed before that
any constant times

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.020
them is also a solution.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.590
So you could also say that some
constant times g of x

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:10.270
plus some constant times h
of x is also a solution.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.150
And maybe the constant
in one of the

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.560
cases is 0 or something.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.290
I don't know.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:19.350
But anyway, these are useful
properties to maybe

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.290
internalize for second order
homogeneous linear

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.560
differential equations.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.600
And in the next video, we're
actually going to apply these

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.660
properties to figure out the
solutions for these.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.190
And you'll see that they're
actually straightforward.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.690
I would say a lot easier than
what we did in the previous

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.070
first order homogeneous
difference equations, or the

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.020
exact equations.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.310
This is much, much easier.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.550
I'll see you in the
next video.
