00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.940
Add and simplify the answer and
write as a mixed number.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.490
So we have two mixed
numbers here.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.700
We have a whole number part
and a fraction part.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.430
We need to add them.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.660
Now, there's two ways
to do this.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.680
You could convert both of these
into improper fractions,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.800
then add them, and then
convert that back

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.290
into a mixed number.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.720
Or you could just look at this
and say, well, you know what?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:28.630
17 and 2/9 is the exact same
thing as 17 plus 2/9, and then

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:38.640
5 and 1/9 is the exact same
thing as 5 plus 1/9, so 17 2/9

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.550
plus 5 and 1/9 is the same
thing as 17 plus

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.260
2/9 plus 5 plus 1/9.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.800
These two statements are
completely equivalent.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.510
And we know that when you're
just adding a bunch of

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.970
numbers, it doesn't matter what
order you do it in, so

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.040
you can swap the order.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.540
So you could say that this is
the same thing as 17 plus 5

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.740
plus 2/9 plus 1/9.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.780
And we could do this
in any order.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.030
And we know what 17 plus 5 is.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.760
We've done that before.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.010
17 plus 5 is 22, so that
part right there is 22.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.470
So we have 22 plus-- now
what is 2/9 plus 1/9?

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.720
Well, they have the same
denominator, so it's going to

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.290
be over 9, and then you
add the numerators.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.040
2 plus 1 is 3.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.540
So it's 22 plus 3/9, but
this can be simplified.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.130
Both the numerator and
the denominator are

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.120
divisible by 3.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.080
Divide the numerator
by 3, you get 1.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.570
Divide the denominator
by 3, you get 3.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.800
So this is 22 plus 1/3, which is
the exact same thing as 22

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.920
and-- let me write it in that
other blue color-- which is

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.805
the exact same thing
as 22 and 1/3.
