00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:11.120
Let's say that I have some set
V that is a subspace in Rn.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.750
And just as a reminder,
what does it mean?

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.960
That's just some set, or some
subset of Rn where if I take

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.680
any two members of that subset--
so let say I take the

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.980
members a and b-- they're both
members my subspace.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.910
By the fact that this is a
subspace, we then know that

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.400
the addition of these two
vectors, or a plus b, is also

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.770
in my subspace.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.655
And this is our closure
under addition.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.180
And by the fact that it's a
subspace, we also know that if

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.010
we multiply any member of our
subspace by a scalar -- so the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.530
fact that those guys are members
of our subspace -- we

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.340
also know that if I pick one
of them, let's say a, and I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.500
multiply a by some scalar, that
this is also going to be

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.400
a member of our subspace.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.190
And we sometimes call this
closure under scalar

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.440
multiplication.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.360
And then a somewhat redundant
statement is that V, well it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030
must contain the zero vector.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.050
And that's true of
all subspaces.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.830
V -- let me write it this
way -- the zero vector

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.355
is a member of V.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.590
And it would be the zero vector
with n components here,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.820
because V is a subspace of Rn.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.350
And why I say that's redundant,
because if I say

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.970
that any multiple of these
vectors is also in V, I could

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.300
just set the scalar
to be equal to 0.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.450
So this statement kind
of takes the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.630
statement into account.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.030
But in a lot of textbooks, they
will always write, oh and

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.080
the zero vector has to
be a member of V.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.430
Although, that's kind of
redundant with the closure

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.020
under scalar multiplication.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.570
Fair enough.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.063
Now, let's say that I also have
some transformation T.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:07.340
It is a mapping, a function,
from Rn to Rm.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.340
What I want to understand, in
this video is, I have a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.140
subspace right here, V.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.600
I want to understand whether
the transformation of the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.030
subspace -- and what
did we call that?

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.020
We called that the image of our
subspace, or our subset,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.840
either way.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.240
The image of V under T.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.890
In the last video, just to kind
of help you visualize it.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.970
How did that work or -- we
had some subset of Rn

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.830
that looked like this.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.280
It was a triangle that looked
something like that.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.120
And that was in Rn, this was
actually in R2, it was a

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.850
triangle that looked something
like that.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.020
And we figured out it's
image under T.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.280
So we went from R2 to R2.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.920
and we had our transformation.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.660
And it ended up looking
something like this.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.352
If I remember it properly.

00:03:03.352 --> 00:03:06.475
It ended up looking like a --
gee, I don't remember it

00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:08.810
fully, but it was like a
triangle that was skewed like

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.660
this, rotated.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.670
So it was a -- actually I think
it was more like -- I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.370
think that's right.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.880
It was rotated a bit clockwise
like that and it was skewed.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.530
But the exact particulars
of that last

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.060
video aren't what matter.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.790
What matters is that you are
able to visualize what an

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.630
image under transformation
means.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.700
It means you take some subset of
R2, all of the vectors that

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.760
define this triangle
right here.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.650
That's some subset of R2.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.010
You transform all of them, and
then you get some subset in

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.260
your codomain.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.560
You could call this the image,
because the transformation of

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.150
that triangle, or if we call
this s, it's equal to the

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.810
transformation of s.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.780
Or you could say it's the image
of-- you can just call

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.560
it the set s, but maybe it helps
you to visualize-- call

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.690
it the image of this
triangle under T.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.310
Or maybe even a neater way of
thinking about it is, this

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.310
triangle-- that skewed, rotated
triangle-- this one is

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.920
the image of this right
triangle under T.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.210
I think that might make
a little bit of

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.850
visual sense to you.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.090
And just as a bit of reminder,
in that last video these

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.790
triangles, these weren't
subspaces.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.900
And just as you could take
scalar multiples of some of

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.220
the vectors that are members of
this triangle, and you'll

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.690
find that they're not going
to be in that triangle.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.500
So this wasn't a subspace, this
was just a subset of R2.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.310
All subsets are not subspaces,
but all subspaces are

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.480
definitely subsets.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.770
Although something can be
a subset of itself.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.600
I don't want to wander
off too much.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.150
But this just helps
you visualize what

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.180
we mean by an image.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:03.500
It means all of the vectors that
are mapped to, from the

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.590
members of your subset.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.670
So I want to know whether
the image of V

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.090
under T is a subspace.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.050
So in order for it to be a
subspace, if I take the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.740
transformation -- let me
find two members of T.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.670
Well clearly if I take the
transformation of any members

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.230
of V, I'm getting members
of the image.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.610
Right?

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.510
So I can write this.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.520
Clearly the transformation of
a and the transformations of

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.230
b, these are both of members
of our images of V under T.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.950
These are both members
of that right there.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:53.180
So my question to you is what
is the transformation of a

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.410
plus the transformation of b?

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.800
And the way I have written this,
these are two arbitrary

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.660
members of our image
of V under T.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.710
Or maybe I should call
it T of capital V.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.710
These are two arbitrary
members.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.090
So what is this equal to?

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.630
Well, we know from our
properties, our definition of

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.770
linear transformations, the sum
of the transformations of

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.110
two vectors is equal to the
transformation of the sum of

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.690
their of vectors.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.060
Now, is the transformation
of a plus b, is

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.130
this a member of TV?

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.310
Is it a member of our image?

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.510
Well, a plus b is a member of V,
and the image contains the

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.810
transformation of all
of the members of V.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.840
So the image contains the
transformation of this guy.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.600
This guy, a plus b
is a member of V.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.490
So you're taking a
transformation of a member of

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.060
V which, by definition, is in
your image of V under T.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.410
So this is definitely true.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.070
Now, let's ask the
next question.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:03.160
If I take a scalar multiple of
some member of my image of V

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.540
under T, or my T of capital
V, right there.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.400
If I take the sum scalar,
what is this equal to?

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.510
By definition for linear
transformation, this is the

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.680
same thing as a transformation
of the

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.910
scalar times the vector.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.030
Now is this going to
be a member of our

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.520
image of V under T?

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.790
Well we know that ca is
definitely in V, right?

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.530
That's from the definition
of a subspace.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.055
This is definitely in V.

00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:35.960
And so, if this is in V, the
transformation of this has to

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.620
be in V's image under T.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.910
So this is in -- this is
also a member of V.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.400
And obviously, you can
set this equal to 0.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.830
The zero vector is a member of
V, so any transformation of --

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.530
if you just put a 0 here, you'll
get the zero vector.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.920
So the zero vector is definitely
-- I don't care

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.970
what this is, if you multiply
it times 0, you are going to

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.190
get the zero vector.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.640
So the zero vector
is definitely

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.690
also a member of TV.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:12.250
So we come on the result that
T -- the image of V under T,

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.700
is a subspace.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.500
Which is a useful result
which we will be able

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.370
to use later on.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.670
But this, I guess, might
naturally lead to the

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.800
question, what if we go --
everything we have been

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.400
dealing with so far have been
subsets, with the case of this

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.659
triangle, or subspaces,
in the case of V.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:42.309
But what if I were to take the
image Rn under T, right?

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:48.550
This is the image
of Rn under T.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.350
Let's think about
what this means.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.200
This means, what do we get when
we take any member of Rn,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.270
what is the set of all
of the vectors?

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.610
Then when we take the
transformation of all of the

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.340
members of Rn, let
me write this.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:06.400
This is equal to the set of the
transformation of all of

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.750
the x's, where each x
is a member of Rn.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.240
So you take each of the members
of Rn and transform

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.020
them, and you create
this new set.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.910
This is the image
of Rn under T.

00:09:21.385 --> 00:09:24.490
Well, there's a couple of ways
you can think of this.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.260
Remember when we defined
-- let's see, T is a

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.680
mapping from Rn to Rm.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.330
We defined this as the domain.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.715
All of the possible inputs
for our transformation.

00:09:39.715 --> 00:09:43.450
And we define this
as the codomain.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.900
And remember I told you that
the codomain is essentially

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.190
part of the definition of
the function or of the

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.110
transformation, and it's the
space that we map to.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.610
It's not necessarily all
of the things that

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.670
we're mapping to.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.350
For example, the image of Rn
under transformation, maybe

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.320
it's all of Rm or maybe it's
some subset of Rn.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.190
The way you can think about it,
and I touched on this in

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.910
that first video, is-- and
they'll never, or at least the

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.000
linear algebra books I looked
at, they didn't specify this--

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.070
but you can kind of view
this as the range of T.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:24.190
These are the actual members
of Rm that T maps to.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.210
That if you take the image of
Rn under T, you are actually

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:35.190
finding-- let's say that
Rm looks like that.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.310
Obviously it will go
in every direction.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.780
And let's say that when
you take-- let me

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.050
draw Rn right here.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.140
And we know that T is a
mapping from Rn to Rm.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.450
But let's say when you take
every element of Rn and you

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.140
map them into Rm, let's say
you get some subset of Rm,

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.300
let's say you get something
that looks like this.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.682
So let me see if I can
draw this nicely.

00:11:01.682 --> 00:11:08.270
So you literally map every point
here, and it goes to one

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:08.860
of these guys.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.200
Or one of these guys can be
represented as a mapping from

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.760
one of these members
right here.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.080
So if you map all of them you
get this subset right here.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:26.040
This subset is, this is
T the image of Rn, the

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.580
image of Rn under T.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.460
And in the terminology that
you don't normally see in

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.790
linear algebra a lot,
you can also kind of

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.830
consider it its range.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.760
The range of T.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.320
Now, this has a special name.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.590
This is called -- and I don't
want you to get confused --

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.480
this is called the image of T.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.880
Image of T.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.480
This might be a little
confusing, image of T.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:57.480
So this is sometimes written
as just im of T.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.580
Now you are a little confused
here, you are like, before

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.010
when we were talking about
subsets, we would call this

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.770
the image of R subset under T.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.430
And that is the correct
terminology when you're

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.400
dealing with a subset.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.920
But when you take, all of
a sudden, the entire n

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.160
dimensional space, and you're
finding that image, we call

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.170
that the image of the actual
transformation.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:27.160
So we can also call this set
right here the image of T.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.980
And now what is the
image of T?

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.020
Well, we know that we can
write any-- and this is

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.990
literally any-- so T is
going from Rn to Rm.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.900
We can write T of x-- we
can write any linear

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.530
transformation like this-- as
being equal to some matrix,

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:51.690
some m by n matrix
times a vector.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.790
And these vectors obviously
are going to be members of

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.810
Rn-- times sum Rn.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.450
And what is this?

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:03.310
So what is the image -- let
me write it in a bunch of

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:12.290
different ways -- what is
the image of Rn under T?

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:17.180
So we could write that as T --
let me write it this way.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:23.780
We could write that as T of Rn,
which is the same thing as

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.130
the image of T.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.820
Notice we're not saying under
anything else, because now

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.200
were saying the image of the
actual transformation.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:39.540
Which we could also write
as the image of T.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.850
Well what are these equal to?

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.610
This is equal to the set of all
the transformations of x.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:53.422
Well all the transformations of
x are going to be Ax where

00:13:53.422 --> 00:13:59.350
x is a member of Rn.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.420
So x is going to be an n-tuple,
where each element

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.770
has to be a real number.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.060
So what is this?

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:12.880
So if we write A-- let
me write my matrix A.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.680
It's just a bunch of column
vectors, a1, a2.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.430
It's going to have n
of these, right?

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.000
Because it has n columns.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.060
And so a times any x is going to
be-- so if I multiply that

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.550
times any x that's
a member of Rn.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.340
I multiply x1, x2, all
the way to xn.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.220
We've seen this multiple,
multiple times.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:41.390
This is equal to x1-- the scalar
x1, times a1, plus x2

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:47.900
times a2, all the way
to plus xn times an.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.200
And we're saying we want the
set of all of these sums of

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.400
these column vectors, where x
can take on any vector in Rn.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.280
Which means that the elements
of x can take on any real

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.730
scalar values.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.010
So the set of all of these is
essentially all of the linear

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.480
combinations of the columns
of a, right?

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.380
Because I can set these guys
to be equal to any value.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.040
So what is that equal to?

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.400
That is equal to, and we
touched on this, or we

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.340
actually talked about this when
we introduced the idea.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:30.670
This is equal to the
column space of A.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:36.570
Or we just denoted it
sometimes as C of A.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.520
So that's a pretty
neat result.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.080
If you take -- it's almost
obvious, I mean it's just I'm

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.950
playing with words a little
bit-- but any linear

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.530
transformation can be
represented as a

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.520
matrix vector product.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.040
And so the image of any linear
transformation, which means

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.460
the subset of its codomain,
when you map all of the

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.280
elements of its domain into
its codomain, this is the

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.530
image of your transformation.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:09.900
This is equivalent to the column
space of the matrix

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.110
that you're transformation
could be represented as.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:18.620
And the column space, of course,
is the span of all the

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:24.790
column vectors of your matrix.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.880
This is just all of the linear
combinations, or the span, of

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.860
all of your column vectors,
which we do right here.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.132
Anyway hope you found that a
little interesting, and you

00:16:33.132 --> 00:16:35.710
will be able to use these
results in the future.
