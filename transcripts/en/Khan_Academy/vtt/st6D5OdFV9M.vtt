00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.490
We spent a good deal of time on
the idea of a null space.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.720
What I'm going to do in this
video is introduce you to a

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.090
new type of space that can be
defined around a matrix, it's

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.930
called a column space.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.770
And you could probably guess
what it means just based on

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.760
what it's called.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.200
But let's say I have
some matrix A.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.600
Let's say it's an
m by n matrix.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.270
So I can write my matrix A and
we've seen this multiple

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.300
times, I can write it as a
collection of columns vectors.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.430
So this first one, second one,
and I'll have n of them.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.110
How do I know that
I have n of them?

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.330
Because I have n columns.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.070
And each of these column
vectors, we're going to have

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.500
how many components?

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.650
So v1, v2, all the way to vn.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.840
This matrix has m rows.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.660
So each of these guys are going
to have m components.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.380
So they're all members of Rm.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.250
So the column space is defined
as all of the possible linear

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.860
combinations of these
columns vectors.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.270
So the column space of A, this
is my matrix A, the column

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780
space of that is all the linear
combinations of these

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.790
column vectors.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.940
What's all of the linear

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.780
combinations of a set of vectors?

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.090
It's the span of
those vectors.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.430
So it's the span of vector
1, vector 2, all the

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.360
way to vector n.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.210
And we've done it before
when we first talked

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.240
about span and subspaces.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.980
But it's pretty easy to show
that the span of any set of

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.980
vectors is a legitimate
subspace.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.180
It definitely contains
the 0 vector.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.760
If you multiply all of these
guys by 0, which is a valid

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.250
linear combination added up,
you'll see that it contains

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.430
the 0 vector.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:54.780
If, let's say that I have some
vector a that is a member of

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.560
the column space of a.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.680
That means it can be represented
as some linear

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.910
combination.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.710
So a is equal to c1 times vector
1, plus c2 times vector

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.320
2, all the way to Cn
times vector n.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.360
Now, the question is, is this
closed under multiplication?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.200
If I multiply a times some new--
let me say I multiply it

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.880
times some scale or s, I'm just
picking a random letter--

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.090
so s times a, is this
in my span?

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.240
Well s times a would be equal
to s c1 v1 plus s c2 v2, all

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.900
the way to s Cn Vn Which is
once again just a linear

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.150
combination of these
column vectors.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.880
So this Sa, would clearly
be a member of the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.950
column space of a.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.650
And then finally, to make sure
it's a valid subspace-- and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.260
this actually doesn't apply just
to column space, so this

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.470
applies to any span.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.700
This is actually a review of
what we've done the past. We

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.000
just have to make sure it's
closed under addition.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.690
So let's say a is a member
of our column space.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.510
Let's say b is also a member
of our column space, or our

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.950
span of all these
column vectors.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:18.150
Then b could be written as b1
times v1, plus b2 times v2,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.470
all the way to Bn times Vn.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.830
And my question is, is a plus b
a member of our span, of our

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.150
column space, the span
of these vectors?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:41.670
Well sure, what's a plus b? a
plus b is equal to c1 plus b1

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:50.420
times v1, plus c2 plus
v2 times v2.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.310
I'm just literally adding
this term to that

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.610
term, to get that term.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.945
This term to this term
to get this term.

00:03:55.945 --> 00:04:01.710
And then it goes all the way
to Bn and plus Cn times Vn.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.710
Which is clearly just
another linear

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.110
combination of these guys.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.530
So this guy is definitely
within the span.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.870
It doesn't have to be
unique to a matrix.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.200
A matrix is just really just
a way of writing a

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.140
set of column vectors.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.029
So this applies to any span.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.700
So this is clearly
a valid subspace.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.800
So the column space of a is
clearly a valid subspace.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.280
Let's think about other ways we
can interpret this notion

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.930
of a column space.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.150
Let's think about it in terms of
the expression-- let me get

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.900
a good color-- if I were to
multiply my-- let's think

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.660
about this.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.470
Let's think about the set of all
the values of if I take my

00:04:50.470 --> 00:05:00.790
m by n matrix a and I multiply
it by any vector x, where x is

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.550
a member of-- remember x has
to be a member of Rn.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.350
It has to have n components in
order for this multiplication

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.070
to be well defined.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.770
So x has to be a member of Rn.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.260
Let's think about
what this means.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.180
This says, look, I can take any
member, any n component

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.840
vector and multiply it by a,
and I care about all of the

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.060
possible products that this
could equal, all the possible

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.830
values of Ax, when I can
pick and choose any

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.380
possible x from Rn.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.630
Let's think about
what that means.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.470
If I write a like that, and if
I write x like this-- let me

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.180
write it a little bit better,
let me write x like this-- x1,

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.680
x2, all the way to Xn.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.320
What is Ax?

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.680
Well Ax could be rewritten as
x1-- and we've seen this

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:09.640
before-- Ax is equal to x1 times
v1 plus x2 times v2, all

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:17.950
the way to plus Xn times Vn.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.200
We've seen this multiple
times.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.980
This comes out of our
definition of

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.190
matrix vector products.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.350
Now if Ax is equal to this,
and I'm essentially saying

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.740
that I can pick any vector x in
Rn, I'm saying that I can

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.590
pick all possible values of the
entries here, all possible

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.400
real values and all possible
combinations of them.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.800
So what is this equal to?

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.290
What is the set of
all possible?

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.420
So I could rewrite this
statement here as the set of

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:57.750
all possible x1 v1 plus x2 v2
all the way to Xn Vn, where

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.300
x1, x2, all the way to Xn, are
a member of the real numbers.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.320
That's all I'm saying here.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.910
This statement is the
equivalent of this.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.590
When I say that the vector x can
be any member of Rn, I'm

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.840
saying that its components
can be any

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.340
members of the real numbers.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.690
So if I just take the set of all
of the, essentially, the

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.320
combinations of these column
vectors where their real

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.570
numbers, where their
coefficients, are members of

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.270
the real numbers.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.010
What am I doing?

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.070
This is all the possible linear
combinations of the

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.740
column vectors of a.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:42.000
So this is equal to the span
v1 v2, all the way to Vn,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.920
which is the exact same thing
as the column space of A.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.930
So the column space of A, you
could say what are all of the

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.170
possible vectors, or the set of
all vectors I can create by

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.860
taking linear combinations of
these guys, or the span of

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.770
these guys.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.300
Or you can view it as, what are
all of the possible values

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.580
that Ax can take on if
x is a member of Rn?

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.010
So let's think about
it this way.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.830
Let's say that I were to tell
you that I need to solve the

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:20.340
equation Ax is equal to-- well
the convention is to write a b

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.590
there-- but let me
put a special b

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.560
there, let me put b1.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.340
Let's say that I need to
solve this equation

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.000
Ax is equal to b1.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.070
And then I were to tell you--
let's say that I were to

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:35.870
figure out the column space of
A-- and I say b1 is not a

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.710
member of the column space of
A So what does that tell me?

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:45.550
That tells me that this right
here can never take on the

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.940
value b1 because all of the
values that this can take on

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.900
is the column space of A.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.000
So if b1 is not in this, it
means that this cannot take on

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.200
the value of b1.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.710
So this would imply that this
equation we're trying to set

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.283
up, Ax is equal to b1,
has no solution.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:18.710
If it had a solution, so let's
say that Ax equals b2 has at

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.960
least one solution.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.150
What does this mean?

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.570
Well, that means that this, for
a particular x or maybe

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.540
for many different x's,
you can definitely

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.110
achieve this value.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.600
For there are some x's that when
you multiply it by a, you

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.660
definitely are able
to get this value.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:46.020
So this implies that b2 is
definitely a member of the

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.480
column space of A.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.000
Some of this stuff on some level
it's almost obvious.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.410
This comes out of
the definition

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.280
of the column space.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.570
The column space is all of the
linear combinations of the

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.740
column vectors, which another
interpretation is all of the

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.260
values that Ax can take on.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.420
So if I try to set Ax to some
value that it can't take on,

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.690
clearly I'm not going to
have some solution.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.120
If I am able to find a solution,
I am able to find

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.590
some x value where Ax is equal
to b2, then b2 definitely is

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.140
one of the values that
Ax can take on.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.580
Anyway, I think I'll
leave you there.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.830
Now that you have at least a
kind of abstract understanding

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.330
of what a column space is.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.080
In the next couple of videos
I'm going to try to bring

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.060
everything together of what we
know about column spaces, and

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.970
null spaces, and whatever else
to kind of understand a matrix

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.280
and a matrix vector product from
every possible direction.
