00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.510
Before we move on, I want to
clarify something that I've

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.490
inadvertently done.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.660
I think I was not exact
with some of the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.550
terminology I used.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.920
So I want to highlight the
difference between two things

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.590
that I've used almost
interchangeably up to this

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.100
point, but now that we are about
to embark on learning

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.260
what voltage is, I think it's
important that I highlight the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.200
difference, because initially,
this can be very confusing.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.430
I remember when I first learned
this, I found I often

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.680
mixed up these words and didn't
quite understand why

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.540
there was a difference.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.280
So the two words are
electrical-- or sometimes

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.580
you'll see electric instead
of electrical.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:49.110
So "electric potential energy"
and "electric potential." I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.380
think even in the last video,
I used these almost

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.630
interchangeably, and I shouldn't
have. I really

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.500
should have always used
electrical or electric

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.390
potential energy.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.850
And what's the difference?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.379
Electrical potential energy is
associated with a charge.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.830
It's associated with a particle
that has some charge.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.390
Only that particle
can have energy.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.520
Electrical potential, or
electric potential, this is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.860
associated with a position.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.170
So, for example, if I have a
charge and I know that it's at

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.720
some point with a given electric
potential, I can

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.590
figure out the electric
potential energy at that point

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.710
by just multiplying actually
this value by the charge.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.970
Let me give you some examples.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.380
Let's say that I have
an infinite

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.740
uniformly charged plate.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.290
So that we don't have to do
calculus, we can have a

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.050
uniform electric field.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.640
Let's say that this
is the plate.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.130
I'll make it vertical just so we
get a little bit of change

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.760
of pace, and let's say it's
positively charged plate.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.170
And let's say that the
electric field

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.010
is constant, right?

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.060
It's constant.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.580
No matter what point we pick,
these field vectors should all

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.156
be the same length because the
electric field does not change

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:12.290
in magnitude it's pushing out,
because we assume when we draw

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.810
field lines that we're using a
test charge with a positive

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.060
charge so it's pushing
outward.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.640
Let's say I have a
1-coulomb charge.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.420
Actually, let me make
it 2 coulombs just

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.320
to hit a point home.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.532
Say I have a 2-coulomb charge
right here, and it's positive.

00:02:33.532 --> 00:02:40.750
A positive 2-coulomb charge, and
it starts off at 3 meters

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.430
away, and I want to bring
it in 2 meters.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.560
I want to bring it in 2 meters,
so it's 1 meter away.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.250
So what is the electric-- or
electrical-- potential energy

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.600
difference between the particle
at this point and at

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.200
this point?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.270
Well, the electrical potential
energy difference is the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.860
amount of work, as we've learned
in the previous two

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.390
videos, we need to apply to this
particle to take it from

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.770
here to here.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.200
So how much work do
we have to apply?

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.290
We have to apply a force that
directly-- that exactly-- we

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.990
assume that maybe this is
already moving with a constant

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.840
velocity, or maybe we have to
start with a slightly higher

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.210
force just to get it moving, but
we have to apply a force

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:34.000
that's exactly opposite the
force provided by Coulomb's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.570
Law, the electrostatic force.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.030
And so what is that force we're
going to have to apply?

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.620
Well, we actually have to know
what the electric field is,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.650
which I have not told you yet.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.220
I just realized that,
as you can tell.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:54.330
So let's say all of these
electric field lines are 3

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.100
newtons per coulomb.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.260
So at any point, what is the
force being exerted from this

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.940
field onto this particle?

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.630
Well, the electrostatic force
on this particle is equal to

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.269
the electric field times the
charge, which is equal to-- I

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.829
just defined the electric field
as being 3 newtons per

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.220
coulomb times 2 coulombs.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.000
It equals 6 newtons.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.940
So at any point, the electric
field is pushing this way 6

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.416
newtons, so in order to push the
particle this way, I have

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:35.930
to completely offset that, and
actually, I have to get it

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.170
moving initially, and I'll
keep saying that.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.570
I just want to hit
that point home.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.690
So I have to apply a force of
6 newtons in the leftward

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.560
direction and I have to apply
it for 2 meters to get the

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.660
point here.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:54.370
So the total work is equal to
6 newtons times 2 meters,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.920
which is equal to 12
newton-meters or 12 joules.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.200
So we could say that the
electrical potential energy--

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.570
and energy is always joules.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.950
The electrical potential energy
difference between this

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.850
point and this point
is 12 joules.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.520
Or another way to say it
is-- and which one

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.530
has a higher potential?

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.140
Well, this one does, right?

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.610
Because at this point, we're
closer to the thing that's

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.170
trying to repel it, so if we
were to just let go, it would

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.530
start accelerating in this
direction, and a lot of that

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.250
energy would be converted to
kinetic energy by the time we

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.480
get to this point, right?

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.520
So we could also say that the
electric potential energy at

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.400
this point right here is 12
joules higher than the

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.480
electric potential energy
at this point.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.680
Now that's potential energy.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.300
What is electric potential?

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.330
Well, electric potential tells
us essentially how much work

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.550
is necessary per unit
of charge, right?

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.220
Electric potential energy was
just how much total work is

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.650
needed to move it from
here to here.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.890
Electric potential says, per
unit charge, how much work

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.340
does it take to move any charge
per unit charge from

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.010
here to here?

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.070
Well, in our example we just
did, the total work to move it

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.780
from here to here
was 12 joules.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.130
But how much work did it take to
move it from there to there

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.500
per charge?

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:29.640
Well, work per charge is equal
to 12 joules for what?

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.280
What was the charge
that we moved?

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.040
Well, it was 2 coulombs.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.520
It equals 6 joules
per coulomb.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.930
That is the electric potential
difference between this point

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:49.760
and this point.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.180
So what is the distinction?

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.150
Electric potential energy was
associated with a particle.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.980
How much more energy did the
particle have here than here?

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.140
When we say electric potential,
because we

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.490
essentially divide by the
size of the particle, it

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.720
essentially is independent of
the size of the particle.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.960
It actually just depends
on our position.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.130
So electric potential, we're
just saying how much more

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.180
potential, irrespective of the
charge we're using, does this

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.240
position have relative
to this position?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.960
And this electric potential,
that's just another way of

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.980
saying voltage, and the unit
for voltage is volts.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.600
So 6 joules per coulomb,
that's the

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.030
same thing as 6 volts.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:42.060
And so if we think of the
analogy to gravitation, we

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.170
said gravitational potential
energy was mgh, right?

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:46.860
This was force.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.040
This was distance, right?

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.970
Electric potential is
essentially the amount of

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.820
gravitational-- if we extend
the analogy, the amount of

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.890
gravitational potential energy
per mass, right?

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:04.500
So if we wanted a quick way of
knowing what the gravitational

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.640
potential is at any point
without having to care about

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.340
the mass, we divide by the
mass, and it would be the

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.130
acceleration of gravity
times height.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.750
Ignore that if it
confused you.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.590
So what is useful
about voltage?

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.650
It tells us regardless of how
small or big or actually

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.170
positive or negative a charge
is, what the difference in

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.980
potential energy would be if
we're at two different points.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.390
So electric potential, we're
comparing points in space.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:37.760
Electric potential energy, we're
comparing charges at

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.330
points in space.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.789
Hopefully, I didn't
confuse you.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.059
In the next video, we'll
actually do a couple of

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.690
problems where we figure out
the electric potential

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.960
difference or the voltage
difference between two points

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.050
in space as opposed
to a charge at two

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.190
different points in space.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.760
I will see you in
the next video.
