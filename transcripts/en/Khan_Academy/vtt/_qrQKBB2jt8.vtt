00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.530
Let's do another stoichiometry
problem where the reaction is

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.570
occurring inside
of a solution.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.550
So we have a metallic zinc and
it reacts with aqueous

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.660
hydrochloric acid.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.270
We see that right there, the
metallic zinc. And then the

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.980
hydrochloric acid is
dissolved in water,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.230
it's an aqueous solution.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.140
The solvent is water.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.310
Makes these products
right there.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.380
And they say, what volume of
0.25 molar-- so they're giving

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.880
us the concentration
of the solution.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.640
What volume of 0.25 molar
hydrochloric acid in

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.190
milliliters-- so we've got to
remember that, they want their

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.850
answer in milliliters-- is
required to convert 11.8 grams

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.910
of zinc completely
to products?

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880
So the way we can do this
we'll figure out.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880
We know that we're
starting off with

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.150
11.8 grams right there.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.880
And we just have to figure out
well, if we have 11.8 grams of

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.950
zinc, how many moles
of zinc that is.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.000
And then, assuming this is a
balanced equation-- and I'm

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.670
going to verify that right after
I finish this sentence--

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.920
but assuming that this is a
balanced equation, for every

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.170
mole of zinc we're going
to need two moles of

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.350
hydrochloric acid.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.480
And then we can figure out
given how many moles of

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.680
hydrochloric acid we need, then
how much of the solution

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.870
do we need based on
its concentration?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.690
So let's do that.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.440
It's going to, I think,
be a lot simpler when

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.350
we actually do it.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.540
But I just want to give you
the action plan before we

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.280
break into it.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.520
But before we do anything,
let's verify that this is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.510
really a balanced equation.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.270
So you have 1 zinc on the
left-hand side, 1 zinc on the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.630
right-hand side, 2 hydrogens
on the left, 2 hydrogens on

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.810
the right, 2 chlorines
on the left, 2

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.140
chlorines on the right.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.200
So it looks balanced.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.490
Let's do the problem.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.220
So the first thing we want to
do-- we're starting off with

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:56.865
11.8 grams of zinc, they give
us that information.

00:01:56.865 --> 00:01:58.650
Now we're going to figure
out how many moles

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.790
of zinc that is.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.215
We're going to want to convert
this to moles.

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:10.479
So it's going to be moles
of zinc over grams of

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.880
zinc moles per gram.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.390
And if you look it up on a
periodic table, zinc has an

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.700
atomic weight of 65.38, so
its molar mass is 65.38.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.100
So it's 1 mole for every 65.38
grams, or its 1/65, roughly,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.260
of a mole per gram.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.180
Actually, you know what?

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.520
I'm just going to save our
calculator for the end.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.970
So the grams of zinc cancels
that with the grams of zinc,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:52.600
and we're left with 11.8 divided
by 65.38 moles of

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.360
zinc.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.880
Now we're trying to figure out
how much of this solution of

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.200
hydrochloric acid is required.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.260
So the next thing we want to
figure out is how many moles

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.000
of hydrochloric acid
are required.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.450
And we see that for every mole
of zinc we need 2 moles of the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.830
hydrochloric acid.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.820
Let me write it this way.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.670
For every 1 mole of zinc--
we'll put that in the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.300
denominator.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.690
I'll switch colors just
arbitrarily here-- we need 2

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.510
moles of hydrochloric acid.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.920
That is required.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.720
And so then we can multiply
the moles of zinc. We'll

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.760
cancel out the moles of zinc.
That's why I wrote

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.530
2/1 instead of 1/2.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.410
Two moles of hydrochloric acid
for every mole of zinc. And

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.240
what does this give us?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.340
This gives us-- I'm not even
going to do the math.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:55.620
It's 11.8 times 2 over 65.38.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.480
And then we're left with moles
of hydrochloric acid

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.060
required-- moles
of hydrochloric

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.230
acid-- HCl-- required.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.820
So we haven't solved
the problem yet.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.530
We want to figure out
what volume of

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.720
the solution we need.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.550
We know the actual number of
molecules we need, but we need

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.170
to know how much solution
will contain

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.519
that number of molecules.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.995
So we want to express
this in liters.

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:23.570
Well, eventually we're going
to get to milliliters, but

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.310
let's just go straight to liters
first because molarity

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.580
is always expressed in liters.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.070
So let's multiply this.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.155
We want the moles of
HCl to cancel out.

00:04:35.155 --> 00:04:40.070
So let's put that in the
denominator, moles of

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.290
hydrochloric acid.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.895
And we want liters of
hydrochloric acid, let me put

00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:53.900
it this way, liters
of 2.50 molar

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.950
hydrochloric acid solution.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.430
When anyone puts this big M
there, that's molarity.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.720
You assume they're talking
about a solution because

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.740
they're giving you the
concentration of the solute in

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.700
the total solution.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.740
So how many moles are
there per liter?

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.260
Well this concentration
is telling us.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.610
Molarity is moles per liter.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:22.810
So there are 2.50 moles for
every 1 liter of our solution.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.720
That's what that tells us.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.050
This is a 2.5 molar solution.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.400
Its molarity is 2.5.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.870
There are 2.52 moles
for every liter.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.030
And I wrote the moles in the
denominator because I wanted

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.900
to cancel out here.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.020
So it's 1/2.5.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.280
So let's cancel those
two guys out.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.120
That cancels out with
that right there.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.470
And then we are left with 11.8
times 2 in the numerator.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:59.890
And in the denominator, we have
65.38 times 2-- let me

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.120
write the times not as
a-- I'll write it

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.690
that way-- times 2.50.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:13.870
And all we're left with in our
units is liters of 2.50 molar

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:20.010
HCl solution-- and then in
that green-- required.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.060
We're almost done.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.620
Then we can get break out
the calculator and

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.320
get the exact answer.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.280
They want the answer
in milliliters.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.180
So far we have the
answer in liters.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.810
I mean, there's going to be some
number here, I don't know

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.480
what it is.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.960
But it's that number of liters
of the 2.5 molar hydrochloric

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.370
acid solution is required.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.275
Let me just copy
and paste this.

00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:46.280
Let's convert this to
milliliters because that's

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.530
what they want.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.930
So that's what we had from
the previous line.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.110
And to convert this to
milliliters-- we've done this

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:01.440
drill before-- we want the
liters to cancel out.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.690
I'll just do it like this.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.870
And we want our answer
in milliliters.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.050
And how many milliliters
are there for a liter?

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.850
Well there are 1,000 milliliters
per 1 liter.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.910
And all of these steps-- the way
I'm showing it to you, I'm

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.270
making the dimensions
cancel out.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.080
But hopefully, they're making
some intuitive sense as well,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.360
that we divide by 2.5 at this
stage because we have more

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.010
than 1 mole per liter.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.090
So however many moles we
require, we're going to have

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.700
fewer liters required.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.930
So we're going to be dividing
by a number that's

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:38.890
greater than 1.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.560
If that doesn't make sense to
you, just stick to the units.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.350
But at every one of these steps
I really want you to

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.770
actually conceptualize
the numbers as well.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.560
But let's go back
to the problem.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.330
So we're converting
it to milliliters.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.860
So our final solution we're left
with, we have the liters.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.420
Cancelling out the liters, and
so we're left with, in the

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:11.460
numerator, 11.8 times 2 times
1,000 over 65.38 times 2.50.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.880
And in the numerator we're left
with milliliters of 2.5

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.920
molar hydrochloric acid.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.760
I'll just write it milliliters
of 2.50 molar

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.980
hydrochloric acid.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.380
I don't want this 2.50 molar
HCl to confuse you.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.960
These aren't numbers in the
computation, this is a label

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.760
to say what type of solution.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.840
We could have just written
over here liters of the

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.370
solution in question.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.250
In case these numbers confuse
you, we could have written

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.893
liters of the solution.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.060
And then this would be
milliliters of the solution.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.900
I don't want that 2.5
to confuse you.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.090
That's just the name of
the solution, or its

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.800
concentration.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.390
That's how we're
identifying it.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.620
But now we've solved
the problem.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:04.020
We just need to calculate this
number, so let's break out the

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.270
calculator.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:17.520
And you get 11.8 times 2 times
1,000 divided by 65.38.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.050
And we're also going
to divide by 2.5.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.210
It's in the denominator,
it's 144.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.080
And actually our lowest-- let's
see, a couple of numbers

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.525
here only have three significant
digits, so we

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.210
should really only stick to
three significant digits, so

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.450
it's 144 milliliters.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:37.570
So this right here is 144
milliliters of, we could say

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.490
the solution, or of
the 2.5 molar

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.070
hydrochloric acid solution.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.930
And we're done.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.060
Hopefully you found that fun.
