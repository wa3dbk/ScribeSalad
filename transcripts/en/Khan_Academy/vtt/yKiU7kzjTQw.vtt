00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.190
We're on test 8, section
5, page 855.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.830
Problem 1.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:15.720
If x over x minus 2 is
equal to 39 over 37,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.520
then what does x equal?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.760
And here you could try to solve
this situation, but

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.130
there's just a pattern here
that you could actually

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.370
identify immediately.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.400
If x is 39, then what
is x minus 2?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.080
x minus 2's going to be 37.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.110
So you could immediately just
try out these numbers.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.920
That just kind of struck
you because 37 is

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.495
two less than 39.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.750
x minus 2 is 2 less than x.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.450
So x must be 39.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.450
You could do that problem
really fast.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420
If you don't understand what I'm
saying you could kind of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.800
solve it with the traditional
method, cross multiply.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.190
You could say 37 times
x, 37x is equal to 39

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.810
times x minus 2.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:04.379
So you get 37x is equal to 39x
minus, what is that, minus 78.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.510
And then you could subtract 39x
from both sides and you

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.990
get minus 2x is equal
to minus 78.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.400
Divide both sides by 2 and
you get x is equal to 39.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.310
But that would have taken
a lot of valuable time.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.040
The first problem with any
section on the SAT, if you

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.900
can't do it in 10 seconds
you might be doing

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.560
it the wrong way.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.690
It's normally a very,
very quick problem.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.610
And that's why this probably
was not the correct

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.250
way of doing it.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.080
You could have just said well
if x is 39, x minus 2 is 37.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.180
Next problem.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.910
Problem 2.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.440
Students in advanced biology
class-- so they have boys,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.990
girls, total.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.570
And then on this side,
this juniors,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.100
seniors, and then total.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:16.730
And then they write-- this is
k, n, m, r, s, t, w, x, z.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.070
In the table above, each letter
represents the number

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.210
of students in that category.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.360
k would be the number of junior
boys in the advanced

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.830
biology class.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.610
Which of the following
must be equal to z?

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.970
So z is the total number
of kids, right?

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.710
So there's a couple of things
that could be equal to z.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.160
It could be w plus x.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.810
That's not a choice.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.280
It could also be m plus t.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.130
But that's not a choice
either, right, m

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.890
plus t isn't a choice.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.990
And the other way is you could
just add up all of the kids

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.120
that are in each of
the categories.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.450
So z is the total
of all the kids.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.930
So if you say the number of
junior boys plus senior boys

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.320
plus junior girls plus senior
girls, so that's k plus

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.740
n plus r plus s.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.750
That's all the students
in the class, right?

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.390
And that must equal z.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.610
And that is choice E.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.860
Next problem.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.450
They have a line
here like that.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.170
And then what do they tell us?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.350
They tell us that this right
here is 25 degrees.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:46.880
This is a, b, c, this is 60
degrees, and this is x.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.990
In the triangle ABC above,
what is the value of x.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.510
This is just the angle game.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.280
So the first thing we want to
figure out is this angle.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.600
And we know that this angle plus
60 is going to be 180,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.750
right, because it's
supplementary.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.980
They kind of combined to form
180 degrees, or they kind of

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.220
created a line to go halfway
around the circle.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.790
So this has to be 120.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.100
Because this plus 60 is 180.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.340
And then we see that 25 plus
120 plus x have to be 180

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.280
because they're all in
the same triangle.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.230
So 25 plus 120 plus x is going
to be equal to 180 as well.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.250
So 145 plus x is equal to 180.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.130
Subtract 145 from both sides.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.620
You get x is equal to 35.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.080
80 minus 45.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.690
Right.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.660
35 and that's choice C.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.910
Next problem.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.040
Problem 4.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.920
The Martin's refrigerator
is broken and will

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.570
cost $300 to fix.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.827
And new energy efficient
refrigerator costing $900, so

00:04:50.827 --> 00:04:54.640
let's say this other
refrigerator costs $900.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.850
It'll save 15 dollars a month
on the electric bill.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.410
If they buy the new refrigerator
in x months, the

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.460
Martin's will have saved an
amount equal to the difference

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.900
between the cost of the new
refrigerator and the cost of

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.800
the old one.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.990
What is the value of x?

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.180
So they're saying that in x
months this new refrigerator--

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.760
they're saying if in x months
the Martin's would have saved

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.580
an amount equal to the
difference between the cost of

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.950
the new refrigerator and the
cost of fixing the old one.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.910
So what's the cost of the
new refrigerator?

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.970
It's $900.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.370
And what's the cost of
fixing the old one?

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.970
It's $300.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.170
So that's the difference between
the cost of fixing the

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.110
new refrigerator and the cost
of fixing the old one.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.220
And they say that that's
how much they will

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.970
have saved in x months.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.700
So they're going to save
that in x months.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.910
They save $15 a month, right?

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.250
So $15 times x months has to be
equal to the difference in

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.850
price, essentially, of
fixing or buying.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.120
And this is a times,
not a minus.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.330
So you get $600 is
equal to 15x.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.240
So x is equal to 600 over 15.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.450
So x is equal to 40-- 15 goes in
60 four times, it goes into

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.920
600 40 times.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.090
So that's choice D.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.140
It takes 40 months for
them to break even.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.900
Next problem.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.040
Problem 5.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.690
The perimeter of an equilateral
triangle ABC is 3

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.860
times the perimeter of an
equilateral triangle DEF.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.040
Let me draw them real fast. This
is one of them, and the

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.290
other one actually is smaller.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:54.350
If I called this one ABC,
this one is DEF.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.690
They say the perimeter of this
one is 3 times this one-- and

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.170
they're both equilateral, right,
so this is x, x, x.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.930
And so we don't know what
these sides are.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.660
But the perimeter of this
one will be 3x-- oh,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.680
then they tell us.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.880
If the perimeter of DEF is
10, what is the length

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.810
of one side of ABC?

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:17.640
So perimeter of triangle
DEF is equal to 10.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.320
And they tell us that
the perimeter of

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.650
ABC is 3 times this.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.150
So that means that the perimeter
of triangle ABC is

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.550
going to be 3 times this,
so it's 30, right?

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.080
So the perimeter of this
triangle is 30 and it's three

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.860
equal sides, so each
side has to be 10.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.620
30 divided by 3.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.290
And that's choice B.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.540
Next problem.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.995
Problem 6.

00:07:49.995 --> 00:07:56.210
A machine mints coins at the
rate of one coin per second.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:02.970
If it does this for 10 hours
each day, approximately how

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:09.600
many days will it take the
machine to mint 360,000 coins?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.860
How many days?

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.880
So let's say how much does
it produce in one day?

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:20.560
So let's see, in one day is
equal to-- so it'll be

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:28.640
producing for 10 hours
per day times how

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.620
many seconds per hour?

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.610
Times 3,600 seconds per hour.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.850
And how did I get 3,600?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.340
60 minutes per hour times 60
seconds per minute, right,

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:46.140
that gives you 3,600 times
one coin per second.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.360
And the units actually
cancel out.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.800
The hours cancel out with
hours, and then you get

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.400
seconds cancel out with seconds,
and you're left with

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.860
coins per day.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:00.330
So that equals 10 times 3,600
is 36, 1, 2, add another 0,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.490
3,600 coins per day.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.690
So the amount of coins I produce
in d days is going to

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:15.680
be 3,600 times d, times
the number of days.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.470
And that we're saying has
to be equal to 360,000.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:28.600
Well immediately let's divide
both sides-- d will be 360,000

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.150
divided by 3,600.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.150
So that's cancels
out with that.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:38.420
You have 360 divided by 36, well
that's just equal to 10.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.600
So it will take 10 days to
produce 360,000 coins, and

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.930
that's choice A.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.780
I'll see you in the
next video.
