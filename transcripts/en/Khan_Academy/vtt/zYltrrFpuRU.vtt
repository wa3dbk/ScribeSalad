00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.050
Welcome back.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.240
I scared you, I'm sure.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.040
I have more energy.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.700
I'm actually fasting
today, but I won't

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.090
go into it too much.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.790
I don't want to go too much into
my personal life, but I

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.900
eat one meal a day now and
I have so much energy.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.220
It's unbelievable.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.870
Hope you don't think I'm crazy,
but it's back to the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.810
SAT videos.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.950
So let's see, we're on
problem number 15.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.750
So I drew it out ahead of time,
because I didn't want to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.810
waste your time because
it's more valuable

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.350
than mine, I think.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.170
Considering I have so much time
now that I only eat one

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.480
meal a day.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:52.720
They say, in the figure above,
triangle PQR is equilateral

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:03.340
and SR and TV intersect
at point P.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.140
What is the value of y?

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.860
So let's just use all the
information they give us.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.190
This is an equilateral
triangle.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.930
So what do you know about
equilateral triangles?

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.270
All the angles in
an equilateral

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.970
triangle are the same.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.690
This is going to be 60 degrees,
this going to be 60

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.090
degrees, and this whole
thing is going to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.410
be 60 degrees, right?

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.950
Well, if this whole thing is
60 degrees, then what's x?

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.860
Well, there's three x's,
and they're equally

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.940
splitting it, right?

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.970
So this is 20 degrees, this is
20 degrees and this is 20

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.220
degrees, right?

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.620
Well, what's equal to angle y?

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.940
From our geometry module, we
know that angle y is equal to

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.275
the opposite angle, right?

00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:47.860
Angle y is going to be equal
to-- so you got to pay close

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.570
attention to which
lines this is.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.060
So that line and that
line, right?

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.010
So the opposite angle
to angle y is this

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.610
angle right here, right?

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.320
So that angle is just two of the
three x's, so it's 20 and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.225
20, so angle y is equal
to 40 degrees.

00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:09.940
It just equals two of
these x degrees.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.060
That's it.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.470
All right, number 16.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.480
Maybe I could do it here with
this kind of toothpaste

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.220
colored ink.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.430
Let the operations triangle and
square be defined for all

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.220
real numbers a and b as follows,
a-- I like these

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:37.420
problems-- a triangle b
is equal to a plus 3b.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:49.985
And then a square b is
equal to a plus 4b.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.330
And then they have this thing.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:16.200
If 4 triangle of 5y is equal
to 5y square 4, what is the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.270
value of y?

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.760
Well this might seem bizarre
to you, but we just have to

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.570
map these functions to-- And
this is just functions in

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.610
disguise, right?

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.980
A function of two variables.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.510
Let's see, so what
is 4 triangle 5y?

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.630
So let's go to the triangle
function.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.940
That's this one, right?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.360
So in this case,
a is 4, right?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.900
Because it's the number before
the triangle, so that's equal

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.020
to 4 plus 3 times b.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.170
Well, what's b?

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.000
b is whatever's after
the triangle, right?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.640
In this case it's 5y.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.030
So 3 times b would
be 3 times 5y.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.190
Let me do some coloring here.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.570
This is just this, right?

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.000
And then if I do the other side
of that-- 5y square 4.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.775
So in this case, 5-- so we're
using the square.

00:04:10.775 --> 00:04:15.400
So in this case 5y
is a, right?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.980
So that equals 5y plus 4b.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.500
And what's b?

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.790
Well, b is whatever's after
the rectangle, right?

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.450
So 4b is 4 times 4.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.370
And now we just solve.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.920
So let's see.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.100
4 times-- 4 plus-- let me just
rewrite that-- 4 plus 3 times

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.980
5 is 15y is equal
to 5y plus 16.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.210
Let's take 4 from both
sides, so you get 15y

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.200
equals 5y plus 12.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.320
Take 5y from both sides, you
get 10y is equal to 12.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.680
y is equal to 12/10, and then
we can reduce that.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.950
Divide the top to bottom by 2,
so y is equal to 6/5, and that

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.820
is our answer.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.640
These are these kind of fill in
the blank ones, so you can

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.980
actually write that--
bubble it in.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.000
The SAT wasn't like that
I when I took it.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.970
Actually, these problems
are really good.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.220
Let's move on.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.680
Number 17.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.840
Let me switch to magenta,
bright magenta.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.990
In the xy-coordinate plane, the
graph of x is equal to y

00:05:46.990 --> 00:06:01.460
squared minus 4 intersects the
line l, at 0 comma p, and the

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.830
point 5 comma t, right?

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.560
These are two points
on the line l.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.200
What is the greatest possible
value of the slope of l?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.130
So this is interesting.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.790
So x is equal to y
squared minus 4.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.640
So, first of all, you need
realize this isn't how you

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.930
normally write a function,
right?

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.545
You normally write it y is
equal to x something.

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:30.495
But, what this is going to look
like-- x plus 4 is equal

00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:37.840
to y squared-- And you don't
have to draw this actually on

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.480
the SAT test. It's going to
take you too much time.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.550
But I think it's useful here
to have a visualization of

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.800
this, right?

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.830
So the graph is going to look
something like this.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.780
It's going to actually
start at minus 4.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.020
It's going to look something
like this,

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.380
the graph-- oh, woops.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.691
I'm still using the line tool.

00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:03.950
The graph is going to look
something like this.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.570
Start back here at minus 4.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.640
I think.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.410
And then the line l-- we can
only assume since it

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.100
intersects it at two points,
it's going to look something

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.650
like this, right?

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.670
Where this could be 0 comma
p, and this is 5 comma t.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.530
What's important to realize is
that both of these points

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.710
satisfy this relationship,
right?

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.720
Because they're on this curve.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.655
So we can do that with
our math, right?

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:40.905
We could write this as
0 comma-- Well, if x

00:07:40.905 --> 00:07:43.360
is 0, what is y?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.900
Well, 0 is equal to
y squared minus 4.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.580
We add 4 to both sides.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.810
Y squared is equal to 4.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.160
So y is equal to plus
or minus 2.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.790
And that's the tricky part,
right? y is equal to

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.040
plus or minus 2.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.360
And then what does this equal?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.800
If x is equal to 5, what is t?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.330
What could this term
right here be?

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:18.490
So let's see, 5 is equal
to y squared minus 4.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.370
y squared is equal to 9.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.815
y is equal to plus or minus 3.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.080
Fascinating.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.770
Actually I drew this
original graph.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.659
Since it's written this way,
since it's not written as a

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.789
square root, it actually
would kind of do

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.039
something like this.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.180
You don't have to draw this.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.870
So anyway.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.600
Plus or minus 3.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.240
So these are the possible
two points we could have

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.120
intersected.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.130
And what the question is
asking is, what is the

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.130
greatest possible value
of the slope of l?

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.460
What we want to figure out--
If we want the greatest

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.170
possible value, we want to go
from a very low number to a

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.350
very high number, right?

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.880
The x values are fixed.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.200
We want as great a possible
change in y, given that change

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.840
in x, right?

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.240
So if we want the lowest
possible value here, we'll go

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.540
with the negative 2.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.100
If we want the highest
possible value of x,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.082
we'll go with 3.

00:09:27.082 --> 00:09:28.320
So let's see.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.940
So if we assume that, the
change in y is 3 minus

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:37.330
negative 2 over change
in x, 5 minus 0.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.050
Adds up, right?

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.830
So this is 3 plus
2 is 5 over 5.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.420
It equals 1.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.170
That is the greatest
possible slope.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.210
I'll see you in the
next video.
