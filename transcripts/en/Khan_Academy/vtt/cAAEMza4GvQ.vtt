00:00:00.832 --> 00:00:02.573
- [Voiceover] So let's compute
the two dimensional curl

00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:03.793
of a vector field.

00:00:03.793 --> 00:00:07.491
The one I have in mind will
have an x component of,

00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:08.931
let's see not nine.

00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:11.431
But y cubed minus nine times y

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:16.153
and then the y component will be x cubed

00:00:16.153 --> 00:00:18.253
minus nine times x.

00:00:18.253 --> 00:00:20.193
You can kind see I'm just
a sucker for symmetry

00:00:20.193 --> 00:00:21.690
when I choose examples.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.166
When I showed in the last video

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.872
how the two dimensional curl,

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:27.372
the 2D curl of a vector field,

00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:33.115
of a vector field v which
is a function of x and y,

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:36.365
is equal to the partial derivative of q,

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:39.698
that second component, with respect to x

00:00:41.113 --> 00:00:45.838
minus the partial derivative
of p that first component,

00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:47.755
with respect to y.

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:49.520
And I went through the
reasoning for why this is true

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.760
but just real quick kinda
the in the nutshell here,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.640
this partial q, partial x
is because of as you move

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.088
from left to right vectors
tend to go from having a small

00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:01.420
or even negative y component
to a positive y component,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.230
that corresponds to
counter clockwise rotation.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.911
And similarly this dp,
dy is because if vectors

00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.764
as you move up and down as you
kind of increase the y value

00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:13.761
go from being positive to zero to negative

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.269
or if they're decreasing
that also corresponds

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:17.720
to counter clockwise rotation.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.810
So taking the negative of that
will tell you whether or not

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.549
changes in the y direction
around your point

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.790
correspond with counter
clockwise rotation.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.189
So in this particular case
when we start evaluating that,

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.103
we start by looking at partial
of q with respect to x.

00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:32.159
So we're looking at the second
component and taking its

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.840
partial derivative with
respect to x and in this case,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.080
nothing but x's show up so
it's just like taking its

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.247
derivative and you get
three x squared minus nine.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:48.761
Three x squared minus nine,
and that's the first part.

00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:51.929
Then we subtract off whatever
the partial derivative of p

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.589
with respect to y is, so we
go up here and it's entirely

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:57.155
in terms of y and trying to
do the symmetry we're just

00:01:57.155 --> 00:02:00.255
taking the same calculation,
three y squared that derivative

00:02:00.255 --> 00:02:02.088
of y cubed minus nine.

00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:08.285
So this right here is
our two dimensional curl.

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:10.444
And lets go ahead and
interpret what this means.

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:12.267
And in fact this vector
field that I showed you

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:14.869
is exactly the one that
I used when I was kind of

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.527
animating the intuition
behind curl to start off with,

00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:19.512
where I had these specific
parts where there is

00:02:19.512 --> 00:02:22.124
positive curl here and
here but negative curl

00:02:22.124 --> 00:02:24.772
up in these clockwise rotating areas.

00:02:24.772 --> 00:02:27.186
So we can actually see
why that's the case here

00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:29.530
and why I chose this specific
function for something

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.750
that'll have lots of good curl examples.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.551
Cause if we look over in that
region where there should be

00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:37.966
positive curl, that's
where x is equal to three

00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:40.067
and y is equal to zero.

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:44.422
So I go over here and say
if x is equal to three,

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:47.922
and y is equal to zero, this whole formula

00:02:48.983 --> 00:02:51.388
becomes let's see, three
times three squared so,

00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:55.079
three times three squared minus nine,

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.899
minus nine and then minus the
quantity now we're plugging

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:03.299
in y here so that's three
times y squared is just zero

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.863
cause y is equal to zero, minus nine.

00:03:06.863 --> 00:03:09.790
Minus nine and so this part is 27,

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.468
that's three times nine is
27 minus nine gives us 18.

00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:16.720
And then we're subtracting
off a negative nine

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.564
so that's actually plus nine
so this whole thing is 27,

00:03:19.564 --> 00:03:22.943
it's actually quite positive,
so this is a positive number

00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:25.289
and that's why when we go
over here and we're looking

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.318
at the fluid flow, you have
a counter clockwise rotation

00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:29.568
in that region.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.102
Whereas, let's say we did
all of this but instead of

00:03:33.102 --> 00:03:36.655
x equals three and y
equals zero, we looked at

00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:40.238
x is equal to zero and
y is equal to three.

00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:43.609
So in that case,

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:48.102
we would instead, so x
equals zero, y equals three,

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:49.866
let's take a look at where that is.

00:03:49.866 --> 00:03:53.221
X is zero, and then y the tick
mark's here are each one half

00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:56.643
so y equals three is
right here, it's in that

00:03:56.643 --> 00:03:59.840
clockwise rotation area
so if I kind of play this,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.859
we got the clockwise
rotation, we're expecting

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.010
a negative value.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.744
Now let's see if that's what we get.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.625
We go over here and I'm gonna evaluate

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.540
this whole function again.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.930
How about plugging in
zero for x so this is

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.180
three times zero times zero minus nine.

00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:20.080
And then we're subtracting off

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.620
three times y squared so that's
three times three squared.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.703
Three squared minus nine.

00:04:27.848 --> 00:04:30.286
And this whole part is zero
minus nine so that becomes

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:34.815
negative nine and over
here we're subtracting off

00:04:34.815 --> 00:04:38.982
27 minus nine which is 18
so we're subtracting off 18,

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:44.229
so the whole thing equals negative 27.

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.608
So maybe I should say
that equals negative 27.

00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:50.742
So because this is negative
that's what corresponds

00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:54.051
to the clockwise rotation that we have

00:04:54.051 --> 00:04:55.572
going on in that region.

00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:57.186
And if you went and you plugged in a bunch

00:04:57.186 --> 00:04:59.044
of different points like
you could perhaps see

00:04:59.044 --> 00:05:01.586
how if you plug in zero
for x and zero for y,

00:05:01.586 --> 00:05:04.210
those nines cancel out
which is why over here

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.428
there's no general
rotation around the origin

00:05:06.428 --> 00:05:08.343
when x and y are both equal to zero.

00:05:08.343 --> 00:05:09.934
And you can understand
that every single point

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:12.314
and the general rotation
around every single point

00:05:12.314 --> 00:05:16.427
just by taking this formula
that we found for 2D curl,

00:05:16.427 --> 00:05:19.233
and plugging in the
corresponding values of x and y.

00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:21.987
So it's actually a very powerful
tool cause you would think

00:05:21.987 --> 00:05:24.184
that's a very complicated
thing to figure out right,

00:05:24.184 --> 00:05:26.908
that if I give you this
pretty complicated fluid flow

00:05:26.908 --> 00:05:29.787
and say hey I want you to
figure out a number that'll

00:05:29.787 --> 00:05:32.445
tell me the general direction
and strength of rotation

00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:35.220
around each point, that's a
lot of information so it's nice

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.311
just to have a small compact formula.
