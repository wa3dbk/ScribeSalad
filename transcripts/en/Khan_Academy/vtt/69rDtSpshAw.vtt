00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.110
This brain teaser is a bit of
a classic, and I'm sure a

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.600
bunch of you have
heard it before.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.510
But I wanted to include this in
the brain teaser playlist

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.770
that I'm making right now.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.480
Because this one is actually a
good build up, and a bit of a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.379
nice warm up session for a
slightly harder brain teaser

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.840
that deals with people telling
the truth and lying.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.025
So this one, we could call it
the truth teller and the liar.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.490
So we're on some type of
adventure quest, and we get to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.020
a fork in a road, right?

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.680
So let's say that there's
two doors.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.340
That's even better.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.710
So there's two doors.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.770
And I've gotten to the end of my
adventure quest. And I know

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.700
that my treasure is behind
one of these two doors.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.790
Unfortunately, behind the other
door is slow and painful

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.870
death, and all of the
misery in the world.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.590
So I want to pick the
door carefully.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.340
And beside the doors, there are
two people sitting there.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.780
There's one guy that
looks like this.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.950
And then there's another guy
that looks like this.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.270
And I know for a fact - the
gods of brain teasers have

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.250
come and told me - that both of
these guys know which door

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.870
has the treasure, and both of
these guys know which door has

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.350
the unbelievable despair
that would ensue if

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.980
I opened that door.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.870
So both of these
guys know which

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.270
door I should be opening.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.070
And I also know, and both of
them know, that one of them

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.740
always tells the truth.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.325
One is always honest. And then
one of them always lies.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.370
And the problem is I don't
know who's who.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.230
And I only have one chance.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.800
Obviously I can't just open
a door and close it.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.710
If I open the wrong door,
the despair will

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.990
come out and kill.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.709
And you know, all of the
pain will happen.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.030
And I can only ask one question
of one of them to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.340
decide which door to open.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.670
So remember, they both know
the correct answer.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.160
But one of them always lies.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.710
One of them always
tells the truth.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.730
And I only have one question
to ask of one of them.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.350
So the brain teaser is: What
question do you ask?

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.780
Who do you ask it to?

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.700
Do you ask it to the green
guy or to the brown guy?

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.300
And then what do you do based
on what they tell you?

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.370
So that is the problem
description.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.020
And I will now give
you the solution.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.150
So if you don't want
the solution, and I

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.110
encourage you not to.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.320
I think if you think about this
one for maybe 20 or 30

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.690
minutes, or at most a day.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.020
Sometimes when you sleep
on a brain teaser it

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.770
might come to you.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.420
So I encourage you to do that.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.390
So pause it, stop
it, whatever.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.730
Don't listen anymore.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.850
Because here is the solution.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.950
So what you do is-- I mean,
you don't know who's who.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.170
So it's not like there's a
correct answer on who you ask

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.340
a question of.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.860
But what you do is you ask you
either of the people, what

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:31.720
would the other guy say is
the correct door to open?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.000
So let's think about this.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.260
So I could ask this guy, I'm
asking the green guy, what

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.220
would this guy say is the
correct door to open?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.480
Now what happens if this
guy tells the truth?

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.200
If this guy tells the
truth, then this

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.970
guy's the liar, right?

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.790
And so he will actually
tell me what this guy

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.040
would tell me to do.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.240
So what would the other guy
say is the correct door to

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.960
open, right?

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.950
So this guy, if you were to tell
him the correct door to

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.550
open, he would tell you the
incorrect door to open.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.440
Right?

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.700
So when you ask this guy what
would that guy say, he'll be

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.590
honest about what this
guy would say.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.270
And since he's a liar,
he would tell you

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.400
the incorrect door.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.930
So the answer to this question,
you would get the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.370
incorrect door.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.150
Incorrect door would be the
answer to that question if

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.620
this guy's the truth teller
and this guy's the liar.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.060
Now what happens if it's
the other way around?

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.530
What if I ask this guy and he
happens to be the liar?

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.350
So this guy's the liar, this
guy's the truth teller.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.210
So the liar, he can't
help himself.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.570
He will lie.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.790
So he knows that this other
guy is the truth

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.550
teller there, right?

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.770
There's only two
of them there.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.400
He knows this guy's
the truth teller.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.820
And he knows that this guy
when asked will say the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.000
correct door to open.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.430
So if you happened to be lucky
and you ask this guy the

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.230
correct door, he would
tell it to you.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.090
This guy will lie.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.040
Let's say that this is the
correct door, door number two

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.290
is the correct door.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.990
So let's say that door number
two is the correct door.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.565
If you ask this guy directly,
he'll say oh

00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:29.510
yeah, door number two.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.770
You'll find all your happiness
behind door number two.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.910
Now if this guy's a liar, he
knows that the truth teller

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.860
will say door number two.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.030
But he's a liar, so he'll tell
you door number one.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.130
So once again, if I ask the same
question of the liar, I

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.250
still get the incorrect door.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.560
Right?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.350
So no matter who I ask this
question to, their answer will

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.680
be the wrong door, the incorrect
door, or the door

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.800
that I get all of
the pain from.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.530
So what you do is you ask this
question, what would the other

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.920
guy say is the correct
door to open?

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.150
And no matter who you ask that
to, they're going to answer

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.910
the incorrect door.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.220
And so you do the opposite.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.940
So I ask this guy, mister green
guy, what would mister

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.530
brown guy say is the correct
door to open?

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:26.960
And green guy will say brown guy
will tell you to open door

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.430
number one.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.280
Well green guy says that brown
guy will tell me to open door

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.040
number one, then I should
open up door number two.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.290
And likewise, if green guy says
brown guy will say to

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.450
open door number two, then I
should open door number one.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.680
Anyway that's a nice warm up
brain teaser for the next one

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.390
I'm going to give you.
