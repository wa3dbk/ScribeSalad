00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.070
We'll now learn an application
of combinations that you

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.570
probably won't find
intuitive at first.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.000
But the more you think about
it, it will make a lot of sense

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.820
and hopefully it'll make you
appreciate, once again, the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.140
beauty of mathematics.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.850
And then you'll also know why--
when we say n choose k in

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.290
combinations --why that's also
called a binomial coefficient.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.480
Because we are going to
cover the binomial theorem.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.430
So before I give you the
binomial theorem, let's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.970
understand the motivation for
why it's even interesting.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.150
So let me erase that.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.110
Invert colors.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.660
So if we just had to
multiply-- I don't know.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.530
Well let's just take different
powers of a binomial.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.350
A binomial is just a polynomial
with two terms, right?

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.000
So a plus b-- Well a
plus b to the 0, that's

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.060
equal to 1, right?

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.710
Anything to the 0
is equal to 1.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.110
a plus b to the 1, well
that equals a plus b.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.550
a plus b squared, that equals--
and if you don't have a lot of

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.310
practice doing this you
might be tempted to say a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.080
squared plus b squared.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.530
But you should correct yourself
quickly and slap yourself on

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.600
the wrist or the brain or
someplace if you did that.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.390
Because that's a plus
b times a plus b.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.400
And then we could use the
distributive property, or,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.410
if you learned it this way
in Algebra I, you could

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.940
use the FOIL property.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.000
That equals a times
a plus b, right?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.360
Plus b times a plus b.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.690
Which is equal to a squared
plus ab plus ba plus b squared.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.980
Which is equal to a squared
plus 2ab plus b squared.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.200
That should be a bit
of review for you.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.590
And now it gets a little
bit more interesting.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.810
What is-- Let me circle that
just so we remember it.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.590
That's a plus b squared.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.440
What's a plus b to the third?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.130
And now this is starting
to get complicated.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:16.730
This is equal to a plus b times
a plus b times a plus b.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.450
Or another way to view it,
it's a plus b squared

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.110
times a plus b, right?

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.700
This is a power of three.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.500
So this was a plus b squared.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.900
So if we multiply it by
a plus b, we'll get a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.510
plus b to the third.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.960
So let's do that.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.460
Let's multiply this
times a plus b.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.480
So first let's multiply
everything times b.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.680
So that's b-- let me do
this in another color.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.840
a squared b, right?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.590
That's a squared times b.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.400
Now let's do 2ab times b.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.600
So plus 2ab squared, right?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.970
2ab times b.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.970
And then plus b cubed.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.910
And then we have a times a.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.210
Well that's a cubed, right?

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.780
None of these match that, so
I'll put it in another column.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.690
a times 2ab.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.830
Well that's 2a squared b.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.650
I'll put that out
here: 2a squared b.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.070
And then a times b squared.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.470
Well that's plus ab
squared, right?

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.010
And now we'll just add
up all of the terms.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.700
All we do is the distributive
property again, right?

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.780
We multiplied a times all of
these terms and then added that

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.740
to b times all of these terms.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.490
If we add it all up-- I'll
try to do it in order

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.330
of-- Let's see.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.630
Let's put the a cubed first.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.200
And then-- Well actually we
already had this thing.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.440
This 2a squared b, I could
have written it here.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.870
2a squared b, because I had
an a squared b here so.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.090
I just rewrote the
2a squared b here.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.040
So we have a cubed plus 2a
squared b plus a squared b.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.960
That's 3a squared b.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.760
And then 2ab squared
plus ab squared.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.720
That's 2ab squared.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.860
And then plus b cubed.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.380
As you can see, that involved
a lot just to take something

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.640
to the third power.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.810
So we could-- If we had the
time, we could figure out what

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.690
a plus b to the fourth power is
or what a plus b to

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.610
the tenth power is.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.190
But as you could imagine,
this would take you all day.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.940
So wouldn't it be neat if there
were an easy way to calculate

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.950
what a binomial is to
an arbitrary power?

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.370
And that's where the binomial
theorem comes into play.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.900
And in this video I'm going
to show you what the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.190
binomial theorem is.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.470
I will show you
how to apply it.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.480
I will show you a trick or
a technique that will make

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.240
you seem like a genius.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.770
And then in the next video
I'll hopefully give you

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.380
some intuition for why the
binomial theorem actually

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.000
involves combinations.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.220
Why it involves actually the
binomial coefficient at all.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.770
So what is the
binomial theorem?

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.510
Let me erase all of this.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.080
And you can confirm that the
binomial theorem works for the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.950
ones that we've worked out,
up to a plus b to the third.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.360
You could work out a plus
b to the fourth if you

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.330
like to punish yourself.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.980
Let's see.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.190
Clear image.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.050
Invert color.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.660
So the binomial theorem tells
us that a plus b to the nth

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.080
power is equal to-- And I know
it's going to look complicated

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.100
at first, but we'll do a couple
of examples and you'll see

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.780
it's not that intimidating.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.300
It equals the sum from k
equals 0 to n, right?

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.610
This n is the same
thing as that n.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.550
Of-- each term is n
choose k, right?

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.650
We're going to keep
incrementing k up from 0 to

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:58.080
n-- of x to the n minus
k times y to the k.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.020
I know that looks complicated
but if we do a couple of

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.300
concrete examples, I think it
should make a reasonable

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.540
amount of sense.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.140
So given-- Oh sorry.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.660
This is-- This isn't-- I
was copying this down.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.660
This should be a to the n
minus k and this should be b.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.500
What I had written down
before, that would be

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.820
x plus y to the n.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.210
If we have a plus b to the n, n
choose k each term. a to the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.900
n minus k times b to the k.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.480
So let's apply this, a couple
of concrete examples.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.640
We could even switch around the
variable names if we want just

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.310
to show you that they don't
have to be a's and b's.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.660
They can be anything.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:41.170
So what is a plus b-- let's do
one that we otherwise would

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.230
have found fairly difficult-- a
plus b to the fourth power.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.760
Well that, the binomial theorem
tells us that, let's see, the

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.070
first term is going to be--
Well what's n, first of

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.620
all? n is 4 in this case.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.220
It equals-- Let me fill in
all the numbers actually.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:04.500
From k equals 0 to 4
of 4 choose k, right?

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.000
Because k is what
we're incrementing.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.960
a to the 4 minus k.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.920
b to the k, right?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.260
I just substituted the
n into the binomial

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.820
theorem definition.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.780
And what does that equal?

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.360
Well the first term
is k equals 0.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.010
So that's 4 choose 0.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.630
So out of 4 things, I'm
going to choose 0.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.260
And I'll show you in the
next video why that works.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.470
Of a to the 4 minus k.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.800
Well the first term k is 0.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.250
So it's a to the fourth,
b to the 0, right?

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.020
So the b, that's just 1,
so we can just ignore it.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.550
So what's the next term?

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.000
Well, it's going
to be 4 choose 1.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.330
And now k is 1.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.740
So 4 minus 1 is 3.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.260
a to the third.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.510
And k is 1 now.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.370
We're in the-- This
is the zeroth term.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.870
This is the first term.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:00.830
So b to the first plus-- So as
you can see, each term we go,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.630
the a term, the first term,
whichever it is, it decrements.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.840
It starts up at the power
n, or in the fourth power.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.850
And then each term,
it goes down by 1.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.520
And then the second term,
the b term, it starts

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.660
at the zeroth power.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.660
So it starts at 1.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.010
That's why you don't
see it there.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.620
And then each term
it increments up.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.520
So then the next one-- So I
think you see the pattern.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:29.820
It's going to be 4 choose 2, a
squared b squared plus 4 choose

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:38.910
3 ab to the third
plus 4 choose 4.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.620
Now it'll have a to the
zero, so that's just

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.690
1, b to the fourth.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.770
So we're done if we just figure
out what these binomial

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.830
coefficients are.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.940
And that's where they
come from, from the

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.720
binomial theorem.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.910
But we remember how to
calculate that, right?

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:56.020
In general-- and hopefully you
have the intuition on this.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.960
You shouldn't just memorize it.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.970
n choose k from our
combinatorics is equal to n

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:07.710
factorial over k factorial
divided by n minus k factorial.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.930
So in this case,
what's 4 choose 0?

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.240
That equals-- I know it seems
very time consuming right now.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.570
Although it's less time
consuming than actually

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.360
multiplying it out.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.210
But I'll show you trick in a
second that will amaze you.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:30.480
So this is equal to 4 factorial
over 0 factorial times 4

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:37.400
factorial, right-- 4 minus 0 is
4 --a to the fourth plus 4

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:45.680
factorial over 1 factorial
times 3 factorial, right?

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.600
4 minus 1 is 3 factorial.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.870
a to the third b plus-- I know
this is getting a little

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.180
tedious, but I think it's good
to completely work through

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.770
one entire problem
--plus 4 choose 2.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.680
That's 4 factorial over
2 factorial times 2

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.410
factorial, right?

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.560
4 minus 2 is 2.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.570
a squared b squared
plus 4 choose 3.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:15.690
That's 4 factorial
over 3 factorial.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.090
4 minus 3 is 1 factorial.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.120
ab cubed.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.200
And then 4 choose 4.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.470
That's plus 4 factorial
over 4 factorial times 0

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.600
factorial b to the fourth.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.730
And notice: this coefficient is
the same as that coefficient.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.370
This coeffieicnt is the same
as this coefficient and then

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.600
this one's in the middle.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.890
So let's evaluate them.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.240
And I'll switch colors.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.120
So 0 factorial, in case
you don't know it, it's

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.410
actually defined to be 1.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.480
Which is a little bit
non-intuitive because 1

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.240
factorial is also 1.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.430
But that's just something
you should know.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.830
So 4 factorial divided by 0
factorial times 4 factorial.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.050
This is actually equal to 1.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.940
So the first term is just a to
the fourth plus 4 factorial--

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.430
it's 4 times 3 times 2 times 1
--divided by 3 times 2 times 1.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.380
So that equals 4.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.820
4a cubed b plus 4 factorial.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.580
That's 4 times 3
times 2 times 1.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.340
So that's 24, right?

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.610
Over-- what's 2 factorial?

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.260
That's just 2.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.420
So 2 times 2 is 4.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.170
So 24 divided by 4 is 6.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:32.600
So 6a squared b squared plus
well 4-- This term is the

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.820
same as this term, right?

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.660
With just the 1 factorial
and the 3 factorial

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.430
got switched around.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.340
And you might want to think
about that for a few

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.530
seconds as to why that is.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.250
It should make a
little sense to you.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:48.030
But that is-- So it's
going to be 4ab cubed.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.030
And it makes sense, right?

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.610
Because this could have
just been b plus a.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.960
A plus b and b plus a are the
same thing so it makes sense

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.280
that there's a symmetry, right?

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.240
That we have 4ab cubed and
we also have 4a cubed b.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.730
Ignore me if you find
that confusing.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.220
If you find it enlightening,
all the better.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.650
And then the last term.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.550
4 factorial.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.460
This term is the same
thing as this term.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.760
And we've already figured
out that equals 1.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.540
So plus b to the fourth.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.410
So I had a little symmetry.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.680
The coefficients
are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.670
And I'll show you in a future
video that these are actually

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.560
the terms of a Pascal Triangle,
which is another avenue

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.140
to go in mathematics.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.180
But anyway, this was
an application of the

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.100
binomial theorem.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.040
And I realize I've taken
12 minutes so far.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.990
So I will do more examples
in the next video.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.492
See you soon.
