00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:08.467
We're asked to add and simplify and we have the principle root of two x squared plus four times the principle

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:14.933
root of eight plus three times the principle root two x squared plus the principle root of eight

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.733
so we can do a little bit of adding, we can actually simplify

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.800
first and then add or we can add first and then simplify

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.400
but it looks like we can already add so lets try and do that

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:30.133
so here, right over here, I have a principle root of two x squared and over here I have three principle

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:35.867
roots of two x squared, well if I have one of something here and I have three of something here and i need

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:41.800
to add them together I can put a one co-efficient out here to make it clear this is one of this thing

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.733
and I have three of these things but if I have one of this thing and three more of these things and I add them together I am

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:56.400
going to have four of those things, so this is four times the principle root of two x squared

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.867
and that confuses a little bit, imagine that the whole principle root of two x squared was some variable

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:08.867
lets say this whole thing was "a" and lets say that this whole thing was "a" as well, because its the same thing, you'd have one "a"

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:14.067
plus three "a"'s which will give you four "a"'s, in this case "a" is all of this business right over here

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:19.333
so we added those terms, and then we wanted to think about we have four principle roots of "a" and we

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:24.800
have one more principle roots of "a", so same idea you have four of these things I am circling in magenta

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.533
and you have one more of these things that I am circling in magenta, that one co-efficient is implicit

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:36.400
so if I have four of something plus one more of something it becomes five of that something

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:45.533
so plus plus five times the square root, plus five times the square root of eight

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:49.867
and now we'll see if we can simplify this anymore, we have four of something and we have five of something

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:54.933
else, so you can't just add these two things together, but maybe we can simplify this a little bit

00:01:54.933 --> 00:02:00.800
so we know that the principle root of two x squared, this is the same thing as, so let me write the four

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.400
out front, so we have the four, and the principle root of two x squared is the same thing as the principle

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.333
root of two times the principle root of x squared so I just rewrote this part over here

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:18.867
and then we have plus five times, now eight can be written as a product of a perfect square and a

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:26.000
not so perfect square, eight can be written as four times two, so lets write it that way

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.800
so if we view this whole, this is the principle root, the square root of four times two, we can re-write this as the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.733
five times the square root of four, or the principle root of four times the principle root of two and

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:44.533
what can we simplify here? well we know what the principle root of x squared is, it is the positive square

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:52.400
root of x squared, so it is not just x, you might be tempted to say it is x but since we know it is

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.467
the positive square root we have to say it is the absolute value of x, because what if x was negative?

00:02:57.467 --> 00:03:01.867
if was x was negative, you'd have , lets say it was negative three, you'd have negative three squared,

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:08.467
you'd have a positive nine, and so the principle root of a positive nine is going to be a positive three

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:12.733
and so it wouldn't just be x, it wouldnt be negative three, it would be positive three, so you have to

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:17.600
take the absolute value, and the other thing that is a perfect square is the four right here, its principle

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.400
root is two, its principle square root i should say is two, so now you have, if we just change the order we

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.533
are multiplying right here, you have four, four times the absolute value

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:36.467
of x, four times the absolute value of x, times the square root of two, times the square root of two,

00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:45.133
I want to do that in that same yellow color, times the square root of two, plus plus we have five times

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:50.600
two, which is ten, right, this whole thing is simplified to two, so we have plus ten

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.400
square roots of two, now we could call it a day, and say we are all done adding and simplifying

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.000
or you could add a little bit more depending on how you wanna view it, because over here you have

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.267
four times the absolute value of x square roots of two, and here you have ten square roots of two

00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:15.067
so you have four absolute value of x of something, and you have ten of that same something, you could

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:19.067
add them up, or another way to think about it is, you could factor out a square root of two

00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:30.200
either one of those works, so you get four times the absolute value of x, plus ten plus ten times times

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.400
the principle square root of two, so depending on whether you view this of this more simplified, one

00:04:37.400 --> 99:59:59.999
of those two will will satisfy you
