00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.610
We've known for several videos
now that the dot product of

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:11.420
two nonzero vectors, a and b,
is equal to the length of

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.540
vector a times the length of
vector b times the cosine of

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.820
the angle between them.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.620
Let me draw a and b just
to make it clear.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.900
If that's my vector a and
that's my vector b right

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.600
there, the angle between
them is this angle.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.430
And we defined it in this way.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.390
And actually, if you ever want
to solve-- if you have two

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.260
vectors and you want to solve
for that angle, and I've never

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.470
done this before explicitly.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.040
And I thought, well, I might
as well do it right now.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.760
You could just solve
for your theta.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:51.460
So it would be a dot b divided
by the lengths of your two

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.300
vectors multiplied by each
other is equal to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.800
the cosine of theta.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.840
And then to solve for theta
you would have to take the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.880
inverse cosine of both sides,
or the arc cosine of both

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.840
sides, and you would get theta
is equal to arc cosine of a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.450
dot b over the magnitudes or
the lengths of the products

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.180
of, or the lengths of each of
those vectors, multiplied by

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.280
each other.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.170
So if I give you two arbitrary
vectors-- and the neat thing

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.210
about it is, this might be
pretty straightforward.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.440
If I just drew something in two
dimensions right here, you

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.500
could just take your protractor
out and measure

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.320
this angle.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.440
But if a and b each have a
hundred components, it becomes

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.320
hard to visualize the
idea of an angle

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.890
between the two vectors.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.110
But you don't need to visualize
them anymore because

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.840
you just have to calculate
this thing right here.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.130
You just have to calculate
this value right there.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.760
And then go to your calculator
and then type in arc cosine,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.140
or the inverse cosine that are
the equivalent functions, and

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.440
it'll give you an angle.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.520
And that, by definition, is the
angle between those two

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.120
vectors, which is a
very neat concept.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.970
And then you can start
addressing issues of

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.500
perpendicularity and
whatever else.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.620
This was a bit of a tangent.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.300
But the other outcome that I
painstakingly proved to you in

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.430
the previous video was that
the length of the cross

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.270
product of two vectors is equal
to-- it's a very similar

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.810
expression.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.680
It's equal to the product of the
two vectors' lengths, so

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.280
the length of a times the length
of b times the sine of

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.930
the angle between them.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.290
Times the sign of the
angle between them.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.120
So it's the same angle.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.820
So what I want to do is take
these two ideas and this was a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.950
bit of a diversion there just
to kind of show you how to

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.900
solve for theta because I
realized I've never done that

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.510
for you before.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.260
But what I want to do is I want
to take this expression

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.800
up here and this expression up
here and see if we can develop

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.590
an intuition, at least in R3
because right now we've only

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.700
defined our cross product.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.580
Or the cross product of two
vectors is only defined in R3.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.780
Let's take these two ideas in
R3 and see if we can develop

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.340
an intuition.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.940
And I've done a very similar
video in the physics playlist

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.920
where I compare the dot product
to the cross product.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.400
Now, if I'm talking about--
let me redraw my vectors.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.820
So the length of a--
so let me draw a.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.420
b, I want to do it
bigger than that.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.090
So let me do it like that.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.540
So that is my vector b.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.910
So this is b.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.070
That is a.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.200
What is the length of a times
the length of b times the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.850
cosine of the angle?

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.080
So let me do that right there.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.000
So this is the angle.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.970
So the length of a if I were to
draw these vectors is this

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.760
length right here.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.390
This is the length of a.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.230
It's this distance right
here, the way

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.330
I've drawn this vector.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.680
So this is, literally, the
length of vector a.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.920
And I'm doing it in R3 or maybe
a version of it that I

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.160
can fit onto my little
blackboard right here.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.150
So it'll just be the length
of this line right there.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.080
And then the length of
b is the length of

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.180
that line right there.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.910
So that is the length of b.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.650
Let me rewrite this
thing up here.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.790
Let me write it as b, the length
of b times the length--

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.570
and I want to be careful.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.710
I don't want to do the dot there
because you'll think

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.640
it's a dot product.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.560
Times a cosine of theta.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.630
All I did is I rearranged
this thing here.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.340
It's the same thing
as a dot b.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.460
Well what is a times the
cosine of theta?

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.640
Let's get out our basic
trigonometry

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.370
tools-- SOH CAH TOA.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.270
Cosine of theta is equal to
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.680
So if I drop, if I create a
right triangle here, and let

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.620
me introduce some new colors
just to ease the monotony.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.970
If I drop a right triangle
right here and I create a

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.490
right triangle right there, and
this is theta, than what

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.650
is the cosine of theta?

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.230
It's equal to this.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.490
Let me do it another color.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.130
It's equal to this,
the adjacent side.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.820
It's equal to this little
magenta thing.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.770
Not all of b, just this
part that goes

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.290
up to my right angle.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.570
That's my adjacent.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.950
I want to do it a little
bit bigger.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.020
It's equal to the adjacent
side over the hypotenuse.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.250
So let me write this down.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.850
So cosine of theta is equal to
this little adjacent side.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.020
I'm just going to write
it like that.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:44.880
Is equal to this adjacent side
over the hypotenuse.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.640
But what is the hypotenuse?

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.970
It is the length of vector a.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.620
It's this.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.210
That's my hypotenuse
right there.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.430
So my hypotenuse is the
length of vector a.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.040
And so if I multiply both sides
by the length of vector

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:06.660
a I get the length of vector a
times the cosine of theta is

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.520
equal to the adjacent side.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.770
I'll do that in magenta.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.910
So this expression right here,
which was just a dot b can be

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.790
rewritten as-- I just told you
that the length of vector a

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.210
times cosine of theta is equal
to this little magenta

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.970
adjacent side.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.500
So this is equal to
the adjacent side.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:38.420
So you can view a dot b as being
equal to the length of

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:44.350
vector b-- that length-- times
that adjacent side.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.910
And you're saying, Sal, what
does that do for me?

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.360
Well what it tells you
is you're multiplying

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.840
essentially, the length of
vector b times the amount of

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.830
vector a that's going in the
same direction as vector b.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.190
You can kind of view this as
the shadow of vector a.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.420
And I'll talk about projections
in the future.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.930
And I'll more formally define
them, but if the word

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.140
projection helps you, just
think of that word.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.530
If you have a light that shines
down from above, this

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.190
adjacent side is kind of like
the shadow of a onto vector b.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.630
And you can imagine, if these
two vectors-- if our two

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:25.180
vectors looked more like this,
if they were really going in

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.110
the same direction.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.760
Let's say that's vector a and
that's vector b, then the

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.730
adjacent side that I care about
is going to-- they're

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.070
going to have a lot
more in common.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.950
The part of a that is going in
the same direction of b will

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.840
be a lot larger.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.840
So this will have a larger
dot product.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.920
Because the dot product is
essentially saying, how much

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.010
of those vectors are going
in the same direction?

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.950
But it's just a number, so it
will just be this adjacent

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.310
side times the length of b.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.730
And what if I had vectors that
are pretty perpendicular to

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:00.850
each other?

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.930
So what if I had two vectors
that were like this?

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:08.390
What if my vector a looked
like that and my vector b

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.370
looked like that?

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.940
Well now the adjacent, the way
I define it here, if I had to

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.060
make a right triangle
like that, the

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.880
adjacent side's very small.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.440
So you're dot product, even
though a is still a reasonably

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.740
large vector, is now much
smaller because a and b have

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.170
very little commonality
in the same direction.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.880
And you can do it
the other way.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.070
You could draw this down like
that and you could do the

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.760
adjacent the other way, but it
doesn't matter because these

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.159
a's and b's are arbitrary.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:44.460
So the take away is the fact
that a dot b is equal to the

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.480
lengths of each of those times
the cosine of theta.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.590
To me it says that the dot
product tells me how much are

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.100
my vectors moving together?

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.040
Or the product of the
part of the vectors

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.660
that are moving together.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:10.320
Product of the lengths of the
vectors that are moving

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.946
together or in the
same direction.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:22.210
You could view this adjacent
side here as the part of a

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.050
that's going in the
direction of b.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.080
That's the part of a that's
going in the direction of b.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.180
So you're multiplying
that times b itself.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.620
So that's what the
dot product is.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.340
How much are two things going
in the same direction.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.000
And notice, when two things are
orthogonal or when they're

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.990
perpendicular-- when a dot b is
equal to 0, we say they're

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.910
perpendicular.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.110
And that makes complete sense
based on this kind of

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.930
intuition of what the dot
product is doing.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.210
Because that means that
they're perfectly

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.040
perpendicular.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.620
So that's b and that's a.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.700
And so the adjacent part of a,
if I had to draw a right

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.390
trianlge, it would come
straight down.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.440
And if I were to say the
projection of a and I

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.070
haven't draw that.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.400
Or if I put a light shining down
from above and I'd say

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.670
what's the shadow of a onto b?

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.440
You'd get nothing.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.120
You'd get 0.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.010
This arrow has no width, even
though I've drawn it to have

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:12.530
some width.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:13.820
It has no width.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.890
So you would have
a 0 down here.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.930
The part of a that goes in
the same direction as b.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.270
No part of this vector
goes in the same

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.550
direction as this vector.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.560
So you're going to have this 0
kind of adjacent side times b,

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.030
so you're going to get
something that's 0.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.150
So hopefully that makes
a little sense.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.870
Now let's think about
the cross product.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:37.520
The cross product tells us well,
the length of a cross b,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.510
I painstakingly showed, you is
equal to the length of a times

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:47.750
the length of b times the sin
of the angle between them.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.500
So let me do the same example.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.370
Let me draw my two vectors.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:59.300
That's my vector a and
this is my vector b.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.480
And now sin-- SOH CAH TOA.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.400
So sin of theta, let
me write that.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:09.340
Sin of theta-- SOH CAH TOA-- is
equal to opposite over the

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.020
hypotenuse.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.870
So if I were to draw a little
right triangle here, so if I

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.900
were to draw a perpendicular
right there, this is theta.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.300
What is the sin of theta equal
to in this context?

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.750
The sin of theta is
equal to what?

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.370
It's equal to this
side over here.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.640
Let me call that just
the opposite.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.840
It's equal to the opposite
side over the hypotenuse.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.540
So the hypotenuse is
the length of this

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.760
vector a right there.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.760
It's the length of
this vector a.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.440
So the hypotenuse is the length
over my vector a.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.500
So if I multiply both sides of
this by my length of vector a,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.710
I get the length of vector a
times the sin of theta is

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.570
equal to the opposite side.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.290
So if we rearrange this a little
bit, I can rewrite this

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.300
as equal to-- I'm just
going to swap them.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.800
I have to do the dot
product as well.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.820
This is equal to b, the length
of vector b, times the length

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.920
of vector a sin of theta.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.720
Well this thing is just the
opposite side as I've defined

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.300
it right here.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.305
So this right here is just
the opposite side,

00:12:18.305 --> 00:12:20.680
this side right there.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.460
So when we're taking the cross
product, we're essentially

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.540
multiplying the length of vector
b times the part of a

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.040
that's going perpendicular
to b.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.680
This opposite side is the
part of a that's going

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.110
perpendicular to b.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.930
So they're kind of
opposite ideas.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.640
The dot product, you're
multiplying the part of a

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.570
that's going in the same
direction as b with b.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.400
While when you're taking the
cross product, you're

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.760
multiplying the part of
a that's going in the

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:54.720
perpendicular direction to
b with the length of b.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.540
It's a measure, especially when
you take the length of

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.790
this, it's a measure of
how perpendicular

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.000
these two guys are.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.590
And this is, it's a measure of
how much do they move in the

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.040
same direction?

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.490
And let's just look at
a couple of examples.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.810
So if you take two
right triangles.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:16.020
So if that's a and that's-- or
if you take two vectors that

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:22.840
are perpendicular to each other,
the length of a cross b

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.570
is going to be equal to-- if we
just use this formula right

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.060
there-- the length of a
times the length of b.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.000
And what's the sin
of 90 degrees?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.250
It's 1.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.910
So in this case you kind of have
maximized the length of

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.970
your cross product.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.660
This is as high as it can go.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.690
Because sin of theta, it's
a maximum value.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.940
Sin of theta is always less
than or equal to 1.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.980
So this is as good as you're
ever going to get.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.480
This is the highest possible
value when you have perfectly

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.630
perpendicular vectors.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.870
Now, when is-- actually, just to
kind of go back to make the

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.780
same point here.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.830
When do you get the maximum
value for your cosine of-- for

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.760
your dot product?

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.230
Well, it's when your two
vectors are collinear.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.500
If my vector a looks like that
and my vector b is essentially

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.250
another vector that's going
in the same direction,

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.410
then theta is 0.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.970
There's no angle between them.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:23.080
And then you have a dot b is
equal to the magnitude or the

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.440
length of vector a times the
length of vector b times the

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.870
cosine of the angle
between them.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.190
The cosine of the angle between
them, the cosine of

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.680
that angle is 0.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.180
Or the angle is 0, so the
cosine of that is 1.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:38.020
So when you have two vectors
that go exactly in the same

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.230
direction or they're collinear,
you kind of

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.700
maximize your dot product.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.510
You maximize your cross product
when they're perfectly

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.080
perpendicular to each other.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.960
And just to make the analogy
clear, when they're

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.550
perpendicular to each other
you've minimized-- or at least

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.640
the magnitude of your
dot product.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.080
You can get negative dot
products, but the absolute

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.360
size of your dot product, the
absolute value of your dot

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.270
product is minimized
when they're

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.710
perpendicular to each other.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:10.090
Similarly, if you were to take
two vectors that are collinear

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.350
and they're moving in the same
direction, so if that's vector

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.280
a, and then I have vector b that
just is another vector

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.480
that I want to draw them
on top of each other.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.560
But I think you get the idea.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.540
Let's say vector
b is like that.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.860
Then theta is 0.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.110
You can't even see it.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.190
It's been squeezed out.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.170
I've just brought these two
things on top of each other.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:35.670
And then the cross product in
this situation, a cross b is

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:39.525
equal to-- well, the length of
both of these things times the

00:15:39.525 --> 00:15:40.070
sin of theta.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.620
Sin of 0 is 0.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.600
So it's just 0.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.300
So two collinear vectors, the
magnitude of their cross

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.810
product is 0.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:56.110
But the magnitude of their dot
product, the a dot b, is going

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.070
to be maximized.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.330
It's going to be as high
as you can get.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.540
It's going to be the length of
a times the length of b.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.450
Now the opposite scenario
is right here.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.210
When they're perpendicular to
each other, the cross product

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.750
is maximized because it's
measuring on how much of the

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:14.930
vectors-- how much of the
perpendicular part of a is--

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.430
multiplying that times
the length of b.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.490
And then when you have two
orthogonal vectors, your dot

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.330
product is minimized,
or the absolute

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.400
value of your dot product.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.840
So a dot b in this case,
is equal to 0.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.420
Anyway, I wanted to make all
of this clear because

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.300
sometimes you kind of get into
the formulas and the

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.720
definitions and you lose the
intuition about what are all

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.940
of these ideas really for?

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.130
And actually, before I move on,
let me just make another

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.210
kind of idea about what the
cross product can be

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.520
interpreted as.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.020
Because a cross product tends
to give people more trouble.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.220
That's my a and that's my b.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.820
What if I wanted to figure
out the area of this

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.110
parallelogram?

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.410
If I were to shift a and have
that there and if I were to

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.420
shift b and draw a line parallel
to b, and if I wanted

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:08.089
to figure out the area of this
parallelogram right there, how

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.000
would I do it just using
regular geometry?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.369
Well I would drop a
perpendicular right there.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:25.020
This is perpendicular and this
length is h for height.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:30.020
Then the area of this, the area
of the parallelogram is

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.140
just equal to the length of my
base, which is just the length

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.650
of vector b times my height.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.670
But what is my height?

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.330
Let me just draw a little
theta there.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.430
Let me do a green theta,
it's more visible.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.530
So theta.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:53.150
So we know already that the sin
of this theta is equal to

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.460
the opposite over
the hypotenuse.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.740
So it's equal to the height
over the hypotenuse.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.350
The hypotenuse is just the
length of vector a.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.520
So it's just the length
of vector a.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.590
Or we could just solve for
height and we'd get the height

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.040
is equal to the length
of vector a

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.000
times the sin of theta.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.480
So I can rewrite this here.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.110
I can replace it with that and
I get the area of this

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.210
parallelogram is equal to the
length of vector b times the

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.110
length of vector a sin theta.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.660
Well this is just the length
of the cross product of the

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.670
two vectors, a cross b.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:36.670
This is the same thing.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.200
I mean you can rearrange
the a and the b.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.780
So we now have another way of
thinking about what the cross

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.670
product is.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.130
The cross product of two
vectors, or at least the

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.220
magnitude or the length of the
cross product of two vectors--

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.320
obviously, the cross product
you're going

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.580
to get a third vector.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.190
But the length of that third
vector is equal to the area of

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.490
the parallelogram that's defined
or that's kind of--

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.220
that you can create from
those two vectors.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.080
Anyway, hopefully you found this
a little bit intuitive

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.750

more of kind of a sense of

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.910
what the dot product and cross
product are all about.
