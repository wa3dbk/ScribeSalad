00:00:00.311 --> 00:00:02.827
Given all the data that we`ve explored in the last video

00:00:02.827 --> 00:00:06.915
and that we have over here, the very high debt to GDP burden that Greece has and

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:09.977
the very weak economy, it`s already in a deep recession.

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:12.665
It`s especially apparent when you look at its unemployment rate.

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:18.064
This is the period October 2010 to March 2012, unemployment rate was already high

00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:22.678
in 2010 and it`s just been going through the roof, it`s already in the low 20%

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:28.427
which is a huge number and even that is understating how bad things are on the ground in Greece

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:31.514
because the unemployment is disproportionately affecting the young

00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:33.633
so if you looked at the unemployment rate for people in their 20`s

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:39.100
it would be much much much higher than even this already unbelievably high unemployment rate.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.669
And we've already explored that the bond markets are expressing that, by asing for higher and higher

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:48.363
interest rates from Greece - these are the long term interest rates in Greece.

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:53.783
And so the possible outcomes that we're talking about here --

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:56.324
So this is Greece -

00:00:56.324 --> 00:00:58.427
--the possible outcomes for Greece--

00:00:58.427 --> 00:01:01.479
The only way that they are able to stay in the Eurozone

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.466
is if someone essentially writes them a huge check, that takes care of a good bit of their debt.

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:15.659
So one option is that they get bailed out. They get bailed out by the rest of Europe.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.607
And Germany is a major actor here, because they are the largest economy of Europe.

00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:23.810
But with the bailout, people are saying: "Hey, look, if we are going to write you a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.567
big check, you've got to cut some of your excesses, you've got to cut some of your mismanagement."

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:35.181
So the bailout packages are all tied to some form of austerity.

00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:41.109
Now, we've already talked about why austerity is definitely not politically popular in Greece

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.768
but why it's also - it might just be a scary thing to do.

00:01:43.768 --> 00:01:47.214
Because you already have an ultra weak economy,

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:49.833
you already have the unemployment rate going through the roof,

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:52.844
what happens if you get even more austere from where you are now,

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:56.826
if you do a drastic cut to government spending from where you are now,

00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:59.728
this could go to who knows where, to a large degree

00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:04.560
this rise of unemployment is due to the last few rounds of bailouts and austerity

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.519
and so that's why the Greek people are getting very suspect of this austerity.

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.168
But if that doesn't happen, and we've talked about this in the last video,

00:02:12.168 --> 00:02:16.442
if that doesn't happen, the only viable option for Greece

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:19.710
is to go off the Euro.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.276
So, leave the Eurozone.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:30.866
The Eurozone is the subset of European union countries that use the Euro as their currency.

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:34.624
And we've already talked about this, it would not be a painless process.

00:02:34.624 --> 00:02:41.684
They would leave the Eurozone, the new currency would be the new Greek drachma

00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:45.932
and with this it would be probably hugely devalued relative to the Euro

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.856
so you would have savings wiped out,

00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:52.792
maybe not fully wiped out, but savings devalued for Greek savers,

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:58.228
and they know that already, that's why, because this outcome is looking more and more likely,

00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:01.915
there is essentially a run on banks in Greece right now.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:05.695
People are going, withdrawing their Euros, so they can stuff them in their mattresses,

00:03:05.695 --> 00:03:08.307
so they won't be converted in devalued drachmas.

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:11.854
But this is having the effect of really weak [..?..]

00:03:11.854 --> 00:03:14.097
potentially breaking down the banking system.

00:03:14.097 --> 00:03:21.057
So you could have bank failures.

00:03:21.057 --> 00:03:25.158
And the whole strategy of leaving the Eurozone,

00:03:25.158 --> 00:03:26.800
leaving the Euro and going to the drachma,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.366
would be to inflate away your liabilities,

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:33.599
would be literally to inflate away your debt obligations and your entitlement obligations,

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.726
but that inflation, and this has definitively happened in the past with countries in this situation,

00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:43.255
could very easily turn to hyper inflation.

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:46.527
And so whether you look at austerity in this reality, where you get bailed out,

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:49.107
or you look at this reality over here,

00:03:49.107 --> 00:03:54.375
in either situation, in the medium term, the economy can really fall apart,

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:57.947
it's really not clear how, outside of maybe extra generous bailout,

00:03:57.947 --> 00:04:01.679
how that can be avoided.

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:03.695
And so in that situation, the economy falls apart.

00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:11.283
And when economy falls apart, in a big way,

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:16.762
and you have major unemployment, it is a scary thing,

00:04:16.762 --> 00:04:18.330
it can lead to social unrest.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.531
And I'm not talking about 8%, 9% or 10% of uneployment rate like we have in US,

00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:26.068
we are talking about 20%, 30%, 40% unemployment rate, even higher

00:04:26.068 --> 00:04:29.314
in the folks that are likely to be unrestful socially,

00:04:29.314 --> 00:04:32.797
which is the young people, so this could lead to social unrest,

00:04:32.797 --> 00:04:41.130
and even radicalization, when people start worrying about whether they get

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.408
food on the table and they don't have a job,

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:48.196
they might start supporting people who have more radical views.

00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:52.059
So just that by itself, is very, very scary proposition.

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:56.024
The history of Europe tells us that even if relatively small countries in Europe

00:04:56.024 --> 00:05:01.134
fall apart in this way, it could have repercussions in the rest of Europe.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.241
This is how the World War I and World War II got started.

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:13.183
Just that reason alone is reason enough for people to think very seriously about bailing Greece out.

00:05:13.183 --> 00:05:15.901
And it doesn't come without moral consequences,

00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:18.977
the counter-argument is - if we bailed them out

00:05:18.977 --> 00:05:29.812
doesn't this reward mismanagement and overspending?

00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:35.530
And even a little bit of shady accounting on their national economic statistics.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.833
So, there's a very good reason, if you are a German tax payer,

00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:41.167
then you are very suspicious of these bailouts.

00:05:41.167 --> 00:05:42.684
Why we are keep running the cheques to the Greeks

00:05:42.684 --> 00:05:44.701
if they are not willing to take some pain?

00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:46.746
Now the Greek side of it, they say "Look, we've already taken amount of pain,

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:50.646
we are already kind of on the brink, possibly across the brink,

00:05:50.646 --> 00:05:54.999
if you force even more pain on us,

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.910
then we are going to be in really, our society

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.795
is at the risk of falling apart. So, we are in a desperate situation.

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:05.965
This is not a time to kind of force a moral point on us."

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:08.633
So that by itself is a reason why people are worried

00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:10.666
but then there is even a bigger reason

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:13.199
that Greece might not be the only,

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.369
it's only the first, maybe the worst, of the situations

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:22.988
but if Greece falls apart, and especially if the Eurozone - or, I should say, the European Union or Europe - is not able to bail out Greece

00:06:22.988 --> 00:06:26.281
that's an implicit signal to the rest of world

00:06:26.281 --> 00:06:30.401
that Europe is not able to essentially bail out its countries.

00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:34.675
So, you see on this chart right over here,

00:06:34.675 --> 00:06:37.200
Greece is not alone, it is definitely the worst,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.658
but right behind it, you have Portugal.

00:06:39.658 --> 00:06:42.683
And its debt, you have long-term debt with interest rates

00:06:42.683 --> 00:06:45.379
looks like around the 12 or 13% range.

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:51.477
Portugal has a 93% debt to GDP ratio and already has very high unemployment rate.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:54.462
If Greece is allowed to leave Eurozone and does not get bailed out,

00:06:54.462 --> 00:06:57.326
investors are going to start wondering

00:06:57.326 --> 00:07:00.706
"Well, hey, maybe Portugal is not going to get bailed out".

00:07:00.706 --> 00:07:03.431
This going to make people expect more interest from Portugal

00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:05.433
in order to lend them money, and they need money

00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:09.004
in order to continue operating in the way they are operating,

00:07:09.004 --> 00:07:11.763
but every increase in a percentage point, right over here,

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:16.106
is going to really eat into Portuguese GDP and kind of force them down its debt spiral.

00:07:16.106 --> 00:07:18.197
Their debt as percentage of their GDP is almost 100%

00:07:18.197 --> 00:07:20.753
if they have to pay an extra one percent on that,

00:07:20.753 --> 00:07:24.482
that 1% is going to eat into their GDP

00:07:24.482 --> 00:07:28.165
and it is going to force Portugal, the economy to slow down even more

00:07:28.165 --> 00:07:29.908
and make it even more and more onerous

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:34.328
and they would just kind of go in the same direction as Greece.

00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:38.645
And once again, Portugal is not alone, Italy has a very high debt to GDP,

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:40.840
Ireland - very high debt to GDP ratio,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.801
Spain has a very high unemployment rate.

00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:46.724
So, the fear here - and I guess there are two major fears -

00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:51.316
one is that Greece by itself can become a point of instability in Europe,

00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:53.420
but the second fear, if this thing isn't solved,

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.278
that this could cause a kind of contagion or a chain reaction through Europe,

00:07:57.278 --> 00:08:02.291
that people start getting freaked out, they start wanting to not lend to these countries,

00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:04.196
that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,

00:08:04.196 --> 00:08:08.067
they might also have to leave the Eurozone.
