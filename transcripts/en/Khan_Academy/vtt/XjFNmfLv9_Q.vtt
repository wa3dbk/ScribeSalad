00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.380
I've taken this problem from
Chapter 4 of the Chemistry &amp;

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.520
Chemical Reactivity book by
Kotz, Treichel and Townsend,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.000
and I've done it with
their permission.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.070
So let's do this example.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.190
A 1.034 gram sample of impure
oxalic acid is dissolved in

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.440
water and an acid-base
indicator added.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.860
The sample requires 34.47
milliliters of 0.485 molar

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.260
sodium hydroxide to reach
the equivalence point.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.960
What is the mass of oxalic acid,
and what is its mass

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.500
percent in the sample?

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.520
So before we even break into the
math of this, let's just

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.520
think about what's happening.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.370
We have some oxalic acid,
which looks like this.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.930
It's really two carbolic acid
groups joined together, if

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.290
that means anything to you.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.510
Watch the organic chemistry play
list if you want to learn

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.800
more about that.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.120
So we have a double bond to one
oxygen, and then another

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.260
bond to a hydroxide.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.250
We have that on the other
carbon as well.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.240
This right here is what
oxalic acid is.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.040
And it's an interesting acid,
because it can actually donate

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.900
two protons.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.550
This proton can be nabbed off,
and this proton can also be

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.150
contributed.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.445
And it's actually resident
stabalized.

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:22.580
If that doesn't mean anything
to you, don't worry.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.500
You'll learn more about that
in organic chemistry.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.700
But the important thing to
realize here is that there's

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.000
two protons to nab off of it.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.410
Now each molecule of sodium
hydroxide-- remember when you

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.060
put it in the water it really
just dissolves, and you can

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.140
really just think of it as
hydroxide-- each molecule of

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.400
hydroxide can nab one of
the hydrogen protons.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.490
So for every one molecule of
oxalic acid, you're going to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.950
need two hydroxides-- one to nab
this hydrogen proton, and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.260
then another one to nab
that hydrogen proton.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.000
So let's write down the balanced
equation that we're

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.120
dealing with here.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.690
So we're going to start off
with some oxalic acid.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.270
So that has two hydrogens-- so
it's H2-- two carbons, and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.270
then four oxygens-- O4.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.520
It's dissolved in water, so
it's an aqueous solution.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.360
And to that, we're going to
add sodium hydroxide.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.370
Now I just told you that you're
going to need two of

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.790
the hydroxides to fully
neutralize the oxalic acid.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.200
So you're going to
need two of them.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.360
And this is also in our
aqueous solution.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.650
And once the reaction happens,
this guy will have lost both

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.570
of the hydrogen protons,
so let me draw that.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.810
So it will look like this.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.220
No more hydrogen,
so it's C2O4.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.340
It'll have a negative
2 charge.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.280
And actually, you could imagine
that it might be

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.100
attracted to these positively
charged sodiums. And 2 sodiums

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.760
in particular.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.400
So this has a negative
2 charge.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.920
We could even write it there
if you want-- 2 minus.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.230
And then you could have
the sodiums over here.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.790
You have these two sodiums
that have two plus.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.060
And this entire molecules
becomes neutral.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.180
They are attracted
to each other.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.650
They are still in an
aqueous solution.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.130
And then, the hydroxide nabs the
protons, and then you are

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.800
left with just water.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.130
So plus 2 moles-- or 2 molecules
depending on how

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.200
we're viewing this--
plus two waters.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.990
I'll just use that same
orange color.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.270
Plus two H2Os.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.860
One of the hydrogens in each
of the water molecules are

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.030
coming from the oxalic acid, and
so two of these hydrogens

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.910
in these two moles of the water
are coming from one

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.820
entire molecule of
oxalic acid.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.550
Now let's actually
do the math.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.610
We have 34.47 milliliters of
the solution that has the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.460
sodium hydroxide.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.560
And I'm just going to convert
that to liters just so it's

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.630
easier to deal with the molarity
right over there.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:26.810
So we have 34.47 milliliters--
we could write it of the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.950
solution, but we understand
that, that's the case.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:37.290
So let's just So this is times,
we have one liter for

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.570
every 1,000 milliliters.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.300
And then this will give us-- the
milliliters cancel out--

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:57.890
34.47 divided by 1,000 is
0.03447 liters of this 0.485

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.700
molar sodium hydroxide
solution.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.410
So let's figure out how many
actual molecules of sodium

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.000
hydroxide we have. This
is the solution.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.940
And we know its concentration,
0.485 molar-- so let me do

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.740
that in a different color--
0.485 molar, this information

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.460
allows us to figure
out the actual

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.590
molecules of sodium hydroxide.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:30.830
So we want to multiply this by--
we have 0.485 moles of

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:38.380
sodium hydroxide for every
1 liter of this solution.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.310
That's what the molarity
tells us.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.260
We have 0.485 moles per liter.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.740
So the liters cancel out, and
then now we're going to

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.950
actually have to get
a calculator out.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.620
And this'll tell us how many
moles of sodium hydroxide we

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.690
have in this solution.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.690
So let me get my calculator.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.980
There we go.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.860
All right, let me just multiply
these two numbers.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:13.580
So we have 0.03447 times 0.485
is equal to-- let me put this

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.080
down here-- 0.167.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.890
And we only have three
significant digits here, so

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.190
we're going to round to three
significant digits.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.630
So we'll just go with 0.0167.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.250
So let me move that over
off the screen.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:41.570
So this is going to be equal
to 0.0167, and all we have

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.050
left here are moles of
sodium hydroxide.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.620
Now we know that this many moles
of sodium hydroxide are

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.660
going to completely react with
however many moles of oxalic

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.300
acid we have. Now we know that
we need two moles of this for

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.170
every mole of oxalic acid.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.880
Or for every mole of oxalic acid
that completely reacts,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.260
we need two moles of this.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.510
So let's write that down.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.680
And then you color.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:21.730
So we need two moles of sodium
hydroxide, we got that from

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.510
our balanced equation right
there, and it's obvious it

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.660
needs one mole, or one molecule
will take this

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.080
proton, and then you need
another molecule

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.160
to take that proton.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:37.180
So we need two moles of sodium
hydroxide for every one mole

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.030
of oxalic acid.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.040
For every one mole of H2C2O4.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.500
So essentially, we are
just going to divide

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.810
this number by 2.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.090
Let me get the calculator
back.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:58.340
So we're just going to divide
0.0167 divided by 2.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.155
Once again, three significant
digits 0.00835.

00:08:03.155 --> 00:08:12.050
So this is going to 0.00835
moles of oxalic acid, H2C2O4.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.010
So we have the number
of moles, but we to

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.790
figure out the mass.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.590
And we know the molar
mass of oxalic acid.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.580
Let me write these down.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.195
We know that hydrogen has a
molar mass-- let me write it

00:08:29.195 --> 00:08:34.490
this way-- molar mass if you
have a mole of hydrogen, it

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.460
has a molar mass of one gram.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.370
If you have-- and this comes
from its atomic weight-- if

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:49.950
you have carbon its molar mass
is 12 grams. And if you have

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:56.510
oxygen, its molar mass
is 16 grams.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.710
So what's the molar mass
of oxalic acid?

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.410
Well we have two hydrogens,
so that's going to

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.640
be two grams, right?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.830
2 times 1 gram.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.340
That's the hydrogens there.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.630
We have two carbons, so it's
going to be plus 24 grams. 12

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.680
grams for each of
these carbons.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.800
And then we're going to have
four oxygens that weigh in, if

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.970
we have a mole of them,
at 16 grams. So that's

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.850
going to be plus 64.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:23.960
So what does this come out to?

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:30.870
24 plus 64 is 88, right?

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.200
2 plus 6 is 88, right.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:40.420
So it's 88 plus 2 more is 90
grams. So if you had a mole of

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.970
oxalic acid, it would be 90
grams. So we could say 90

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:52.180
grams per mole of H2C2O4.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.880
So let's go back to
the math here.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.790
I'll rewrite it over here.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:08.700
We know we're dealing with
0.00835 moles of

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.130
oxalic acid, H2C2O4.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.010
And now we know its
molar mass.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.160
We know that there are 90
grams-- let me do this in a

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.430
different color, this color's
getting motonous-- we know

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:30.120
that there are 90 grams
of H2C2O4 for

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:36.680
every one mole of H2C2O4.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.870
This is its molar mass.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.530
And now we just multiply this
number, and we'll figure out

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.790
the grams of oxalic acid.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.200
That and that cancels out.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.380
and.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.490
Then we just take the number
that we had and multiply it by

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.860
90, so times 90.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.880
This just says the previous
answer, which is the number of

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.510
moles of oxalic acid times its
molar mass will tell us the

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.860
grams of oxalic acid.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.910
So we get 0.75.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.750
I'll just round it to
2 since we only have

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.000
three significant digits.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.860
The 90 isn't exact, so it's a
little bit-- but I'll just

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.570
round it to three significant
digits.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.940
So 7--.752.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:27.770
This is equal to 0.752 grams
of oxalic acid: H2C2O4.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.520
And I think we've answered
part of the question.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.390
So the first question is, what
is the mass of oxalic acid?

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.800
We've just answered it.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.640
That answer right there
is 0.752 grams.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.980
Now the next part is,
what is its mass

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.600
percent in the sample?

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.600
Well the sample of impure oxalic
acid right over here,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.950
was 1.034 grams. So we just have
to say, what percentage

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:57.060
is 0.752 of 1.034?

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.250
So let's get the calculator
back.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:14.580
So we have the 0.752 divided
by 1.034 and we get 72.7%.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.150
So the answer to the
second part right

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.220
over there is, 72.7%.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.170
We were able to figure out that
this impure oxalic acid

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:29.990
sample is 72.7% actual
oxalic acid.
