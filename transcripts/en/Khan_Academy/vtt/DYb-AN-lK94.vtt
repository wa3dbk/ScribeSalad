00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.796
Now that you've seen some
examples of the chain rule

00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:06.930
in use, I think the actual
definition of the chain rule

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.770
might be more digestible now.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.550
So let me give you the actual
definition of the chain rule.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:27.340
Let's say I have a function f
of x and it equals h of g of x.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.640
And you remember all this
from composite functions.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.350
So the chain rule just says
that the derivative of f of x

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.500
or f prime of x is equal to
the derivative of this inner

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:48.370
function, g prime of x times
the derivative of this h

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.600
function, h prime of x.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.105
But it's not going to
be just h prime of x.

00:00:54.105 --> 00:00:59.070
It's going to be h
prime of g of x.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.750
So let's apply that to some
examples like we were

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.290
doing before, and I think
it'll make some sense.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:17.870
So let's say we had f of x is
equal to x squared plus 5x

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.080
plus 3, all of this
to the fifth power.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.580
So in this example, what's
h of x, what's g of x, and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.440
you know what f of x is.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.240
Well let's say g of x would
be this inner function.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.010
So we would say-- let me pick a
different color-- g of x here

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:47.260
is x squared plus 5x plus 3.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.480
It's the stuff, f g of x.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.715
Well h of g of x is this whole
thing, so what would h of x be?

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.840
This is h of g of x, but
h of x would just be x

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.940
to the fifth, right?

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.530
Because this expression as you
took this entire g of x and you

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.370
put it in for x right here.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.630
I think that make sense if you
take this entire expression and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.720
you substitute x here for this
entire expression you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.810
get this expression.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:30.280
And this shows that this
is equal to h of g of x.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.450
If you just take this blue part
and substitute it for x, you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.410
get this entire expression.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.860
So the chain rule just tells us
that the derivative of this,

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.980
that f prime of x-- and I have
a feeling I'm going to run out

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.570
of space-- f prime of x-- well
actually before I do anything,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.950
let's figure out the
derivatives of g

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.470
of x and h of x.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.700
g of x of g prime of x-- let me
draw a little line here to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.530
divide it out, I know I'm
running out of space.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.530
So g prime of x is
equal to 2x plus 5.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.290
2x plus 5, and then derivative
3 is just 0, right?

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.150
And the derivative of h of
x? h prime of x is equal

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.410
to 5 x to the fourth.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.270
So the chain rule just says
that the derivative of this

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.530
entire composite function
is just-- let me just

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.240
write it down here.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.850
I'm doing this to
optimally confuse you.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.050
The derivative of this entire
function is just g prime of x.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.450
Well we figured out with g
prime of x is here, it's 2x

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:55.260
plus 5 times h times
h prime of g of x.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.310
So what's h prime of g of x?

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.750
Well h prime of x is 5x to
the fourth, but we want

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.800
h prime of g of x.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:11.330
So h prime of g of x
would equal 5 times g

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.190
of x to the fourth.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.310
And we know what g of x is,
it's this whole thing.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.970
So it would be times 5, and
this whole thing x squared

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.990
plus 5x plus 3, all that
to the fourth power.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.815
I think I have truly, truly
confused you, so I'm going

00:04:29.815 --> 00:04:33.630
to try to do a couple
of more examples.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.310
Clear this.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.560
OK.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.320
Let me write it up here again.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:55.870
So if we say that f of x is
equal to h of g of x, then f

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:07.055
prime of x is equal to g prime
of x times h prime of g of x.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.955
So I'll do another example.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:28.750
Let's say that g of x is equal
to x to the seventh minus

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.150
3x to the ninth is 3.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:44.870
And let's say that h of x is
equal to-- let's do something

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.260
reasonably straightforward.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:55.570
Let's say h of x is
x to the minus 10.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.430
So what is f of x? f of x is
just h of g of x, and this

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.660
should be a bit of a reminder
from composite functions.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.310
So let's see.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:15.995
h of g of x would just be-- you
take g of x and you substitute

00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:25.090
it for x here, so it would just
be this expression, x to the

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.670
seventh minus 3x to the minus
third, and then all of that

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.810
to the minus 10th power.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.720
So this is our f of x.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.700
And this is of course equal to
f of x, right, because f of

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.350
x is equal to h of g of x.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.050
I know this very confusing,
but bear with me.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.650
Maybe you have to watch
the video twice and it'll

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.130
start making more sense.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.770
Well we want to now figure
out what f prime of x is.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.570
Well the chain rule tells us
all it is, is we take the

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.930
derivative of g of x, right?

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.240
So the derivative
of g of x is what?

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.450
That's easy.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.190
Or hopefully it's easy by now.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:12.280
Derivative of g of x is 7x to
the sixth, and minus 3 times

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.720
minus 3 is plus 9x
to the minus 4.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.790
I just took minus 3 and went
down 1, so that's g prime of x.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:31.130
And then times h
prime of g of x.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.550
Well what's h prime of x?

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.010
That's easy.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.890
That's just minus 10
times x to the minus 11.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.050
But we want to do h
prime of g of x.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.590
So instead of having an x here,
we're going to substitute that

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.320
x with the entire g
of x expression.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:55.760
So this is just times 10 time
something to the minus eleven,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.600
and that something
is just g of x.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:05.780
x to the seventh, minus 3x
access to the minus 3.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.780
And there's our answer. f prime
of x is the derivative of kind

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.300
of the inner function, g of x,
times the derivative of the

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.420
outer function, but instead of
it just being applied to x it'd

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.960
be applied to the entire g of x
instead of an x being here.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.470
Maybe I've confused you more.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.680
Let me do one quick example
just to show you that you

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.940
don't have to kind of do this
whole h of g of every time.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:48.980
So if I have f of x is equal to
5 times minus x to the eighth,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:54.180
plus x to the minus eighth,
all of that over to

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.630
the fifth power.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.610
If I want to figure out f prime
of x I just take the derivative

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:05.480
of this inner function I guess
I could call it, so that's

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:12.480
minus 8x to the seventh minus
8x-- because it's just take the

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.580
negative 8-- to the minus
ninth, times the derivative

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.920
of this larger function.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:27.740
So 5 times 5 is 25 times
something to the fourth.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.440
And that something is just
going to be this expression

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.730
minus x to the eighth plus
x to the minus eighth.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.290
And we're done.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.100
You could simplify it.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.080
You could multiply this 25 out
and do et cetera, et cetera.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.540
Hopefully this gives you more
of an intuition of what the

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.730
chain rule is all about, and
I'm going to do a lot more

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.910
examples in the next couple
of presentations as well.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:48.250
See you soon.
