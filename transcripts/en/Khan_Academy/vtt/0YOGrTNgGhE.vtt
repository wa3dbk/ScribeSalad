00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.930
Let's imagine that instead of
having two charges, we just

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.210
have one charge by itself,
sitting in a

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.210
vacuum, sitting in space.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.650
So that's this charge here, and
let's say its charge is Q.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.950
That's some number,
whatever it is.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.390
That's it's charge.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.850
And I want to know, if I were to
place another charge close

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.720
to this Q, within its sphere of
influence, what's going to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.880
happen to that other charge?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.820
What's going to be the
net impact on it?

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.540
And we know if this has some
charge, if we put another

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.130
charge here, if this is 1
coulomb and we put another

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.720
charge here that's 1 coulomb,
that they're both positive,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.550
they're going to repel each
other, so there will be some

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.310
force that pushes the
next charge away.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.920
If it's a negative charge and I
put it here, it'll be even a

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.580
stronger force that pulls it
in because it'll be closer.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.550
So in general, there's this
notion of what we can call an

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.070
electric field around
this charge.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.320
And what's an electric field?

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.019
We can debate whether it really
exists, but what it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.880
allows us to do is imagine that
somehow this charge is

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.280
affecting the space around it
in some way that whenever I

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.470
put-- it's creating a field that
whenever I put another

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.530
charge in that field, I can
predict how the field will

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.630
affect that charge.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.350
So let's put it in a little more
quantitative term so I

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.990
stop confusing you.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.345
So Coulomb's Law told us that
the force between two charges

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:33.945
is going to be equal to
Coulomb's constant times-- and

00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:37.090
in this case, the first
charge is big Q.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.890
And let's say that the second
notional charge that I

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.170
eventually put in this field
is small q, and then you

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.600
divide by the distance
between them.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.810
Sometimes it's called r because
you can kind of view

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.340
the distance as the
radial distance

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.300
between the two charges.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.350
So sometimes it says r squared,
but it's the distance

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.910
between them.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.890
So what we want to do if we want
to calculate the field,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.260
we want to figure out how much
force is there placed per

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.710
charge at any point around this
Q, so, say, at a given

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.460
distance out here.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.070
At this distance, we want to
know, for a given Q, what is

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.460
the force going to be?

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.390
So what we can do is we could
take this equation up here and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.890
divide both sides by this small
1, and say, OK, the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.470
force-- and I will arbitrarily
switch colors.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.100
The force per charge at this
point-- let's call that d1--

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.110
is equal to Coulomb's constant
times the charge of the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.440
particle that's creating the
field divided by-- well, in

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.360
this case, it's d1--
d1 squared, right?

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.280
Or we could say, in general--
and this is the definition of

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.860
the electric field, right?

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.310
Well, this is the electric field
at the point d1, and if

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.400
we wanted a more general
definition of the electric

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.260
field, we'll just make this a
general variable, so instead

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.590
of having a particular distance,
we'll define the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.870
field for all distances
away from the point Q.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.100
So the electric field could be
defined as Coulomb's constant

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.110
times the charge creating the
field divided by the distance

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.210
squared, the distance we are
away from the charge.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.890
So essentially, we've defined--
if you give me a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.440
force and a point around this
charge anywhere, I can now

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.610
tell you the exact force.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.970
For example, if I told you that
I have a minus 1 coulomb

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:43.490
charge and the distance is equal
to-- oh, I don't know.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.610
The distance is equal to let's
say-- let's make it easy.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.710
Let's say 2 meters.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.590
So first of all, we can say,
in general, what is the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.370
electric field 2 meters
away from?

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.310
So what is the electric
field out here?

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.090
This is 2, right?

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.320
And it's going to be
2 meters away.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.160
It's radial so it's actually
along this whole circle.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.180
What is the electric
field there?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.160
Well, the electric field at
that point is going to be

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.430
equal to what?

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.580
And it's also a vector
quantity, right?

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.529
Because we're dividing a vector
quantity by a scalar

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.519
quantity charge.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.300
So the electric field at that
point is going to be k times

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.360
whatever charge it is divided
by 2 meters, so divided by 2

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.180
meters squared, so that's 4,
right, distance squared.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.360
And so if I know the electric
field at any given point and

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.000
then I say, well, what happens
if I put a negative 1 coulomb

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.780
charge there, all I have to do
is say, well, the force is

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.600
going to be equal to the charge
that I place there

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.910
times the electric field
at that point, right?

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.300
So in this case, we said the
electric field at this point

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.950
is equal to-- and the units for
electric field are newtons

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.790
per coulomb, and that
makes sense, right?

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.890
Because it's force divided
by charge,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.650
so newtons per coulomb.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.770
So if we know that the electric
charge-- well, let me

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.880
put some real numbers here.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.840
Let's say that this
is-- I don't know.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.782
It's going to be a really large
number, but let's say

00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:10.600
this-- let me pick
a smaller number.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.670
Let's say this is 1
times 10 to the

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.536
minus 6 coulombs, right?

00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:20.010
If that's 1 times 10 to the
minus 6 coulombs, what is the

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.940
electric field at that point?

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.890
Let me switch colors again.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.960
What's the electric field
at that point?

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.620
Well, the electric field at
that point is going to be

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.170
equal to Coulomb's constant,
which is 9 times 10 to the

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.910
ninth-- times the charge
generating the field-- times 1

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.190
times 10 to the minus
6 coulombs.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.980
And then we are 2 meters
away, so 2 squared.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.455
So that equals 9 times 10 to
the third divided by 4.

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:52.540
So I don't know, what is that?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:00.970
2.5 times 10 to the third or
2,500 newtons per coulomb.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.660
So we know that this is
generating a field that when

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.430
we're 2 meters away, at a radius
of 2 meters, so roughly

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.800
that circle around it, this is
generating a field that if I

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.300
were to put-- let's say I were
to place a 1 coulomb charge

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.860
here, the force exerted on that
1 coulomb charge is going

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.880
to be equal to 1 coulomb times
the electric fields, times

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.620
2,500 newtons per coulomb.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.210
So the coulombs cancel out, and
you'll have 2,500 newtons,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.090
which is a lot, and that's
because 1 coulomb is a very,

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.020
very large charge.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.980
And then a question you should
ask yourself: If this is 1

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.830
times 10 to the negative 6
coulombs and this is 1

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.120
coulomb, in which direction
will the force be?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.150
Well, they're both positive,
so the force is going to be

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.870
outwards, right?

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.040
So let's take this notion and
see if we can somehow draw an

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.490
electric field around a
particle, just to get an

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.870
intuition of what happens when
we later put a charge anywhere

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.120
near the particle.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.440
So there's a couple of ways to
visualize an electric field.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.330
One way to visualize it is if I
have a-- let's say I have a

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.640
point charge here Q.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.820
What would be the path of a
positive charge if I placed it

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.060
someplace on this Q?

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.000
Well, if I put a positive charge
here and this Q is

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.600
positive, that positive charge
is just going to accelerate

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.370
outward, right?

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.890
It's just going to go straight
out, but it's going to

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.810
accelerate at an ever-slowing
rate, right?

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.150
Because here, when you're really
close, the outward

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.030
force is very strong, and then
as you get further and further

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.290
away, the electrostatic force
from this charge becomes

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.170
weaker and weaker, or you could
say the field becomes

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.000
weaker and weaker.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.660
But that's the path of a--
it'll just be radially

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.410
outward-- of a positive
test charge.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.140
And then if I put it here, well,
it would be radially

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.580
outward that way.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.660
It wouldn't curve the
way I drew it.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.620
It would be a straight line.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.160
I should actually use
the line tool.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.190
If I did it here, it would be
like that, but then I can't

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.030
draw the arrows.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.200
If I was here, it would
out like that.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.700
I think you get the picture.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.890
At any point, a positive test
charge would just go straight

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.140
out away from our charge Q.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.550
And to some degree, one measure
of-- and these are

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.240
called electric field lines.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.700
And one measure of how strong
the field is, is if you

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:37.120
actually took a unit area
and you saw how dense

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.960
the field lines are.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.320
So here, they're relatively
sparse, while if I did that

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.750
same area up here-- I know
it's not that obvious.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.910
I'm getting more
field lines in.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.220
But actually, that's not a good
way to view it because

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.620
I'm covering so much area.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.820
Let me undo both of them.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.470
You can imagine if I had a lot
more lines, if I did this

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.880
area, for example, in that area,
I'm capturing two of

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.800
these field lines.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.410
Well, if I did that exact same
area out here, I'm only

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.070
capturing one of the field
lines, although you could have

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.460
a bunch more in between here.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.800
And that makes sense, right?

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.470
Because as you get closer and
closer to the source of the

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.380
electric field, the charge
gets stronger.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.905
Another way that you could have
done this, and this would

00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:23.320
have actually more clearly shown
the magnitude of the

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.046
field at any point, is you could
have-- you could say,

00:09:27.046 --> 00:09:30.470
OK, if that's my charge Q, you
could say, well, really close,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.300
the field is strong.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.440
So at this point, the vector,
the newtons per coulomb, is

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.430
that strong, that strong, that
strong, that strong.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.630
We're just taking
sample points.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.360
You can't possibly draw them
at every single point.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.680
So at that point, that's
the vector.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.420
That's the electric
field vector.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.320
But then if we go a little bit
further out, the vector is

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.090
going to be-- it falls off.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.770
This one should be shorter, then
this one should be even

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.510
shorter, right?

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.990
You could pick any point and you
could actually calculate

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.370
the electric field vector, and
the further you go out, the

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.130
shorter and shorter the electric
field vectors get.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.340
And so, in general, there's all
sorts of things you can

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.240
draw the electric fields for.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.560
Let's say that this is a
positive charge and that this

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.640
is a negative charge.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.010
Let me switch colors so I don't
have to erase things.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.740
If I have to draw the path of
a positive test charge, it

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.490
would go out radially from
this charge, right?

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.350
But then as it goes out, it'll
start being attracted to this

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.820
one the closer it gets to the
negative, and then it'll curve

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.720
in to the negative charge and
these arrows go like this.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.580
And if I went from here, the
positive one will be repelled

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.140
really strong, really strong,
it'll accelerate fast and it's

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.230
rate of acceleration will slow
down, but then as it gets

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.870
closer to the negative one,
it'll speed up again, and then

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.860
that would be its path.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.260
Similarly, if there was a
positive test charge here, its

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.430
path would be like
that, right?

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.600
If it was here, its path
would be like that.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.704
If it was here, it's path
would be like that.

00:11:05.704 --> 00:11:09.800
If it was there, maybe its path
is like that, and at some

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.980
point, its path might never get
to that-- this out here

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.440
might just go straight
out that way.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.130
That one would just go straight
out, and here, the

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.550
field lines would just
come in, right?

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.950
A positive test charge would
just be naturally attracted to

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.470
that negative charge.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.490
So that's, in general, what
electric field lines show, and

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.570
we could use our little area
method and see that over here,

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.970
if we picked a given area, the
electric field is much weaker

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.580
than if we picked that
same area right here.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.120
We're getting more field lines
in than we do right there.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.650
So that hopefully gives you
a little sense for what an

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.820
electric field is.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.920
It's really just a way of
visualizing what the impact

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.810
would be on a test charge
if you bring it

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.010
close to another charge.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.570
And hopefully, you
know a little bit

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.050
about Coulomb's constant.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.280
And let's just do a very
simple-- I'm getting this out

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.990
of the AP Physics book, but they
say-- let's do a little

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.140
simple problem: Calculate the
static electric force between

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.850
a 6 times 10 to the negative
sixth coulomb charge.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:12.950
So 6 times-- oh, no, that's
not on an electric field.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.070
Oh, here it says: What is the
force acting on an electron

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:21.290
placed in an external electric
field where the electric field

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:27.330
is-- they're saying it is 100
newtons per coulomb at that

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.130
point, wherever the
electron is.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.250
So the force on that, the force
in general, is just

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.180
going to be the charge times the
electric field, and they

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.260
say it's an electron,
so what's the

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.950
charge of an electron?

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.570
Well, we know it's negative, and
then in the first video,

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:45.860
we learned that its charge is
1.6 times 10 to the negative

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:54.660
nineteenth coulombs times
100 newtons per coulomb.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.200
The coulombs cancel out.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.600
And this is 10 squared, right?

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.240
This is 10 to the positive 2, so
it'll be 10 to the minus 19

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.160
times 10 to the positive 2.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.650
The force will be minus
1.6 times 10 to

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.840
the minus 17 newtons.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.150
So the problems are
pretty simple.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.952
I think the more important thing
with electric fields is

00:13:15.952 --> 00:13:18.990
to really understand intuitively
what's going on,

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.530
and kind of how it's stronger
near the point charges, and

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.080
how it gets weaker as it goes
away, and what the field lines

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.710
depict, and how they can be used
to at least approximate

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:29.990
the strength of the field.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.230
I will see you in
the next video.
