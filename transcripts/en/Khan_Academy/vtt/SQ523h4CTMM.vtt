00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.510
Paulo wants to earn $1500
by mowing lawns.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.980
He will charge $35 for
each lawn he mows.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.860
What is the minimum number of
lawns the Paulo needs to mow

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.790
to reach his goal of $1500?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.770
So we need to figure out the
minimum number of lawns that

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.700
Paulo needs to mow.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.470
Now, whatever that number is,
that number times $35, because

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.580
that's how much he's going
to get per lawn.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.470
So the number that he has to
mow times $35 needs to be

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.450
greater than 1,500.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.640
So to figure out that number,
let's just divide 1,500

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.820
divided by 35.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.460
Maybe it goes evenly, and
that'll be the number of lawn

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.740
he needs to mow.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:57.210
So we're going to take 1,500
and divide it by 35 because

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.070
that's how much he gets
paid per lawn.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.060
Now 35 does not go into 1, so we
have to add another digit.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.570
35 does not go into 15.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.570
35 goes into 150.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.170
Well, 30 goes into
150 five times.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.700
35 is bigger so it won't
go into it five times.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.620
Let's try out 4.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.620
Let's see if it goes
into it four times.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.630
4 times 5 is 20.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.880
Let's regroup the 2,
or carry the 2.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.900
Four times 3 is 12.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.580
12 plus 2 is 14.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.480
Now we subtract.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.930
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.160
5 minus 4 is 1.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.500
The ones cancel out, and
then we bring down

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.940
this zero right here.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.440
35 goes into 100.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.140
Well, 35 times 2 is 70, and if
you add another-- 35 times 3

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.440
is 105, so that's too big, so
it goes into it two times.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.850
2 times 5 is 10.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.250
Let's carry the 1.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.680
2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is
7, or 35 times 2 is 70.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.190
You subtract.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.370
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.960
0 minus 7, you can't do it.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.360
You could already view it as 10
minus 7, or if you want to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.580
go in the traditional way, this
0 can take or borrow 1

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.810
from this 1, so that
becomes a 0.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.330
This becomes a 10.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.060
10 minus 7 is 30.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.810
And so there's nothing
left to bring down.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.510
so we now know that 35 goes into
1,500 forty-two times,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.950
but there's a remainder of 30.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.550
If he mowed 42 lawns, he'd
be 30 short of 1,500.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.320
35 times 42 is 30
less than 1,500.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.090
What would it be?

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.240
1,470.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.300
So in order to make 1,500, he's
going to have to go over

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.350
it, so he's going to have to
do one more lawn than this.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.750
So just to remind ourselves,
if we just divide-- let me

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.260
write it here.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:06.160
1,500 divided by 35 is equal
to 42, remainder 30, so 42

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.430
won't be enough lawns.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.630
We're going to have more to-- we
have 30 more bucks to earn,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.560
so he's going to have to mow one
more lawn to get another

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.110
$35, so he's going to have
$5 left over after he

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.470
makes up this 30.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.780
So he's going to have to mow 43
lawns if he really wants to

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.640
cross this threshold of $1500.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.480
If he does mow the 43 lawns,
he'll have more than $1500.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.690
He'll actually have $5
more than $1500.
