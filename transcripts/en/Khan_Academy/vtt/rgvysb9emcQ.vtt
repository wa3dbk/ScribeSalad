00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.080
Let's do a couple of problems
graphing linear equations.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.280
They are a bunch of ways to
graph linear equations.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.560
What we'll do in this video
is the most basic way.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.790
Where we will just plot a
bunch of values and then

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.750
connect the dots.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.830
I think you'll see
what I'm saying.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.460
So here I have an equation,
a linear equation.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.990
I'll rewrite it just in case
that was too small. y is equal

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.330
to 2x plus 7.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.180
I want to graph this
linear equation.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.730
Before I even take out the graph
paper, what I could do

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.450
is set up a table.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.840
Where I pick a bunch of x values
and then I can figure

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.180
out what y value would
correspond to

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.980
each of those x values.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.450
So for example, if x is equal
to-- let me start really low--

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.670
if x is equal to minus 2--
or negative 2, I should

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.310
say-- what is y?

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.620
Well, you substitute
negative 2 up here.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.200
It would be 2 times
negative 2 plus 7.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.060
This is negative 4 plus 7.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.270
This is equal to 3.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
If x is equal to-- I'm just
picking x values at random

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.209
that might be indicative of--
I'll probably do three or four

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.190
points here.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.470
So what happens when
x is equal to 0?

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.390
Then y is going to be equal
to 2 times 0 plus 7.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.530
Is going to be equal to 7.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.870
I just happen to be
going up by 2.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.270
You could be going up
by 1 or you could be

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.840
picking numbers at random.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.600
When x is equal to
2, what is y?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.090
It'll be 2 times 2 plus 7.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.070
So 4 plus 7 is equal to 11.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.990
I could keep plotting
points if I like.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.630
We should already have
enough to graph it.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.700
Actually to plot any line, you
actually only need two points.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.130
So we already have one
more than necessary.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.530
Actually, let me just do one
more just to show you that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.050
this really is a line.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.750
So what happens when
x is equal to 4?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.670
Actually, just to not go up by
2, let's do x is equal to 8.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.600
Just to pick a random number.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.400
Then y is going to be 2 times 8
plus 7, which is-- well this

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.010
might go off of our graph
paper-- but 2 times 8 is 16

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.139
plus 7 is equal to 23.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.940
Now let's graph it.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.580
Let me do my y-axis
right there.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.050
That is my y-axis.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.550
Let me do my x-axis.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.220
I have a lot of positive values
here, so a lot of space

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.540
on the positive y-side.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.200
That is my x-axis.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.540
And then I use the points x
is equal to negative 2.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.420
That's negative 1.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:42.440
That's 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.800
Those are our x values.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.430
Then we can go up
into the y-axis.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.190
I'll do it at a slightly
different scale because these

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.630
numbers get large
very quickly.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.690
So maybe I'll do it in
increments of 2.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:06.800
So this could be 2, 4,
6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.370
I could just keep going
up there, but

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.030
let's plot these points.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.540
So the first coordinate I have
is x is equal to negative 2, y

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.770
is equal to 3.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.770
So I can write my coordinate.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.945
It's going to be the point
negative 2, 3.

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:20.990
x is negative 2.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.320
y is 3.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.810
3 would land right over there.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.990
So that's our first one,
negative 2, 3.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.050
Then our next point.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.640
0, 7.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.600
We do it in that color.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.950
0, 7.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.880
x is 0.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.340
Y is 7.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.330
Right there.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.980
0, 7.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.200
We have this one
in green here.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.340
Point 2, 11.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.075
2, 11 would be right
about there.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.560
And then this last point-- this
is actually going to fall

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.080
off of my graph.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.440
8, 23.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.410
That's going to be way
up here someplace.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.230
If you can even see
what I'm doing.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.650
This is 8, 23.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.090
If we connect the dots, you'll
see a line forms. Let me

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.000
connect these dots.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.380
I've obviously hand drawn it, so
it might not be a perfectly

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.390
straight line.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.290
If you had a computer do it, it
would be a straight line.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.029
So you could keep picking x
values and figuring out the

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.920
corresponding y values.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.520
In the situation y is a function
of our x values.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.200
If you kept plotting every
point, you'll get every line.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.220
If you picked every possible x
and plotted every one, you get

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.400
every point on the line.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.400
Let's do another problem.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.240
At the airport, you can
change your money from

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.490
dollars into Euros.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.360
The service costs $5.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.380
and for every additional dollar,
you get EUR 0.7.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.470
Make a table for this and plot
the function on a graph.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.430
Use your graph to determine how
many Euros you would get

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.320
if you give the office $50.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.380
I will write Euros is equal to--
so let's see, it's going

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.710
to be dollars.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.040
So you're going to have
to give your dollars.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.290
Right off of the bat, they're
going to take $5.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.320
So dollars minus 5.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.430
So immediately this
service costs $5.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.480
And then everything that's
leftover-- this is your

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.620
leftover-- you get EUR 0.7 for
every leftover dollars.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.410
You get 0.7 for whatever's
leftover.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.590
So this is the relationship.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.770
Now we can plot points-- we
could actually answer their

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.750
question right off the bat.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.190
If you give them $50, we don't
even have to look at a graph.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.280
But we will look at a graph
right after this.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.190
So if you did Euros is equal
to-- if you have given them

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.030
$50-- it would be 0.7
times 50 minus 5.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.350
You gave them 50.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.160
They took 5 as a service fee.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.000
So this is just $45 It would
be 0.7 times 45.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.060
I could do that right here.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.270
45 times 0.7.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.480
7 times 5 is 35.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.660
4 times 7 is 28 plus 3 is 31.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.800
And then we have only one number
behind the decimal,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.810
only this 7.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.880
So it's 31.5.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.530
So if you give them $50, you're
going to get EUR 31.5.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.300
Euros, not dollars.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.010
So we answered their question,
but let's actually do it

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.610
graphically.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.330
Let's do a table.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.340
Maybe I'll get a
calculator out.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.580
I'll refer to that
in a little bit.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.230
So let's say dollars
you give them.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.200
And how many Euros do you get?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.810
I'll just put a bunch
of random numbers.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.100
If you give them $5, they're
just going to take

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.580
your $5 for the fee.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.620
You're going to get $5 minus
5, which is 0 times 0.7.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.600
So you're going to
get nothing back.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.570
So there's really no good reason
for you to do that.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.520
Then if you give them $10.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.860
What's going to happen?

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.630
If you give them $10, 10
minus 5 is 5 times 0.7.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.790
You're going to get $3-- or
I should say EUR 3.50.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.430
3.5 Euros, you'll get.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.690
Now what happens if
you give them $30?

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.840
Actually let me say 25.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.420
If you give him $25,
25 minus 5 is 20.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.620
20 times 0.7 is $14.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.470
I'll do one more value.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.460
Let's say you gave them $55.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.650
This makes the math easy
because then you

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.790
subtract that 5 out.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:53.170
55 minus 5 is 50 times
0.7 is $35.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.260
Is that right?

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.230
Yep, that's right.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.890
You'll get EUR 35
I should say.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:58.500
These are all Euros.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.820
I keep wanting to say dollars.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.610
Let's plot this.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.620
All of these values are
positive, so I only have to

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.240
draw the first quadrant here.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:17.540
And so the dollars-- let's go
in increments of 5, 10, 15,

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:27.720
20, 25, 30, 35, 40,
45, 50, 55.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.070
I made my x-axis a little
shorter than I needed to.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.390
All the way up to 55.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.890
And then the y-axis.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.090
I'll go in increments of 5.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:45.550
So that's 5, 10, 15,
20, 25, 30, 35.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.330
Well that's a little bit too
much of an increment.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.220
35.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.230
Now let's plot these points.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.200
I give them $5.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.440
I get EUR 0.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.070
This right here is Euros.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.176
This is the dollars.

00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:00.930
The dollars is the independent
variable and we figure out the

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.670
Euros from it.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.530
Or the Euros I get
is dependent on

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.330
the dollars I get.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.790
If I give $10, I get EUR 3.50.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.430
3.50-- it's hard to read.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.850
Maybe 3.50 would be right
around there.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.040
If I give $25, I get EUR 14.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.650
25, 14 is right about there.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.090
Obviously, I'm hand drawing it,
so it's not going to be

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.230
quite exact.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.460
If I get $55, I get EUR 35.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.900
So 55, 35 right there.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.450
If I were to connect to the
dots, I should get something

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.410
that looks pretty
close to a line.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.340
If I did it-- if I was
a computer, it would

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.150
be exactly a line.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.650
That looks pretty good.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.400
Then we could eyeball what
they asked us to do.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.750
Use your graph to determine how
many Euros you would get

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.590
if you give the office $50.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.660
This is 50 right here.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.270
So you go bam, bam, bam, bam,
bam, bam, bam, bam.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.020
I'm at the graph.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.900
Then you go all the way--
actually I drew that last

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.170
point on the graph a little
bit incorrectly.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.420
Let me.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.670
35 is right here.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.940
Let me redraw that point.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.870
35 is right there roughly.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.160
So 55, 35 is right there.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.900
So let me redraw my line.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.880
It will look-- I lost 25.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.470
25, 14 is right there.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.670
So my graph looks something
like that.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.010
That's my best attempt.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.350
Now let's answer the question.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.190
We give them $50 right there.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.480
You go up, up, up, up,
up, up, up. $50.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.030
The person is going to get.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.430
You go all the way to
the left-hand side.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.550
That's right about 31.50.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.370
We figured out exactly
using the formula.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.830
But you can see, you can eyeball
it from the graph and

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.860
figure out any amount
of dollars.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.540
If you give them $20, you're
going to go all

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.860
the way over here.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.090
You'll figure out that it should
be-- well $20 should be

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.540
about 7.50.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.465
The imprecision in my graph-- in
my drawing the graph makes

00:10:58.465 --> 00:11:00.030
it a little bit less exact.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.330
When you say 20 minus 5 is 15.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.230
15 times-- actually it'll
be a little over

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.640
$10, which is right.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.480
It's right over there.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.670
If you put $20 in there,
20 minus 5 is 15.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:18.340
15 times 0.7 is $10.50,
which is right there.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.850
So you can look at any point
in the graph and figure out

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.250
how many Euros you'll get.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.130
Let's do this one where
we'll do a little bit

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.270
of reading a graph.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.730
The graph-- I think it said
use the graph below.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.420
Oh, the graph below shows
a conversion chart for

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.420
converting between weight
in kilograms

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.990
and weight in pounds.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.710
Use it to convert the following
measurements.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.050
We have kilograms here
and pounds here.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.270
So they want 4 kilograms into
weight into pounds.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.820
So if we look at this
right here, 4

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.640
kilograms is right there.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.150
We just follow where
the graph is.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.610
So 4 kilograms into pounds, it
looks like, I don't know, a

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.210
little bit under 9 pounds.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.035
So a little bit less than--
so almost, I'll

00:12:05.035 --> 00:12:07.930
write almost 9 pounds.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.270
You can't exactly see.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.310
It's a little less than
9 pounds right there.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.370
4 kilograms. Now 9 kilograms.
We go over here.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.310
9 kilograms. Go all
the way up.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:24.700
That looks like almost
exactly 20 pounds.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.570
Here they say 12 pounds into
weight in kilograms. Actually

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.030
kilograms is mass, but I
won't get particular.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.120
So 12 pounds.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.670
Go over here.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.460
Pounds.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:40.390
12 pounds in kilograms
looks like 5 1/2.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.090
Approximately 5 1/2.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.040
And then 17 pounds
to kilograms.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.390
So 17 is right there.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:58.120
17 pounds to kilograms looks
right about 7 1/2 kilograms.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.910
Anyway, hopefully that these
examples made you a little bit

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.550
more comfortable with graphing
equations and reading graphs

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.290
of equations.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.450
I'll see you in the
next video.
