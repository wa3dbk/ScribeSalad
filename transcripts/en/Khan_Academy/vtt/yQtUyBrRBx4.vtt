00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.170
Everything we've talked about
so far with this startup

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.800
company selling socks and all
of that, has been raising

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.710
money from an equity.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.350
We raised private money-- when
the company was private it

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.980
went to VCs and it went to angel
investors, and maybe you

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.790
could go to your friends and
family to raise money.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.500
And then the company could go
public and raise money from

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.640
the public markets.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.000
But there's actually
two ways that a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.220
company can raise capital.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.125
So this is why this playlist is
called capital markets, or

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:32.500
it's part of it, the name
of raise capital.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.870
Capital is just essentially--
I mean the easy way to think

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.160
about it is you're raising cash
that you want to invest

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.240
in some way to grow your
business or to sustain your

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.820
business or start
your business.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.610
So everything we talked about so
far was equity, and that's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.080
essentially selling shares in
your company to raise money.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.360
And so that's all of
those VC examples.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.990
The equity investor-- so when
you sell equity, you're

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.070
essentially selling-- you're
kind of making that person

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.600
who's buying the stock-- you
know, an equity is the same

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.920
thing as stock-- you're making
the person who's buying a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.960
stock kind of a partner
in the company.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.550
So if the company-- let's say
there's two situations-- if

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.260
the company goes bankrupt-- and
I'll talk a lot more about

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.080
what bankruptcy even means--
but if the company goes

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.770
bankrupt, all the shareholders
end up with nothing.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.880
They end up with nil.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.580
But if the company has a lot
of upside, the stock gets a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.010
lot of upside.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.610
Because they're partners
in it.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.510
If this was a company, that
start-up that we talked about,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.000
if it turns into Amazon.com and
becomes a billion-dollar

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.970
company, everyone is going
to do really well.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.630
Everyone's going to share
in that upside.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.890
But there's another way to raise
money, and actually this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.390
is probably something that's
more familiar at

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.610
the household level.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.680
I mean at the household level
you never raise equity.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.860
You never say, you know what--
well you can, but you're not

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.400
going to say hey, I need to buy
a house, why don't I go to

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.890
my rich friend and offer to sell
10% of the stake in my

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.460
house to him and he'll be kind
of a partner in my house.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.570
That could happen but for the
most part it doesn't.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.360
Usually when you do something on
a personal level you raise

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.610
money through debt.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.940
And that's interesting.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.350
So what's good about debt is
it's-- so let's think about it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.180
from the point of view of
the person who's lending

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.480
the money to you.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.880
Debt is just borrowing money.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.300
I think all of us know what
borrowing money is.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.830
I go to my rich friend and I say
hey, could I borrow $1 and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.630
I'll give you $1.25 in a year?

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.340
And he says, OK, you're
good for it.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.290
But I'm essentially promising
I'm going to give the money

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.860
back at some future date.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.060
If I sell equity, I'm not
promising anything.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.240
I'm like hey, I got a great
business, why don't you give

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.700
$1 and then you get a 20%
cut of my business.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.840
If my business does awesome,
you get 20% of all of the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.900
profits of my business.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.010
If my business does horrible,
well you took a risk, you get

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.370
nothing and I get nothing.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.310
Debt says regardless of how my
business does, if it does

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.160
awesome all you're going
to get is the interest.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.930
That's kind of the upside.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.550
So the upside's limited,
right?

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.060
If I borrow money at 9%
interest, all that person's

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.230
going to get is 9%.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.230
Even if my company becomes the
next Google or Microsoft or

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.810
whatever else, that person's
just going to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.170
get 9% on their money.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.440
While this person might have
gotten a hundred times their

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.930
money because they made a bet.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.080
On the other hand, this downside
is much lower.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.470
So limited downside.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.920
Because they're going to get
their money back at a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.560
certain-- you know, there's a
certain payment schedule.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.550
And they're going to get their
money back before the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.740
stockholders-- so let's say
in a situation where the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.180
company's going into
difficulty-- and we'll do a

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.130
whole playlist on bankruptcy--
the people who lend money to

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.030
the company will see their money
before the stockholders

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.150
see anything.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.750
So how does all of this come
out from the balance sheet?

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.040
So let's say we have
a public company.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.430
If you wonder what a CFO at a
company does, this is really

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.370
the main decision that they're
always making.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.010
Do we raise money-- well, how
do we raise money if we need

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.890
it, and do we raise money from
the equity markets or from the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.850
debt markets?

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.010
So let's come up with
a company again.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.840
Let's say that that's
its current assets.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.450
Not current-- I don't want to
say current assets, it's the

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.649
assets that it currently has.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.470
Current assets means something
different, and we'll talk

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.090
about that in the future.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.437
But let's say, so that's
its assets.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.220
You know it might have
some cash here.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.920
We'll go into more detail.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.580
We'll actually look at real
company balance sheets and

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.150
decipher what all of the terms
on the balance sheet mean.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.830
But that's its assets for now.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.340
And let's say right now all of
its money it's raised so far

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.970
has been equity.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.430
And let's say it's a publicly
listed company.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.480
It doesn't have to be.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:59.580
Let's say that's all of its
equity, and let's say it has,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.980
I don't know, 10
million shares.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.500
And the other interesting thing
about when a company's

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.750
public-- remember, every time
when a company was private and

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.330
it took an investor, when it
took equity investors, they

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.280
had to sit and have a
negotiation saying what is

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.630
this worth?

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.020
What are these assets worth?

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.470
But what's cool is, is when
you have a publicly traded

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.830
company, these shares are traded
on an exchange, right?

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.330
These shares are on, let's
say it's on the

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.780
New York Stock Exchange.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.430
So every day you could
go to Yahoo!

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.060
Finance or wherever and you
can look at a chart.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.000
Let me draw a chart.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.290
You can draw a chart.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.150
And we've all seen stock
charts, I think.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.390
So let's say that this is this
could have been its IPO date

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.010
or it could just be the start
that we're looking at, and

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.540
let's say the stock IPO went up,
and then the whole market

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.380
went down a little bit.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.530
But the stock-- maybe
it's there, right?

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.660
But on any given, really almost
any given second,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.750
there's a price that somebody
traded that stock at and it

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.790
might not be the best price,
but it is a price.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.660
And we'll talk about why that
happens, because you might

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.280
have 10 million shares, and if
only, I don't know, 100 shares

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.040
get traded at any second, or
let's say only 100 shares get

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.870
traded in the day, is that
an indicative price?

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.830
Because that's not
a huge percentage

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.740
of all of the shares.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.440
But anyway, we'll talk more
about what volume means

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.220
relative to the total float
and all of that.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.320
But let's say at this split
second the company shares

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.320
traded at $15 a share.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.640
This is $15, right, at
this second in time.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.810
This is like right now.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.720
Traded at $15 a share, and you
could look it up on your

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.740
Bloomberg terminal
or whatever else.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.450
So essentially the market
is providing us a

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.180
value for this company.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.400
The market is saying wow, the
market is willing to trade the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.390
share at $15.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.610
There was a willing buyer and
a willing seller at exactly

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.390
$15 a share.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.450
So that means that the market at
that moment is valuing this

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.880
company at $15 per share times
10 million shares.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:05.040
So $15 per share times 10
million shares-- not

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.290
necessarily a dollar sign.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.090
So the market is assigning
a, 15 times 10 is 100.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.560
$150 million market cap.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.640
Market capitalization
for the company.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.350
And you could look on the kind
of, I think it's the key

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.590
statistics tab on Yahoo!

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.260
Finance, and you'll see market
capitalization for a company.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.200
And it's just the number
of shares times the

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.630
price of the shares.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.380
This is essentially what
the market's value

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.240
of the equity is.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.680
The market is saying that
this piece right here

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.600
is worth $150 million.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.030
And since this piece is the same
size as the assets, we

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.190
have nothing else on the
right-hand side, the market's

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.020
essentially saying that the
assets right now are worth

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.820
$150 million.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.320
And these aren't always
going to be equal.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.960
We'll see probably in a few
videos when you start raising

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.000
debt you have to do an extra
calculation to figure out what

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.870
the asset value or-- and I'll
throw out a new term here, the

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.020
enterprise value
of the firm is.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.850
The enterprise value's
essentially the asset value

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.600
minus excess cash.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.750
The cash the company really
doesn't need to operate.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.590
And we'll go into more
detail of that.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.950
But we'll just view it as
the assets for now.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.850
So if I'm the CFO of this
company, and let's say we need

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.710
to raise another, I don't
know, $15 million.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.520
I have two options.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.359
I could say OK, the company is
trading at $15 per share, I

00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:36.049
need to raise $15 million,
so I could issue

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.280
another million shares.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.360
It wouldn't be the initial
public offering because I'm

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360
already public.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.490
It would be a follow-on
offering, or sometimes it's

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.620
called a secondary offering.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.410
Although the word secondary has
kind of two connotations.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.810
But it would be a follow-on
offering where I would issue,

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.320
I'd go to the board, we would
essentially create another

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.470
million shares, and then sell
them into the market, and

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.470
hopefully people will buy it at
$15 a share or probably a

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.250
little bit less because we're
kind of flooding the market

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.420
with a ton of shares.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.820
Maybe they buy it at $14
per share, and we

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.610
would raise $14 million.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.060
And that would be a follow-on
offering.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.600
So we can always use the public
markets as a way to

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.780
raise more money.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.830
We didn't have to go to all
this-- I mean, for the most

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.940
part we didn't have to do this
huge valuation exercise and

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.610
negotiations and do all of this,
hire banks and all that.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.290
Although the banks will
still collect fees.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.750
We actually would have to
hire banks to do this.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.730
So that's one option.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.540
Or the other option is we're an
established company, we're

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.200
generating cash, we could
make interest

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.380
payments if we want to.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.380
We could go to a bank.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.100
And actually there's a lot of
different ways to do this.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.030
But we could essentially
borrow money.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.050
And let's just say we do that.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.500
Instead of doing this--
let's say we do both.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.870
So let's say we did a $1 million
follow-on offering,

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.130
that gave us $14 million.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.400
And let's say we want another
$2 million, but this time

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.030
instead of selling shares--
so right now how many

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.470
shares do we have?

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.880
We sold 1 million, we
had 10 million, we

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.580
have 11 million shares.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.310
Let's say, you know what, let's
say as a CFO I feel like

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.500
our shares are going to
move up a lot more.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.830
So we don't like selling
them at this low price.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.060
And let's say interest
rates are really low.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.270
Instead we're going
to borrow money.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.640
That's essentially
raising debt.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.480
So let's say we borrow another
$3 million because we need it.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.280
So actually this would be debt,
$3 million of debt, and

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.625
we would get $3 million
of cash.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.340
So now our assets are
all of this stuff on

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.040
the left-hand side.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.850
And what are our liabilities
now?

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.590
Now, we didn't have liabilities
before because

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.690
everything we had
were equities.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:45.340
But now we do.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.340
Now we owe somebody $3
million right here.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.560
And I'll talk more about all the
different ways to kind of

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.660
borrow money.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.180
But it's essentially, it could
just literally be a bank loan.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.580
They might have just gone to
Bank of America and said hey,

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.730
we're a big company and we're
good for the money, why don't

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.260
you lend us $3 million.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.020
And maybe it would be $3 million
at a low interest

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.930
rate, at maybe 6% per year.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.710
And Bank of America feels good
because you have a high--

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.190
we'll talk more about credit
ratings and all of that-- but

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.670
they say oh, you have
essentially a good company

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.020
credit score.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.810
So we'll give it to you at
a low interest rate.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.720
So what happens in the future
is, these assets are going to

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.980
generate, hopefully,
some cash.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.250
And before these guys see it--
let me do to it in the--

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.330
before these equity holders--
this is the equity holders

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.820
right now-- before the equity
holders see anything, these

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.750
guys have to get paid their
interest. And I'll show you

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.260
all of that on a line-by-line
basis in an income statement.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.960
Everything we've done so far
has been a balance sheet.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.970
But something interesting
is happening now.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.913
Now all of a sudden your assets,
which is that side-- I

00:11:47.913 --> 00:11:50.820
know I just keep writing over
the same drawing-- your assets

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.700
are now larger than
your equity.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.700
I think now, and this is just
kind of a review of the

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:02.730
balance sheet video, you see
that the assets are equal to

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:09.390
your equity, which is this right
here, your equity plus

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.340
your liabilities.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.170
Your liabilities now
are $3 million.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.930
Plus liabilities.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.740
So if you wanted to know what
your assets are worth, because

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.090
your assets are equal
to your equity.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.050
So what's your market value
of your equity?

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.490
Well, we figured that
out already.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.760
We have 11 million shares now.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.630
And let's say the stock plummets
to $10 a share for

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.620
some strange reason or for
a not-strange reason.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.530
So what's the market cap? $10 a
share, 11 million shares, we

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.920
have a $110 million
market cap.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.270
We're doing a market value.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.980
And we'll talk more about the
difference between market and

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.430
book value.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.460
But this is the market
value of your equity.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.470
And then what is your
liabilities?

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:55.090
Well we owe $3 million,
so plus 3 million.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.160
So we could say that for the
most part the market value of

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.340
our assets, the market thinks
that this entire left-hand

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:07.430
side is going to be worth the
value of our equity, the

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.490
market cap of the company, plus
the amount of debt, which

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.460
is equal to $113 million.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.590
So the value of these assets are
$113 million, and that for

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.610
the most part is the enterprise

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:21.720
value of the company.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.490
What is the company's
assets worth?

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.610
And we'll talk-- there's a
little bit of a tweak we'll do

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.550
in the future on enterprise
value.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.520
But that's essentially how you
kind of can value what the

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.690
company's worth.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.410
A lot of people when they do
a market capitalization

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.640
calculation they say
oh, that's what

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.490
the company's worth.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.720
Well no, that's what the
equity is worth.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.670
Market cap is what the
equity's worth.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.856
If you want to know what the
company's worth, you have to

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:48.460
take the market cap and
then add the debt.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.150
Another way-- well, I won't get
too complicated because I

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.270
just realized I've run
out of time again.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.110
See you in the next video.
