00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.650
We're trying to test whether
a new low-fat diet actually

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.940
helps obese people
lose weight.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.790
100 randomly assigned people are
assigned to group one and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.410
put on the low-fat diet.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.280
Another 100 randomly assigned
obese people are assigned to

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.770
group two and put on a diet of
approximately the same amount

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.610
of food, but not
as low in fat.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.010
So group two is the control,
just the no diet.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.660
Group one is the low
fat group, to see

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.870
if it actually works.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.740
After four months, the mean
weight loss was 9.31 pounds

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.540
for group one.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.960
Let me write this down.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.310
Let me make it very clear.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:46.590
So the low fat group, the mean
weight loss was 9.31 pounds.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.140
So our sample mean for group
one is 9.31 pounds, with a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.120
sample standard deviation
of 4.67.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.840
And both of these are obviously
very easy to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.650
calculate from the
actual data.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.310
And then for our control group,
the sample mean, 7.40

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.560
pounds for group two.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.800
With a sample standard deviation
of 4.04 pounds.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.100
And now, if we just look at it
superficially, it looks like

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.670
the low-fat group lost more
weight, just based on our

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.820
samples, than the
control group.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.040
If we take the difference
of them.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.910
So if we take the difference
between the low-fat group and

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:50.250
the control group, we get 9.31
minus 7.40 is equal to, let's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:01.860
get the calculator out, 1.91.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.070
So the difference of our
samples is 1.91.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.639
So just based on what we see,
maybe you lose an incremental

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.210
1.91 pounds every four months
if you are on this diet.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.180
And what we want to do in this
video is to get a 95%

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.700
confidence interval around
this number.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.910
To see that in that 95%
confidence interval, maybe, do

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.610
we always lose weight?

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.480
Or is there a chance that we can
actually go the other way

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.630
with the low-fat diet?

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.850
So in this video, 95%
confidence interval.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.190
In the next video, we'll
actually do a hypothesis test

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.650
using this same data.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.770
And now to do a 95% confidence
interval, let's think about

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.020
the distribution that we're
thinking about.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.350
So let's look at the
distribution.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.190
Of course we're going to think
about the distribution that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.860
we're thinking about.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.500
We want to think about the
distribution of the difference

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.390
of the means.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.600
So it's going to have
some true mean here.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.030
Which is the mean of
the difference

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.370
of the sample means.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.490
Let me write that.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.330
It's not a y, it's
an x1 and x2.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.980
So it's the sample mean of x1
minus the sample mean of x2.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.830
And then this distribution right
here is going to have

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.165
some standard deviation.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.330
So it's the standard deviation
of the distribution of the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.110
mean of x1 minus the
sample mean of x2.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.900
It's going to have some standard
deviation here.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.960
And we want to make an
inference about this.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.030
Or I guess, the best way to
think about it, we want to get

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.360
a 95% confidence interval.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.230
Based on our sample, we want to
create an interval around

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.630
this, where we're confident that
there's a 95% chance that

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.780
this true mean, the true mean
of the differences, lies

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.010
within that interval.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.200
And to do that let's just think
of it the other way.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:14.220
How can we construct an interval
around this where we

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.990
are 95% sure that any sample
from this distribution, and

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.950
this is one of those samples,
that there is a 95% chance

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.470
that we will select from this
region right over here.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.800
So we care about a 95% region
right over here.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.960
So how many standard deviations
do we have to go in

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.370
each direction?

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.980
And to do that we just have
to look at a Z table.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.740
And just remember, if we have
95% in the middle right over

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.940
here, we're going to have 2.5%
over here and we're going to

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.930
have 2.5% over here.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.020
We have to have 5% split
between these

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.900
two symmetric tails.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.140
So when we look at a Z table,
we want the critical Z value

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.120
that they give right
over here.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.300
And we have to be
careful here.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.245
We're not going to look up 95%,
because a Z table gives

00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:03.640
us the cumulative probability
up to that critical Z value.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.480
So the Z table is going to
be interpreted like this.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.400
So there's going to be some Z
value right over here where we

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.940
have 2.5% above it.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.190
The probability of getting a
more extreme result or Z score

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.080
above that is 2.5%.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.040
And the probability of getting
one below that

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.620
is going to be 97.5%.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.640
But if we can find whatever Z
value this is right over here,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.335
it's going to be the same
Z value as that.

00:05:32.335 --> 00:05:34.930
And instead of thinking about
it in terms of a one tail

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.450
scenario, we're going to think
of it in a two tail scenario.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:46.760
So let's look it up for
97.5% on our Z table.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.920
Right here.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.450
This is 0.975, or 97.5.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.760
And this gives us
Z value of 1.96.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.760
So Z is equal to 1.96.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:09.380
Or 2.5% of the samples from this
population are going to

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.050
be more than 1.96 standard
deviations away from the mean.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.550
So this critical Z value right
here is 1.96 standard

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.260
deviations.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.450
This is 1.96 times the standard

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.460
deviation of x1 minus x2.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.700
And then this right here is
going to be negative 1.96

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.840
times the same thing.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.870
Let me write that.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.010
So this right here,
it's symmetric.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.550
This distance is going to be
the same as that distance.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.900
So this is negative 1.96 times
the standard deviation of this

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.150
distribution.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:07:03.110
So let's put it this way,
there's a 95% chance that our

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.590
sample that we got from our
distribution-- this is the

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.080
sample as a difference of
these other samples.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:28.730
There's a 95% chance that 1.91
lies within 1.96 times the

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.940
standard deviation of
that distribution.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.210
So you could view
it as a standard

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.380
error of this statistic.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.760
So x1 minus x2.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.370
Let me finish that sentence.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.360
There's a 95% chance that 1.91,
which is the sample

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.470
statistic, or the statistic that
we got, is within 1.96

00:07:52.470 --> 00:08:00.380
times the standard deviation
of this distribution of the

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.090
true mean of of the
distribution.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.680
Or we could say it the
other way around.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:15.830
There's a 95% chance that the
true mean of the distribution

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:24.090
is within 1.96 times the
standard deviation of the

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.800
distribution of 1.91.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.900
These are equivalent
statements.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.429
If I say I'm within three feet
of you, that's equivalent to

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.480
saying you're within
three feet of me.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.549
That's all that's saying.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.760
But when we construct it this
way, it becomes pretty clear,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.679
how do we actually construct
the confidence interval?

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:46.340
We just have to figure out
what this distance

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.750
right over here is.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.730
And to figure out what that
distance is, we're going to

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.010
have to figure out what the
standard deviation of this

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.310
distribution is.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.460
Well the standard deviation of
the differences of the sample

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.980
means is going to be equal to,
and we saw this in the last

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.820
video-- in fact, I think I have
it right at the bottom

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:09.050
here-- it's going to be equal
to the square root of the

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.255
variances of each of those
distributions.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.550
Let me write it this way.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:30.270
So the variance, I'll
kind of re-prove it.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:35.570
The variance of our distribution
is going to be

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.690
equal to the sum of the
variances of each of these

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.940
sampling distributions.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.730
And we know that the variance
of each of these sampling

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.120
distributions is equal to the
variance of this sampling

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.870
distribution, is equal to the
variance of the population

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:02.290
distribution, divided
by our sample size.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.880
And our sample size in
this case is 100.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.880
And the variance of this
sampling distribution, for our

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:15.010
control, is going to be equal
to the variance of the

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:20.840
population distribution for
the control divided by its

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.270
sample size.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.250
And since we don't know
what these are, we

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.480
can approximate them.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.520
Especially, because our n is
greater than 30 for both

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.190
circumstances.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:37.180
We can approximate these with
our sample variances for each

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.780
of these distributions.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.920
So let me make this clear.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.480
Our sample variances for each
of these distributions.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.950
So this is going to be our
sample standard deviation one

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.630
squared, which is the sample
variance for that

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.770
distribution, over 100.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:11:00.540
Plus my sample standard
deviation for the control

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.190
squared, which is the
sample variance.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.590
Standard deviation squared
is just the

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.760
variance divided by 100.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:14.080
And this will give us the
variance for this

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.220
distribution.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.920
And if we want the standard
deviation, we just take the

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.970
square roots of both sides.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.620
If we want the standard
deviation of this distribution

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.110
right here, this is the variance
right now, so we just

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.620
need to take the square roots.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.430
Let's calculate this.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.160
We actually know these values.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.695
S1, our sample standard
deviation for

00:11:37.695 --> 00:11:39.830
group one is 4.67.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.070
We wrote it right
here, as well.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:51.000
It's 4.76 and 4.04.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.620
The S is 4.67, we're going
to have to square it.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.300
And the S2 is 4.04, we're going
to have to square it.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.580
So let's calculate that.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:09.040
So we're going to take the
square root of 4.67 squared

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:18.440
divided by 100 plus 4.04
squared, divided by 100.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.072
And then close the
parentheses.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:29.940
And we get 0.617.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.390
Let me write it right here.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:36.330
This is going to be
equal to 0.617.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.720
So if we go back up over here,
we calculated the standard

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.220
deviation of this distribution
to be 0.617.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.720
So now we can actually calculate
our interval.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.700
Because this is going
to be 0.617.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:58.150
So if you want 1.96 times that,
we get 1.96 times that

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.240
0.617, I'll just write the
answer we just got.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:11.770
So we get 1.21.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:18.660
So the 95% confidence interval
is going to be the difference

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:27.190
of our means, 1.91, plus or
minus this number, 1.21.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.040
So what's our confidence
interval?

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.620
So the low end of our confidence
interval, and I'm

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:40.130
running out of space, 1.91 minus
1.21, that's just 0.7.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.360
So the low end is 0.7.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:51.630
And then the high end, 1.91
plus 1.21, that's 2.12.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.770
let me just make sure of that.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.710
My brain sometimes doesn't work
properly when I'm making

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.200
these videos.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:08.450
3.12.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:14.110
So just to be clear, there's not
a pure 95% chance that the

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:19.000
true difference of the true
means lies in this.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.680
We're just confident that
there's a 95% chance.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.280
And we always have to put a
little confidence there,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.110
because remember, we didn't
actually know the population

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.640
standard deviations, or the
population variances.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.930
We estimated them
with our sample.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.330
And because of that, we don't
know that it's an exact

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:35.850
probability.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.300
We just have say we're confident
that it is a 95%

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.040
probability.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.510
And that's why we just say it's
a confidence interval.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.760
It's not a pure probability.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.115
But it's a pretty neat result.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.600
So we're confident that there's
a 95% chance that the

00:14:52.600 --> 00:15:00.820
true difference of these two
samples-- and remember, let me

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:10.720
make it very clear, the expected
value of the sample

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.990
means is actually the same thing
as the expected value of

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.130
the populations.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.720
And so, what this is giving us
is actually a confidence

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.530
interval for the true difference
between the

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.280
populations.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.630
If you were to give everyone,
every possible

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.080
person, diet one.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.500
And every possible
person diet two.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.120
This is giving us a confidence
interval for the true

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.610
population means.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.790
And so when you look at this,
it looks like diet one

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.080
actually does do something.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.450
Because in any case, even at the
low end of the confidence

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.650
interval, you still have
a greater weight

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.400
loss than diet two.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.070
Hopefully, that doesn't
confuse you too much.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.430
In the next video, we're
actually going to do a

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.400
hypothesis test with
the same data.
