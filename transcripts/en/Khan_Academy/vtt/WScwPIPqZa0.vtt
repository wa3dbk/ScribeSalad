00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.220
Let's say I have a balloon.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.250
And in that balloon
I have a bunch of

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.440
particles bouncing around.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.710
They're gas particles, so
they're floating freely.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.660
And they each have some
velocity, some kinetic energy.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.910
And what I care about, let me
just draw a few more, what I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.560
care about is the pressure that
is exerted on the surface

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.140
of the balloon.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.960
So I care about the pressure.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.840
And what's pressure?

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.366
It's force per area.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.150
So the area here, you can think
of it as the inside

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.070
surface of the balloon.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.960
And what's going to apply
force to that?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.330
Well any given moment-- I only
drew six particles here, but

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.850
in a real balloon you would have
gazillions of particles,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.070
and we could talk about how
large, but more particles than

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.440
you can really probably
imagine-- but at any given

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.760
moment, some of those particles
are bouncing off the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.930
wall of the container.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.820
That particle is bouncing
there, this particle is

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.910
bouncing there, this guy's
bouncing like that.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.900
And when they bounce, they apply
force to the container.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.850
An outward force, that's what
keeps the balloon blown up.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.970
So think about what the pressure
is going to be

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.680
dependent on.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.470
So first of all, the faster
these particles move, the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.720
higher the pressure.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.320
Slower particles, you're going
to be bouncing into the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.480
container less, and when you do
bounce into the container,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.070
it's going to be less of a
ricochet, or less of a change

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.110
in momentum.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.840
So slower particles,
you're going to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.550
have pressure go down.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.690
Now, it's practically impossible
to measure the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.800
kinetic energy, or the velocity,
or the direction of

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.060
each individual particle.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.490
Especially when you
have gazillions

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.630
of them in a balloon.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.080
So we do is we think
of the average

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.610
energy of the particles.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.600
And the average energy of the
particles, you might say oh,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.300
Sal is about to introduce
us to a new concept.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.050
It's a new way of looking at
probably a very familiar

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.070
concept to you.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.410
And that's temperature.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.640
Temperature can and should be
viewed as the average energy

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.640
of the particles
in the system.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.220
So I'll put a little squiggly
line, because there's a lot of

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.110
ways to think about it.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.615
Average energy.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.020
And mostly kinetic energy,
because these particles are

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.140
moving and bouncing.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.690
The higher the temperature,
the faster that these

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.820
particles move.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.850
And the more that they're going
to bounce into the side

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.610
of the container.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.540
But temperature is
average energy.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.645
It tells us energy
per particle.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.450
So obviously, if we only had
one particle in there with

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.170
super high temperature, that's
going to have less pressure

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.620
than if we have a million
particles in there.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.430
Let me draw that.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.110
If I have, let's take two
cases right here.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.990
One is, I have a bunch of
particles with a certain

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.020
temperature, moving in their
different directions.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.120
And the other example,
I have one particle.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.320
And maybe they have the
same temperature.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.690
That on average, they have
the same kinetic energy.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.450
The kinetic energy per
particle is the same.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.940
Clearly, this one is going to
be applying more pressure to

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.130
its container, because at any
given moment more of these

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.750
particles are going to be
bouncing off the side than in

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.310
this example.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.200
This guy's going to bounce,
bam, then going to go and

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.120
move, bounce, bam.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.450
So he's going to be applying
less pressure, even though his

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.840
temperature might be the same.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.070
Because temperature is kinetic
energy, or you can view it as

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.020
kinetic energy per particles.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.780
Or it's a way of looking at
kinetic energy per particle.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.250
So if we wanted to look at the
total energy in the system, we

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.260
would want to multiply the
temperature times the number

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.020
of particles.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.470
And just since we're dealing
on the molecular scale, the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.090
number of particles can often
be represented as moles.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.540
Remember, moles is just
a number of particles.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.959
So we're saying that that
pressure-- well, I'll say it's

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.160
proportional, so it's equal
to some constant,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.200
let's call that R.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.020
Because we've got to make all
the units work out in the end.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.100
I mean temperature is in Kelvin
but we eventually want

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.470
to get back to joules.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.470
So let's just say it's equal
to some constant, or it's

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.790
proportional to temperature
times the number of particles.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.270
And we can do that
a bunch of ways.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.650
But let's think of
that in moles.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.590
If I say there are 5 mole
particles there, you know

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.870
that's 5 times 6 times 10
to the 23 particles.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.640
So, this is the number
of particles.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.430
This is the temperature.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.680
And this is just
some constant.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.770
Now, what else is the pressure
dependent on?

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.320
We gave these two examples.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.290
Obviously, it is dependent on
the temperature; the faster

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.900
each of these particles move,
the higher pressure we'll

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.840
have. It's also dependent on the
number of particles, the

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.770
more particles we have, the more
pressure we'll have. What

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.690
about the size of
the container?

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.120
The volume of the container.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.540
If we took this example, but
we shrunk the container

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.040
somehow, maybe by pressing
on the outside.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.870
So if this container looked like
this, but we still had

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:37.600
the same four particles in it,
with the same average kinetic

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.550
energy, or the same
temperature.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.440
So the number of particles
stays the same, the

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.330
temperature is the same, but
the volume has gone down.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.200
Now, these guys are going to
bump into the sides of the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.680
container more frequently
and there's less area.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.385
So at any given moment, you have
more force and less area.

00:05:54.385 --> 00:05:56.180
So when you have more force and
less area, your pressure

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.720
is going to go up.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.910
So when the volume went down,
your pressure went up.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.560
So we could say that pressure
is inversely

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.940
proportional to volume.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.960
So let's think about that.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.190
Let's put that into
our equation.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:22.880
We said that pressure is
proportional-- and I'm just

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.620
saying some proportionality
constant, let's call that R,

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.610
to the number of particles times
the temperature, this

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.660
gives us the total energy.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.750
And it's inversely proportional
to the volume.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.920
And if we multiply both sides
of this times the volume, we

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.230
get the pressure times the
volume is proportional to the

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.040
number of particles times
the temperature.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.350
So PV is equal to RnT.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.920
And just to switch this around
a little bit, so it's in a

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.395
form that you're more likely to
see in your chemistry book,

00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:58.660
if we just switch the
n and the R term.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.750
You get pressure times volume
is equal to n, the number of

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.470
particles you have, times some
constant times temperature.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:14.480
And this right here is the
ideal gas equation.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.965
Hopefully, it makes
some sense to you.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.690
When they say ideal gas, it's
based on this little mental

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.380
exercise I did to come
up with this.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.530
I made some implicit assumptions
when I did this.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:35.440
One is I assumed that we're
dealing with an ideal gas.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.470
And so you say what, Sal,
is an ideal gas?

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.060
An ideal gas is one where the
molecules are not too

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.330
concerned with each other.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.740
They're just concerned with
their own kinetic energy and

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.980
bouncing off the wall.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.580
So they don't attract
or repel each other.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.120
Let's say they attracted each
other, then as you increased

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.490
the number of particles
maybe they'd want to

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.550
not go to the side.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.770
Maybe they'd all gravitate
towards the center a little

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.730
bit more if they did
attract each other.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.730
And if they did that, they would
bounce into the walls

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.740
less and the pressure would
be a little bit lower.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.935
So we're assuming that
they don't attract

00:08:11.935 --> 00:08:13.710
or repel each other.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.980
And we're also assuming that
the actual volume of the

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.630
individual particles are
inconsequential.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.210
Which is a pretty good
assumption, because they're

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.870
pretty small.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:28.850
Although, if you start putting
a ton of particles into a

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.210
certain volume, then at some
point, especially if they're

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.250
big molecules, it'll start to
matter in terms of their size.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.840
But we're assuming for the
purposes of our little mental

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.190
exercise that the molecules have
inconsequential volumes

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.100
and they don't attract
or repel each other.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.190
And in that situation, we can
apply the ideal gas equation

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.310
right here.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.360
Now, we've established the
ideal gas equation.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.430
But you're like, well what's R,
how do I deal with it, and

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.180
how do I do math problems,
and solve chemistry

00:08:59.180 --> 00:08:59.890
problems with it?

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.230
And how do the units
all work out?

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.900
We'll do all of that in the next
video where we'll solve a

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.940
ton of equations, or a
ton of exercises with

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.350
the ideal gas equation.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.160
The important takeaway from this
video is just to have the

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.330
intuition as to why this
actually does make sense.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.100
And frankly, once you have
this intution, you should

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.870
never forget it.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.560
You should be able to maybe even
derive it on your own.
