00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
Use deductive reasoning and the
distributive property to

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.360
justify x plus y squared is
equal to x squared plus 2xy

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.690
plus y squared.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.190
Provide the reasoning
for each step.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.290
Now when they say use deductive
reasoning and all

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.920
this stuff, it might seem like
something daunting and new,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.940
but this is no different than
what we've done in the past.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.970
In fact, we've done this
very exact problem.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.700
So let's just do it step by
step, show our logic, and

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.020
that's essentially deductive
reasoning.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.800
We're starting with a statement
and we're going to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.330
deduce that this is going to
be equal to something else.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.379
So let's start with
x plus y squared.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.550
We know an exponent means to
multiply something by itself

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.590
that many times.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.060
So we know that this is the same
thing, or we can deduce

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.130
that it is the same thing, as
x plus y times-- and I'll do

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.650
this next x plus y in
a different color--

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.100
times x plus y.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.390
That's what x plus
y squared is.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.630
Now they say to use the
distributive property.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.970
And this is a bit
of review here.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.950
And we've seen it many, many,
many times before.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.580
The distributive property just
tells us that if we have a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.100
times b plus c-- I want to do
as many colors as possible--

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:26.270
that this is equal to a times
each of these terms. a times b

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.340
plus a times c.

00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:33.320
It's called distributive
property cause you're

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.710
distributing the a in all of
the terms in the expression

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.180
that your multiplying a by.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.710
Now we can do the exact
same thing here.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.030
Instead of an a, you could
imagine this is an x plus y.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.880
And we can take this entire x
plus y and we can distribute

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.470
it on to both of the terms on
this expression that it is

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.000
multiplying.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.450
If this was an a, it'd
be ax plus ay.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.570
Now that it's an x plus y, we
multiply the x plus y times

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.640
each of those terms. And
that's just by the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.550
distributive property.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.620
So by the distributive property
that's going to be

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.264
equal to-- we'll distribute this
on to each of them-- x

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:09.514
plus y times x.

00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:15.085
And actually I don't even have
to write the x after it.

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:15.940
I could just write it there.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.200
It doesn't matter whether you
multiply x times x plus y, or

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.520
x plus y times x.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.350
Order doesn't matter.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.860
So that's that times that.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.960
And then it's going to be
plus y times x plus y.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.860
And now we can apply the
distributive property again.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.565
We have x being multiplied by
x plus y, then we have a y

00:02:37.565 --> 00:02:39.570
being multiplied by x plus y.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.510
So let's just do that again.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:51.245
So then we get this is equal to
x times x plus x times y.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.270
I'm going through great pains to
keep the colors consistent.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.280
Plus y times x.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.970
Plus y times this x over here.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.930
Plus y times that
y over there.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.450
I'm doing this a lot
slower, and I'm not

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.600
skipping any steps here.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.770
Now what do each of these
things equal? x times x.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.510
That is the same thing
as x squared.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.850
So this is equal to x squared.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.450
This right here, xy,
we have one xy.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.220
But then we have yx is also
the same thing as xy.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.270
It doesn't matter what order
you multiply it in.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.920
So xy plus xy is 2xy.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.580
Plus 2xy.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.750
And then this last term right
here, y times y, that's the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.310
same thing as y squared.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.330
So we're done.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.130
We've used deductive
reasoning.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.110
We've just used logical steps to
start with a statement, to

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.930
start with an expression
really.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.040
And we essentially just
logically manipulated it.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.440
We started with.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.210
I guess you could call this a
statement-- I guess that's the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.790
best thing to call it-- and we
logically manipulated to come

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.250
up with another statement,
another fact.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.290
We know that this is equal to
this using logical properties

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.090
and distributive property
and things like that and

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.340
properties of exponents.
