00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
 

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.810
Two different hoses are being
used to fill a fish pond.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.220
Used together, the
two hoses take 12

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.800
minutes to fill the pond.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.510
If used alone, one hose is
able to fill the pond 10

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.090
minutes faster than the other.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.930
So 10 minutes faster than
the other hose.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.740
How long does each hose take
to fill the pond by itself?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.260
So let's think about
each of the hoses.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.480
We have a faster hose, and then
we have a slower hose.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.220
And let's say that the faster
hose fills the pond.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.760
Let's say it takes him
f minutes per pond.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.840
 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.100
Now how long is it going to
take the slower hose?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.900
Well, the faster hose does
it in 10 minutes less.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.590
It's 10 minutes faster.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.400
So the slower hose is going
to take 10 minutes more.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.570
So the slower hose is going to
take f plus 10 minutes per

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.019
fish pond or per pond.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.630
Now this is in minutes per pond,
but if we want to be

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.880
able to add rates together, we
should really think about in

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.580
terms of ponds per minute.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280
So let's rewrite each
of these statements

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.050
as ponds per minute.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.900
You could write this as f
minutes per 1 pond or f plus

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.530
10 minutes per 1 pond.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.710
And if you just take the inverse
of each of these

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.250
statements, these ratios are
equivalent to saying 1 pond

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.000
per f minutes.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.820
So it's really not saying
anything else.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.020
I'm just inverting the ratio.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.905
Or you could think of it as
1/f ponds per minute.

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:41.590
 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.550
Same logic right here.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:52.260
We could essentially rewrite
this ratio as 1 over f plus 10

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.910
ponds per minute.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.400
So now we have the rate
of the faster hose.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.840
We have the rate of
the slower hose.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.710
How many pounds per minute
for the faster hose?

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.820
How many pounds per minute
for the slower hose?

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.870
If we add these two rates,
we'll know the ponds per

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.240
minute when they're
acting together.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.870
So if we have 1/f ponds per
minute plus 1 over f plus 10

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.670
ponds per minute.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.690
This is the faster hose, this
is the slower hose.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.600
This'll tell us how
many ponds for

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.590
minute they can do together.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.540
Now, we know that information.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.450
They say the two hoses
take 12 minutes.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.630
So let me write that
over here.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.440
So combined.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.100
The combined take 12
minutes per pond.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.370
So what is their combined rate
in terms of ponds per minute?

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.660
So you could view this as
12 minutes per one pond.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.500
You could take the inverse of
this or take the ratio in

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.170
terms of ponds per minute
instead and

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.380
you get 1/12 minutes.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.140
Sorry, 1/12 ponds per minute.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.790
In one minute combined, they'll
fill 1/12 of a pond.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.880
Which makes complete sense.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.190
Because it takes them
12 minutes to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.920
fill the whole thing.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.050
So in one minute they'll
only do 1/12 of it.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.600
So this is their combined rate
in ponds per minute.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.860
This is also their combined
rate in ponds per minute.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.610
So this is going to
be equal to 1/12.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.430
And now we just have to solve
for f and then f plus 10 is

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.770
going to be how long it
takes the slower hose.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.020
So let's multiply.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.850
Let's see what we could do.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.320
We could multiply both sides of
this equation times f and

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.050
times f plus 10.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.290
So let's do that.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.630
So I'm going to multiply both
sides of this equation times f

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.480
and f plus 10 times both
sides of this equation.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.720
So f and f plus 10.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.990
Scroll down a little bit.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.420
Scroll to the left, so we
have some real estate.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.210
So let's distribute this
f times f plus 10.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.190
So if we multiply f times f plus
10 times 1/f, that f and

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.690
that f will cancel out and we're
just going to be left

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.700
with an f plus 10.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.190
That's when you multiply
that term times the f

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.750
times f plus 10.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.735
Now, when you multiply this
term, when you multiply 1 over

00:04:14.735 --> 00:04:19.310
f plus 10 times f times f plus
10, this and this will cancel

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.310
out and you're just
left with an f.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.650
So you have plus f is equal
to-- and you have over 12.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.880
Actually, well in a second, let
me multiply all sides of

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.890
this equation by 12.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.230
I'll do that next in a second.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.650
So let's just say this is going
to be equal to 1/12

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.930
times f squared.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.640
 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.880
f times f is f squared.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.640
Plus 10f.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.230
And now let's just multiply
both sides of

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.280
this equation by 12.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.700
I could've done it in the last
step so that we don't have any

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.950
fractions here.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.740
 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.750
And so the left-hand side
we get 12 times f.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.770
We get 12f plus 120 plus 12f.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.070
The right-hand side, that and
that cancels out and you are

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.840
left with f squared plus 10f.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.060
And now we have a quadratic.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.390
We just have to get it into
a form that we know how to

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.230
manipulate or deal with.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.860
Before that, we can
simplify it.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.070
We have a 12f and a 12f.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.400
So this becomes 24f plus
120 is equal to f

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.420
squared plus 10f.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.120
And then let's get all
of this stuff out of

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.900
the left-hand side.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.540
They'll get all on the
right-hand side.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.940
So from both sides of this
equation, let's subtract 24f

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.270
and a negative 120
or minus 120.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.965
So you have minus
24f minus 120.

00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:48.020
The left-hand side
just becomes 0.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.530
That was the whole point.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.470
Right-hand side is f squared.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.380
10 minus 24f is negative 14f.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.550
Minus 120.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.170
Now we could factor this.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.850
Let's see, if you do 20 times--
yeah, that looks like

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:07.330
it would work.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.930
So negative 20 and 6, when you
take their product, give you

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.420
negative 120.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.460
And negative 20 plus
6 is negative 14.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.240
So we could factor this
right-hand side as 0 is equal

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.810
to f minus 20 times f plus 6.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.170
When you multiply negative 20
times 6, you get negative 120.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.180
Negative 20 plus 6
is negative 14.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.830
And the only way that that's
going to be equal to 0 is if f

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:45.140
minus 20 is equal to 0 or
f plus 6 is equal to 0.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.470
Add 20 to both sides
of this equation.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.680
You get f is equal to 20.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.720
Remember, f is how many minutes
does it take for the

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.650
fast hose to fill the pond.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.130
And then, if you take
this one, you

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.410
subtract 6 from both sides.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.670
You get f is equal
to negative 6.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.730
Now, when we're talking about
how many minutes does it take

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.460
for the fast hose to fill the
pond, it doesn't make any

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.650
sense to say that it
takes it negative 6

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.040
minutes to fill the pond.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.790
So we can't use this answer.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.270
We need a positive answer.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.810
So this is how many minutes it
takes the fast hose to fill

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.780
the pond. f is equal to 20.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.530
So this right here, the
faster hose takes

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.000
20 minutes per pond.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.080
I'll write it here.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.610
20 minutes per pond
is the fast hose.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.950
And then the slower hose, it
takes 10 minutes more.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.860
It's f plus 10.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.160
So it takes 30 minutes
per pond.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.650
And we're done.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.950
I don't want to confuse
you with this stuff.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.570
The faster hose takes
20 minutes.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.010
Slower hose takes 30
minutes per pond.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.150
If they were to do it together,
it would take 12

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.410
minutes, which is a little
bit more than half.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.930
If you had two faster hoses,
it would take 10 minutes.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.780
But this guy's a little bit
slower, so it's taking you a

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.610
little bit more than
10 minutes.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.760
So it makes sense.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.940
It takes you 12 minutes when
they're working together.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.440
