00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.070
In the last video, we learned
that the pressure at some

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:10.120
depth in a fluid is equal to the
density of the fluid times

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.670
how deep we are in the fluid,
or how high is the column of

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.990
fluid above us times gravity.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.870
Let's see if we can use that
to solve a fairly typical

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.750
problem that you'll see in your
physics class, or even on

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.660
an AP physics test.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's say that I have a bowl.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.740
And in that bowl, I have
mercury, and then I also have

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.000
this kind of inverted test
tube that I stick in the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.480
middle of-- this is the side
view of the bowl, and I'll

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.950
draw everything shortly.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.960
Let's say my test tube looks
something like this.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.090
Let's say I have no air in this
test tube-- there's a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.120
vacuum here-- but the outside
of the bowl, this whole area

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.950
out here, this is exposed
to the air.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.530
We are actually on Earth, or
actually in Paris, France, at

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.550
sea level, because that's what
an atmosphere is defined as--

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.940
the atmospheric pressure.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.970
Essentially, the way you could
think about it-- the weight of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.830
all of the air above us is
pushing down on the surface of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.270
this bowl at one atmosphere.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.530
An atmosphere is just the
pressure of all of the air

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.000
above you at sea level
in Paris, France.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.650
And in the bowl,
I have mercury.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.536
Let's say that that mercury--
there's no air in here, and it

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:11.000
is actually going to go up
this column a little bit.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.200
We're going to do the math as
far as-- one, we'll see why

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.830
it's going up, and then we'll do
the math to figure out how

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.110
high up does it go.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.030
Say the mercury goes up
some distance-- this

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.280
is all still mercury.

00:02:29.498 --> 00:02:31.820
And this is actually how a
barometer works; this is

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.860
something that measures
pressure.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.730
Over here at this part, above
the mercury, but still within

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.040
our little test tube, we have
a vacuum-- there is no air.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.680
Vacuum is one of my favorite
words, because it has

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.930
two u's in a row.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.740
We have this set up, and so my
question to you is-- how high

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.430
is this column of mercury
going to go?

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.270
First of all, let's just have
the intuition as to why this

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.660
thing is going up
to begin with.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.780
We have all this pressure from
all of the air above us-- I

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.320
know it's a little un-intuitive
for us, because

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.140
we're used to all of that
pressure on our shoulders all

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.520
of the time, so we don't really
imagine it, but there

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.340
is literally the weight of
the atmosphere above us.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.830
That's going to be pushing down
on the surface of the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.420
mercury on the outside
of the test tube.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.630
Since there's no pressure here,
the mercury is going to

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.220
go upwards here.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.810
This state that I've drawn is
a static state-- we have

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.260
assumed that all the
motion has stopped.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.267
So let's try to solve
this problem.

00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:44.300
Oh, and there are a couple of
things we have to know before

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.140
we do this problem.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.710
It's mercury, and we know the
specific gravity-- I'm using

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.000
terminology, because a lot of
these problems, the hardest

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:09.350
part is the terminology--
of mercury is 13.6.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.230
That's often a daunting
statement on a test-- you know

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.860
how to do all the math, and all
of a sudden you go, what

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.060
is specific gravity?

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.589
All specific gravity is, is the
ratio of how dense that

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.300
substance is to water.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:29.460
All that means is that
mercury is 13.6

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:37.365
times as dense as water.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.070
Hopefully, after the last
video-- because I told you

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.240
to-- you should have memorized
the density of water.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.870
It's 1,000 kilograms per meter
cubed, so the density of

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.210
mercury-- let's write that down,
and that's the rho, or

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.400
little p, depending on how you
want to do it-- is going to be

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.240
equal to 13.6 times the density
of water, or times

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:11.960
1,000 kilograms per
meter cubed.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.830
Let's go back to the problem.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.060
What we want to know
is how high this

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.350
column of mercury is.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.290
We know that the pressure--
let's consider this point

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.700
right here, which is essentially
the base of this

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.270
column of mercury.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.030
What we're saying is the
pressure on the base of this

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.630
column of mercury right here, or
the pressure at this point

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.800
down, has to be the same thing
as the pressure up, because

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.180
the mercury isn't moving--
we're in a static state.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.180
We learned several videos ago
that the pressure in is equal

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.350
to the pressure out on
a liquid system.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.740
Essentially, I have one
atmosphere pushing down here

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.380
on the outside of the surface,
so I must have one atmosphere

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.630
pushing up here.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.590
The pressure pushing up at this
point right here-- we

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.520
could imagine that we have
that aluminum foil there

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.850
again, and just imagine where
the pressure is hitting-- is

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.450
one atmosphere, so the pressure
down right here must

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.090
be one atmosphere.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.840
What's creating the pressure
down right there?

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.330
It's essentially this column
of water, or it's this

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.380
formula, which we learned
in the last video.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.000
What we now know is that the
density of the mercury, times

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.880
the height of the column of
water, times the acceleration

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.300
of gravity on Earth-- which is
where we are-- has to equal

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.810
one atmosphere, because it has
to offset the atmosphere

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.820
that's pushing on the outside
and pushing up here.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:52.880
The density of mercury is this:
13.6 thousand, so 13,600

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.550
kilogram meters per
meter cubed.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.060
That's the density times the
height-- we don't know what

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.695
the height is, that's going to
be in meters-- times the

00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:06.460
acceleration of gravity,
which is 9.8

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.340
meters per second squared.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.350
It's going to be equal
to one atmosphere.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.020
Now you're saying-- Sal,
this is strange.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.850
I've never seen this atmosphere
before-- we've

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.600
talked a lot about it, but how
does an atmosphere relate to

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.330
pascals or newtons?

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.320
This is something else you
should memorize: one

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:32.120
atmosphere is equal to 103,000
pascals, and that also equals

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.660
103,000 newtons per
meter squared.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.350
One atmosphere is how much we're
pushing down out here.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.230
So it's how much we're pushing
up here, and that's going to

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.560
be equal to the amount of
pressure at this point from

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.650
this column of mercury.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:54.380
One atmosphere is exactly this
much, which equals 103,000

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.800
newtons per meters squared.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:07.660
If we divide both sides by
13,609.8, we get that the

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:21.130
height is equal to 103,000
newtons per meter cubed, over

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:36.659
13,600 kilograms per meter cubed
times 9.8 meters per

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:37.909
second squared.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.940
Make sure you always have the
units right-- that's the

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.600
hardest thing about these
problems, just to know that an

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.210
atmosphere is 103,000 pascals,
which is also the same as

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.410
newtons per meter squared.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:09:01.810
Let's just do the math, so let
me type this in-- 103,000

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:17.000
divided by 13,600 divided
by 9.8 equals 0.77.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.250
We were dealing with newtons,
so height is

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.870
equal to 0.77 meters.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.720
And you should see that the
units actually work, because

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.030
we have a meters cubed in the
denominator up here, we have a

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.060
meters cubed in the denominator
down here, and

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.260
then we have kilogram meters
per second squared here.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.780
We have newtons up here,
but what's a newton?

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.720
A newton is a kilogram meter
squared per second, so when

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.700
you divide you have kilogram
meters squared per second

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.060
squared, and here you
have kilogram

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.390
meter per second squared.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.080
When you do all the division of
the units, all you're left

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.450
with is meters, so we have 0.77
meters, or roughly 77

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.850
centimeters-- is how high this
column of mercury is.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.255
And you can make a barometer out
of it-- you can say, let

00:09:57.255 --> 00:09:59.760
me make a little notch on this
test tube, and that represents

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.550
one atmosphere.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.540
You can go around and figure
out how many atmospheres

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.780
different parts of
the globe are.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.200
Anyway, I've run out of time.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.940
See you in the next video.
