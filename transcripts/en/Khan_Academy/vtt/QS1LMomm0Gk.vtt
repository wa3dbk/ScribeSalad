00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.362
Find the sum 3 and 1/8 plus
3/4 plus negative 2 and 1/6.

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:06.820
Let's just do the
first part first.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.240
It's pretty straightforward.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.620
We have two positive numbers.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.190
Let me draw a number line.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.219
So let me draw a number line.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.270
And I'll try to focus in.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.300
So we're going to
start at 3 and 1/8.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.950
So let's make this 0.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:28.020
So you have 1, 2, 3,
and then you have 4.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.440
3 and 1/8 is going to
be right about there.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.299
So let me just draw
its absolute value.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:40.710
So this 3 and 1/8 is going to
be 3 and 1/8 to the right of 0.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.430
So it's going to be exactly that
distance from 0 to the right.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.020
So this right here, the
length of this arrow,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.194
you could view it as 3 and 1/8.

00:00:50.194 --> 00:00:52.860
Now whenever I like to deal with
fractions, especially when they

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.040
have different denominators
and all of that,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.330
I like to deal with them
as improper fractions.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.080
It makes the addition
and the subtraction,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.163
and, actually, the
multiplication and the division

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:01.770
a lot easier.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.580
So 3 and 1/8 is the same
thing as 8 times 3 is 24,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.220
plus 1 is 25 over 8.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.010
So this is 25 over 8, which is
the same thing as 3 and 1/8.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.770
Another way to think
about it, 3 is 24 over 8.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.030
And then you add 1/8 to
that, so you get 25 over 8.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.000
So this is our starting point.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now to that, we are
going to add 3/4.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We are going to add 3/4.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.610
So we're going to
move another 3/4.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.080
We are going to
move another 3/4.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.480
It's hard drawing these arrows.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.190
We're going to move
another 3/4 to the right.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.060
So this right here,
the length of this

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.120
that we're moving
to the right is 3/4.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.886
So plus 3/4.

00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:45.010
Now where does this put us?

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.440
Well, both of these
are positive integers.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440
So we can just add them.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.106
We just have to find
a like denominator.

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:52.910
So we have 25 over 8.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.880
We have 25 over 8 plus 3/4.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.150
That's the same thing as we need
to find a common denominator

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.650
here.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.020
The common denominator, or
the least common multiple

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.250
of 4 and 8 is 8.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.350
So it's going to be
something over 8.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.560
To get from 4 to 8,
we multiply by 2.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.680
So we have to multiply
3 by 2 as well.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.820
So you get 6.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.450
So 3/4 is the same thing as 6/8.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.550
If we have 25/8 and
we're adding 6/8

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.990
to that, that gives
us 25 plus 6 is 31/8.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.320
So this number right over here,
this number right over here,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.205
is 31/8.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.670
And it makes sense
because 32/8 would be 4.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.050
So it should be a little
bit less than four.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.400
So this number right
over here is 31/8.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.250
Or the length of this arrow, the
absolute value of that number,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.020
is 31/8, a little
bit less than 4.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.830
If you wanted to write that as a
mixed number, it would be what?

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.439
It would be 3 and 7/8.

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.730
So that's that right over here.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.250
This is 31/8.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.010
That's that part
right over there.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.610
Now to that, we want to
add a negative 2 and 1/6.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.700
So we're going to add
a negative number.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.210
So think about what negative
2 and 1/6 is going to be like.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.420
So let me do this in a
new color, do it in pink.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.470
Negative 2 and 1/6.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.054
So we're going to
subtract, or I guess

00:03:23.054 --> 00:03:25.178
we're going to say we're
going to add a negative 1.

00:03:25.178 --> 00:03:27.670
We're going to add a negative
2 and then a negative 1/6.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.100
So let me draw.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.785
So negative 2 and 1/6, we
could literally draw like this.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.180
Negative 2 and 1/6 we
could draw with an arrow

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.180
that looks something like that.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.655
So this is negative 2 and 1/6.

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:45.530
Now, there's a couple
ways to think about it.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.170
You could just say,
hey, look, when

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.090
you add this arrow,
this thing that's

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.089
moving to the left-- we
could put it over here,

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:53.130
and you would get straight
to negative 2 and 1/6.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.160
But we're adding this
negative 2 and 1/6.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.760
It's the same thing
as subtracting

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.920
a positive 2 and 1/6.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.030
We're moving 2 and
1/6 to the left.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.520
And we're going to end up with
a number whose absolute value is

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.130
going to look
something like that.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.921
And it's actually going
to be to the right.

00:04:09.921 --> 00:04:12.095
So it's not going to only
be its absolute value.

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:13.470
Well, its absolute
value is going

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.119
to be the number since it's
going to be a positive number.

00:04:16.119 --> 00:04:17.660
So let's just think
about what it is.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.959
This value right
here, which is going

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.625
to be the answer to
our problem, is just

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:25.140
going to be the difference
of 31/8 and 2 and 1/6.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.230
And it's the positive
difference because we're

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.560
dealing with a positive number.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.100
So we just take 31/8.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.790
And from that, we will
subtract 2 and 1/6.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.730
So let's do this.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:42.780
So this orange value is going
to be 31/8 minus 2 and 1/6.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.600
So 2 and 1/6 is the
same thing as 6 times 2

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.500
is 12 plus 1 is 13.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.651
Minus 13/6.

00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:55.150
And this is equal
to, once again, we

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.740
need to get a common
denominator over here.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.600
And it looks like 24 will be
the common denominator, 24.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.040
And let me make it very clear.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.920
This is the 31/8.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.220
And this is the 2 and 1/6.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.580
This right here
is the 2 and 1/6.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.100
So 31/8 over 24.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.930
You have to multiply by 3
to get to the 24 over here.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.510
So we multiply by 3 on the 31.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.650
That gives us 93.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.210
And then to go from 6 to 24,
you have to multiply by 4.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.050
We do that in another color.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.880
You have to multiply
it by 4, so we

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.740
have to multiply by
4 up here as well.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.870
So 4 times 13, let's see.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.286
4 times 10 is 40.

00:05:40.286 --> 00:05:42.180
4 times 3 is 12.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.180
So that's 52.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.970
So this is going to be equal
to 93 minus 52 over 24.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.220
And that is-- so 93 minus 52.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.620
3 minus 2 is 1.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.010
9 minus 5 is 4.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.729
So it is 41/24 and positive.

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.270
And you can see that here just
by looking at the number line.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.450
This right here is 41 over 24.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.500
And it should be a
little bit less than 2

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.940
because 2 would be 48 over 24.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.340
So this would be 48 over 24.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.750
And it makes sense that we're
a little bit less than that.
