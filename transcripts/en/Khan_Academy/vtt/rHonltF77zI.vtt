00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.780
Let's say I have a set of
linearly independent vectors,

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:16.460
V1, V2, all the way to Vk,
that are a basis for V.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.880
We've seen this many
times before.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.450
That's nice.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.570
It's a basis, but we've learned
over the last few

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.900
videos it would be even
better to have an

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.280
orthonormal basis for V.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.500
What we're going to address in
this video is, is there some

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.090
way that we can construct an
orthonormal basis for V, given

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.700
that we already have this basis,
which I'm assuming

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.630
isn't orthonormal.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.700
It'll work whether or not
it's orthonormal.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.690
It'll just generate another
orthonormal basis.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.680
But can we somehow, just given
any basis, generate an

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.320
orthonormal basis for V, and
then be able to benefit from

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.820
all of the properties of having
an orthonormal basis?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.330
Let's see if we can make
some headway here.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.000
Let's think about it
for simple cases.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.080
Let's say that I have a
one-dimensional subspace.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.540
Let's call that V1, for it's
a one-dimensional subspace.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.870
I'm going to say it's the span
of just this vector V1.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.210
Now, or you could say the vector
V1 is the basis for the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.770
subspace V1.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.290
If I had this simple case, how
can I ensure that this is

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.030
orthonormal?

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.266
What I could do is I could
define some vector,

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.790
let's call it U1.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.850
Obviously, this is orthogonal
to all of the other guys.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.360
There aren't any other
guys here.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.600
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.520
vectors there, but there aren't
any other members of

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.270
this set, so it's orthogonal
to everything else because

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.660
there isn't anything else.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.470
And then to make its length
equal one, you can take this

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.120
vector and divide it
by its length.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.810
So if we define some vector U1
to be equal to V1 divided by

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.330
the length of V1, then
the length of U1

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.050
is going to be what?

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.500
It's going to be the length
of V1 over the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.340
length of V1 like this.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.360
This is just a constant
right here.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.570
This is going to be 1 over
the length of V1.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.090
That could be 5, times length
of V1, which is

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.070
just equal to 1.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.890
This one will have
a length of 1.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:45.200
So just like that, if we have
the set of just U1, we could

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:57.740
say that just the set of U1 is
an orthonormal basis for V1,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.430
for the subspace V1.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.690
Now, that was trivially easy.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.110
If k happens to be
1, we're done.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.440
That was super easy.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.040
We just have to divide
by our length.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.990
You have to just essentially
just normalize this vector,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.060
and you have an orthonormal
basis because there's nothing

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.700
else to be orthogonal with.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.570
Well let's complicated the
issue a little bit.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.200
Let's say we go to
two dimensions.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.900
Let's say we have
a subspace V2.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.520
That's the span of, let's
say it's the first

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.190
two of these vectors.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:34.810
It's the span of V1
and the vector V2.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.580
Now, we know that V1, V1 can
easily be represented as-- or,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.020
V1 is a linear combination
of U1.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.800
How do I know that?

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.800
Well, I can just multiply
both sides of this times

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.030
the length of V1.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.240
We have U1 times the length
of V1 is equal to V1.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.440
So we could say this
is the same thing.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.320
This is equivalent to saying the
span of the vector U1 and

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.780
the vector V2, where U1 is the
vector we got up here.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.670
How can I say this?

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.160
Because anything that can be a
linear combination of these

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.560
guys can be a linear combination
of those guys.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.230
Because where ever you had a
V1, you can replace the V1

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.269
with the linear combination
of U1 that gives you V1.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.430
So you just multiply U1 times
that scalar and you get it.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.140
I think you get the point.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.470
But how can we ensure that this
is an orthonormal set?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.110
What do we do?

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.100
Let's graph it.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.740
This is going to be
a plane in Rn.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.320
So let's just make our
chalkboard here, or our video

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.430
board here, the plane.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.950
So we have U1, which
is a unit vector.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.150
It has length 1.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.400
So that is U1.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.000
V1 and V2 are linearly
independent, that's by

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.120
definition of a basis.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.250
So you can't represent V2 as
a linear multiple or linear

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.300
combination of V1.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.600
Likewise, you can't represent V2
as a linear combination of

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.750
U1 because U1 is a linear
combination of U1.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.130
So, V1 is not going to be on
the line spanned by U1.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.390
So I could actually draw that.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.980
The line spanned by U1
is just like this.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.290
This is the line
spanned by U1.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.350
Let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.330
I don't want to make
it too dark.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.500
So this is the line.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.570
I'll do one last try.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.725
The line spanned by U1
looks like this.

00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:24.730
It looks like that,
it's just a line.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.610
And that is the subspace
V1, right?

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.590
With the span of U1.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.390
So this is equal to
the span of U1.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.480
All we did is normalize V1
right there to get to U1.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.280
So the span of V1 is the
same span of U1.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.960
That is this subspace.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.040
That's this line in Rn.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.070
We have vector V2,
which is linearly

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.120
independent from V1 and U1.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.960
V2 would look, let's just
say something like that.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.800
V2.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.130
Now, what we want to do is
replace V2 with another vector

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.550
that is definitely orthogonal
to this, and will still be

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.570
able to construct V2 with some
combination of this and our

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.840
new vector.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.780
Well, the most obvious vector
would be some vector that is

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.540
orthogonal to V1.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.820
So it's orthogonal, so it's
a member of the orthogonal

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.070
complement of V1.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.200
If you look at it just visually
here, if I add some

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.740
member of V1 to that member of
the orthogonal complement of

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.210
V1, I'm going to get V2.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.125
In fact, we've seen that
multiple times.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.540
We know that any vector in
Rn, let's say V2, can be

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.880
represented as a sum
of two vectors.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:58.740
I'll call them x and y, where x
is a member of V1 and y is a

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.510
member of the orthogonal
complement of V1.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.700
We've seen that multiple
times.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.890
Now what was this thing
by definition?

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.890
We're looking for this thing.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.950
This is the x.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.590
And this is the y.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.230
We're looking for the y, because
if we can find this

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.060
vector y, then if we replace
V with that vector y, we'll

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.120
still be able to generate
V because you can take a

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.035
multiple of U and add
it to y and get V.

00:07:28.035 --> 00:07:31.160
And so anything that you were
able to generate with V2

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.280
before, you can now generate
with our U1, multiples of

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.520
that, plus multiples
of our new vector.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.570
So, we're trying to solve, we're
trying to figure out

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.030
what this vector y
is right there.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.150
So how do we do it?

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.790
Well, it's going to be V2
minus this vector x.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.450
Right?

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.450
What is this vector
x, by definition?

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.790
This vector x is, by definition,
the projection of

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:01.550
V2 onto the subspace V1.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.550
So, the vector that we're trying
to find, the vector y,

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.400
and if we find it, and that we
can replace V2 with y, the

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:16.340
vector y, is just equal to
V2-- let me write it this

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:23.590
way-- minus the projection
of V2 onto V1.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.550
That's what y is.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.050
Remember, if we can replace V2--
the reason why the span

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:38.950
of U1, V2 is the same thing as
the span of U1-- let me call

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.309
this y2 here.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:41.890
I'm going to just call that
y2, because we're probably

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.230
going to have to use
y's in the future.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.610
You want y2.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.520
So the reason why this span is
the same thing as the span of

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:56.250
U1 and y2 is because I can
generate V2 with a linear

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.460
combination of U1
and y2, right?

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.980
I can scale up U1 and then add
y2 and I'll get to V2.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.370
So anything that I could have
generated with V2 I can get

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.930
with a linear combination
of these guys.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.590
That's why these
are equivalent.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.300
And what's neat about this now
is that these guys are

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.690
orthogonal complements-- or
these guys are orthogonal

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.130
relative to each other, right?

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.500
By definition, y was a member of
the orthogonal complements.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.450
If you dot these two guys,
you're going to get 0.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.000
How can we actually
solve for it?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.930
Well, this is useful as
well because V1 has

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.590
an orthonormal basis.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.890
And we saw, I think it was two
or three videos ago, the neat

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.930
thing about orthonormal bases
is, it's very easy to

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.420
determine the projection
onto those bases.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.600
It's essentially, let me write
it over here, the projection

00:09:52.600 --> 00:10:00.610
of the vector V2 onto the
subspace V1 is equal to V2--

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:07.680
let me write it this way-- V2
dotted with the subspaces V1's

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:14.350
first basis vector, which
is the vector U1, right?

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.700
That's its first basis vector.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:21.070
We're dealing with an
orthonormal basis-- times U1.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:25.150
And then if we had more basis
vectors, we would say plus V2

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.320
dotted with our next basis
vector, times that basis

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.930
vector, and so on
and so forth.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.580
But V1 only has one
basis vector.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.770
It only has the basis vector
U1 right here.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.570
Right?

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.270
It is only spanned by that.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:43.410
So, we can rewrite this thing
right here. ys, this vector

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.330
right here that I'm going to
replace V2 with, is equal to

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:55.080
V2 minus the projection of V2
onto the subspace V1, on to

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.230
that line, which is just this.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:04.830
V2 dot U1 times the vector U1.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.910
And just like that, we've
solved for y.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.690
So we have a basis for V2, where
this guy and this guy

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.710
are orthogonal.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.870
This guy is the unit vector.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.120
He's been normalized,
but this guy hasn't

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.660
been normalized yet.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:24.410
So to normalize it, let's just
define some other vector as U2

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.100
and do the same thing.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.060
Let's just normalize it.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.650
So U2 is equal to y2, divided
by the length of y2.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.000
Now, we can say that the
subspace V2 is equal to the

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.330
span of U1 and, instead of y2,
I'll put U2 there, because I

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.990
can generate y2 by just
scaling up U2.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.130
What's neat about this now is,
I have two unit vectors, or

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.380
two normalized vectors, and
they're orthogonal with

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.460
respect to each and they span
what V1 and V2 spanned

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.590
originally.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.280
Now,

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.930
we need to keep going.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.100
What about if we want to go
to V3 here, what do we do?

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.730
Well, we do the same idea.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.490
So let's define the
subspace V3.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.430
This is going to be a
three-dimensional subspace.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.340
Once we get beyond V3, it
becomes a little hard to

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.720
visualize, but I think you're
going to see the

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.240
pattern after this step.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:29.920
If we define V3 as equal to the
span of these guys, U1,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.420
U2, and then, in our
original basis, V3.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.980
I didn't write it there but
there's a V3 there.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.150
So in our original
non-orthonormal

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.980
basis, we have V3.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.110
What is this going
to look like?

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.870
Or how can we turn this into
an orthonormal basis?

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:53.060
So, if you visualize all of
these, so the span of U1 and

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.460
U2, our subspace V2 is just
going to be a plane.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.720
It's going to be
a plane in R3.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.950
It's going to look like
that right there.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.430
And so, our new span is going
to be everything in that

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.370
plane, all linear combinations
of things in that plane, plus

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.010
linear combinations of our
vector V3, which is linearly

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.930
independent from these guys
because it was linearly

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.220
independent from the stuff we
used to construct these guys.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.605
So V3 is going to pop
out of this plane.

00:13:21.605 --> 00:13:23.170
It can't be represented
by the linear

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.610
combination of those guys.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.650
So let's say V3 pops out of
the plane, like that.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.730
Now, we want another vector that
can represent everything

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.760
of this span, but it is
orthogonal to these dudes

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.920
right here.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.190
Or another way to think
about it, it's

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.320
orthogonal to the plane.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.990
So we want another vector that
is orthogonal to the plane.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:51.460
So let's call that vector y3,
y sub 3, not y to the third

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.340
power, y sub 3.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:59.420
And if we figure out our y sub
three, we can replace V3 with

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.570
it because V3 can be represented
as a linear

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.250
combination of U1 and U2.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:03.890
Right?

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.850
That's going to be a linear
combination of U1, U2 is going

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.810
to be some vector in
this plane plus y3.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.460
I can represent this guy with
this green vector plus this

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:13.910
vector right here.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.370
So if we replace him with y3, we
can still get to V3 and we

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.600
can still get to all the linear
combinations that V3

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.020
can help construct.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.040
So what is this y3?

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.160
Well, by the same exact logic,
this green vector right here

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:37.110
is the projection of my vector
V3 onto the subspace V2 and

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:44.300
your vector y3 is just equal
to the vector V3 minus the

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:51.360
projection of V3 onto V2.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.370
So, what is that going to be?

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.950
Well, the projection-- I'll
write it here-- the projection

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:03.560
onto the subspace V2 of V3, of
the vector V3 is going to be

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.380
equal to-- we're going
to use the same exact

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.310
logic we did before.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.140
We saw this two or
three videos ago.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:13.170
Because V2 is defined with an
orthonormal basis, we can say

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:19.260
that the projection of V3 onto
that subspace is V3, dot our

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:25.460
first basis vector, dot U1,
times our first basis vector,

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:32.550
plus V3 dot our second basis
vector, our second orthonormal

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.090
basis vector, times our second
orthonormal basis vector.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:36.770
It's that easy.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.440
That's one of the neat things
about having an

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.680
orthonormal basis was.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.200
This is an orthonormal basis.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.870
So we can define the projection
in this way.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.570
So y is just going to be V3
minus this business right

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.460
here, and I'll just write out.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:59.910
So y3 is going to be V3 minus
the projection of V3 onto V2.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:04.690
So minus that business
right there.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.700
Let me copy it, and then
let me paste it.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.770
And then you get y3.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.105
And y3 is nice.

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:16.310
So if we replace this with y3,
which we can because we can

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.970
now get V3 as a linear
combination of

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.520
these guys and y3.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.870
That's nice because all of these
guys are orthogonal with

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.500
respect to each other, but y3
does not have length 1 yet.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.630
It hasn't been normalized.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.950
So we can just replace y3 with
another unit vector.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:38.950
We'll just say, U3 is equal to
y3 divided by the length of

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.450
y3, whatever that might be.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.880
But if we have what y3 is, we
can figure out its length and

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.080
divide by that.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.550
And then if you put-- so this
is equal to the span of U1,

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.700
U2, and U3.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.300
So U3 might be a scaled-down
version of y3.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.860
We're talking about linear
combinations when we talk

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.070
about span, so you can scale
them up and add it to the

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:03.480
projection.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.589
You're still going to get V3.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.190
And now, these are all
normalized vectors.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:11.720
And so you would not have an
orthonormal basis for the

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.119
subspace V3.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.589
I think you get the
pattern now.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.935
You can keep doing this.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:23.950
You can define V4, when I
defined the problem I just

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:27.030
said that we're dealing with
a k dimensional subspace.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:27.930
We go up to Vk.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.580
But you just keep going until
you go up to your k.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.570
If k was 3, we'd be done.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:38.650
If k is 4, you say you define a
subspace V4 is equal to the

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:47.290
span of U1, U2, U3, and then
throw our non-orthonormal

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.700
vector, V4, into the mix.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:59.180
And so you can replace V4 with
y4 is equal V4 minus the

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.080
projection.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.370
It becomes a little
hard to visualize.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.720
You're not projecting on to
a three-dimensional space.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:10.280
The projection of V4 onto
our subspace V3.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.120
It's completely analogous
to this.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.370
It's just V3 is now a
three-dimensional

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.190
space, not a plane.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.690
You're [? finding ?]

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.700
this projection onto this.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.300
This is definitely going to be
orthogonal to everything else,

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.090
to our subspace V3.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:31.560
And you can construct V4 with y4
because V4, by definition,

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.120
is equal to-- we can just
rearrange this-- y4 plus the

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.480
projection of V4 onto V3.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.275
So you can construct V4 with y4
and some linear combination

00:18:44.275 --> 00:18:45.140
of these guys.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.860
So I can replace this guy
with y4 and then I

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.920
would normalize y4.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.145
I would divide it by its
length and I'd get U4.

00:18:51.145 --> 00:18:54.660
And I just keep doing that
until I get up to k.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.290
If I do V5, I do the process
over and over and over again.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:05.060
And this process of creating an
orthonormal basis is called

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:12.275
the Gram-Schmidt Process.

00:19:12.275 --> 00:19:14.760
And it might seem a little
abstract, the way I did it

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.480
here, but in the next video
I'm actually going to find

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.820
orthonormal bases
for subspaces.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.640
You'll see it's not too bad
when you have to deal with

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.110
real numbers.
