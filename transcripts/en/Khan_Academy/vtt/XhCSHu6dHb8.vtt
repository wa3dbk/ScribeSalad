00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.580
 

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.980
Let's say I have a subspace v
that is equal to all of the

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:15.325
vectors-- let me write it this
way-- all of the x1, x2, x3's,

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:24.980
so all the vectors like this
that satisfy x1 plus x2 plus

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.050
x3 is equal to 0.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.030
So if you think about it, this
is just a plane in R3, so this

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.180
subspace is a plane in R3.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.810
And I'm interested in finding
the transformation matrix for

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.350
the projection of any vector
x in R3 onto v.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.840
So how could we do that?

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.780
So we could do it like we
did in the last video.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.280
We could find the basis for
this subspace right there.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.580
And that's not too hard to do.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.290
We could say x1, if we assume
that, let's say, that x2 and

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.080
x3 are kind of free variables,
then we could say that x1 is

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.550
equal to minus x2, minus x3.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.940
And then let's just, just so we
can write it in, kind of,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.130
our parametric form, or if we
can write our solution set as

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.650
the combination of basis
vectors, we can say x2 is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.520
equal to, let's say
it's equal to some

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.930
arbitrary constant, C2.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.360
And let's say that x3
is equal to some

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.900
arbitrary constant, C3.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.860
Then we can say that v, we can
rewrite v, we could say that v

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.220
is-- I'll do it here-- v is
equal to the set of all x1's,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:51.590
x2's, and x3's that are equal
to C2 times-- so x1 is equal

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.320
to minus-- let me rewrite
this with a C2--

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.230
this is equal to C2.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.190
This is equal to C3.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.050
So x1 is equal to minus
C2, minus C3.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.470
So x1 is equal to minus 1 times
C2, plus C3 times what?

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.560
Plus C3 times minus 1.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.550
And then what is x2 equal to?

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.470
x2 is just equal to C2.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.420
So it's 1 times C2,
plus 0, times C3.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.450
x3 is just equal to C3,
so it's 0 times C2,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.700
plus 1, times C3.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.410
And so this is another way
of defining our subspace.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.810
All of the vectors that satisfy
this is equal to this

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.590
definition here.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.660
It's all the vectors whose
components satisfy, or that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.450
lie in this plane, whose entries
lie in that plane.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.420
And that's for any real
numbers right there.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.590
Or another way of writing this,
is v is equal to the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:05.230
span of the vectors minus 1, 1,
and 0, and the vector minus

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.430
1, 0, and 1.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.100
Just like that.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.000
And we know that these are
actually a basis for v because

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.480
they're linearly independent.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.640
There's no way I can take linear
combinations of this

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.390
guy and make the second
entry equal a 1 here.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.670
And likewise there's no way I
can take linear combinations

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.480
of this guy and make this third
entry equal a 1 here.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.390
So these are also
a basis for v.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.560
So given, that just using the
technique we did before, we

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.120
could set some vector, we could
set some matrix A equal

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:45.930
to minus 1, 1, 0, and then
minus 1, 0, and 1.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.280
And then we can figure out that
the projection of any

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.440
vector x in our 3 onto v is
going to be equal to, and we

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.640
saw this, it's going to be equal
to A times the inverse

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.210
of A transpose A.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.190
All of that times A transpose
and all of that times x.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.750
And you can do it.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.500
You have A here.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.860
You can figure out what the
transpose of A is very easy.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.615
You can take A transpose A,
then you can invert it.

00:04:19.615 --> 00:04:22.500
And it'll be very similar to
what we did in the last video.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.530
It'll be a little less work,
because this is a 3 by 2

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.720
matrix, instead of
a 4 by 2 matrix.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.260
But you saw it is actually
a lot of work.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.800
It's very hairy and you might
make some careless mistakes.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.620
So let's figure out if there's
another way that we can come

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.060
up with this matrix
right here.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:50.280
Now we know that if x is a
member of R3, that x can be

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.550
represented as a combination of
some vector v, that is in

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.720
our subspace, plus some vector
w, that is in the orthogonal

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.820
complement of the subspace,
where v is a member of our

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:19.760
subspace, and w is a member of
the orthogonal complement of

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.950
our subspace.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:26.290
Now by definition, that right
there is the projection of x

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.030
onto v, and this is the
projection of x onto the

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.510
orthogonal complement of v.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:42.070
So we can write that x is equal
to the projection onto v

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:49.650
of x, plus the projection onto
v's orthogonal complement, or

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.190
the orthogonal complement
of v of x.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.190
So this is by definition, that
any member of R3 can be

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.000
represented this way.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.220
Now if we want to write this as
matrix vector products, and

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.620
two videos ago I showed you
that these are linear

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.346
transformations.

00:06:05.346 --> 00:06:06.940
So let me write that here.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.230
So they're linear
transformations.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.780
So they can be written as
matrix vector products.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.190
You see that right there.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:19.130
Let me define this matrix, I
don't know, let me call this

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.060
matrix T, let me
just call it T.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.250
And let me do another.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.180
Let me do a letter,
let me do B.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:40.200
And let's say that the
projection onto the orthogonal

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.270
complement of v of x, let's say
that that's equal to some

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.125
other matrix C, times x.

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:52.650
And we know this is a linear
transformation, so it can be

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.720
represented as some
matrix C times x.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.060
So what are these going
to be equal to?

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.610
Well x, if I want to write it as
a linear transformation of

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.730
x, I could just write it as the
3 by 3 identity matrix,

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.370
times x, right?

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.880
That's the same thing as x.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.710
That's going to be equal to the
projection of x onto v,

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.800
well that's just the same
thing as B times x.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.010
 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.870
And then plus the projection
of x onto v's orthogonal

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.640
complement, well that's
just C times x.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.050
Plus C times x.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.390
And if you want to factor out
the x on this side, we know

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.830
that the matrix vector
products exhibit the

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.260
distributive property, so we
could write that the identity

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:47.180
matrix times x is equal
to B plus C, times x.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.000
Or another way to view this
equation is that this matrix

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.740
must be equal to these
two matrices.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:02.530
So we get that the identity
matrix in R3 is equal to the

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:09.100
projection matrix onto v, plus
the projection matrix onto v's

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.580
orthogonal complement.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.740
Remember, the whole point of
this problem is to figure out

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.800
this thing right here,
is to solve or B.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.520
And we know a technique
for doing it.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.520
You take A transpose, you can do
this whole thing, but that

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.760
might be pretty hairy.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.520
But maybe it's easy
to find this guy.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.400
Maybe, I don't know.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.780
It actually turns out in the
video, this one will be easy.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.050
So if it's easy to find this
guy, we can just solve for B.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:36.200
If we subtract C from both
sides, we get that B is equal

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.760
to I, is equal to the identity
matrix, minus the

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.960
transformation matrix for the
transformation onto v's

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.300
orthogonal complement.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.730
So let's see what this is.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.460
Let's see if we can figure out
what C is right there.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.860
So let's go back to
our original.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.200
So remember-- let me rewrite
the problem actually--

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:09.940
remember that v was equal to,
essentially it's equal to all

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:24.140
of the x1's, x2's, x3's that
satisfy x1 plus x2, plus x3 is

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.960
equal to 0.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.500
Or another way to say it is that
all the x1's, x2's, and

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:39.800
x3's that satisfy the equation
1, 1, 1, times x1, x2, x3 is

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.900
equal to the 0 vector.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.610
Or this case it'll just be 0.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.440
We could write the 0 vector
just like that.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.180
So 1 times x1, plus 1 times x2,
plus 1 times x3 is going

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.350
to equal the 0 vector.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.350
This is another way
to write v.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.670
Now all of the x's that
satisfied this right here,

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.110
what is that?

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.170
This is saying that v is equal
to the null space of this

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.920
matrix right there.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.550
The null space of this matrix
is all of the vectors that

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.330
satisfy this equation.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:14.370
So v is equal to the null
space-- let me write it this

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:19.440
way-- the null space of 1,
1, 1, just like that.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.050
Up here we, kind of, figured
out v in kind of the

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:22.710
traditional way.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.730
We figured out that v is the
span of these things, but now

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.600
we know that's the same thing is
the null space of 1, 1, 1.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.890
These two statements
are equivalent.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:37.080
Now we at least had a hunch that
maybe, you know, we could

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.070
figure out, straight up, this B
here by doing all of this A

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.120
transpose and, you know,
by doing all of

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.970
this silliness here.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.040
But our hunch is maybe if
we could figure out the

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:53.650
transformation matrix for the
orthogonal complement of v

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.560
right there, that then we could
just apply this, kind

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.600
of, that we can just solve for
B given that the identity

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.840
matrix minus this guy is
going to be equal to B.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.590
So let's see if we can figure
out the projection matrix, if

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.420
we can figure out the
transformation matrix for the

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.260
orthogonal projection, for
x onto the orthogonal

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.820
projection of v.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.380
So this is v.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.550
What is v compliment?

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.650
v compliment is going to be
equal to the orthogonal

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.680
complement, or v perp is going
to be equal to the orthogonal

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:35.340
complement of the null space
of this matrix right here.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.210
Which is equal to what?

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:41.180
Remember, the null space, its
orthogonal complement-- a null

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:49.220
space's orthogonal complement is
equivalent to the row space

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.620
or the column space
of A transpose.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.650
We saw that multiple times.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.690
Or you could say the orthogonal
complement of the

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.990
row space is the null space.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.120
We've seen this many,
many times before.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.790
So the orthogonal complement of
this guy is going to be the

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.880
column space of his transpose.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.305
So the column space of the
transpose of this guy.

00:12:15.305 --> 00:12:21.560
So it's 1, 1, 1,
just like that.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.570
Or we can write that v's
orthogonal complement is equal

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:32.490
to the span of 1, 1, 1.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.320
The column space of this matrix,
we only have one

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.540
column in it, so its column
space is going to be the span

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.860
of that one column.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.340
So just to visualize what
we're doing here, that

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.780
original equation for v, that
satisfies that, that's just

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.030
going to be some plane in R3.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.660
 

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.570
That is v right there.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.100
And now we just figured
out what v's

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.610
orthogonal complement is.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.050
It's going to be a line in R3.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.270
It's going to be all
of the linear

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.880
combinations of this guy.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.640
So it's going to be
some line in R3.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.900
I haven't drawn it.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.960
You know this is going to be
tilted more, and so is this,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.000
but it's going to
be some line.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.840
So this is the orthogonal
complement of v.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.840
So let's see if we
can figure out.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:18.820
So remember, the projection--
let me do it this way.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.920
So this is the basis for v's
orthogonal complement.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.200
So let's construct
some matrix.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.760
I don't know, let me
use a letter that I

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.020
haven't used before.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.250
Let me construct some matrix D,
whose columns are the basis

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.710
vectors for the orthogonal
complement of v.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.580
Well, there's only one
basis vector, so

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.730
it's going to be that.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.930
And we learned, in the last
video and the video before

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:53.550
that, that the projection of
any vector in R3 onto v's

00:13:53.550 --> 00:14:00.580
orthogonal complement is going
to be equal to D times D

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:09.520
transpose D inverse, times
D transpose, times x.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.230
Or another way to view it is
that this thing right here,

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.590
that thing right there is the
transformation matrix for this

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.470
projection.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.455
That is the transformation
matrix.

00:14:20.455 --> 00:14:23.940
 

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.020
matrix

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.620
So let's see if this is easier
to solve this thing than this

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.190
business up here, where we
had a 3 by 2 matrix.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.490
That was the whole motivation
for doing this problem.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.180
To figure out the projection
matrix for v's subspace, we'd

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.150
have to do this with
the 3 by 2 matrix.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.100
It seems pretty difficult.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.720
Instead, let's find the
projection matrix to get to

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.780
the production onto
v's orthogonal

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.770
complement, which is this.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.050
So what is D transpose?

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.910
So D transpose is just going
to be equal to 1, 1, 1.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.230
What is D transpose times D?

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.770
Well, that's D transpose.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.220
This is D, just like that.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.540
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.460
This is just the dot product
of that and that.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:13.210
1 times 1, plus 1 times 1, plus
1 times 1, it equals 3.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.690
So this thing right here is
equal to a 1 by 1 matrix 3.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:18.540
So let's write it down.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:26.700
So this is equal to D-- which
is this matrix, 1, 1, 1--

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.770
times D transpose D inverse.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.670
So D transpose D is just
a 1 by 1 matrix.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.010
And we're going to have
to invert it.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.750
Actually, I've never defined the
inverse of a 1 by 1 matrix

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.510
for you just now, so it's
just mildly exciting.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.420
Times D transpose.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.280
So D transpose looks
like this, 1, 1, 1.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.940
And then all of that's
times x.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.920
But this is the transformation
matrix right there.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.490
Now what is the inverse
of a 1 by 1 matrix?

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:58.930
Now you just have to remember
that A inverse times A is

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.730
equal to the identity matrix.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.850
If we're dealing with a 1 by 1
matrix, then I'm just trying

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:11.030
to figure out what, let's say,
what matrix times 3 is going

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.880
to be equal to the 1 by
1 identity matrix.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:26.500
So let's say that 3 inverse
times 3 has to be equal to the

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.600
identity matrix.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.710
1 by 1 identity matrix.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.600
Well, the only matrix that's
going to make this work out,

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.040
to get this entry I'll just take
this guy's entry times

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.880
that guy's entry, is going to
be this guy right here.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.500
The inverse of this 1
by 1 matrix has to

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.920
be the matrix 1/3.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.200
1/3 times 3 is equal to 1.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.700
This is almost trivially
simple, but this is the

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.270
inverse, that right there is the
inverse matrix, for the 1

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.020
by 1 matrix 3.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.790
So this right here
is just 1/3.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.360
And we could actually
just take that out.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.660
It's a 1 by 1 matrix,
which is essentially

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.430
equivalent to a scalar.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:08.599
So this is going to be equal--
let me just draw a line here--

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:13.547
this thing is equal to 1/3--
actually, I don't want to

00:17:13.547 --> 00:17:13.930
confuse you.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.050
Let me rewrite it.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:21.410
So we get the projection of
any vector in R3 onto the

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:28.510
orthogonal complement of v, is
equal to 1/3, that's 1/3,

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:33.330
times the vector 1, 1, 1,
times-- sorry, or wait, that

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.120
is a vector or the matrix 1
on 1-- times that matrix

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.880
transposed, 1, 1, 1.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.860
And then all of that times x.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.580
And you can see, this is a lot
simpler than if we have to do

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.040
all of this business
with this matrix.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.160
That's a harder matrix
to deal with.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.910
This 1, 1, 1 matrix
is very easy.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.840
Now what is this going
to be equal to?

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.930
This is going to be equal to
1/3 times, we have a 3 by 1

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.510
times a 1 by 3 matrix,
so it's going to

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.195
result in a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:18:05.195 --> 00:18:07.880
 

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.560
And what do we get?

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.980
So this first entry is going to
be 1 times 1, which is 1.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.970
The second entry is going to
be 1 times 1, which is 1.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.840
The third entry is going to
be 1 times 1, which is 1.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.450
I think you see the pattern.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.430
The second grow, first column,
1 times 1, which is 1.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.480
So this is going to be a
3 by 3 matrix of 1's.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.060
So just like that we were able
to get-- that was a pretty

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.780
straightforward situation--
we were able to get the

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:38.170
projection matrix for any
vector in R3 onto v's

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.820
orthogonal complement.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:49.270
Now, we know that this thing
right here is our original C

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:50.510
that we said.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:55.760
And we said that the identity
matrix-- we wrote it up here.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.760
Let me refer back to what
I wrote way up here.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.410
We said, look, the identity
matrix is equal to the

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:07.590
transformation matrix for the
projection onto v, plus the

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.790
transformation matrix for the
projection onto v's orthogonal

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:11.780
complement.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.490
Or we can write that the
transformation matrix for the

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:20.540
projection onto v is equal to
the identity matrix minus the

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.990
transformation matrix for the
projection onto v's orthogonal

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.240
complement.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:30.050
 

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:35.430
So if we say that the projection
onto v of x is

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:40.780
equal to B times x, we know that
B is equal to the 3 by 3

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.980
identity matrix, minus C, and
this is C right there.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:52.560
So B is equal to the identity
matrix-- so that's just 1, 0,

00:19:52.560 --> 00:20:04.160
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1-- minus C,
minus 1/3, times 1, 1, 1, 1,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.850
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, just like that.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.405
And what is this going
to be equal to?

00:20:08.405 --> 00:20:11.650
 

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.720
Let's see, let's, in our heads,
multiply this out.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.040
All of these entries are going
to be 1/3 essentially, if we

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.240
multiply this out like that.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.200
So if we have 1 minus 1/3.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.155
I could write it
out like that.

00:20:25.155 --> 00:20:28.440
It's 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.530
Everything is 1/3.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:36.740
1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3,
and this just becomes a 1.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.810
So 1 minus 1/3 is 2/3.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.290
And all of the 1's minus 1/3
are going to be 2/3, so we

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.910
could just go down
the diagonal.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.880
And then the 0's minus 1/3 are
going to be minus 1/3.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.750
Minus 1/3, minus
1/3, minus 1/3.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:58.090
You have minus 1/3, minus
1/3, and minus 1/3.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.740
And just like that, we've been
able to figure out our

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.450
projection, our transformation
matrix, for the projection of

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:09.390
any vector x onto v, by
essentially finding this guy

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.010
first, for finding the
transformation matrix for the

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.760
projection of any x onto v's
orthogonal complement.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.870
Anyway, I thought that
was pretty neat.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:25.850
And you could rewrite this as v
equal to 1/3 times 2, 2, 2,

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.470
2's along back the diagonals
and then you have minus 1's

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:29.720
everywhere else.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.040
 

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.600
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
