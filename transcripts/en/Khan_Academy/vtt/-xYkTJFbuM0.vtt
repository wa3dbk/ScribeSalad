00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.500
So we had the hundred
logicians.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.570
All of their foreheads
were painted blue.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.910
And before they entered the
room, they were told that at

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.240
least one of you hundred
logicians has your forehead

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.440
painted blue.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.920
And then every time that they
turned on the lights, so that

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.420
they could see each other,
they said OK, once you've

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.820
determined that you have a blue
forehead, when the lights

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.040
get turned off again, we want
you to leave the room.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.120
And then once that's kind of
settled down, they'll turn the

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.270
lights on again.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.659
And people will look at
each other again.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.820
And then they'll turn
them off again.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.970
And maybe people will
leave the room.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.150
And so forth and so on.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.810
And they're also all told that
everyone in the room is a

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.700
perfect logician.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.380
They have infallible logic.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.560
So the question was,
what happens?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.990
And actually maybe an even more
interesting question is

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.420
why does it happen?

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.880
So I'll answer the first,
what happens?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.050
And if just take the answer,
and you don't know why, it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.880
almost seems mystical.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.520
That essentially the light gets
turned on and off 100

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.640
times, and then after the
hundredth time that the light

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:15.540
gets turned on, and the lights
get turned off again, all of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.350
them leave. They all leave.
So I mean, it's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.730
kind of weird, right?

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.660
Let's say I'm one of them.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.750
Or you're one of them.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.060
I go into this room.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.570
The lights get turned on.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.090
And I see 99 people with
blue foreheads.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.020
And I can't see my
own forehead.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.520
They see my forehead,
of course.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.810
But to any other person, I'm
one of the 99, right?

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.690
But I see 99 blue foreheads.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.970
So essentially what happens if
we were to watch the show is,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.390
the lights get turned on.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.150
You see 99 blue foreheads.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.910
Then the lights get
turned off again.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.970
And then the lights get
turned on again.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.030
And everyone's still
sitting there.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.700
And I still see 99
blue foreheads.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.490
And that happens 100 times.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.510
And after the hundredth time
the light gets turned on,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.810
everyone leaves the room.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.230
And at first glance,
that seems crazy,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.210
because nothing changes.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.010
Nothing changes between every
time we turn on the light.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.030
But the way you need to think
about this-- and this is what

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.380
makes it interesting-- is what
happens instead of 100, let's

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.070
say there was one person
in the room.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.485
So before the show starts-- they
never told me that there

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.890
were going to be 100
people in the room.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.010
They just said, at least one
of you, at least one of the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.310
people in the room, has your
forehead painted blue.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.410
And as soon as you know that
your forehead is painted blue,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.920
you leave the room.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.950
And that everyone's a
perfect logician.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.430
So imagine the situation where
instead of 100 there's only

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.500
one perfect logician.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.100
Let's say it's me.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.570
So that's the room.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.460
I walk in.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.760
And I sit down.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.160
And maybe I should
do it with blue.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.540
And then they turn the
lights on, and say,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.310
look around the room.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.890
And I look around the room, and
I see nobody else, right?

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.525
And remember, even in the case
of one, we've painted

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:12.540
everyone's forehead blue.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.360
So in this case, this one dude,
or me or whoever you

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.270
want to call him.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.110
His forehead is painted blue.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.970
So he looks around and he
sees no one in the room.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.880
But he remembers the statement,
and maybe it's even

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.830
written down on a card for
him in case he forgets.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.310
That at least one of you has
your forehead painted blue.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.180
So if he looks around the room
and he says, well I'm the only

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.850
dude in the room.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.470
And they told me that at least
one of the dudes in the room

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.110
is going to have their
foreheads blue.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.870
Well, I'm the only
dude in the room.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.620
So I must have a
blue forehead.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.550
So as soon as they turn the
lights off, he's going to

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.450
leave. Fair enough.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.010
That's almost trivially
simple.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.040
And you might say, so how
does this apply to 100?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.820
Well what happens when
there are two people.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.870
And once again, both
of them have their

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.810
foreheads painted blue.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.480
So let me draw another.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.060
I don't want to keep drawing
the blue forehead room.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.130
Let's say there's
two people now.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.400
So let's put ourselves in
the head of this guy.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.650
Right behind the
blue forehead.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.270
That's where we're sitting.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.620
OK.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.660
So when he enters the room.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.380
He says, I either have
a blue forehead.

00:04:28.712 --> 00:04:31.010
I either have a blue
forehead, or I

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.220
don't have a blue forehead.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.490
No blue.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.180
Right?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.230
This is what this
guy's thinking.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.050
Let me draw him.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.900
And he has a blue forehead.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.590
But he doesn't know it.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.180
He can't see it.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.050
That's the whole point about
painting the forehead blue, as

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.170
opposed to another
part of the body.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.890
So he says, I either have a blue
forehead or I don't have

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.440
a blue forehead.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.800
He walks in.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.950
Let's say this is this guy.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.850
He walks in.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.930
The first time the lights get
turned on, he sees this other

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.410
dude there who has
a blue forehead.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.480
And he says OK, now let
me think about it.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.900
How will this guy respond
depending on

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.220
each of these states?

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.070
So let's say that I don't
have a blue forehead.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.730
Let's go into this reality.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.900
If I don't have a blue forehead,
what is this guy

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.180
going to see?

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.620
When the lights get turned on,
he's going to see that I don't

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.760
have a blue forehead.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.770
And we were both told
that at least one of

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.440
us has a blue forehead.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.070
So this guy, because he's a
perfect logician, will deduce

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.690
that he has to have
a blue forehead.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.630
Remember, this is in a
situation, if I assume that I

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.720
don't have a blue forehead.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.700
We're in this world.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.920
I'm a perfect logician, so
if I can assume, if I'm

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.690
simulating the reality where I
don't have a blue forehead,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.550
then this guy will see, I don't
have a blue forehead.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.950
And then he'll say, I must
have a blue forehead.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.260
And so when the lights get
turned off, this guy will

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.950
leave. He'll exit the room.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.680
And vice versa.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.770
The other guy will make
the same logic.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.940
But since both of them have blue
foreheads, what happens?

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.680
The lights get turned
off, then the lights

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.020
get turned back on.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.270
When the light gets turned
back on, this guy's still

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.490
sitting here.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.780
And I just determined that
if I didn't have a blue

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:22.790
forehead-- and this is me--
this guy would have left.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.920
Because he could've said, oh I
must be the only guy with a

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.000
blue forehead.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.710
So he would have left.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.630
But since he didn't leave,
I now know that

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.300
I have a blue forehead.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.420
So then the second time that
the lights get turned on, I

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.030
can deduce that I have
a blue forehead.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.500
And then when the lights get
turned off again, I'll leave.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.950
And this guy, he's a perfect
logician, so he makes the

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.460
exact same conclusion.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.420
Because he also simulated in his
head, OK if I didn't have

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:59.790
a blue forehead, then this guy
will leave as soon as the

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.330
lights get turned off
the first time.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.140
If this guy doesn't have a blue
forehead, then this guy

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.390
will say, well I see no-one else
in the room with a blue

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.870
forehead, and since I know that
there's at least one with

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.990
a blue forehead, I'll have to
leave. But since he didn't

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.200
leave, this guy will also know
that he must have a blue

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.000
forehead as well, so they'll
actually leave together.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.250
Maybe they'll bump into each
other on the way out.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.520
Fair enough.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.390
Now what happens if you extend
it to three people?

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.570
So we already said, if you have
one person in the room,

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.060
he'll come to the conclusion the
first time that the lights

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.650
are turned on.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.390
And then he'll leave right
when they're turned off.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.780
If you have two people, it takes
them essentially two

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.860
times for the light to get
turned on to reach that

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.020
conclusion.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.990
Now if you have three people,
and I think you see

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.240
where this is going.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.240
One, two and three.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.780
Now remember, no one knows if
their foreheads are painted

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.430
blue, but the producers of the
show actually did paint

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.340
everyone's forehead blue.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.090
So so once again, let's get
into this guy's head.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.120
So this guy says, he's either
blue or he's not blue.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.810
So in the reality when
he's not blue,

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.840
what's going to happen?

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.820
Well, this guy-- and this gets a
little bit confusing, but if

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.790
you think about it from the
previous example, it makes a

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.040
lot of sense.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.690
A person who has a not-blue
forehead actually shouldn't

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.730
affect the outcome of what
the blue people do.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.340
Because let's say that this guy
says, well what's going to

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.700
happen if I'm not blue?

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.020
Well, this guy's going to look
at that guy, and say, oh he

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.720
has a blue forehead.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.820
He doesn't have a
blue forehead.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.050
So if I don't have a blue
forehead, this guy's going to

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.360
see two people without
blue foreheads.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.760
And he's going to leave the room
the first time that the

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.650
lights are turned on.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.670
He'll come to the conclusion.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.080
Now the second time that the
light's turned on, this guy

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.550
will say, gee, this guy
didn't leave the room.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.250
That guy doesn't have
a blue forehead.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.500
And this guy didn't leave the
room because he must have seen

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.150
someone with a blue forehead.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.540
Therefore I must have
a blue forehead.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.810
And so, if this guy doesn't have
a blue forehead, both of

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.990
these guys would leave the room
the second time that the

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.580
light gets turned on.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.050
Now what happens if they don't
leave the room the second time

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.800
that the lights are turned on?

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.000
Well if I was not blue,
they would have left.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.430
So if they haven't left by the
third showing of the light,

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.660
then I know that I'm blue.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.270
So when you have three people,
they're all perfect logicians,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.810
they all have their foreheads
painted blue.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.860
The light will be shown
three times.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.950
Or the light will be turned
on three times.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.800
And then when the light
gets turned off,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.050
they'll all leave together.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.760
And so this logic
applies for any.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.230
You could have 1,000 people.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.250
You can keep extending it.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:08.030
The fourth person will have
the exact same logic.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:16.450
If he's not blue, then these
guys are going to leave after

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.430
three turnings on
of the light.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.670
But if they don't leave after
three turnings on of the

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.030
light, then he must be blue.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.630
And so they're all going
to leave together.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.390
All four of them on
the fourth showing

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.340
of everyone's foreheads.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.860
Anyway, and you can keep
extending this

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.640
all the way to 100.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.625
And 100 is arbitrary.

00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:36.520
You could do this with a million
people, and they would

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.060
just keep looking at each
other a million times.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.020
And then on the millionth
showing, they would all reach

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.236
the conclusion that they all
have blue foreheads, and they

00:10:43.236 --> 00:10:44.880
would leave the room.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.170
And if you think about
it, it's fairly

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.100
straightforward logic.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:56.230
But it leads to kind of a very
almost eerie result.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.700
Hopefully that satisfies you.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.540
See you in the next video.
