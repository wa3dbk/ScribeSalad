00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.399
As a hint, I'll take the determinant of a very similar two by two matrix.

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.514
So we wanna figure out the determinant of this matrix and we can denote it

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:13.371
by the determinant of the 2x2 matrix five,

00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:17.642
three,negative one and four

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:21.892
and the definition of determinant of the 2x2 matrix like this, as we can first take

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:24.888
this diagonal, five times four

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:29.532
so write it down, just going to be equal to

00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:35.777
5 * 4 minus of product of that diagonal

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:46.721
...so what is this

00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:50.347
give us? So, five times four is twenty

00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:55.362
and then three times negative one will be negative three

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:57.521
this is negative three...

00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:01.771
but making negative the negative three will make the positive three

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.397
so the determinant of this matrix is twenty three.
