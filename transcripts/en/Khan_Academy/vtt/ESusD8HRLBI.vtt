00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.390
Welcome to the presentation
on moments.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.680
So just if you were
wondering, I have

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.310
already covered moments.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.760
You just may not have recognized
it, because I

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.410
covered it in mechanical
advantage and torque.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.500
But I do realize that when I
covered it in mechanical

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.200
advantage and torque, I think
I maybe over-complicated it.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.100
And if anything, I didn't cover
some of the most basic

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.400
moment to force problems that
you see in your standards

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.900
physics class, especially
physics classes that aren't

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.250
focused on calculus or going
to make you a mechanical

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.850
engineer the very next year.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.660
So we did that with-- why did
I write down the word

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.980
"mechanical?" Oh yeah,
mechanical advantage.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.970
If you do a search for
mechanical advantage, I cover

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.730
some things on moments
and also on torque.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.620
So what is moment of force?

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.850
Well, it essentially is the
same thing as torque.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.490
It's just another word for it.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.730
And it's essentially force times
the distance to your

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.650
axis of rotation.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.489
What do I mean by that?

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.690
Let me take a simple example.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.870
Let's say that I have
a pivot point here.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.470
Let's say I have some type
of seesaw or whatever.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.260
There's a seesaw.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.290
And let's say that I were to
apply some force here and the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.750
forces that we care about-- this
was the exact same case

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.850
with torque, because there's
essentially the same thing.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.370
The forces we care about
are the forces that are

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.910
perpendicular to the distance
from our axis of rotation.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.000
So, in this case, if we're here,
the distance from our

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.830
axis of rotation is this.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.990
That's our distance from
our axis of rotation.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.870
So we care about a perpendicular
force, either a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.220
force going up like that or a
force going down like that.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.490
Let's say I have a force
going up like that.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.830
Let's call that F, F1, d1.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.110
So essentially, the moment of
force created by this force is

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.500
equal to F1 times d1, or the
perpendicular force times the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.990
moment arm distance.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.240
This is the moment
arm distance.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.450
That's also often called the
lever arm, if you're talking

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.820
about a simple machine, and I
think that's the term I used

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.480
when I did a video on
torque: moment arm.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.590
And why is this interesting?

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.810
Well, first of all, this force
times distance, or this moment

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.330
of force, or this torque, if it
has nothing balancing it or

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.310
no offsetting moment or torque,
it's going to cause

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.830
this seesaw in this example to
rotate clockwise, right?

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.100
This whole thing, since it's
pivoting here, is going to

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.380
rotate clockwise.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.150
The only way that it's not going
to rotate clockwise is

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.360
if I have something keep-- so
right now, this end is going

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.500
to want go down like that, and
the only way that I can keep

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.320
it from happening is if I exert
some upward force here.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.820
So let's say that I exert some
upward force here that

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.880
perfectly counterbalances, that
keeps this whole seesaw

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.060
from rotating.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.530
F2, and it is a distance d2
away from our axis of

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.930
rotation, but it's going in a
counterclockwise direction, so

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.830
it wants to go like that.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.890
So the Law of Moments
essentially tells us, and we

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.790
learned this when we talked
about the net torque, that

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.910
this force times this distance
is equal to this force times

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.500
this distance.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:47.780
So F1 d1 is equal to F2 d2, or
if you subtract this from both

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:55.470
sides, you could get F2 d2 minus
F1 d1 is equal to 0.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.820
And actually, this is how we
dealt with it when we talked

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.640
about torque.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.060
Because just the convention with
torque is if we have a

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.890
counterclockwise rotation, it's
positive, and this is a

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.940
counterclockwise rotation
in the example

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.260
that I've drawn here.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.750
And if we have a clockwise
rotation, it has a negative

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.540
torque, and that's just the
convention we did, and that's

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.089
because torque is a
pseudovector, but I don't want

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.310
to confuse right now.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.390
What you'll see is that these
moment problems are actually

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.709
quite, quite straightforward.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.240
So let's do a couple.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.640
It always becomes a lot easier
when you do a problem, except

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.780
when you try to erase
things with green.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.410
So let's say that --
let me plug in real

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.070
numbers for these values.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.250
Let me erase all of this.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.210
Let me just erase everything.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.450
There you go.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.170
All right, let me draw
a lever arm again.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.290
So what we learned when we
learned about torque is that

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.130
an object won't rotate if the
net torque, the sum of all the

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.670
torques around it, are zero,
and we're going to apply

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.280
essentially that same
principle here.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.700
So let's do it with masses,
because I think that helps

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.980
explain a lot of things and
makes this seesaw example a

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.230
little bit more tangible.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.940
Let's say I have a 5-kilogram
mass here, and let's say that

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.640
gravity is 10 meters
per second squared.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.480
So what is the downward
force here?

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.450
What is the downward force?

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.060
It's going to be the mass times
acceleration, so it's

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.140
going to be 50 Newtons.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.350
And let's say that the distance,
the moment arm

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.570
distance or the lever arm
distance here, let's say that

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.880
this distance right
here is 10 meters.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.800
Let's say that I have
another mass.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:58.830
Let's say it's a 25 kilogram--
no, that's too much.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.090
Let's say it's 10 kilograms.
Let's say I have

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.490
a 10-kilogram mass.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.590
And I want to place it some
distance d from the fulcrum or

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.600
from the axis of rotation so
that it completely balances

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.140
this 5-kilogram mass.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.550
So how far from the axis of
rotation do I put this

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.390
10-kilogram mass?

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.310
This is the distance, right?

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.270
Because we actually carry
the distance to the

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.720
center of the mass.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.750
Well, how much force
is this 10-kilogram

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.400
mass exerting downwards?

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.120
Well, it's 10 kilograms times 10
meters per second squared,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.620
it's 100 Newtons.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.540
This is acting what?

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.390
This is acting clockwise,
right?

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.830
This one's acting clockwise
and this one's acting

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.130
counterclockwise, right?

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.750
So they are offsetting
each other.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.840
So we could do it a
couple of ways.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.190
We could say that 50 Newtons,
the moment in the

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.950
counterclockwise direction, 50
Newtons times 10 meters, in

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.890
order for this thing to not
rotate has to be equal to the

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.560
moment in the clockwise
direction.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.520
And so the moment in the
clockwise direction is equal

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:12.140
to 100 Newtons times some
distance, let's call that d,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.230
100 Newtons times d, and
then we could just

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.210
solve for d, right?

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.650
We get 50 times 10 is 500.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:24.730
500 Newton-meters is equal
to 100 Newtons times d.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.740
That's 100.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.970
Divide both sides by 100, you
get 5 meters is equal to d.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.410
So d is equal to 5.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.420
That's interesting.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.950
And I think this kind of
confirms your intuition from

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.390
playing at the playground that
you can put a heavier weight

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.090
closer to the axis of rotation
to offset a light weight

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.790
that's further away.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.530
Or the other way to put it is
you could put a light weight

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.040
further away and you kind of get
a mechanical advantage in

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.030
terms of offsetting the
heavier weight.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.240
So let's do a more difficult
problem.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.090
I think the more problems we
do here, the more sense

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.680
everything will make.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.430
So let's say that we have
a bunch of masses.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.470
Actually, let's not
do it with masses.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.820
Let's just do it with forces
because I want to

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.070
complicate the issue.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.410
So this is the pivot.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:28.940
And let's say I have a force
here that's 10 Newtons going

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.360
in the clockwise direction, and
let's say it is at-- let's

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.440
say if this is 0, let's say that
this is at minus 8, so

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.190
this distance is 8, right?

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:47.820
Let's say that I have another
force going down at 5 Newtons.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.060
And let's say that its
x-coordinate is minus 6.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.980
Let's say I have another force
that's going up here, and

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.790
let's say that it
is 50 Newtons.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.790
This might get complicated.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.510
50 Newtons, and it's at minus
2, so this distance

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.970
right here is 2.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:10.750
Let's say that I need to figure
out-- and I'm making

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.000
this up on the fly.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.750
Let's say that I have another
force here that is 5 Newtons.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.360
No, let's make it a weird
number, 6 Newtons, and this

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.840
distance right here
is 3 meters.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.000
And let's say that I need to
figure out what force I need

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.780
to apply here upwards or
downwards-- I actually don't

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.380
know, because I'm doing this on
the fly-- to make sure that

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.660
this whole thing
doesn't rotate.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.950
So to make sure this whole
thing doesn't rotate,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.090
essentially what we have to
say is that all of the

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.770
counterclockwise moments or all
of the counter clockwise

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.170
torques have to offset all
of the clockwise torques.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.880
And notice, they're not
all on the same side.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.350
So what are all of the things
that are acting in the

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.570
counterclockwise direction?

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.790
So counter clockwise
is that way, right?

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.850
So this is acting
counterclockwise, this is

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.080
acting counterclockwise,
and that's it, right?

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.530
So the other ones
are clockwise.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.000
And we don't know this one.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.210
Let's assume for a second.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.190
We could assume either way.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.680
And if we get a negative, that
means it's the opposite.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.830
So let's assume that this is a--
all of the clockwise ones

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.770
I'll do in this dark brown.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.950
Let's assume this is clockwise,
let's assume that

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.940
this is clockwise, and let's
assume that our mystery force

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.190
is also clockwise.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.060
All of the counterclockwise
moments have to offset all the

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.340
clockwise moments.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.700
So what are the counterclockwise
moments?

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.170
Well, this one's
counterclockwise, so it's 10

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.440
Newtons, 10 times its distance
from its moment arm.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.600
We said it's 8, because it's
at the x-coordinate minus 8

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.310
from 0, so it's 10
times 8, plus 50.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:58.360
This is also counterclockwise
times 6, 50 times 6, and those

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.840
are all of our counterclockwise
moments and

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.340
that has to equal the
clockwise moments.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.880
So clockwise moments,
let's see.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.450
We have 5 Newtons that's going
clockwise times 6.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.880
5 Newtons.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.400
Actually, was this 6?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.820
No, if this is 6, I must have
written some other number here

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.860
that I can't read now.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.070
How far did I say this was?

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.770
Let's say that this is 2.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.840
So that 50, let's say this is
2, it's negative 2, because

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.010
that's what it looks like.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.430
I apologize for confusing you.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.650
So what were all the
counterclockwise moments?

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:38.130
This 10 Newtons times its
distance 8, the 50 Newtons

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.790
times this distance, 2.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.750
Don't get confused
by the negative.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.890
I just kind of said we're in
the x-coordinate axis or at

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.620
minus 8 if this is 0, but it's
8 units away, right?

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.810
And this 50, its moment arm
distance is 2 units.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.640
So that has to equal all of
the clockwise moments.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.430
So the clockwise moments
is 5 Newtons times 6.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.760
Its distance is 6 and it's
5 Newtons going in

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.720
the clockwise direction.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.170
And then we have plus
6 Newtons times 3,

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.690
plus 6 times 3.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.550
And then we're just assuming,
we don't know for sure.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:14.840
Let's say we're applying
the force.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.010
I should have told you
ahead of time so you

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:16.620
could do this problem.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.430
Let's say that we're applying
the force at 10 meters away

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.480
from our fulcrum arm.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.140
So force times 10.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.240
So now let's just solve
for the force.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:35.310
We get 80 plus 100 is equal
to 30 plus 18 plus 10F.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:40.950
We get 180 is equal
to 48 plus 10F.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.500
What's 180 minus 48?

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:50.350
It's 132 is equal to
10F, or we get F is

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.780
equal to 13.2 Newtons.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:59.530
So we guessed correctly that
this is going to be a-- sorry,

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.490
this is going to be a-- I keep
mixing up all of the clockwise

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.740
and counterclockwise.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.360
This is going to be
a clockwise force.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.540
These were all of the-- sorry,
this is going to be a

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.010
counterclockwise force, right?

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.040
A clock, this is
counterclockwise.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.140
Let me label that because I
think I said it wrong several

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.240
times in the video.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.180
So these go clockwise.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.440
And it's this one
and this one.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.650
And what were the
counterclockwise?

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.480
These go counterclockwise.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.830
So we have to apply a 13.10
Newton force 10 meters away,

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:45.380
which will generate 132
Newton-meters moment in the

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.410
counterclockwise direction,
which will perfectly offset

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:52.100
all of the other moments, and
our lever will not move.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.280
Anyway, I might have confused
you with all the

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.170
counterclockwise/clockwise.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.940
But just keep in mind that all
the moments in one rotational

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.270
direction have to offset all
the moments in the other

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.510
rotational direction.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:06.440
All a moment is is the force
times the distance from the

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.260
fulcrum arm, so force times
distance from fulcrum arm.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.570
I'll see you in the
next video.
