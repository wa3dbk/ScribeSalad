00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.870
I want to make a quick
correction to the last video

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.510
where we introduced the
carboxylic acid videos, and

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.860
then we can actually compare
them in terms of their

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.060
relative stability.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.810
And that one mistake I did is
when I named the ester, all I

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.630
did is I named the main
carbon backbone.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.910
I didn't actually tell you how
many carbons you have attached

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.130
to the oxygen over here.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.400
Acetate really just refers to
this part over here, knowing

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.720
that it is bonded to-- or maybe
I should say it refers

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.780
to this part over here.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.080
But you also have to specify
how many carbons

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.960
you have over here.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.460
So this molecule that
we drew over here is

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.940
actually methyl acetate.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.890
Or if you want it's systematic
name, it's methyl ethanoate.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.015
And this is where we get
the methyl from.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:54.010
It is methyl ethanoate.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.800
Now, with that out of the way,
let's actually compared these

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.010
carboxylic acid derivatives,
and I'll compare the

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.540
derivatives of acetic acid.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.280
So the first one we saw was
the amide acetamide.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.930
Acetamide looks just
like this.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.580
This is acetamide.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.180
Then the next one we looked
at was the ether.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.710
And that's the one I just
pointed out the mistake on.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.250
So this was ethyl acetate.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.520
You have CH3 right here.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.060
This is methyl acetate.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.190
This is where the methyl
part comes from.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.220
So this is methyl acetate.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.180
And then we will compare that
to the anhydride version.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.135
So this is acetic anhydride.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:50.740
Let me do this in a new color.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.000
Acetic anhydride looks
like this.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.990
And finally, we had the
acetyl chloride.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.700
Acetyl chloride looked
just like this.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.510
And, of course, these are all
derivatives of acetic acid,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.260
which we drew at the top of the
last video, which is right

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.700
over there.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.790
Now, let's think about which
of these may or may not be

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.280
more stable.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.360
And to think about it, we're
going to think about any

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.220
resonance structures that these
molecules might have. So

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.190
if we first focus on acetamide,
we know that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.260
nitrogen forms three bonds and
then has two extra electrons

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.440
that form another lone pair.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.330
And it's actually electron rich,
because it's a good bit

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.240
more electronegative than the
hydrogens here and actually

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.180
reasonably more electronegative
then the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.600
carbon it's attached to.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.610
So you could imagine a situation
where a nitrogen

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.300
could donate an electron to this
carbon right over here,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.255
and then that carbon can let go
of one of the electrons in

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:16.260
a double bond with the oxygen.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.900
And so it could go back to the
oxygen and you would have a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.880
resonance structure that
would look like this.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.135
Let me actually use
the same colors.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.525
This oxygen just gained
an electron up there.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:34.840
And, actually, let me
draw the electron.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.010
Well, actually, I'll just put
the negative charge due to

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.250
that electron.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.920
And then we had this bond right

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.970
over here to the nitrogen.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.790
But the nitrogen just a gave
an electron to this carbon

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.920
right here, the carbonyl, or
what was the carbonyl carbon,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.770
and so now we have a double
bond over here.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.910
And the nitrogen just to gave
an electron, so it now has a

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.790
positive charge.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.830
But this is a resonance
structure of acetamide, so

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.180
pretty stable.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.705
So this is maybe I should
even say quite stable.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.170
Now, let's think about an
ether here, and we could

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.240
probably do something
fairly similar.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:25.360
So if we think about this ether
here, oxygen has two

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.730
extra lone pairs.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.480
It is more electronegative than
the things that it is

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.720
bonded to, so it could do a
very similar thing to what

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.920
this nitrogen did.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.650
It could give an electron to
this carbon right over here,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.640
and then that carbon can give
back an electron to the

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.380
carbonyl oxygen, to that
oxygen over there.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.950
And so it's resonance structure

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.600
would look like this.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.790
It would have a resonance
structure, so it's almost the

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.790
exact same thing is as what
we saw with the amide.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.550
So it would have a resonance
structure.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.120
This oxygen just gained
an electron.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.250
Now it will have a
negative charge.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.470
This bond to the oxygen is still
there, but this oxygen

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.400
just gave another electron,
formed another bond with what

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.820
was the carbonyl carbon.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.270
It actually forms a new carbonyl
group, if you want to

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.990
view it that way, and so
it will look like this.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.690
And this oxygen gave away an
electron so now it has a

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.120
positive charge.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.700
So this seems like a pretty
good resonance structure.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.050
So the question is which
of these two are

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.720
going to be more stable?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.490
And the answer there really
just comes out of

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.440
the Periodic Table.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.010
If you look at nitrogen and
oxygen, they're right there.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.610
They're both near
the top right.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.660
They're both pretty
electronegative, but oxygen is

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.030
more electronegative.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.530
It is to the right
of nitrogen.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.360
So because oxygen is more
electronegative, remember,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.430
electronegativity is just the
tendency to hog electrons.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.450
How much do you like
to hog electrons?

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.590
Oxygen likes to hog electrons
more than nitrogen likes to

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.590
hog electrons.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.520
So it would be less likely,
marginally less likely, to

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.880
give away an electron than
nitrogen would be, so this

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.330
resonance structure is a little
bit less likely, or

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.930
when you think of it
probabilistically, it's going

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.100
to happen a little bit
less frequently than

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.170
this resonance structure.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.710
So this one right here, this is
going to stabilize it less.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.210
So this is going to be
a little bit less

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.850
stable then the amide.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.380
So if we called this quite
stable, I'll just say this is

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.610
just stable over here.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.580
Now let's think about
what's going to

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.035
happen with the anhydride.

00:06:36.035 --> 00:06:41.610
The anhydride, once again, we
have an oxygen right here.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.000
It's got its spare electrons.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.870
It's more electronegative
than the things

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.210
that it's bonded to.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.330
So it seems like you could do
something very similar to what

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.360
we saw with the actual ether.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.660
It could donate an electron to
this bond right over here, in

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.920
which case, you would have
a resonance structure

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.780
that looks like this.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.920
And if it donates an electron to
this carbon over here, then

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.890
an electron can be taken away
from the carbon and given back

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:10.670
to that oxygen.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.730
So that would give us a
resonance structure that would

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.930
look like this.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.670
That guy now has a
negative charge.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.160
We now have a double bond
to this oxygen.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.630
it still has another bond
to the other acyl

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.020
group, just like that.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.140
And now this oxygen gave away
an electron, so it has a

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.090
positive charge.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.050
So it seems like a very similar
situation to what we

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.280
saw with an ether.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.810
But there's another resonance
structure here.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.810
You could also have a situation
where instead of the

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.990
electron being donated to this
carbon bond and that

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.620
happening, you could have a
situation like this, where the

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.955
electron gets donated to that
carbon bond and then this

00:07:47.955 --> 00:07:53.560
electron gets taken back by that
oxygen, so you would have

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.120
this situation.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.320
You would have a situation where
this acyl group still

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.340
looks the same bonded to this
oxygen, but now we have a

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.990
double bond over here.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.060
This guy took away
an electron.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.190
So one of the bonds in the
double bonds goes away.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.980
It now has a negative charge,
and then you have the rest of

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.020
the molecule.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.280
So you actually have these
two resonance structures.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.690
And, of course, this is now a
positive charge since it gave

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.850
away electron.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.200
So you might say, hey,
more resonance

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.860
structures, more stability.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.230
But the key here is to realize
that both resonance structures

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.510
are dependent from
the same oxygen.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.080
They essentially have to share
this oxygen's electrons.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.159
So each one of these
individually is less likely to

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:44.030
occur than just what occurs
with the ether.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.360
You can kind of view it as both
of these bonds have to

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.470
share what in the ether this
one gets on its own.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.750
And we even saw that this is
still less likely to occur

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.930
than this over here.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.730
So in this situation, in an
anhydride, if one guy's

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.110
getting the double bond, the
other guy's-- if there's a

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.500
resonance structure on one side
of the anhydride, the

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.000
other side is still reactive.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.830
If there's a resonance structure
on the left side,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.770
then the right side is still
reactive, so we'll call this

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.350
less stable.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.920
This right here is
less stable.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.890
Then finally, you have
your acetyl chloride.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.830
And acetyl chloride, there
really is no resonance

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.660
structure here.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.180
Chlorine is so electronegative
that it is unlikely to give

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.430
away an electron.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.160
It is sitting pretty with
eight electrons.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.260
That's actually true
from these other

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.010
characters right here.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.280
But chlorine is very, very
unlikely to contribute a

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.400
resonance structure here.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:47.180
So this gets no stability, so
this is the least stable of

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.040
the carboxylic acid
derivatives that

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.880
we're looking at.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.350
Now, why am I even bothering
with all of this hierarchy of

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.790
stability for carboxylic
acid derivatives?

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.890
And I'm bothering with it
because we know-- or we don't

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.860
know quite yet, but I've
already shown you some

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.690
mechanisms that can take us from
a carboxylic acid to an

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.200
ether or carboxylic acid
to an acyl halide.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.810
And, in general, you can go
between all of these and a

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.900
carboxylic acid.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.890
But since we know their relative
stabilities, we know

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.920
that if you start with an acetyl
chloride, you're much

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.500
more likely to go to an
acetamide if you have the

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.680
proper ingredients in there.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.490
If you have some amides floating
around than the other

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.970
way around.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.040
You're much more likely to go
from that to that, because

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.370
this is much less stable than
that, then you are to go from

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.670
acetamide to acetyl chloride.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.850
Likewise, you're much more a
likely to go from a carboxylic

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.700
acid to-- let me put
it this way.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.030
You're much more likely to go
from a carboxylic acid to an

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.100
acetamide, and I haven't drawn
the carboxylic acid here, but

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.050
this has better resonance than
even its original carboxylic

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.540
acid than the other
way around.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.000
Or you're much more likely
to go from an

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.770
anhydride to an ether.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.380
So that's why I'm doing
this hierarchy.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.710
You're much more likely to go
from something on the right to

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.840
something on the left.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.950
And we'll explore some of those
mechanisms in the next

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.320
few videos.
