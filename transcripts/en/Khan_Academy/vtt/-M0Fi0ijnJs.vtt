00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.900
The owner of a restaurant
wants to find out more about

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.020
where his patrons
are coming from.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.680
One day, he decided
to gather data

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.780
about the distance
in miles that people

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.780
commuted to get
to his restaurant.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.690
People reported the
following distances traveled.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.770
So this is our data
right over here.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.200
He wants to create a graph
that helps them understand

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.840
the spread of the distances
and the median distance

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.050
that people travel.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.640
What kind of a graph
should he create?

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.600
And you can plot this data in
many different types of graphs,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.690
but they tend to depict
things in different ways.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.512
For example, a line graph
shows a trend over time.

00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:36.220
He's not interested
in a trend over time,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.678
so a line graph
doesn't make sense.

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:40.807
Or a line graph could be a trend
of one variable with respect

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:41.640
to another variable.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.973
It doesn't just have to be time.

00:00:42.973 --> 00:00:44.650
But he doesn't want
to see a trend here.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.233
A bar graph is good
when you're trying

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:48.050
to bucket things, put
things into buckets

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.440
and see how those
buckets are performing.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.820
Once again, that's not
exactly what he wants to see.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.490
A pie graph, if you
want to see kind

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.420
of how things make up a whole.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.080
That's not what he wants
to see right over here.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.111
A stem and leaf plot does
help with distributions

00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:04.569
a little bit, but
it really doesn't

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.870
tackle the median distance and
the spread really, really well.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.650
So the one that
does, and especially

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.550
when people talk about
medians and spread,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.492
is a box and whiskers plot.

00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:16.200
And I'll show you how
to do it right now.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.180
Box and whiskers.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.630
And what a box and whisker
plot literally does

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.620
is it shows the
spread of the data.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.079
It splits it into quartiles.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.620
And I'll talk about
that in a second.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.409
And it also tells you where the
median of the data actually is.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.200
And that's one of the
things that the owner

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.802
of the restaurant cares about.

00:01:31.802 --> 00:01:33.510
So whenever you're
dealing with medians--

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.720
and box and whisker plots deal
with medians-- the first thing

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.430
you want to do is
order all the numbers

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.555
because the median is really
the middle number when

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:41.930
you order them all up.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.050
So let's order this.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.250
So let's write it in order.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.600
So first we have 1.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.030
So we get rid of that 1.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.290
Then we have one
2 right over here.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.490
And then we have another
2 right over there.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.890
That's all of our 2's.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.481
Then we have this 3, that
3, and then we have that 3.

00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:02.230
So those are two people
who have to travel

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.762
3 miles to the restaurant.

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:05.220
Then let's see, do
we have any 4's?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.400
We have one 4 right over there.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.740
And then we have another
4 right over there.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.920
Then, let's see,
do we have any 5's?

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.532
Actually, I just realized
that I skipped one of the 1's.

00:02:17.532 --> 00:02:18.990
We have another 1
right over there.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.380
So let's write that
1 right over there.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.029
We actually had two 1's.

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:23.820
And then let's see.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.140
Do we have any 5's?

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.900
We do not have
any 5's over here.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.890
Do we have any 6's?

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.630
We have one 6 right over here.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.290
And then we have no more 6's.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.880
Do we have any 7's?

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.950
We have one 7 right over there.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.920
8's.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.601
We have an 8 right over there
and that's the only one.

00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:43.100
Let's see.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.510
Do we have any 9's?

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.650
No 9's.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.510
Any 10's?

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.870
Yes, we have a 10.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.900
Do we have an 11?

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.040
Yep.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.250
11.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.160
Do we have any 12's?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.470
No 12's, no 13's.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.826
14?

00:02:56.826 --> 00:02:58.640
14.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.680
And we have a 15.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.100
People must like
this restaurant.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.308
They're traveling a good bit.

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:07.730
Then we have a 20 and
then we have a 22.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.080
So I've ordered all the numbers.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.070
Let me make sure I
haven't skipped or gotten

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.770
some duplicates.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.580
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.630
17 people were surveyed, 17
patrons of the restaurant.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:29.330
And we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.090
16, 17.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.590
All right.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.180
Seems like I've got all of
them and I've ordered them now.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.690
Now the median is
the middle number.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.310
We just said that we
had 17 of these numbers.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.150
So we want the
number-- and since it's

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.242
an odd number of numbers,
the median actually

00:03:43.242 --> 00:03:44.450
will be one of these numbers.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.920
It's actually the middle number.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.980
It'll be the number
where eight are larger

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.040
and eight are smaller.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.560
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.544
So it looks like
this is our median.

00:03:55.544 --> 00:03:56.710
It will be the ninth number.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.710
And then you have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 that are larger.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.460
So eight are smaller than
6, eight are larger than 6.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.550
So 6 is the middle number.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.410
If we had an even
number of numbers here,

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.629
if we had two middle
numbers, then we

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:12.920
would take the average of them.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.686
When you have an odd
number of data points,

00:04:15.686 --> 00:04:17.269
then you can just
take the middle one.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.974
So this one right over
here is our median.

00:04:20.974 --> 00:04:23.140
And then when you do a box
plot, what you want to do

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.040
is you want to find the
median of the set of numbers

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.280
that are smaller
than the median.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.900
And you also want to find the
median of the set of numbers

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.790
that are larger than the median.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.600
These are called
the first quartile

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600
and the second quartile.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.475
Because when you do
that, you split your data

00:04:37.475 --> 00:04:40.310
into four sections,
or quartiles.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.350
"Quar," you'd normally
associate with four.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.180
So let's look at the set
that's smaller than 6.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.850
So we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 numbers.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.749
So it's an eight.

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:53.290
If you have eight
data points, you're

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.510
going to actually have
two middle numbers.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.010
So for example, you have
these two right over here

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.830
are the two middle numbers--
three less, three more.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.960
You can't just pick the
2 because if you just

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.364
picked the 2, you'd have
three less and four more.

00:05:07.364 --> 00:05:09.280
And you can't just pick
the 3 because then you

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.390
would have three
more and four less.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.140
So these are our
middle two numbers.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.940
So the median of this group
right over here is 2.5.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.390
I averaged these
middle two numbers.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.550
And then let's do it over
here with this group.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.540
I'll do it in blue.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.470
So once again, we
have eight numbers.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.860
You're going to
have two middles.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.870
And so it's going to be the
third and the fourth number,

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.150
which is 11 and 14.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.460
And if you average 11
and 14-- let's see.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:43.130
11 plus 14 is 25, divided
by 2 is 12.5, is 12.5.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.730
So this essentially divides
the data into four sections.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.700
You have everything up
to this first quartile.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.750
So you have this first
section right over here,

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.540
this first median of the
lower half of the data is 2.5.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.010
Then you have everything between
2.5 and 6, then 6 to 12.5,

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.390
and then everything
more than 12.5.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.050
And so what a box
and whisker plot

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.370
is essentially a
graphical depiction

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.680
of this right over here.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.030
So let's do that.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.010
I'm going to set
up a number line.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.990
So let me draw a number line
as straight as possible.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.730
So let's say that
is my number line.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.340
And let's say that this is 0.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.700
And let's say that this
is-- I want to make it.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.310
So let's say that this is 10.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.740
And then this would be 20.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.920
And then this would be 5.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.070
This would be-- let me do it a
little bit cleaner than that.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.630
This would be 15.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.270
25 would be right around there.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.530
So first thing on the
box and whiskers plot,

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.360
you want to show the
entire range of data.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.060
So our smallest data
point starts at 1.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.300
So 1 is right about here.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.100
So if I do-- so this is 2.5.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.620
So 1 is right about here.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.700
And then our largest
data point is 22.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.480
22 would sit right about there.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.520
And I'll even label
it, although you often

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.850
won't see it labeled like that.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.760
That's 1.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.330
And then that is 22.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.140
And then the middle half of
the data, we do with a box.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.190
So the middle half
is this quartile

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.650
and this quartile
right over there.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.960
So the second quartile
starts at 2.5.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.410
So 2.5 is right there.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.100
So this is where we
start our box, 2.5.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.780
And then our third
quartile starts at 12.5.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.560
So 12.5 is right over there.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.320
12.5 is right over there.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.619
And then we can draw a box.

00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:36.160
I'll draw the box
in a neutral color.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.650
I'll do it actually
in that yellow color.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.160
So let me draw the box here.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.760
So the box shows where the
middle half of our data is.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.040
And now I can draw
these two arrows, these.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.224
So that's the box part.

00:07:47.224 --> 00:07:48.640
And then these two
arrows are what

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.530
you would call the whiskers.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.350
And that shows where
all the other data is.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.320
So it's really showing
the spread of the data.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.480
And then the last thing we need
to show is the actual median.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.130
And the median-- I'll do it in
purple-- we already figured out

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.250
is 6.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.980
So the median sits right
about-- see, this is 5.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.780
This would 7.5.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.070
6 would be right over there.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.790
So with this one
diagram, you've actually

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.700
depicted all of this
information in terms

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.390
of where is the median.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.130
The median is at 6.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.050
That is 6 right over there.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.910
Where is the middle
half of the data?

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:29.600
Well, it's between 2.5 and
12.5, between 2.5 and 12.5.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.230
And all of the data, the entire
spread for all of the customers

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.610
sits between-- and this is
what the whiskers do for us.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.706
It sits between 1 and
it sits between 22.

00:08:40.706 --> 00:08:43.039
And if you wanted to color
code it a little bit better--

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.490
let me do that just
because it's fun.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.030
So this data right
over here-- and really,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.690
if you think about it, it's
including this data too.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.795
That's what this
whisker is depicting.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.900
This data right over-- Let me
do that in a different color.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.540
This data right
over here is kind

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.077
of the first half of the box.

00:09:06.077 --> 00:09:07.160
That data right over here.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.490
Then you have your
median in magenta.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:15.030
Then this data right over here
is the second part of the box.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.090
So it's all of this
stuff right over here.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.370
And then finally, let
me pick a new color

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.330
that I haven't used yet.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.980
This data is kind of
represented by this part,

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.532
by this whisker right over here.

00:09:30.532 --> 00:09:32.240
Now there's one thing
I want to leave you

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.700
with is that I used a method for
this box and whisker diagram.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.960
I found the median.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.870
I use a method where the two
halves, I got rid of the median

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.460
and I found the
median of this part,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.959
and I found the
median of that part.

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:45.380
And that's the
more typical method

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.050
for box and whisker plots.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.010
Sometimes when you find
the median of the lower

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.920
half and the upper
half, some people

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.579
will include this median in both
sets when they calculate it.

00:09:53.579 --> 00:09:55.620
But I just want to let
you know that's out there.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.161
But the way that I
did it is actually

00:09:57.161 --> 00:09:58.200
the more mainstream way.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.570
That's the way most
calculators, I believe,

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.868
actually will do a
box and whisker plot.
