00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.360
We're on problem number 7.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.100
Ahmed has two containers of--
oh, look at that, they're

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.070
doing ethnic names now.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.930
For the first time, someone on
the SAT sounds like they might

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.730
be related to me.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.860
Anyway, Ahmed has containers
of two different sizes.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.210
The total capacity of
16 containers of

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.760
one size is x gallons.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.250
So let's see, so it's
container 1 size

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.700
and container 2 size.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.990
So it's 16 containers of size 1,
so 16 times size 1 is equal

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.240
to x gallons.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.940
And the total capacity of 8
containers on the other side

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.520
is also x gallons.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.170
So 8 times c2 do is
also x gallons.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.770
And x is greater than
0, of course.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.480
You can't have negative
gallons.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.030
In terms of x, what is the
capacity, in gallons, of each

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.939
of the larger containers?

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.010
Let me see what it is.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.160
Ahmed has containers of
two different sizes.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.700
The total capacity of 16
containers of 1 size is x

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.240
gallons, right.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.060
And the total capacity of 8
containers of the other size

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.740
is also x gallons.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.980
And x is greater than 0.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.070
In terms of x, what is the
capacity, in gallons, of each

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.470
of the larger containers?

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.800
OK.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.200
So all we have to know is about
the larger containers.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.450
Oh, the trick here is which one
is the larger container?

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.630
Right, that is the trick
to this question.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.140
So you really need 8 of the
second containers to get x.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.050
We need 16 of this container
to get to x.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.010
So this is a larger
container, right?

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.310
And if we wanted to know the
exact size, you divide both

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.190
sides by 8, you get container
2 is equal to x/8 gallons.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.430
And you could have figured
out container 1 is

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.220
equal to x/16 gallons.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.090
And something divided by 8 is
going to be bigger than

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.935
something divided by 16.

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:02.770
So this is our answer.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.450
This is the larger container,
x divided by 8,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.180
that's choice D.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.850
Got to read these problems
carefully.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.260
Next question.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.510
Whoops.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.170
Problem 8.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.300
Rectangle a, b, c, d.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.160
I'm still getting over the fact
that they had the name

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.740
Ahmed in the SAT.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.660
Anyway, rectangle A, B, C, D.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.330
One day, they'll have a Salman
in there too and I will be

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.910
very proud.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.830
That's my full name.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.680
I go by Sal.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.970
Some people think that I'm not
proud of my ethnicity, but I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.470
explained that's what
my mother called me.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.020
But my full name is Salman.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.300
It's actually Salman Khan, which
is the name of an Indian

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.360
actor that gets more
web hits than I do.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.490
But that's life.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.380
OK, problem eight.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.490
Rectangle A, B, C, D, lies in
the x, y coordinate plane, so

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.360
the sides are not parallel
to the axes.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.615
Well, let me clear this.

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:02.450
I have to focus.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.040
OK.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.560
It's not parallel to the axes.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.130
What is the product of the
slopes of all four

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.410
sides of A, B, C, D?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.250
Oh, this is fun.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.922
OK.

00:03:10.922 --> 00:03:12.040
So let me draw it.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.300
So it looks like that,
like that, like

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.610
that, like that, roughly.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.970
I didn't draw it perfectly,
but these are

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.220
right angles, right?

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.020
OK.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.860
So let's say the slope of this
line, right here, is m, right?

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.910
Well this line's going to be
parallel to this line, so this

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.140
is also going to have
a slope of m.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.670
And this is something you
should just memorize.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.980
The slope of a perpendicular
line-- so the slope

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.320
perpendicular to this--
is a negative inverse.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.090
So the inverse of m is 1/m,
and it's going to be the

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.630
negative inverse.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.060
So the slope of this line right
here is negative 1/m.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.020
And that's something that
you should just

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.820
memorize, for life.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.450
And, of course, this one is
parallel to this one.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.735
It's also perpendicular
to these two, so

00:03:58.735 --> 00:04:01.220
it's also minus 1/m.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.130
So they want to know the product
of all of these.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:12.330
So you get m times minus 1/m
times m times minus 1/m.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.930
m times minus 1/m, this is
minus 1 times minus 1,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.810
which equals 1.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.430
And that is choice D.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.780
Next problem.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.315
This problem is all based on,
did you know that the slope of

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:28.505
a perpendicular line is
a negative inverse?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.250
Invert colors.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.600
All right.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.080
Problem number 9.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.210
An hour long television program
includes 20 minutes of

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.390
commercials.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.230
What fraction of the hour long
program was not commercials?

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.110
So if it had 20 minutes of
commercials, it must have had

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.700
40 minutes not commercials,
right?

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.140
So 40 minutes over an hour is
the fraction that's not

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.640
commercials.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.850
So that's 4/6, which
equals 2/3.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.690
That's the answer.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.720
That's it.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.930
Problem 10.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.740
If the product of 0.3 and a
number is equal to 1-- 0.3 and

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.055
a number, the product of 0.3
and a number, I'll say x is

00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:17.555
equal to 1.

00:05:17.555 --> 00:05:19.170
So the product of 0.3
and x is equal to

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.050
1-- what is the number?

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.635
Divide both sides by 0.3.

00:05:22.635 --> 00:05:26.800
x is equal to 1 divided
by 0.3.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.890
And what is that equal to?

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.500
I don't know, can you use
a calculator on this?

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.770
You could multiply the top
and the bottom by 10.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.510
That is equal to 10/3, which is
equal to 3 and 1/3, which

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.310
is equal to-- well, you could
just write 10/3, actually.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.520
Multiply the top and
the bottom of it.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.560
Well, that's also
3.333 repeating

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.490
over, and over again.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.470
So you could do it
that way too.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.050
Next problem.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.930
Did I do that right?

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.670
Is equal to what?

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.980
Right.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.630
That's right.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.570
Problem 11.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.565
Let-- oh, I like when they
define these new operations.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.990
OK, this is a fun one, x y, z
can be defined as-- so that

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:26.150
means x to the y minus
z to the y.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.600
For all positive integers x, y,
and z, what is the value of

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.200
triangle 10, 3, 5?

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.540
OK.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.590
So what's x?

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.400
x is this term.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.220
So it's 10 to the y-- y is this
term, 10 to the third--

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.580
minus z, z is this term.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.110
I'm just pattern matching.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.920
So that z is this.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.270
And then my z to
the y, y is 3.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.030
That's all it is.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.110
So it's 10 to the third
minus 5 to the third.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.650
10 to the third is 10 times 10
times 10, which is 1,000,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.100
minus 5 times 5 times
5, which is 125.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.890
And so that's what?

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.730
That's 875.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.680
And we are done.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.930
Next problem.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.400
OK, draw a rectangle.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.040
Let's see, they have a
rectangle that looks

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.740
something like that.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:27.485
And then there's a line there.

00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:40.940
And these are points P,
Q, R, S, T, and U.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.430
And the figure above P, Q,
S, T is a rectangle.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.200
And U, R, S, T is a square.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.100
So this is a square.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.650
Fair enough.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.150
So that means this
side's equal.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.720
P, U is equal to 5.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.420
So this is equal to 5.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.110
And U, T is a positive
integer.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.090
U, T is an integer, So
that's interesting.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.790
We know it's an integer, and we
know it can't be negative.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.800
You can't have a negative side
of a square in our universe.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:14.420
If the area of P, Q, S, T must
be more than 10-- so area is

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.600
greater than 10 and
less than 30.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.610
Area is less than 30, so
we can write this way.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:30.710
Area less than 30-- what is one
possible value of U, T?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.090
Well let's just say that
U, T is x, right?

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.309
And this is a square, so
this is x, and this

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.429
is x as well, right?

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:42.490
And so what is the area
of this big thing?

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.130
It's going to be this
side which is what?

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:50.880
5 plus x times this
side, which is x.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.430
So that's going to
be the area.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.050
So it's going to be
5x plus x squared.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.500
And so that's the area.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.860
And it has to be between these
two spaces, right?

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.090
So we could try out
some numbers.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.130
Let's see, if x is 1
what's the area?

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.240
It's 5 plus 1.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.650
So then the area is 7.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.850
No, that's not greater
than 10.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.130
What happens if x
is equal to 2?

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.150
Then we have 5 times
of x is 2.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.760
You have 7 times
2, which is 14.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.690
And that satisfies
these conditions.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.230
14 is greater than 10
and less than 30.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.190
So that's it.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.100
You didn't even have to do x.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.610
You could have just said well,
what if x is, you could have

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.950
tried 1, and just tried 2.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.020
And you could say 5 plus
2 is 7 times 2 is 14.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.900
That meets my conditions,
and I am done.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.240
That's all you've got to do.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.150
I'll see you in the
next video.
