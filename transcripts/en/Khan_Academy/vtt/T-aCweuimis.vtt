00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.340
We are asked which of these
lines are parallel.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.490
So parallel lines are lines that
have the same slope, and

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.000
they're different lines, so they
never, ever intersect.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.540
So we need to look for different
lines that have the

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.030
exact same slope.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.230
And lucky for us, all of these
lines are in y equals mx plus

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.990
b or slope-intercept form, so
you can really just look at

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.330
these lines and figure
out their slope.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.870
The slope for line A,
m is equal to 2.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.100
We see it right over there.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.040
For line B, our slope is equal
to 3, so these two guys are

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.890
not parallel.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.020
I'll graph it in a second
and you'll see that.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.360
And then finally, for line C--
I'll do it in purple-- the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.230
slope is 2.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.980
So m is equal to 2.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.690
I don't know if that purple
is too dark for you.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.040
So line C and line A have the
same slope, but they're

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.530
different lines, they have
different y-intercepts, so

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.960
they're going to be parallel.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.290
And to see that, let's actually
graph all of these

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.300
characters.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.470
So line A, our y-intercept
is negative 6.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.080
So the point 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.680
And our slope is 2.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.730
So if we move 1 in the positive
x direction, we go up

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.710
2 in the positive y direction.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.725
One in x, up 2 in y, if we
go to in x, we're going

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:27.705
to go up 4 in y.

00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:32.030
And I can just do up 2, then
we're going to go 2, 4, and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.870
you're going to see it's all on
the same line, so line A is

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.850
going to look something like--
do my best to draw it as

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.180
straight as possible.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.910
Line A-- I can do a better
version than that-- line A is

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.690
going to look like-- well,
that's about just as good as

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.040
what I just drew--
that is line A.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.370
Now let's do line B.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.940
Line B, the y-intercept
is negative 6.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.650
0, negative 6.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.422
So it has the same y-intercept,
but its slope is

00:02:00.422 --> 00:02:05.320
3, so if x goes up by 1,
y will go up by 3.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.620
So x goes up by 1,
y goes up by 3.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.120
If x goes up by 2, y is
going to go up by 6.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.876
2, 4, 6.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.160
So this line is going to look
something like this.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.770
Trying my best to connect
the dots.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.550
It has a steeper slope, and you
see that when x increases,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.560
this blue line increases by
more in the y direction.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.940
So that is line B-- and notice,
they do intersect,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.780
there's definitely not
two parallel lines.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.560
And then finally, let's
look at line C.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.670
The y-intercept is 5.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.640
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.690
The point 0, 5, its
y-intercept.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.370
And its slope is 2.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.240
So you increase by 1 in the x
direction, you're going to go

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.640
up by 2 in the y direction.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.890
If you decrease by 1,
you're going to go

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.560
down 2 in the y direction.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.390
If you increase by, well, you're
going to go to that

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.100
point, you're going to have
a bunch of these points.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.840
And then if I were to graph the
line-- let me do it one

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.810
more time-- if I were to
decrease by two, I'm going to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.930
have to go down by 4, right?

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.010
Negative 4 over negative
2 still a slope of

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.710
2, so 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.780
And I can do that one more time,
get right over there.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.330
And then you'll see the line.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.120
The line will look like that,
it will look just like that.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.020
And notice that line C and
line A never intersect.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.560
They have the exact
same slope.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.000
Different y-intercepts, same
slope, so they're increasing

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.780
at the exact same rate, but
they're never going to

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.900
intersect each other.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.600
So line A and line
C are parallel.
