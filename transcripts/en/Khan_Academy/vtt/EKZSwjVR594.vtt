00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.390
What we want to do in this video
is figure out the mass

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.480
of calcium carbonate we need
to react completely with 25

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.200
milliliters of 0.75 molar
hydrochloric acid solution.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.530
And we have the reaction here.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.520
And just to remind ourselves
what we're talking about we

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.480
have this hydrochloric acid, and
it is dissolved in water.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.040
It is an aqueous solution.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.600
The solvent is water, and this
0.75 molar tells us the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.560
molarity of that solution.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.920
It tells us the concentration
or the moles of hydrochloric

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.685
acid per liter of our
entire solution.

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:45.880
And we need to figure out the
mass of this calcium carbonate

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.900
that we need to react
completely with the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.590
hydrochloric acid solution.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.280
This amount of it.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.790
Now before we do any
stoichiometric problems, we

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.150
have to make sure that our
actual equation is balanced.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.960
So let's do that first. So on
the left-hand side right here

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.010
we've got a calcium.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.720
That's the only calcium.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.960
And on the right-hand side
we only have 1 calcium.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.660
So everything looks good from
the calcium point of view.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.620
On the left-hand side we
have a carbon here.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.390
I'll do it in pink.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.880
We have 1 carbon here, and then
we have no carbons here.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.570
And on the right-hand side
we only have 1 carbon.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.090
Everything looks good so far.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.000
On the left-hand side we
have 3 oxygens, no

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.140
oxygens over here.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.060
And over here we have 1 oxygen
and then 2 more.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.460
We have 3 on the right-hand
side.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.490
Everything looks good so far.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.380
On the left-hand side we have
1 hydrogen right there.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.130
And then on the right-hand
side we have 2 hydrogens.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.660
We have 2 hydrogens here.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.020
So to balance it let me put 2--
let me put a 2 in front of

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.310
the hydrochloric acid, the
aqueous solution of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.780
hydrochloric acid.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.250
Now the hydrogens balance out,
and we haven't done the

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.570
chlorines yet, which is good,
because that would have messed

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.430
up everything if they were
already balanced.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.810
But let's see.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.550
Now we have 2 chlorines
on the left-hand side.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.210
How many do we have on
the right-hand side?

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.590
We have 2.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.580
So now this equation is balanced
after we threw that 2

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.170
coefficient on the hydrochloric
acid.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.940
So now let's figure out what
mass of calcium carbonate do

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.550
we need to react completely
with this much of 25

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.350
milliliters of a 0.75 molar
hydrochloric acid solution.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.990
Now the whole way to think about
it is I've given-- this

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.080
is how this problem is different
than everything else

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.670
we've seen so far is that I
haven't given you the mass of

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.890
hydrochloric acid.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.070
I haven't told you the moles
of hydrochloric acid.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.650
I've told you the amount
of solution containing

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.350
hydrochloric acid and
the concentration.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.210
So what we're going to do is
take this information to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.820
figure out the moles of
hydrochloric acid in this

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.420
reaction, how many moles do
we have in this solution.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.105
And then for every 2 moles of
hydrochloric acid we're going

00:02:58.105 --> 00:03:00.560
to need 1 mole of calcium
carbonate.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.650
You're going to see that.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.260
And then we just have to figure
out well, given that

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.570
we're going to need half as many
moles here as there are

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.690
here, how much mass is that.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.020
So let's do that.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:25.810
So we are starting off with the
25 milliliters of-- let me

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.420
write this-- 0.750 molar HCl
solution, and let's convert

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.770
this to moles of hydrochloric
acid.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.570
So the first thing we need to
think about is that molarity

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.640
is always expressed in
moles per liter.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.540
This is expressed in milliliters
right now.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.440
So I want to get rid
of the milliliters.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.040
I want it to be in liters.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.560
So I want to multiply it by
liters-- I'll just write it as

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.670
a capital L-- as liters
per milliliter.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.150
And we know we have 1 liter
per 1,000 milliliters, or

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.330
there's 1/1000 of a liter per
milliliters, however you want

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.080
to view it.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.820
That's going to cancel
out that milliliters.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.160
And then we want to convert--
we want to use this

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.800
concentration information to
figure out the actual number

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.700
of moles of hydrochloric acid
we're dealing with.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:37.440
So to do that we're going to
multiply it times 0.750 moles

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:45.930
of hydrochloric acid per liter
of-- or I'll write this--

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.815
0.750 molar hydrochloric
acid solution.

00:04:52.815 --> 00:04:55.310
So let me make sure
you understand

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.010
what I'm doing here.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.005
I first want to get the 25
milliliters into liters, so

00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:01.450
I'm going to essentially divide
by 1,000 and the units

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.090
will work out.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.790
We have a milliliters in the
numerator, milliliters in the

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.680
denominator, we're left
with a liter on top.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.920
And then I want to convert
from the solution to the

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.600
actual number of moles.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.080
And if something is a-- I could
put a 0 right here--

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:22.220
0.75 molar, that means that
there is 0.75 moles of

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.250
hydrochloric acid per liter
of the solution.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.770
This is just-- I'm just
saying you can

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.340
call that the solution.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.950
And so this'll cancel out.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.550
We have the liters canceling
out with the liters.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.050
And then you can even say the
of 0.75 molar hydrochloric

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.670
acid solution cancels out with
the of .750 molar hydrochloric

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.870
acid solution.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.930
And then you're left with--
let me stay in the same

00:05:48.930 --> 00:06:04.740
color-- 25 times 1 times 0.750
divided by 1,000 moles of

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.160
hydrochloric acid.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.170
And let's get our calculator
out to solve

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.180
for this right here.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:23.250
So that is, let's see, 25 times
0.75 divided by 1,000 is

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.140
equal to 0.01875.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.120
Let me write that down.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:38.040
So this is equal to 0.018--
if I want to stick with

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.250
significant digits I really
don't have any more than three

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.680
significant digits here, so I
really shouldn't have any more

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.780
than three here.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:50.600
So I could say 0.018-- instead
of 75 I'll just round it-- 8

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.470
moles of hydrochloric acid.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.100
And now we know that for every
2 moles of hydrochloric acid

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.330
we need 1 mole of calcium
carbonate.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.520
So we want to know the moles of
calcium carbonate required.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.550
So let's do that.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.720
So let's multiply this times--
we want this thing

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.740
to cancel out here.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.200
We want that to cancel out.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.980
So we want to know, so for every
mole of hydrochloric

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.960
acid, or for every 2 moles of
hydrochloric acid, we see that

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.460
there, for every 2 moles of
hydrochloric acid we need 1

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.980
mole-- I'll do it in that same
orange color-- we need 1 mole

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:36.510
of calcium carbonate
is required.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:42.030
And so these moles of
hydrochloric acid is going to

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.200
cancel out with that moles
in the denominator.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.400
And we're essentially just going
to take this number and

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.440
multiply it by 1 and divide
by 2, or just essentially

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.510
divide it by 2.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.810
So let's do that.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.680
I could just take the original
number right here, divided by

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.200
2-- I should only do it three
significant digits-- so it's

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.920
really-- well I'll just stay
with this-- so 0, 0, 9, 3, 8

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.320
just to round it.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:25.460
So this is equal to, we're left
with 0.00938 moles of

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.740
calcium carbonate required.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.630
And we're not done yet.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.460
Remember, the question that we
asked is what's the mass of

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.940
calcium carbonate required.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.240
So we need to figure out, we
need to essentially multiply

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.159
this times the molar mass.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.850
So we want to convert this into
grams. Let's convert this

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.040
into grams. I'll switch colors
just arbitrarily.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.770
And to put it into grams you
have to figure out the molar

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.470
mass of calcium carbonate.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.690
And the molar mass of calcium--
you could look up

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.390
the atomic weight of calcium
on a periodic

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.520
table-- it is 40.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.240
And then you're going to have a
carbon in there, that's 12,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.370
we've seen that a lot.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.470
Then you have an oxygen,
which is 16, but we

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.650
have three of them.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.350
So 16 times 3 is 48, so it's
going to be 40 plus 12 plus

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.750
48, which is equal to 100.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.130
So it has a molar mass of 100.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:28.740
So times 100 grams of calcium
carbonate for every-- let me

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.960
just write that-- grams of
calcium carbonate for every

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.950
mole of calcium carbonate.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.970
And we know we're doing the
right thing by multiplying by

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.430
100 because these units
cancel out.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.440
Moles of calcium carbonate in
the numerator, moles of

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.120
calcium carbonate in
the denominator.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.120
So those cancel out.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.780
So we essentially just have to
multiply this thing times 100.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.960
So let's do that.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.050
So that thing times 100.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:59.000
So times 100 is equal to--
and we had rounded

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.800
it-- so it's 0.938.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.670
So let me write that.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:08.070
0.938.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:16.660
So it equals 0.938 grams
of calcium carbonate.
