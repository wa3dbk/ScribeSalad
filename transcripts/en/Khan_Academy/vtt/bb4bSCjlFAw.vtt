00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.711
- [Voiceover] More
function visualizations.

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:04.644
So let's say you have a function

00:00:04.644 --> 00:00:06.831
that's got a single input t.

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.813
And then it outputs a vector.

00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:11.869
And the vector's gonna depend on t.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.136
So the x component will be
t times the cosine of t.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:21.906
And then the y component will
be t times the sine of t.

00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:25.530
This is what's called
a parametric function.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.119
And I should maybe say
one-parameter parametric function.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.134
One parameter.

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:34.695
And "parameter" is just kind
of a fancy word for input.

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:36.374
Parameter.

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:40.562
So in this case, t is
our single parameter.

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:42.157
And what makes it a parametric function

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:44.834
is that we think about
it as drawing a curve

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:47.143
and its output is multidimensional.

00:00:47.143 --> 00:00:49.590
So you might think, when you
visualize something like this,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.297
ah, it's got, you know, a single input.

00:00:51.297 --> 00:00:53.233
And it's got a two-dimensional output.

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.080
Let's graph it.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.132
You know, put those three
numbers together and plot them.

00:00:57.132 --> 00:00:58.729
But what turns out to be even better

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.508
is to look just in the output space.

00:01:01.508 --> 00:01:03.714
So in this case, the output
space is two-dimensional.

00:01:03.714 --> 00:01:07.078
So I'll go ahead and draw
a coordinate plane here.

00:01:07.078 --> 00:01:09.622
And let's just evaluate this function

00:01:09.622 --> 00:01:10.868
at a couple different points

00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:12.968
and see what it looks like, okay.

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:15.028
So I might, maybe the easiest place

00:01:15.028 --> 00:01:16.539
to evaluate it would be zero.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.186
So f of zero

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:24.612
is equal to,

00:01:24.612 --> 00:01:27.665
and then, in both cases,
it'll be zero times something.

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:30.891
So zero times cosine of zero is just zero.

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.882
And then zero times sine
of zero is also just zero.

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:37.396
So that input corresponds to the output.

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:39.653
You could think of it as a
vector that's infinitely small

00:01:39.653 --> 00:01:41.974
or just the point at the origin,

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:43.594
however you want to go about it.

00:01:43.594 --> 00:01:45.056
So let's take a different point,

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:47.419
just to see what else could happen.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:51.013
And I'm gonna choose pi halves.

00:01:52.873 --> 00:01:55.064
Of course, the reason
I'm choosing pi halves,

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:57.312
of all numbers, is that
it's something I know

00:01:57.312 --> 00:01:59.097
how to take the sine and the cosine of.

00:02:00.447 --> 00:02:03.426
So t is pi halves, cosine of pi halves.

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:06.041
And you start thinking, okay,

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:07.273
what's the cosine of pi halves?

00:02:07.273 --> 00:02:08.663
What's the sine of pi halves?

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:11.458
And maybe you go off and
draw a little unit circle

00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:14.203
while you're writing things out.

00:02:14.203 --> 00:02:14.902
Whoops.

00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:18.732
See the problem with
talking while writing.

00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:20.838
Sine of pi halves.

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:26.303
And you know it's,

00:02:26.303 --> 00:02:28.841
if you go off and scribble
that little unit circle.

00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:30.574
And you say pi halves is gonna bring us

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:32.013
a quarter of the way around.

00:02:32.013 --> 00:02:33.179
Over here.

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.205
And cosine of pi halves is measuring

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:37.542
the x component of that.

00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:39.320
So that just cancels out to zero.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.308
And then sine of pi halves

00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:45.004
is the y component of that.

00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:46.723
So that ends up equaling one.

00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:51.832
Which means that the vector as a whole

00:02:55.132 --> 00:02:57.744
is gonna be zero for the x component

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.796
and then pi halves for the y component.

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:02.407
And what that would look like,

00:03:02.407 --> 00:03:04.973
you know, the y component of pi halves

00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:07.183
is about 1.7 up there.

00:03:07.183 --> 00:03:08.508
There's no x component.

00:03:08.508 --> 00:03:10.011
So you might get a vector like this.

00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:11.550
And if you imagine doing this

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.124
at all the different input points,

00:03:13.124 --> 00:03:15.210
you might get a bunch of different vectors

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.060
off doing different things.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.468
And if you were to draw it,

00:03:18.468 --> 00:03:21.080
you don't want to just
draw the arrows themselves.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.749
Because that'll clutter
things a whole bunch.

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.725
So we just want to trace the points

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:27.219
that correspond to the output,
the tips of each vector.

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:29.741
And what I'll do here, I'll
show a little animation.

00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:31.956
Let me just clear the board a bit.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.153
An animation where

00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:36.680
I'll let t range between zero and 10.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.323
So let's write that down.

00:03:43.024 --> 00:03:44.973
So the value t is gonna start at zero.

00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:47.411
And then it's gonna go to 10.

00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:50.202
And we'll just see what values,

00:03:50.202 --> 00:03:52.171
what vectors does that output.

00:03:52.171 --> 00:03:55.483
And what curve does the tip
of that vector trace out?

00:03:57.433 --> 00:03:58.813
So there it goes.

00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:01.199
All of the values just kind
of ranging, zero to 10.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.453
And you end up getting this spiral shape.

00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:05.099
And you can maybe think about why

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.272
this cosine of t, sine of t
scaled by the value t itself

00:04:08.272 --> 00:04:09.542
would give you this spiral.

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:11.576
But what it means is that when you,

00:04:12.976 --> 00:04:14.948
you know, we saw that zero goes here.

00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:19.591
Evidently, it's the case
that 10 outputs here.

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.578
And a disadvantage of
drawing things like this,

00:04:21.578 --> 00:04:24.619
you're not quite sure of
what the interim values are.

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:25.731
You know, you could kind of guess.

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:27.230
Maybe one goes somewhere here.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.801
Two goes somewhere here.

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.144
And you're kind of hoping
that they're evenly spaced

00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:32.441
as you move along.

00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:34.638
But you don't get that information.

00:04:34.638 --> 00:04:36.388
You lose the input information.

00:04:36.388 --> 00:04:37.704
You get the shape of the curve.

00:04:37.704 --> 00:04:39.122
And if you just want, you know,

00:04:39.122 --> 00:04:40.953
an analytical way of describing curves,

00:04:40.953 --> 00:04:43.025
you find some parametric
function that does it.

00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:44.979
And you don't really care about the rate.

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.577
But just to show where it might matter,

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:49.482
I'll animate the same thing again,

00:04:49.482 --> 00:04:51.332
another function that
draws the same curve.

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:53.236
But it starts going really quickly.

00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:55.577
And then it slows down as you go on.

00:04:56.497 --> 00:04:59.945
So that function is not quite
the t cosine t, t sine of t

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:01.482
that I originally had written.

00:05:01.482 --> 00:05:02.972
And in fact, it would mean that,

00:05:03.942 --> 00:05:06.239
let's just erase these guys.

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:08.728
When it starts slowly,

00:05:08.728 --> 00:05:11.298
you can interpret that
as saying, okay maybe...

00:05:11.298 --> 00:05:12.795
Well, actually, it started
quickly, didn't it?

00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:15.598
So one would be really far off here.

00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:17.340
And then two, we kind
of zipped along here.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.517
And three, you know,
still going really fast.

00:05:19.517 --> 00:05:21.316
And then maybe by the
time you get to the end,

00:05:21.316 --> 00:05:22.773
it's just going very slowly,

00:05:22.773 --> 00:05:24.925
just kind of seven is here, eight is here,

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:27.801
and it's hardly making any
progress before it gets to 10.

00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:29.660
So you can have two different functions

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.990
draw the same curve.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.670
And the fancy word here is "parameterize."

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.363
So functions will parameterize a curve

00:05:36.363 --> 00:05:38.898
if, when you draw just
in the output space,

00:05:38.898 --> 00:05:40.411
you get that curve.

00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:41.455
And in the next video,

00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:43.307
I'll show how you can have functions

00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:44.668
with a two-dimensional input

00:05:44.668 --> 00:05:46.227
and a three-dimensional output

00:05:46.227 --> 00:05:49.430
draw surfaces in three-dimensional space.
