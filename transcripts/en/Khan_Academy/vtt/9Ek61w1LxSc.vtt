00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:12.390
Let's say we have the equation
7 times x is equal to 14.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.970
Now before even trying to solve
this equation, what I want to

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.080
do is think a little bit about
what this actually means.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.870
7x equals 14, this is the exact
same thing as saying 7 times x

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:35.000
-- let me write it this way --
7 times x -- we'll do the x in

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.270
orange again -- 7 times
x is equal to 14.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.860
Now you might be able to
do this in your head.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.490
You could literally go
through the 7 times table.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.960
You say well 7 times 1 is equal
to 7, so that won't work.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.350
7 times 2 is equal to
14, so 2 works here.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.920
So you would immediately
be able to solve it.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.510
You would immediately, just
by trying different numbers

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.220
out, say hey, that's
going to be a 2.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.200
But what we're going to do in
this video is to think about

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.780
how to solve this
systematically.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.100
Because what we're going to
find is as these equations get

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.680
more and more complicated,
you're not going to be able to

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.670
just think about it and
do it in your head.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.590
So it's really important that
one, you understand how to

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.510
manipulate these equations,
but even more important to

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.280
understand what they
actually represent.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.090
This literally just says 7
times x is equal to 14.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.530
In algebra we don't
write the times there.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.620
When you write two numbers next
to each other or a number next

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.280
to a variable like this, it
just means that you

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.100
are multiplying.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.920
It's just a shorthand,
a shorthand notation.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.040
And in general we don't use the
multiplication sign because

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.970
it's confusing, because x is
the most common variable

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.840
used in algebra.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.330
And if I were to write 7 times
x is equal to 14, if I write my

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.140
times sign or my x a little
bit strange, it might look

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.150
like xx or times times.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.410
So in general when you're
dealing with equations,

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.910
especially when one of the
variables is an x, you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.350
wouldn't use the traditional
multiplication sign.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.020
You might use something like
this -- you might use dot to

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.130
represent multiplication.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.040
So you might have 7
times is equal to 14.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.720
But this is still
a little unusual.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.750
If you have something
multiplying by a variable

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.080
you'll just write 7x.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.210
That literally means 7 times x.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.750
Now, to understand how you can
manipulate this equation to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.040
solve it, let's visualize this.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.710
So 7 times x, what is that?

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.690
That's the same thing -- so I'm
just going to re-write this

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.720
equation, but I'm going to
re-write it in visual form.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.880
So 7 times x.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.740
So that literally means x
added to itself 7 times.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.230
That's the definition
of multiplication.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.900
So it's literally x plus x plus
x plus x plus x -- let's see,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.830
that's 5 x's -- plus x plus x.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.660
So that right there
is literally 7 x's.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.300
This is 7x right there.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.270
Let me re-write it down.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.030
This right here is 7x.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.610
Now this equation tells us
that 7x is equal to 14.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.800
So just saying that
this is equal to 14.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.300
Let me draw 14 objects here.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.640
So let's say I have 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.640
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.790
So literally we're saying
7x is equal to 14 things.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.070
These are equivalent
statements.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.280
Now the reason why I drew
it out this way is so that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.950
you really understand what
we're going to do when we

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.110
divide both sides by 7.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.820
So let me erase
this right here.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.175
So the standard step whenever
-- I didn't want to do that,

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:48.720
let me do this, let me
draw that last circle.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.360
So in general, whenever you
simplify an equation down to a

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.080
-- a coefficient is just the
number multiplying

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.750
the variable.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.465
So some number multiplying the
variable or we could call that

00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:00.990
the coefficient times a
variable equal to

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.990
something else.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.210
What you want to do is just
divide both sides by 7 in

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.240
this case, or divide both
sides by the coefficient.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.130
So if you divide both sides
by 7, what do you get?

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.150
7 times something divided
by 7 is just going to be

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.690
that original something.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.350
7's cancel out and 14
divided by 7 is 2.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.180
So your solution is going
to be x is equal to 2.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.200
But just to make it very
tangible in your head, what's

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.570
going on here is when we're
dividing both sides of the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.260
equation by 7, we're literally
dividing both sides by 7.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.250
This is an equation.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.850
It's saying that this
is equal to that.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.230
Anything I do to the left hand
side I have to do to the right.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.130
If they start off being equal,
I can't just do an operation

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.970
to one side and have
it still be equal.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.100
They were the same thing.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.420
So if I divide the left hand
side by 7, so let me divide

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.150
it into seven groups.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.920
So there are seven x's here,
so that's one, two, three,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.690
four, five, six, seven.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.780
So it's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven groups.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.240
Now if I divide that into
seven groups, I'll also want

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.350
to divide the right hand
side into seven groups.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.530
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.370
So if this whole thing is equal
to this whole thing, then each

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.660
of these little chunks that we
broke into, these seven chunks,

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.860
are going to be equivalent.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.070
So this chunk you could say
is equal to that chunk.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.530
This chunk is equal to
this chunk -- they're

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.490
all equivalent chunks.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.360
There are seven chunks
here, seven chunks here.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.390
So each x must be equal
to two of these objects.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.240
So we get x is equal to, in
this case -- in this case

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.830
we had the objects drawn
out where there's two of

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.680
them. x is equal to 2.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.210
Now, let's just do a couple
more examples here just so it

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.565
really gets in your mind that
we're dealing with an equation,

00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:58.320
and any operation that you do
on one side of the equation

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.540
you should do to the other.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.040
So let me scroll
down a little bit.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:13.550
So let's say I have I say
I have 3x is equal to 15.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.640
Now once again, you might be
able to do is in your head.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.780
You're saying this is
saying 3 times some

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.490
number is equal to 15.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.380
You could go through your 3
times tables and figure it out.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.150
But if you just wanted to do
this systematically, and it

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.680
is good to understand it
systematically, say OK, this

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.500
thing on the left is equal
to this thing on the right.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.995
What do I have to do to
this thing on the left

00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:33.640
to have just an x there?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.690
Well to have just an x there,
I want to divide it by 3.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.930
And my whole motivation for
doing that is that 3 times

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.620
something divided by 3, the 3's
will cancel out and I'm just

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.120
going to be left with an x.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.190
Now, 3x was equal to 15.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.240
If I'm dividing the left side
by 3, in order for the equality

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.230
to still hold, I also have to
divide the right side by 3.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.560
Now what does that give us?

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.070
Well the left hand side, we're
just going to be left with

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.130
an x, so it's just
going to be an x.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.040
And then the right hand side,
what is 15 divided by 3?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.760
Well it is just 5.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.570
Now you could also done this
equation in a slightly

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.140
different way, although they
are really equivalent.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.160
If I start with 3x is equal to
15, you might say hey, Sal,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.260
instead of dividing by 3, I
could also get rid of this 3, I

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.110
could just be left with an x if
I multiply both sides of

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.670
this equation by 1/3.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.710
So if I multiply both sides
of this equation by 1/3

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.830
that should also work.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.980
You say look, 1/3 of 3 is 1.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.710
When you just multiply this
part right here, 1/3 times

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.170
3, that is just 1, 1x.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:52.130
1x is equal to 15 times
1/3 third is equal to 5.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.140
And 1 times x is the same thing
as just x, so this is the same

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.400
thing as x is equal to 5.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.660
And these are actually
equivalent ways of doing it.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.180
If you divide both sides by
3, that is equivalent to

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.340
multiplying both sides
of the equation by 1/3.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.160
Now let's do one more and I'm
going to make it a little

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.270
bit more complicated.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.840
And I'm going to change the
variable a little bit.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:36.200
So let's say I have 2y
plus 4y is equal to 18.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.956
Now all of a sudden it's
a little harder to

00:08:37.956 --> 00:08:38.540
do it in your head.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:42.420
We're saying 2 times something
plus 4 times that same

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.260
something is going
to be equal to 18.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.400
So it's harder to think
about what number that is.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.110
You could try them.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.910
Say if y was 1, it'd be 2
times 1 plus 4 times 1,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.710
well that doesn't work.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.390
But let's think about how
to do it systematically.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.250
You could keep guessing and
you might eventually get

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.840
the answer, but how do you
do this systematically.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.830
Let's visualize it.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:04.540
So if I have two y's,
what does that mean?

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.800
It literally means I have two
y's added to each other.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.990
So it's literally y plus y.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.300
And then to that I'm
adding four y's.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.350
To that I'm heading four y's,
which are literally four

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.090
y's added to each other.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:25.220
So it's y plus y plus y plus y.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.630
And that has got to
be equal to 18.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:34.530
So that is equal to 18.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.840
Now, how many y's do I have
here on the left hand side?

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.520
How many y's do I have?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.590
I have one, two, three,
four, five, six y's.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.070
So you could simplify this
as 6y is equal to 18.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.930
And if you think about it
it makes complete sense.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:57.350
So this thing right here,
the 2y plus the 4y is 6y.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.320
So 2y plus 4y is 6y,
which makes sense.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.840
If I have 2 apples plus
4 apples, I'm going

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.850
to have 6 apples.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.810
If I have 2 y's plus 4 y's
I'm going to have 6 y's.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.615
Now that's going to
be equal to 18.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.250
And now, hopefully, we
understand how to do this.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.490
If I have 6 times something is
equal to 18, if I divide both

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.710
sides of this equation by 6,
I'll solve for the something.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:29.920
So divide the left hand
side by 6, and divide the

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.870
right hand side by 6.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:39.100
And we are left with
y is equal to 3.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.160
And you could try it out.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.750
That's what's cool
about an equation.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.290
You can always check to see
if you got the right answer.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.220
Let's see if that works.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:52.120
2 times 3 plus 4 times
3 is equal to what?

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.640
2 times 3, this
right here is 6.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.580
And then 4 times 3 is 12.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.410
6 plus 12 is, indeed,
equal to 18.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.640
So it works out.
