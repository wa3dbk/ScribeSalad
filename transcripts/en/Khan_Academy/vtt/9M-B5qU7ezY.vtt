00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.780
Let's do some word problems that
are essentially dealing

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.970
with slope of a line.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.250
You might see these being
referred to as direct

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.280
variation models, because we're
going to model what's

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.590
being described in
this problem.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.045
We're going to graph it out and
then hopefully we're going

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:17.620
to be able actually answer
their question.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.540
Let's see what they're asking.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.750
The current standard for
low-flow showerheads is 2.5

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.000
gallons per minute.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.390
Calculate how long it would
take to fill a 30 gallon

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.180
bathtub using such a showerhead

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.340
to supply the water.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.010
What we can do here is we can
set up a direct variation

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.310
model, which sounds very fancy,
but it just says, OK,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.690
let's set up a little equation
that describes how many

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.610
gallons we would have filled--
or how many gallons we would

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.980
have used after a certain
number of minutes.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.600
So let's say that we have
gallons is equal to the rate

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.780
at which we fill the gallons.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:17.460
So it's going to be 2.5 gallons
per minute times the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.710
number of minutes.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.380
I'll say m for minutes
and g for gallons.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.860
We have just set up our direct
variation model.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.780
Nothing fancier than that.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.360
We now have an equation that
describes, you give me the

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.430
number of minutes, I'll multiply
that times 2.5

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.550
because that's how quickly we're
filling the bathtub.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.460
So after 1 minute, 1 times
2.5, we have 2.5 gallons.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.220
After 2 minutes, we have 2 times
2.5, we have 5 gallons.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.330
So this is our model.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.350
And this is also a line.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.130
Remember the form of a line is
y is equal to mx plus b.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.510
Here we have no b.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.320
The b is gone.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200
We just have an m times an x.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.250
The x now we're calling minutes
and the y we're now

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.760
calling gallons and the
slope is now 2.5.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.670
Let's plot this before I even
answer their question.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.690
Instead of calling this the
x-axis-- remember x, the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.730
independent variable,
is now the minutes

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.850
that we let it flow.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.470
So that's the m-axis
for minutes.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.070
And the vertical axis, instead
of calling it the y-axis, I'm

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.260
going to call it the g-axis
for the number of gallons

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.700
we've filled.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.866
I'm only going to deal in the
positive quadrant assuming we

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:26.710
can only have positive
minutes.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.620
So what's going on here?

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.820
We have a slope of 2.5.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.900
We could also write this as
gallons is equal to-- 2.5 is

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:42.930
the same thing as 5/2 gallons
per minute times the minutes.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.030
So now we know our
slope is 5/2.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.280
I could have used 2.5 as
well, but I like 5/2.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.220
Our y-intercept we already
know is 0.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.700
There's no y-intercept here.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.050
You could do this as plus 0.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.990
So you start over here
at the origin.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.380
That's our y-intercept.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.280
And for every 2 that we go to
the right, we move up 5.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.240
So we move-- change in x is 2.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.120
One, two, three, four, five.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.180
Change in x is 2.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.160
One, two, three, four, five.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.550
If change in x is negative 2,
then change in y, it'll be

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.630
negative 5.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.540
Negative 2.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.920
One, two, three, four, five.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.300
And so on and so forth.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.300
We'll eventually
get down here.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.755
So our line, our model if we
graph it, looks like this.

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:26.800
I'm trying my best to go through
all of the points.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.360
Actually, I just said
I would only do it

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.050
in the first quadrant.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.810
It really doesn't make sense in
this quadrant right here,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.900
because you can't have
negative minutes.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.370
Or you shouldn't have
negative minutes.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.240
So we should only be dealing
with it up here.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.560
Now they're asking how long
will it take to fill a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.540
30-gallon bathtub?

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.540
Now, unfortunately, my graph
right here does not go all the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.510
way up to 30 gallons.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.800
If it did-- this is 10 gallons
right up here.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.390
That's 10 gallons if I went 3
times higher, I could just

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.370
read the graph.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.780
But we could also solve for it
algebraically right here.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.150
How many minutes does it take?

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.870
Well, let's just make our
gallons equal to 30.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.450
So you have 30 gallons is equal
to, I'll put it in the

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:18.279
same color, 2.5 gallons per
minute times minutes.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.800
Now, all we have to do to solve
for minutes is divide

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.400
both sides by 2.5 gallons
per minute.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.950
Divide both sides by 2.5
gallons per minute.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.080
I'm doing the units to show you
that the units actually

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.970
all work out in the end.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.170
So this will cancel out.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.280
It will just become a 1.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.450
And so the left-hand side-- or
we could say m-- is going to

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.100
be equal to 30 divided by 2.5.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.770
We have this gallons
in the numerator.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.580
I want to show you, you can deal
with the units just like

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.180
you would deal with
actual numbers.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.570
And if I have gallons per minute
in the denominator, if

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.730
I divide by this fraction,
that's the same thing is

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.840
multiplying by its inverse.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.780
That's the same thing
as multiplying

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.230
by minutes per gallon.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.020
Right?

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.960
These units were in
the denominator.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.850
When I put them in the
numerator, I flip them.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.070
So gallons in the numerator,
gallons in the denominator.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.200
They cancel out.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.280
So I'm left with 30 divided
by 2.5 minutes.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.900
And what is 30 divided by 2.5?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.110
Is equal to 12.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.020
So it'll take us 12 minutes to
fill up a 30 gallon bathtub.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.270
We have our minutes
right there.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.880
12 minutes.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.850
Let's do one more.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.940
Amen is-- or maybe A-man, I
don't know the best way to

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.750
pronounce that name-- is using
a hose-- let me scroll over a

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.880
little bit-- is using a hose to
fill his new swimming pool

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.070
for the first time.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.850
He starts the hose at 10 PM--
let me write this down.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:18.420
He starts at 10 PM-- so this is
the start time-- and leaves

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.540
it running all night.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.150
At 6 AM, he measures the
depth and calculates

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.520
the pool is 4/7 full.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.300
So when he starts at 10 PM--
so this is time and this is

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.470
how full the pool is.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.680
So, obviously when he starts
it, the pool is empty.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.760
It's a new swimming pool.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.240
They tell us.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.530
So the pool is 0 full.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.300
It's 0 whatever.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.500
It has no water in
it whatsoever.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:49.790
Then at 6 AM, he measures the
depth and calculates the pool

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.660
is 4/7 full.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.920
So here it is 4/7 full.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.160
At what time will his
new pool be full?

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.530
So we want to know
when it's full.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.110
When it is 1/1 full?

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.500
Where it's 7/7 full.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.420
At what time?

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.290
So to do this, we have to set up
a similar model that we did

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.500
the last time.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.770
We could say, the fullness of
the pool is equal to some

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.170
constant times the amount of
time that's passed by.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.730
We know when time is equal to
0-- let me put this this way.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.910
This is time.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.490
Let me write it here.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.980
This is time.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.870
This is time, 0.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.920
What is this in hours?

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.100
This is 8 hours later, right?

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.640
This is time 8.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.150
We don't know what this is.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.660
This is time something else.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.320
So when time is 0 at 10 PM, 0
times k, we have 0 fullness.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.240
We are not full at all.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:53.180
When time is equal to 8, we have
k times 8. k is the rate

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.210
at which we're filling
the pool.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.060
k times 8.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.600
We're at 4/7 fullness.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.490
So now we can actually
figure out what k is.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.480
We can figure out what our
proportionality constant is

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.460
for our direct variation
model.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.790
Sounds very fancy, but all we're
saying is, look, this

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.120
pool-filling business
can be modeled by an

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.550
equation like this.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.200
The amount that we're full is
directly proportional to the

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.790
amount of time that we
let the hose run.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.490
And this is the proportionality
constant.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.280
We don't know how quickly it
fills, but now we can figure

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.800
out how quickly it fills.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.890
Because we know after 8
hours it is 4/7 full.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.169
So to solve for k, you divide
both sides by 8 hours.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:45.370
So we get k is equal to 4/7 full
divided by 8 hours, which

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:53.150
is the same thing as 4/7 times
1/8 full per hour.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.140
So if we figure this
out, let's see.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.980
Divide by 4.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.360
Divide by 4.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.050
So we get 1/14 fullness.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.420
It's kind of a weird unit--
full per hour.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.690
Or you could say, we fill 1/14
of the pool per hour.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.920
So k is 1/14.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.240
So here our equation-- let
me write over here.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:23.300
The fullness of the pool is
equal to 1/14 times the time.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.130
So the question that we
have to answer is when

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.240
does this equal 1?

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.910
At what time?

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.730
So let's set up the equation.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.720
So we have 1.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.035
That means we're completely
full.

00:09:34.035 --> 00:09:38.030
It is equal to 1/14
times time.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:44.520
If we multiply both sides of
this equation times 14, the

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.420
1/14 and the 14 cancel out.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.950
And we're left with
t is equal to 14.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.240
So the pool will fill
after 14 hours.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.490
Remember everything we were
dealing with was hours.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.870
If we start at 10 PM-- that was
time 0-- what time are we

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.860
at 14 hours?

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.240
So 10 PM in one day-- if you
go to 10 AM the next day,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.280
that's 12 hours.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.010
That's how I think.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:14.600
We need to go 2 more hours
to get to 14 hours.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.670
That's noon the next day.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.490
At noon the day after he starts
filling is when the

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.190
pool will be full.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.260
We can graph this.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.290
I had this graph paper here.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.820
Let's actually graph everything
I'm talking about.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.470
The equation-- I wrote it over
here-- fullness is equal to

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.620
1/14 times t.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.860
Let's assume that each of
these notches is two.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:44.690
That is two, four, six, eight,
ten, twelve, fourteen.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.990
So this tells us that as
we run 14, we rise 1.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:54.360
So if x-change is 14, y-change
is positive 1.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.360
And I'll make these
units 1, 2.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.600
So the scale isn't
exactly perfect.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.370
I'm distorting the graph a
little bit, but that is 1.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.480
So the graph will look
something like that.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.340
Just like that.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.690
It has a slope of 1/14.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.210
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
