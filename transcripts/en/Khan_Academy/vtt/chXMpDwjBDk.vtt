00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.520
Now that we know a little bit
about the formation and

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.190
enthalpy change, and what
enthalpy is, we can talk a

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.970
little bit about Hess's Law.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.020
And what this tells us is that
the energy change of a process

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.690
is independent of how we get
from one state to another.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.340
And really, that's a by-product
of the fact that

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.430
energy is a state variable.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.740
Whether we're talking about
enthalpy or internal energy,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.470
they're state variables.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.180
And we've talked multiple times
that it's independent of

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.250
how many steps it takes to
get there, or what path

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.400
you happen to take.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.730
But how is that useful to us
when we're dealing with

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.495
everyday reactions?

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:46.990
So let me just make up some
reaction where I have A plus B

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.640
yields, oh, I don't know,
let's just say this

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.290
yields C plus D.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.350
And I wanted to figure out
what was the change in

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.230
enthalpy of this reaction?

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.400
Or essentially, how much heat
is absorbed or released by

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.950
this reaction.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.960
I don't know what it is.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.000
I haven't measured it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.290
And all I have are the
heats of formation.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.630
So all I know is, how do you
go-- so I know the heat of

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.490
formation of A-- so let me call

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.620
that the heat of formation.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.985
Remember, H isn't for heat.

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:17.180
Even though we kept calling
it heat of formation, it's

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.300
actually the change
in enthalpy.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.670
And it's the standard
change in enthalpy.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.630
But the change in enthalpy
we know as heat.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.155
So it's heat, change in enthalpy
of formation was the

00:01:26.155 --> 00:01:27.280
same thing as heat
of formation.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.620
This little naught sign
tells us it's a

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.130
standard heat the formation.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.500
We can look up that in a table,
and let's say that

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.670
that's some number.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.190
And then we have our heat of
formation of B-- delta heat of

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.460
formation, let me
call it, of B.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.130
This Is heat of formation
of A, and it's a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.750
standard heat of formation.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.300
And we could look up in a table
that heat of formation

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.700
of C, which is change
in enthalpy.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.870
And then the heat of
formation for D.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.680
So all of these things we can
look up in a table, right?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.330
And we'll do that in a second.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.730
Now, what has Hess's law tells
us is that the change in

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.340
energy, the change in-- and
enthalpy is what we're

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.820
measuring here-- the change in
enthalpy here is independent

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.509
of what we're doing.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.380
So instead of saying this
reaction, we could say hey,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.365
let's go from this reaction, and
go back-- let me do it in

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:17.530
a different color.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.430
Let's go back to our constituent
products, so kind

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.120
of the elemental
form of these.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.080
So you know, if this was like
carbon dioxide, you'd be going

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.100
back to the carbon and
the oxygen molecules.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.870
So you'd go back to the
elemental form.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.000
And how much energy, or what's
the change in enthalpy, as you

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.040
go back to the elemental form?

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.480
The heat of formation is what
you get from the element of

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.600
form to A, or the elemental
form to B.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.580
So to get A and B back to the
elemental form is going to be

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.920
the minus of those.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920
You're going to take
the reaction

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.470
in the other direction.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.740
So this change is going to take
minus delta-- the heat

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.040
of, I guess, of forming A, or it
could be the minus the heat

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.670
of deconstructing A, you
can almost view it.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.790
And it would also be minus
the same thing for B.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.730
And then, this is just
the elemental form.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.020
And now we can go from
the elemental

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.530
form back to the products.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.010
Because we have the
same atoms here.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.700
They're just rearranging
themselves into two different

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.300
sets of molecules.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.880
So now we can go back from the
elemental form and go up here.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.090
And we know what those are.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.550
We know how much energy it takes
to go from the elemental

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.030
form to C and D.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.800
That's their heats
of formation.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:39.090
So Hess's Law tells us that
delta H of this reaction, the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.840
change in enthalpy of this
reaction, is essentially going

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.780
to be the sum of what it takes
to decompose these guys, which

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.930
is the minus heat of formations
of these guys, plus

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.750
what it takes to reform
these guys over here.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.270
So we can just write it as delta
H of formation for C

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.990
plus delta H of formation
for D.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.400
So the heat of formations for
these guys minus these guys.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.290
This is what it took you to
get to the elemental form.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.630
So minus delta heat of formation
of A, minus delta

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.980
heat of formation of B.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.720
And then you'll have the
heat of the reaction.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.790
And if it's negative, we would
have released energy.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.710
And if this number is positive,
then that means that

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.310
there's more energy here than on
this side, so we would have

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.430
to absorb energy for this
reaction to happen, and it

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.760
would be endothermic.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.540
So this is all abstract and
everything, and I've told you

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.640
about Hess's Law.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.000
Let's actually apply it
to some problems.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.740
So let's say I have this
reaction right here, where I

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.830
start with ammonia.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.010
And it's ammonia gas.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.050
And I'm going to react that with
molecular oxygen to yield

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.500
some nitrogen monoxide, 4 moles
of it, and some water.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.790
So what's the heat of this
reaction right here?

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.360
So what we do, is we just look
up the heats of formation of

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.990
each of these.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.440
So let's just look them up.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.160
Let's start with the ammonia.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.420
What's the heat of formation
of ammonia?

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.010
And it's always given in
kilojoules per mole, so

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.800
they'll say to form one
mole of ammonia.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.640
So to form 1 mole of ammonia--
let's look up here.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.540
This is all cut and paste
from Wikipedia.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.430
And am I starting in the gaseous
or the aqueous state?

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.540
Well, I think I just-- see, I'm

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.650
starting the gaseous state.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.590
I've added that G there.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.510
So ammonia in the gaseous state
has a heat of formation

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.660
of minus 45.9 per joule.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.190
So what is that going--
so minus 45.9

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.420
kilojoules per mole.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.170
That's just for one mole of

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.770
ammonia, the heat of formation.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.240
It's in kilojoules.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.210
I'll just look them
all up right now.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.725
Now what's the heat of
formation of oxygen?

00:05:52.725 --> 00:05:55.760
And I'm not going to look it up
right now, because oxygen

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.680
is in its elemental form.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.970
So if you see something in the
form that it just always

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.700
takes, before you do anything
to it, its heat of

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.570
formation is 0.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.730
So if you see O2, its heat
of formation is 0.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.970
If you see hydrogen, if you
see H2, its heat of

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:10.450
formation is 0.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.940
If you see carbon by itself,
heat of formation is 0.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.340
Carbon in the solid state, heat
of formation is 0, at

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.210
standard temperature
and pressure.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.840
Now what about nitrogen
monoxide?

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.090
Let's look that up.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.250
I have it right here.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.680
Nitrogen monoxide.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.770
Heat of formation.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:36.810
It's positive, 90.29.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.370
And finally, what's the heat
of formation of water?

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.620
Well, let me see.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.910
Liquid water.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:07:00.000
Minus 285.83.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.430
Now you might tempted
to say, OK.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.900
Hess's Law says that if if we
want the delta H for this

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.850
reaction, we just take this plus
this, and subtract that.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.900
And you'd be almost right, but
you'd get the problem wrong.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.000
Because these are the heat
of formation per mole.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.052
But we notice in this reaction,
we have 4 moles of

00:07:18.052 --> 00:07:21.190
this, plus 5 moles of this,
yields 4 moles of this plus 6

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.090
moles of that.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.310
So we have to multiply this
times the number of moles.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.124
So here I have to multiply this
times 4, 4 here, and I

00:07:30.124 --> 00:07:32.080
have to multiply it times 4
here, and I have to multiply

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.120
it times 6 here.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.620
I don't even worry about
multiplying 0 times 5, because

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.970
it's just going to be 0.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.090
So now we can apply Hess's Law
to figure out the delta H of

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.830
this reaction.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.660
So the delta H of this reaction
is going to be equal

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.560
to, 4 times the heat of
formation of nitrogen

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:58.400
monoxide-- so 4 times 90.29,
plus 6 times the heat of

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.860
formation of water.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:06.330
So plus, I'll switch colors,
6 times minus 285.83.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.800
And just as a side note, given
that the heat of formation of

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.570
nitrogen monoxide is positive,
that means that you have to

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.320
add heat to a system to get this
to its elemental form.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.650
So it has more energy than
its elemental form.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.940
So it won't just happen
by itself.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.460
And water, on the other hand,
it releases energy when you

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.230
form it from its
elemental form.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.900
So in some ways, it's
more stable.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.580
But anyway let me--

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.280
So these are the heats of
formations of the products.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.590
And then we want to subtract out
the heats of formation of

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.470
the reactants in our reaction.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:44.280
So here it's 4 times 45.9--
Let me make sure.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.770
It's a minus 45.9.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.120
Right?

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.220
That ammonia had a minus
45.9 heat of formation.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.780
So what did we end up with?

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.680
Let me get the calculator out.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.522
So I have-- let me make sure
I put it over here.

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:04.640
I have to be able to read it.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.840
Well, I'll just do it off the
screen, because my screen is

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.020
getting filled up.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.610
So I have-- let me
just do it here.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:28.600
4 times 90.29 plus 6 times
285.83 negative is equal to--

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.090
so so far, we're
at minus 1,353.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.570
Does that sound about right?

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.370
That looks about right.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:41.060
And now we want to subtract from
that 4 times minus 45.9.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:51.710
So we want to subtract-- so
minus 4 times 45.9 negative is

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.870
equal to minus 1,170.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.770
So our delta h of this reaction
is equal to minus

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:04.490
1,170 kilojoules for
this reaction.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.270
And all we did is, we took the
heat of formation of the

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.400
products, multiply it times
the number of moles, and

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.320
subtracted out the
heat of formation

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.570
of the actual reactants.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.120
There you go.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.770
Let's do one more of these.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.010
Let's say I had some propane.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.440
I had some propane, and I'm
going to combust it.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.290
I'm going to oxidize the propane
to yield some carbon

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.710
dioxide in water.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.830
Well, it's the same drill.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.480
What's the heat of formation
of propane?

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.230
Look it up here.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.330
It is amazing how exhaustive
these lists really are.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.850
Propane is down here in
its liquid state.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.976
Heat of formation minus 104.7.

00:10:39.976 --> 00:10:41.600
So let me write that down.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.470
Minus 104.7.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.010
Heat of formation of oxygen
in its elemental state.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.840
That's how you always
find oxygen.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.000
So it's just 0.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.700
Heat of formation of carbon
dioxide-- Let's see.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:04.170
Carbon dioxide, and as
a gas, minus 393.5.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:04.800
And water.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.900
We already figured that out.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:12.960
It's minus 285.83.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.120
So how much heat is formed when
we combust one mole of

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.750
propane right here?

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.850
So let's see.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.120
We have to figure out the heat
of the products, the heat of

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.290
formation of the products-- so
it's going to be 3 times this.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.760
Because we formed
3 moles of this.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.520
For every mole, we release
this much energy.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.610
And then plus 4 times
this, and then

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.280
subtract out 1 times this.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.440
So what do we get?

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.900
We get 3 times 393.5
and that's a

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.320
negative, is equal to that.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:12:01.180
Plus 4 times 285.83 negative
is equal to minus 2,300

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.280
kilojoules, roughly.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.680
And then we have to subtract
out 1 times this.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.400
Or we could just add 104.7.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.820
So let me just do that.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:18.150
So plus 104.7 is equal
to minus 2,200.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:25.450
So here my heat of this
reaction, is equal to minus

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:31.810
2,219 kilojoules as we
go in this direction.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.050
For every mole of propane that
I combust, I will actually

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.630
produce this much energy
on the other side.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:45.650
Because this right here has
roughly 2,200 less kilojoules

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.390
than this side right there.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.860
So I could actually rewrite this
reaction where I write

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.140
all that, and I could
have added--

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.440
actually, let me do it.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.870
I could rewrite this reaction
is C3H8 propane, plus 5

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:07.060
oxygens, yields 3 carbon
dioxides plus 4 waters plus

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.880
2,219 kilojoules.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.160
That's actually what's released
by this reaction.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.680
It's exothermic.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.610
This side of the reaction has
less heat than this side, and

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:18.890
that-- it didn't
just disappear.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.090
It got released.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.390
And this is where
it got released.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.430
Now sometimes you'll see a
question where they say, hey.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.970
Fair enough.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.850
You figured out the heat
of this reaction.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.540
How much heat is going to be
released if I were to hand

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.210
you, I don't know, let's
say I were to hand

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:38.980
you 33 grams of propane?

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.690
Well, then you just start
thinking, oh, well, how many

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.960
moles of propane this is.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.890
Because if I combust one
mole of propane, I

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.180
get this much heat.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.240
So how many moles of propane
is 33 grams?

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.530
Well, how much does
1 mole weigh?

00:13:51.530 --> 00:14:02.520
The 1 mole of carbon weighs 12
grams. 1 mole of hydrogen

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.320
weighs 1 gram.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.990
So 1 mole of propane is going to
be 3 times 12-- so times 3,

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.417
because we have 3 carbons there
and 8 hydrogens, so

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:18.870
times 8-- so it's going to
be equal to 36 plus 88.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.900
So it's going to be 44.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.750
So this is going to be 44
grams per mole, right?

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.930
This is, let me write
that down.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.420
44 grams per mole.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.680
Now, if I give you 33
grams, how many

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.050
moles am I giving you?

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:44.030
Well, 33 grams times, I guess we
could say, 1 over 44 moles

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.840
per gram-- I don't have to write
the whole gram there.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.290
And then the grams cancel.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.180
I'm giving you 33 over
44 of a mole, or I'm

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.140
giving you 0.75 moles.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.510
So if one mole produces this
much energy, 3/4 of a mole is

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.340
going to produce 3/4 of this.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:08.960
So we just multiply
that times 0.75.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.330
And you get 1,664.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:17.990
So times 0.75 is
equal to 1,664.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.710
So if I were to give you 1 mole
of propane, and I were to

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:25.020
combust it with enough oxygen,
I'll produce 2,200 kilojoules

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.450
that's released from
the system.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.310
So this side of system has
less energy left over.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:33.050
But if I were to only give you
33 grams, which is 3/4 of a

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.530
mole, then you're going to
release roughly 1,600

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:37.550
kilojoules.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.970
Anyway.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.980
Hopefully you found
that helpful.
