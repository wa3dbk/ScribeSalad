00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.130
In the completing the square
video I kept saying that all

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.810
the quadratic equation is
completing the square

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.450
as kind of a short cut
of completing square.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.220
And I was under the impression
that I had done this

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.120
proof already but now I
realize that I haven't.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.750
So let me prove the quadratic
equation to you, by

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.690
completing the square.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.210
So let's say I have a
quadratic equation.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.870
I guess a quadratic equation is
actually what you're trying to

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.760
solve, and what a lot of people
call the quadratic equation is

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.960
actually the quadratic formula.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.100
But anyway I don't want to get
caught up in terminology.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.030
But let's say that I have
a quadratic equation that

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:46.450
says ax squared plus bx
plus c is equal to 0.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.280
And let's just complete
the square here.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.480
So how do we do that?

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.940
Well let's subtract c from both
sides so we get ax squared plus

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.740
the bx is equal to minus c.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.040
And just like I said in the
completing the square video

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.200
I don't like having this
a coefficient here.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.355
I like just having one
coefficient on my x squared

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:10.980
term so let me divide
everything by a.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:21.440
So I get x squared plus b/a
x is equal to-- you have

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.695
to divide both sides
by a --minus c/a.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.600
Now we are ready to
complete the square.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.890
What was completing the square?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.790
Well it's somehow adding
something to this expression so

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.590
it has the form of something
that is the square

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.140
of an expression.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.940
What do i mean by that?

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.400
Well, I'll do a
little aside here.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.950
if I told you that x plus
a squared, that equals

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.500
x squared plus two ax
plus a squared, right?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.330
So if I can add something here
so that this left hand side

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.810
this expression looks like
this, then I could

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.330
go the other way.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.690
I can say this is going to be
x plus something squared.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.590
So what do I have to
add on both sides?

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.140
If you watched the completing
the square video this should be

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.730
hopefully intuitive for you.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.510
What you do is you say well
this b/a, this corresponds to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.183
the 2a term, so a is going to
be half of this, is going to

00:02:26.183 --> 00:02:28.010
be half of this coefficient.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.100
That would be the a.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.620
And then what I need
to add is a squared.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.930
So I need to take half of
this and then square it and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.110
then add it to both sides.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.865
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:02:38.865 --> 00:02:40.810
Do it in this magenta.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.650
So I'm going to take half of
this-- I'm just completing

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.100
square, that's all I'm doing,
no magic here --so

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.450
plus half of this.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.230
Well half of that
is b/2a right?

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.130
You just multiply by 1/2.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.240
And I have to square it.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.893
Well if I did it to the left
hand side of the equation, I

00:02:55.893 --> 00:02:57.660
have to do it to the
right hand side.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.206
So plus b/2a squared.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.670
And now I have this left hand
side of the equation in the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.750
form that it is the square of
an expression that is

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.950
x plus something.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.880
And what is it?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.970
Well that's equal to-- let me
switch colors again --what's

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.730
the left hand side of
this equation equal to?

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.520
And you can just use this
pattern and go to the left.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.730
It's x plus what?

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.960
Well we said a, you can do one
of two ways. a is 1/2 of this

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.390
coefficient or a is the square
root of this coefficient or

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.310
since we didn't even square it
we know that this

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.970
is a. b/2a is a.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:49.060
So this is the same thing as x
plus b over 2a everything

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.980
squared, and then that equals--
let's see if we can simplify

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.230
this or make this a little
bit cleaner --that equals--

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.760
See, if I were to have a common
denominator-- I'm just doing a

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.600
little bit of algebra here
--see, when I square this it's

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.780
going to be 4a squared--
let me let me write this.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.740
This is equal to b
squared over 4a squared.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.710
Right?

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.860
And so if I have to add these
two fractions, let me make

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:29.550
this equal to 4a squared.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.330
Right?

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.750
And if the denominator is
4a squared, what does

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.360
the minus c/a become?

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.280
I See if I multiply the
denominator by 4a, I have to

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.810
multiply the numerator by 4a.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:50.090
So this becomes
minus 4ac, right?

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.030
And then b squared over
4a squared, well that's

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.810
just still b squared.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.520
I'm just doing a little
bit of algrebra.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520
Hopefully I'm not
confusing you.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.470
I just expanded this.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.330
I just took the square of this,
b squared over 4a squared.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.790
And then I added this to this,
I got a common denominator.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.710
And minus c/a is the same thing
as minus 4ac over 4a squared.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.570
And now we can take the
square root of both

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.240
sides of this equation.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.760
And this should hopefully
start to look a little

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.490
bit familiar to you now.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.290
So let's see, so we get x.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.080
So if we take the square root
of both sides of this equation

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:29.780
we get x plus b/2a is equal to
the square root of this-- let's

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.180
take the square root of the
numerator and the demoninator.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.950
So the numerator is-- I'm going
to put the b squared first, I'm

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.110
just going to switch this
order, it doesn't matter --the

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.660
square root of b squared
minus 4ac, right?

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.440
That's just the numerator.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.240
I just the square root of it,
and we have to get the square

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.770
root of the denominator too.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.970
What's the square
roof of 4a squared?

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.020
Well it's just 2a, right?

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.950
2a.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.800
And now what do we do?

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.640
Oh, it's very important!

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.400
When we're taking the square
root, it's not just the

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.070
positive square root.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.450
It's the positive or
minus square root.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.600
We saw that couple of times
when we did the-- and you could

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.090
say it's a plus or minus here
too, but if you look plus or

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.800
minus on the top and a plus or
minus on the bottom, you can

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.290
just write it once on the top.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.930
I'll let you think about why
you only have to write it once.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.560
If you had a negative an a
plus, or negative and a plus

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.250
sometimes cancel out, or a
negative and a negative,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.790
that's the same thing as
just having a plus on top.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.210
Anyway, I think you get that.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.140
And now we just have to
subtract b/2a from both sides.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:33.680
and we get, we get-- and this
is the exciting part --we get x

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:42.850
is equal to minus be over to 2a
plus or minus this thing, so

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:51.790
minus b squared minus 4ac,
all of that over 2a.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.850
And we already have a common
denominator, so we can

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.130
just add the fractions.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.880
So we got --and I'm going to do
this in a vibrant bold-- I

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.570
don't know maybe not so much
bold, well green color --so we

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:10.970
get x is equal to, numerator,
negative b plus or minus square

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:19.470
root of b squared minus
4ac, all of that over 2a.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.010
And that is the famous
quadratic formula.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.480
So, there we go we proved it.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.410
And we proved it just from
completing the square.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.570
I hope you found that
vaguely interesting.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.450
See in the next Video.
