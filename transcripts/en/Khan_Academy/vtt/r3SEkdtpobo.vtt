00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.170
In the last video, I told you
that if you had a quadratic

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.020
equation of the form ax squared
plus bx, plus c is

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.770
equal to zero, you could use the
quadratic formula to find

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.800
the solutions to
this equation.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.590
And the quadratic
formula was x.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.780
The solutions would be equal
to negative b plus or minus

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.800
the square root of b squared
minus 4ac, all

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.950
of that over 2a.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.240
And we learned how to use it.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.040
You literally just substitute
the numbers a for a, b for b,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.660
c for c, and then it gives you
two answers, because you have

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.830
a plus or a minus right there.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.000
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.380
actually prove it to you.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.930
Prove that using, essentially
completing the square, I can

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.540
get from that to that
right over there.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.190
So the first thing I want to
do, so that I can start

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.600
completing the square from this
point right here, is--

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.635
let me rewrite the equation
right here-- so we have ax--

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:08.340
let me do it in a different
color-- I have ax squared plus

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.920
bx, plus c is equal to 0.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.060
So the first I want to do is
divide everything by a, so I

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.790
just have a 1 out here
as a coefficient.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.160
So you divide everything by a,
you get x squared plus b over

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.030
ax, plus c over a, is equal
to 0 over a, which

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.530
is still just 0.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.620
Now we want to-- well, let me
get the c over a term on to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.880
the right-hand side,
so let's subtract c

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.710
over a from both sides.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.850
And we get x squared plus b over
a x, plus-- well, I'll

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.950
just leave it blank there,
because this is gone now; we

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.250
subtracted it from both sides--
is equal to negative c

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.580
over a I left a space
there so that we can

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.740
complete the square.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.030
And you saw in the completing
the square video, you

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.800
literally just take 1/2 of this
coefficient right here

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.060
and you square it.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.990
So what is b over
a divided by 2?

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.800
Or what is 1/2 times b over a?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.610
Well, that is just b over 2a,
and, of course, we are going

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.110
to square it.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.520
You take 1/2 of this
and you square it.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.500
That's what we do in completing
a square, so that

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.770
we can turn this into the
perfect square of a binomial.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.570
Now, of course, we cannot just
add the b over 2a squared to

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.280
the left-hand side.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.130
We have to add it
to both sides.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.750
So you have a plus b over 2a
squared there as well.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.310
Now what happens?

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.040
Well, this over here, this
expression right over here,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:59.250
this is the exact same thing as
x plus b over 2a squared.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.120
And if you don't believe me, I'm
going to multiply it out.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.030
That x plus b over 2a squared
is x plus b over 2a, times x

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.830
plus b over 2a. x times
x is x squared.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.960
x times b over 2a is
plus b over 2ax.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.560
You have b over 2a times x,
which is another b over 2ax,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.580
and then you have b over 2a
times b over 2a, that is plus

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.660
b over 2a squared.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.180
That and this are the same
thing, because these two

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.910
middle terms, b over 2a plus b
over 2a, that's the same thing

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.200
as 2b over 2ax, which is the
same thing as b over ax.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.520
So this simplifies to x squared
plus b over ax, plus b

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.960
over 2a squared, which is
exactly what we have written

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.720
right there.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.580
That was the whole point of
adding this term to both

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.340
sides, so it becomes
a perfect square.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.970
So the left-hand side
simplifies to this.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.810
The right-hand side, maybe
not quite as simple.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.490
Maybe we'll leave it the
way it is right now.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.160
Actually, let's simplify
it a little bit.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.339
So the right-hand side,
we can rewrite it.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.960
This is going to be equal
to-- well, this is

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.090
going to be b squared.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.220
I'll write that term first. This
is b-- let me do it in

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.340
green so we can follow along.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.250
So that term right there
can be written as b

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.210
squared over 4a square.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.420
And what's this term?

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.270
What would that become?

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.730
This would become-- in order
to have 4a squared as the

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.640
denominator, we have to multiply
the numerator and the

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.280
denominator by 4a.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.590
So this term right
here will become

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.480
minus 4ac over 4a squared.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.970
And you can verify for yourself
that that is the same

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.550
thing as that.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.790
I just multiplied the
numerator and the

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.400
denominator by 4a.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.400
In fact, the 4's cancel out and
then this a cancels out

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.930
and you just have a c over a.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.730
So these, this and that
are equivalent.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.460
I just switched which I write
first. And you might already

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.980
be seeing the beginnings of the
quadratic formula here.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.700
So this I can rewrite.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.760
This I can rewrite.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.220
The right-hand side, right
here, I can rewrite as b

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:37.060
squared minus 4ac, all of
that over 4a squared.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.150
This is looking very close.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.800
Notice, b squared minus 4ac,
it's already appearing.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.470
We don't have a square root yet,
but we haven't taken the

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.720
square root of both
sides of this

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.670
equation, so let's do that.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.720
So if you take the square root
of both sides, the left-hand

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.260
side will just become x plus--
let me scroll down a little

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.900
bit-- x plus b over 2a is going
to be equal to the plus

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.670
or minus square root
of this thing.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.460
And the square root of this
is the square root of the

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.360
numerator over the square
root of the denominator.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.040
So it's going to be the plus or
minus the square root of b

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.690
squared minus 4ac over the
square root of 4a squared.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.690
Now, what is the square
root of 4a squared?

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.820
It is 2a, right?

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.390
2a squared is 4a squared.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.530
The square root of this
is that right here.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.260
So to go from here to here, I
just took the square root of

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.650
both sides of this equation.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.860
Now, this is looking very
close to the quadratic.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.990
We have a b squared minus
4ac over 2a, now we just

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.070
essentially have to subtract
this b over 2a from both sides

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.740
of the equation and
we're done.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.210
So let's do that.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.640
So if you subtract the b over
2a from both sides of this

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.980
equation, what do you get?

00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:00.080
You get x is equal to negative
b over 2a, plus or minus the

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.000
square root of b squared minus
4ac over 2a, common

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.960
denominator.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.640
So this is equal
to negative b.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.500
Let me do this in a new color.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.370
So it's orange.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:21.980
Negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared minus

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:27.970
4ac, all of that over 2a.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.370
And we are done!

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.630
By completing the square with
just general coefficients in

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.890
front of our a, b and c, we
were able to derive the

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.600
quadratic formula.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.360
Just like that.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.920
Hopefully you found that as
entertaining as I did.
