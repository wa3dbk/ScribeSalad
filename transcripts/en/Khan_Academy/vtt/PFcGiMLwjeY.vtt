00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.280
In the video where I first
introduced the concept of

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.430
entropy, I just tried
something out.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.700
I defined my change in entropy
as being equal to the heat

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.250
added to a system, divided by
the temperature at which it

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.700
was added to the system.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.270
And then I tested to
see if this was

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.660
a valid state variable.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.890
And when I did that, I looked
at the Carnot cycle.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.370
And this is a bit of a review.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.340
Never hurts to review.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.240
Let me draw the PV
diagram here.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.670
We saw that we start at this
state here, and then we

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.320
proceed isothermically.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.020
We removed little pebbles
off the piston.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.190
So we increased the volume
and lowered the pressure.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.170
Then we proceed adiabatically,
where we isolated things and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.750
we moved like that.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.650
That was adiabatically.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.880
Then at this other isotherm,
we added the pebbles back.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.590
And then we isolated
the system again.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.160
So adiabatically, we continued
to add more pebbles, and we

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.230
got back to our original
state.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.430
And I did a couple of videos
where I show that if you take

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.750
the heat added here-- so this is
all being done at some high

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.720
temperature, T1.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.320
This is being done at some
low temperature, T2.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.910
There's some heat being added
here, Q1, and that there's

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.760
some heat being released
here, Q2.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.110
And since these are adiabatic,
there's no transfer of heat to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.650
and from the system.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.050
And when I looked at this, and
when I looked at the Carnot

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.970
cycle, and I used this
definition of entropy, I saw

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.400
that the total change in S, when
I go from this point all

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.780
the way around and got back, the
change in S, was equal to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.770
Q1 over T1 plus Q2 over T2.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.220
And then I actually showed you
that this was equal to 0,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.880
which is exactly the result
that I wanted to see.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.690
Because in order for this to be
a state variable, in order

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.800
for S to be a state variable, it
should not be dependent on

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.615
how I got there.

00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:12.490
It should only be dependent
on my state variables.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.980
So even if I go on some crazy
path, at the end of the day,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.560
it should get back to 0.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.650
But I did something, I guess,
a little bit-- what I did

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.870
wasn't a proof that this is
always a valid state variable.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.320
It was only a proof that it's
a valid state variable if we

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.850
look at the Carnot cycle.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.070
But it turns out that it was
only valid because the Carnot

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.600
cycle was reversible.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.340
And this is a subtle but super
important point, and I really

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.920
should've clarified this
on the first video.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.450
I guess I was too caught up
showing the proof of the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.080
Carnot cycle to put the
reversibility there.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.720
And before I even show you why
it has to be reversable, let

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.210
me just review what
reversibility means.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.600
Now, we know that in order to
even define a path here, the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.640
system has to be pretty close to
equilibrium the whole time.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.230
That's the whole reason why
throughout these videos, I've

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.330
been drawing this piston, you
know, have the gases down

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.780
here, and then always-- instead
of having one big

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.660
weight on top that I took off
or took on, because it would

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.550
throw the system out of
equilibrium-- I did it in

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.310
really small increments.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.860
I just moved grains of sand, so
that the system was always

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.640
really close to equilibrium.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.430
And that's called quasistatic.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.680
and I've defined that before.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.440
And that means that you're
always in kind of a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.720
quasi-equilibrium.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.910
So your state variables
are always defined.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.280
But that, by itself, does not
give you reversability.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:47.480
You have to be quasistatic and
frictionless in order to be

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.650
reversible.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.110
Now, what do we mean
by frictionless?

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.720
Well, I think you know what
frictionless means.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.120
Is that like you see in this
system right here, if I make

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.590
this piston a little bit bigger,
that when this piston

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.330
rubs against the side of this
wall, in kind of our real

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.950
world, there's always a little
bit of friction.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.730
Those molecules start bumping
against each other, and then

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.050
they start making them vibrate,
so they transfer some

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.160
kinetic energy.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.000
From just by rubbing into each
other, they start generating

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.399
some kinetic energy,
or some heat.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.350
So you normally have some heat
generated from friction.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.900
Now, if you have some heat
generated from friction, when

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.550
I remove a pebble-- first all,
when I remove that first

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.010
pebble, it might not
even do anything.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.430
Because it might not even
overcome-- you can kind of

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.140
view it as the force
of friction.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.400
But let's say I remove some
pebbles, and this thing moves

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.650
up a little bit.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.210
But because some of the, I guess
you could say, the force

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.280
differential, the pressure
differential between the

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.800
pebbles and the gas inside, and
the pressure of the gas,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.480
was used to generate heat as
opposed to work, when I add

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.360
the pebbles back, if I have
friction, I'm not going to get

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.930
back to the same point
that I was before.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.940
Because friction is always
resisting the movement.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.440
So in order for something to be
reversible, when I remove a

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.110
couple of pebbles, if I removed
ten pebbles and add

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.810
the ten pebbles back, I should
be at the exact same state.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.550
But as, you know, you can just
do the thought experiment.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.520
If there's friction, I won't
be at the exact same state.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.470
My piston won't move as much as
you would expect if it was

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.960
frictionless.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.140
So this is a key assumption
for reversability.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.330
Now, the Carnot cycle, by
definition, is reversible.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.500
And that's why no one could
actually really implement an

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.490
engine that fully does
the Carnot cycle.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.750
And we even showed that, that
the Carnot cycle is the most

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.130
efficient potential engine.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.970
That if anyone made a more
efficient engine, you could

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.220
have a perpetual motion
machine, or a

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.190
perpetual energy machine.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.820
And the reason why the Carnot
engine is the most efficient

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.600
engine-- and there's no secret
here-- it's because it's

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.770
frictionless.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.860
Any engineer who makes engines
could tell you, wow, if I

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.460
could just remove all of the
friction from my system, I

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.410
would get a lot more
efficient.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.610
Now, with that said-- so I've
told you that look.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.570
The definition doesn't have to
be-- it happened to work, Q

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.680
divided by T, because
I was dealing with

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.380
a reversible system.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.750
And just to hit the point home,
let me show you that it

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.520
would not have worked if I had
just defined it Q divided by T

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.320
on an irreversible system.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.495
So let's say that I have-- let
me draw another PV diagram.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.550
And I'm going to do almost
a very simple thought

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.830
experiment.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.520
Now I'm going to have an
irreversible system.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.410
And I start here at some
point on my PV diagram.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.900
And you know, this could be some
type of cylinder, and it

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.320
has a piston on top, and I have
my rocks, like always.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.210
But this time, there's a
little bit of friction.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.030
When this thing moves, a
little bit of heat is

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.040
generated in this.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.440
And when it moves in
either direction,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.910
some heat is generated.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.500
So we can call that the
heat from friction.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.330
When it moves either up
or when it moves down.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.320
So let's do something.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.590
Let's stick this on a big
reservoir, like we tend to do.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.370
So it's an isothermal system.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.780
So let's call this T1.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.220
And let's just start
removing pebbles.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.610
And we'll move along
an isotherm.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.010
Maybe to that point there.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.900
And then we're going to-- and
I want to make a very

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.400
important point here.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.440
Because this is has friction,
I'm not going to get quite as

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.830
far along the isotherm than
if I didn't have friction.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.500
If this was a frictionless
system, I would've gotten a

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.430
little bit further along
the isotherm.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.460
So the number of rocks isn't
going to be the same as it was

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:55.960
frictionless.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.390
But let's just say I
move from here to

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.480
here on the PV diagram.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.050
And then we go and add a bunch
of rocks back, and we want to

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.450
go all the way back.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.910
And I'm not even saying whether
we have the same

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.010
number of rocks or
different rocks.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.860
You're probably going to have to
add a few more rocks to get

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.260
back to this point.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.140
But the idea here is, is that
we've gotten back to the same

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.090
point on the state diagram.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:22.270
So our delta U total should be
equal to 0, which is equal to

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.150
the delta U of expansion.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.350
So the delta U of expansion is
the delta u to go that way,

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:33.059
delta U of expansion, plus the
delta U of contraction, which

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.450
is the delta U of going
back like this.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.909
Those have to be equal to
0 by definition, right?

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.400
Because internal energy is a
state variable, and if we get

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.920
to that same point, our delta
U has to be equal to 0.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.290
So what's our delta
U of expansion?

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.230
What's our change in internal
energy as we expand?

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:59.680
Our delta U of expansion is
equal to the heat added to the

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.965
system minus the work
done by the system.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.870
And we know how much
work was done, this

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.640
whole area right there.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.670
And then plus the heat added
by the friction.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.550
There's some heat added
by the friction.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.800
Let me do that in brown.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.620
What's that?

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.005
I was on some random website off
the screen, and all of a

00:09:34.005 --> 00:09:35.870
sudden that cartoon
sound started up.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.660
I have no idea what that was.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.100
But anyway, where was I?

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.120
So I said our change in internal
energy from expansion

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.310
is going to be the heat added
to the system from our

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:51.360
reservoir minus the work done
by the system, as we expand,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.520
plus the heat added to the
system or generated by the

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.220
system-- I guess you could say,
it's not being added.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.650
The system is creating this heat
itself, as it expands.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.300
There's this friction
right there.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:02.920
Fair enough.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.750
So this is the one variation.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.860
Now that we're not dealing with
the reversible process,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.080
we have this friction.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.510
Now what's our change in energy
from contraction?

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.740
So our change in internal energy
from contraction is

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.150
going to be the heat that leaves
the system, that has to

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.940
go back into the reservoir
as we contract.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.660
Because otherwise, if we didn't
have the reservoir, the

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.950
temperature would go up.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.450
But we want to release heat.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.640
So we want to say, heat
released-- and

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.430
I'm going to do something.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.940
Let's just assume that all
of the Q's are positive.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:39.000
So if I'm releasing heat, it's
going to be a minus Q release.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.450
Let's just say that this is a
positive number, and if I'm

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.850
releasing it, it's going to
be a minus right there.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.470
And I want to just do that, just
to hopefully make things

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.030
little bit clearer.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.350
Plus the work performed
on the system.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.040
I'm assuming that work is always
positive, so if we're

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.790
doing work, it'll
be minus work.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.930
If work is being done to
us, it'll be plus work.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.290
But in this situation
as well, we're still

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.880
adding heat from friction.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.840
Or heat from friction is still
being generated in the system.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.540
This is still positive.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.230
In either direction, when we
move upwards or downwards, the

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.430
system is generating friction.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.370
Now, we always said, we went all
the way here, we went all

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.300
the way back.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.990
So the sum of these has to be
equal to 0, because this is a

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.120
state variable.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.080
So if the sum of all of this
has to be equal to 0, let's

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.750
sum this up.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.630
So this gets us to
Qa minus Qr.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.900
So the heat accepted minus
the heat released.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.440
The W's cancel out.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:41.870
Plus-- let me see right here--
plus 2 times the heat of

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.250
friction in either direction.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.670
All of that has to
be equal to 0.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.290
Let's see.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.120
What we can do is, we can
rewrite this as the heat

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.210
accepted minus the heat released
is equal to minus 2

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.760
times the amount of heat
generated from friction.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.240
And then if we just switch these
around, we'll get the

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.070
heat released minus the heat
accepted is equal to-- well, I

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.580
just wanted to get all positive
numbers-- 2 times the

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.560
heat of friction.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.200
Now why did I do all of this?

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.450
Because I wanted to do
an experiment with an

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.810
irreversible system, and this
was a very simple experiment

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.580
with an irreversible system.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:25.580
Now, we said that delta S,
which a long time ago I

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.090
defined as Q divided by T-- and
in this video, I said it

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.380
had to be reversible.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.000
And I wanted to show you right
now that what if I didn't make

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.830
the constraint that this
has to be reversible?

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.000
Because if this doesn't have to
be reversible, and I just

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.640
use this definition right here,
you'll see that your

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:52.200
delta S here would be-- you just
divide everything by T--

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.870
because our temperature was
constant the entire time, we

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.410
were just on a reservoir--
you'll see that this is going

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.260
to be your delta s.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.240
This is your total change in
the, I guess you could say,

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.950
your net heat added
to the system.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.090
So this is, let me say,
this is the heat

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.012
added to the system.

00:13:11.012 --> 00:13:13.290
Let me do it this way.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:19.200
Heat added to the system,
divided by the temperature at

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.655
which it was added.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.290
Which is a positive number.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.410
Even though we got to
the exact same place

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.060
on this date diagram.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.780
So in an reversible system,
this wouldn't be

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.220
a valid state variable.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.830
So it's only a valid state
variable if it's reversible.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.670
Now, does that mean that you
can only talk about entropy

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.950
for reversible reactions?

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:44.740
No.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.300
You can talk about entropy
for anything.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.050
But what you do is-- and this
is another important point.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:57.630
So let's say that I have some
irreversible reaction that

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.730
goes from here to here.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.110
And I want to figure out
its change in entropy.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.370
Right?

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.410
And it might have done all
sorts of crazy things.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.000
It's an irreversible reaction,
its path might

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.630
have gone like that.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.410
That's assuming it's
quasistatic, if we can even

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.020
look at its path like that.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.700
If we wanted to figure out its
change in entropy, though, we

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.470
wouldn't worry about the heat
that was added to it and the

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.130
different temperatures at
which it was added.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.300
We wouldn't worry about that.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.380
We would just say, OK.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.900
What would it have taken for a
reversible system to go from

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.100
this state to this state?

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.290
And then maybe a reversible
system would have done

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.490
something like this.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.710
Sorry, I want to make
it a smooth curve.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.060
Maybe a reversible system
might have done

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.180
something like that.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:43.540
And this change, this heat added
by the reversible system

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.160
divided by the temperature for
the reversible system, would

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.090
be the change in entropy.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:56.280
And this change in entropy--
we could call this S final,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.540
and this is S initial, it's
going to be the same for both

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.060
systems. It's just, we don't use
the irreversible system to

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.310
figure out our entropy.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.750
We would use the reversible heat
and temperature to figure

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.460
out the actual change.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.300
Hopefully that clarifies
something else.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.370
It's, on some level, a subtle
point, but on some level it's

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.140
super important.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.160
Because you can't-- the
thermodynamic definition of

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.360
entropy has to be this.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.560
It has to be heat added to a
reversible system divided by

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.820
the temperature that
was added.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.750
Not just heat to any system.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.870
It just happened to work when
I did it, and I should have

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:32.540
been clearer about it when I
first explained it, that it

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.790
worked only because it was
a Carnot cycle, which is

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.040
reversible.
