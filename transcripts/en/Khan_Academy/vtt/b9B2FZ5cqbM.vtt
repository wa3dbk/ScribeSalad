00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.540
- [Grant] All right, so last video

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.960
I showed you guys this really crazy fact.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.440
Now, we have our usual setup here

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.850
for this constrained
optimization situation.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.510
We have a function we wanna maximize,

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.370
which I'm thinking of as
revenues for some company,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.210
a constraint, which I'm thinking of

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.204
as some kind of budget for that company,

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:18.500
and as you know if you've
gotten to this video,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.700
one way to solve this
constrained optimization problem

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.730
is to define this function
here, the Lagrangian,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.180
which involves taking this function

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.230
that you're trying to maximize,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.380
in this case the revenue,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.000
and subtracting a new variable, lambda,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.850
what's called the Lagrange multiplier,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.000
times this quantity, which
is the budget function,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.940
however much you spend

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.840
as a function of your input parameters,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.150
minus the budget itself,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.040
which you might think of
as $10,000 in our example.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.440
So that's all the usual setup,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.880
and the crazy fact,
which is just declared,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.130
is that when you set this
gradient equal to zero,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.830
and you find some solution,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.840
and there will be three
variables in this solution:

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.560
h*, s*, and lambda*,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.500
that this lambda* is not meaningless.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.850
It's not just a proportionality constant

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.760
between these gradient vectors,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.570
but it will actually tell you

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.510
how much the maximum
possible revenue changes

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.640
as a function of your budget,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.200
and the way to start writing
all of that in formulas

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.700
would be to make explicit the fact that,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.730
if you consider this value, the
$10,000 that is your budget,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.970
which I'm calling b, a
variable and not a constant,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.120
then you have to
acknowledge that h* and s*

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.120
are dependent on b, right?

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.720
It's a very implicit relationship,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.890
something that's kind of
hard to think about at first,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.270
because as you change b, it
changes what the Lagrangian is,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.730
which is gonna change where
its gradient equals zero,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.700
which changes what h*,
s*, and lambda* are,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.770
but in principle,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.723
they are some function
of that budget, of b,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.060
and the maximum possible revenue

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.750
is whatever you get when you
just plug in that solution

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.220
to your function r,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.830
and the claim I made, that I
just pulled out of the hat,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.250
is that lambda*,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.680
the lambda value that comes
packaged in with these two

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.890
when you set the gradient of
the Lagrangian equal to zero,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.350
equals the derivative
of this maximum value,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.500
thought of as a function of b.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.070
Maybe I should emphasize that.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.330
We're thinking of this maximum value

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.680
as a function of b, with respect to b.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.820
So that's kind of a mouthful.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.380
It takes a lot just to even
phrase what's going on,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.250
but in the context of an economic example,

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.360
it has a very clear, precise meaning,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.280
which is, if you increase
your budget by a dollar,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.550
if you increase it from
$10,000 to $10,001,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.383
you're wondering,

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:33.020
for that tiny change in
budget, that tiny db,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.150
what is the ratio of the
resulting change in revenue?

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.960
So in a sense, this lambda* tells you,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.010
for every dollar that
you increase the budget,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.910
how much can your revenue increase

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.740
if you're always maximizing it?

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.070
So why on earth is this true, right?

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.320
This just seems like it
comes out of nowhere.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.390
Well, there are a couple
clever observations

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.920
that go into proving this.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.890
The first is to notice what happens

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.770
if we evaluate this
Lagrangian function itself

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.130
at this critical point, when you input

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.857
h*, s*, and lambda*,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.530
and remember, the way that
these guys are defined

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.040
is that you look at all of the values

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.490
where the gradient of the
Lagrangian equals the zero vector,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.130
and then, if you get
multiple options, you know,

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.930
sometimes when you set
the gradient equal to zero

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.540
you get multiple solutions,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.947
and whichever one maximizes
R, that is h*, s*, lambda*.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.430
So now I'm just asking, if you plug that,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.360
not into the gradient of the Lagrangian,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.440
but to the Lagrangian
itself, what do you get?

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.790
Well, you're going to get

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.280
we just look at its definition up here,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.857
R evaluated at h* and s*,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.903
right?

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.253
And we subtract off lambda*

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.160
times

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.637
B of h*, s*,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.490
minus the constant that
is your budget, you know,

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.010
something you might think of as $10,000,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.760
whatever you set little b equal to.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.210
Okay, Grant, you might say,
why does this tell us anything?

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.430
You're just plugging in stars

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.150
instead of the usual variables,

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.030
but the key is that if
you plug in h* and s*,

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.400
this value has to equal zero

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.020
because h* and s* have to
satisfy the constraint.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.360
Remember, one of the cool parts

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.810
about this Lagrangian
function as a whole is that

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.890
when you take its partial
derivative with respect to lambda,

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.260
all that's left is this
constraint function

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.980
minus the constraint portion.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.730
When you set the gradient
of the Lagrangian

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.280
equal to the zero vector,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.540
one component of that

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.620
is to set the partial derivative
with respect to lambda

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.613
equal to zero,

00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:52.120
and if you remember from
the Lagrangian video,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.590
all that really boils down to

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.100
is the fact that the
constraint holds, right?

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.520
Which would be your
budget achieves $10,000.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.230
When you plug in the appropriate
h* and s* to this value,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.050
you are hitting this
constrained amount of money

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.033
that you can spend.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.650
So by virtue of how h* and s* are defined,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.090
the fact that they are solutions

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.150
to the constrained optimization problem

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.303
means this whole portion goes to zero.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.340
So we can just kind of cancel
all that out, and what's left

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.030
what's left here is the maximum
possible revenue, right?

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.863
So evidently,

00:05:23.863 --> 00:05:26.760
when you evaluate the Lagrangian
at this critical point,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.980
at h*, s*, and lambda*, it equals M*.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.170
It equals the maximum possible value

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.320
for the function you're
trying to maximize.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.550
So ultimately, what we want

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.630
is to understand how that
maximum value changes

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.060
when you consider it a
function of the budget.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.630
So evidently, what we can look for

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.860
is to just ask how the Lagrangian changes

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.333
as you consider it a
function of the budget.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.200
Now, this is an interesting
thing to observe,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.420
because if we just look up

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.210
at the definition of the Lagrangian,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.100
if you just look at this formula,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.320
if I told you to take
the derivative of this

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.330
with respect to little b,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.840
how much does this change
with respect to little b,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.410
you would notice that this goes to zero.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.870
It doesn't have a little b.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.533
This would also go to zero,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.690
and all you'd be left with

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.940
would be negative lambda times negative b,

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.970
and the derivative of
that with respect to b

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.513
would be lambda.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.570
So you might say, oh yeah,
of course, of course,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.270
the derivative of that
Lagrangian with respect to b,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.200
once we work it all out,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.813
the only term that was
left there was the lambda,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.260
and that's compelling,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.560
but ultimately it's not entirely right.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.530
That overlooks the fact

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.810
that L is not actually
defined as a function of b.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.600
When we defined the Lagrangian,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.090
we were considering b to be a constant.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.900
So if you really wanna consider this

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.403
to be a function that involves b,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.460
the way we should write it,

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.700
and I'll go ahead and erase this guy,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.870
the way we should write this Lagrangian

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.010
is to say, you are a function of h*,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.913
which itself is dependent on b,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.070
and s*, which is also
a function of b, right?

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.290
As soon as we start
considering b a variable

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.320
and not a constant,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.540
we have to acknowledge
that this critical point,

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.360
h*, s*, and lambda*,
depends on the value of b.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.267
So likewise, that lambda*,

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.453
lambda* is also gonna be a function of b,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.440
and then we can consider,
as a fourth variable, right,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.323
so we're adding on yet another
variable to this function,

00:07:35.443 --> 00:07:36.833
the value of b itself,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.303
the value of b itself here.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.860
So now, when we wanna know,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.920
what is the value of the Lagrangian

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.730
at the critical point, h*, s*, lambda*,

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.380
as a function of b, all right?

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.850
So that can be kind of confusing.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.060
What you basically have is this function

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.090
that only really depends
on one value, right?

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.570
It only depends on b,

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.603
but it kinda goes through
a four-variable function,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.290
and so, just to make it explicit,

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.530
this would equal the value of R

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.227
as a function of h*, and s*,

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.683
and each one of those is a
function of little b, right?

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.230
So this term is saying,
what's your revenue?

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.133
Evaluate it on the maximizing
h and s for the given budget,

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.037
and then you subtract off lambda*.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.730
Oh here, I should probably

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.990
I'm not gonna have room here, am I?

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.793
So what you subtract off,

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.083
minus lambda*

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.230
at B

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.947
of h*,

00:08:51.046 --> 00:08:51.879
and s*,

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.610
but each of these guys is
also a function of little b,

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.503
little b,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.853
minus little b, right?

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.390
So you have this large

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.470
kind of complicated
multivariable function.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.210
It's defined in terms of h*'s and s*'s,

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.510
which are themselves very implicit, right?

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.930
We just say, by definition

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.330
these are whatever values make
the gradient of L equal zero.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.820
So very hard to think about
what that means concretely,

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.700
but all of this is really just dependent

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.563
on the single value, little b,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.050
and from here, if we wanna
evaluate the derivative of L,

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.340
we wanna evaluate the
derivative of this Lagrangian

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.193
with respect to little b,

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.880
which is really the only
thing it depends on.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.950
It's just via all of
these other variables,

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.773
we use the multivariable chain rule,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.530
and at this point,

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.690
if you don't know the
multivariable chain rule,

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:54.730
I have a video on that.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.860
Definitely pause.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.693
Go take a look.

00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:58.260
Make sure that it all makes sense.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.740
But right here, I'm just gonna be assuming

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.560
that you know what the
multivariable chain rule is.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.050
So what it is, is we take the partial

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.660
we're gonna look at
the partial derivatives

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.020
with respect to all four of these inputs.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:09.853
So we'll start with

00:10:09.853 --> 00:10:13.257
the partial derivative
of L with respect to h*,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.387
with respect to h*,

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.000
and we're gonna multiply that

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.763
by the derivative of h* with respect to b,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.450
and this might seem like a
very hard thing to think about,

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.970
like, how do we know how
h* changes as b changes?

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.520
But don't worry about it.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.090
You'll see something magic
happen in just a moment.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.220
And then we add in partial derivative of L

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.377
with respect to that second variable, s*,

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.280
with respect to whatever
the second variable is,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.143
multiplied by the derivative of s*

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.133
with respect to b.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.090
You can see how you really need to know

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.620
what the multivariable
chain rule is, right?

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.520
This would all seem
kind of out of the blue.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.460
So what we now add in

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.687
is the partial derivative of L
with respect to that lambda*,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.150
with respect to lambda*,

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.533
multiplied by the derivative of lambda*

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.033
with respect to little b,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.063
and then finally,

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.520
finally, we take the partial
derivative of this Lagrangian

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.253
with respect to that little b,

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.960
which we're now considering
a variable in there, right?

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.050
We're no longer considering
that b a constant.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.420
Multiplied by, well,
something kinda silly:

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.493
the derivative of b
with respect to itself.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.760
So now, if you're thinking

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.040
that this is gonna be
horrifying to compute,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.650
I can understand where you're coming from.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.940
You have to know the derivative of lambda*

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.230
with respect to b.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.230
You have to somehow
intimately be familiar with

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.470
how this lambda* changes as
you change b, and like I said,

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.740
that's such an implicit
relationship, right?

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.090
We just said that lambda*
is, by definition,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.980
whatever the solution to
this gradient equation is.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.250
So somehow you're supposed to know

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.460
how that changes when you
slightly alter b over here?

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.070
Well, you don't really
have to worry about things,

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.510
because by definition, h*, s*, and lambda*

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.050
are whatever values make the
gradient of L equal to zero,

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.610
but if you think about
that, what does it mean

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.640
for the gradient of L to
equal the zero vector.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.530
Well, what it means is that
when you take its derivative

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.600
with respect to that first
variable, h*, it equals zero.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.570
When you take its derivative

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.450
with respect to the second variable,

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.100
that equals zero as well,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.300
and with respect to this third variable,

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.513
that's gonna equal zero.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.530
By definition, h*, s*, and lambda*,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.310
are whatever values make it the case,

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.920
so that when you plug them in,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.420
the partial derivative of the Lagrangian,

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.110
with respect to any one of
those variables, equal zero.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.100
So we don't even have to worry
about most of this equation.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.992
The only part that matters here

00:12:52.992 --> 00:12:56.290
is the partial derivative
of L with respect to b,

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.200
that we're now considering a variable,

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.923
multiplied by, well, what's db/db?

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.150
What is the rate of change

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.470
of a variable with respect to itself?

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.303
It's one.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.423
It is one.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.830
So all of this stuff, this
entire multivariable chain rule,

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.363
boils down to a single
innocent-looking factor,

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.000
which is the partial derivative of L,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.520
partial derivative of L
with respect to little b,

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.490
and now there's something
very subtle here, right?

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.450
Because this might seem obvious.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.430
I'm saying the derivative
of L with respect to b

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.823
equals the derivative
of L with respect to b,

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.620
but maybe I should give a
different notation here, right?

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.040
Because here, when I'm taking
the derivative, really,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.180
I'm considering L as a
single-variable function, right?

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.760
I'm considering, not what happens

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.700
as you can freely change
all four of these variables.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.140
Three of them are locked into place by b.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.010
So maybe I should really
give that a different name.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.070
I should call that L*.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.400
L* is a single-variable function,

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.840
whereas this L is a
multivariable function.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.690
This is the function where you
can freely change the values

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.530
of h, and s, and lambda,
and b, as you put them in.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.840
So if we kind of scroll up
to look at its definition,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.200
which I've written all over, I guess.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.130
Here, let me actually rewrite
its definition, right?

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.450
I think that'll be useful.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.180
I'm gonna rewrite that L,

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.233
if I consider it as a
four-variable function of h, s,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.333
lambda, and b,

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.990
that what that equals is R

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.180
evaluated at h and s,

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.523
minus lambda,

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.230
multiplied by this constraint function B

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.783
evaluated at h and s, minus little b,

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.123
and this is now

00:14:45.123 --> 00:14:47.200
when I'm considering
little b to be a variable.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.700
So this is the Lagrangian

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.120
when you consider all four of these

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.240
to be freely changing as you want,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.810
whereas the thing up here

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.870
that I'm considering a
single-variable function,

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.930
has three of its inputs locked into place.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:14:59.763
So effectively,

00:14:59.763 --> 00:15:02.620
it's just a single-variable
function with respect to b.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.090
So it's actually quite miraculous

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:07.440
that the single-variable
derivative of that L, here,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.950
I should L*, with respect to b,

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.080
ends up being the same as
the partial derivative of L,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.570
this L, where you're free
to change all the variables,

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.090
that these should be the same.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.390
Usually, in any usual circumstance,

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.340
all of these other terms would
have come into play somehow,

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.220
but what's special here is that

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.570
by the definition of this L*,

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.100
the specific way

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.940
in which these h*, s*, and
lambda*'s are locked into place

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.920
happens to be one

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.530
in which all of these partial
derivatives go to zero.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.010
So that's pretty subtle, and
I think it's quite clever,

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.000
and what it leaves us with is that

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.640
we just have to evaluate
this partial derivative,

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.473
which is quite simple,

00:15:47.473 --> 00:15:49.060
'cause we look down here, and you say,

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.140
what's the partial derivative
of L with respect to b?

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.300
Well, this R has no b's in it,

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.310
so don't need to care about that.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:00.880
This term over here, its partial
derivative is negative one

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.180
just 'cause there's a b here,

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.430
and that's multiplied
by the constant lambda,

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.643
so that all just equals lambda,

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.320
but if we're in the situation

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.480
where lambda is locked into
place as a function of little b,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.123
then we'd write lambda* as a
function of little b, right?

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.960
So if that feels a little
notationally confusing,

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.110
I'm right there with you,

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.540
but the important part here,
the important thing to remember

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.183
is that we just started
considering b as a variable,

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.310
and we were looking at
the h*, s*, and lambda*,

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.850
as they depended on that variable.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.610
We made the observation
that the Lagrangian,

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.720
evaluated at that critical point,

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.330
equals the revenue evaluated
at that critical point.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.380
The rest of the stuff just cancels out.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.700
So if you wanna know the derivative of M*,

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.190
the maximizing revenue,
with respect to the budget,

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.820
how much does your maximum revenue change

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.570
for tiny changes in your budget?

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.010
That's the same as
looking at the derivative

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.570
of the Lagrangian with
respect to the budget,

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.000
so long as you're considering it

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.020
only on values h*, s*, lambda*,

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.640
that are critical points
of the Lagrangian,

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.850
and all of that really nicely boils down

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.200
to just taking a simple partial derivative

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.950
that gives us the relation we want.
