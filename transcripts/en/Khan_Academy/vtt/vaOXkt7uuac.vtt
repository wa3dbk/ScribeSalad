00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.510
We're on problem 36.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.560
And it says, what is the area
in square units of the

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.180
trapezoid shown below?

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.930
So, when you just look at this
you're like, OK, trapezoid, do

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.580
I know the formula for the
area of a trapezoid.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.990
Then you might get confused
and all that.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.520
But you say, well, trapezoid
I can break that up into a

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.120
rectangle and a triangle.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.935
If were to draw a
line right here.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.220
Then I've broken up the
trapezoid into a rectangle and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.030
a triangle.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.720
And if I know the dimensions of
each of those, I know the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.480
area of each of them and
then I know the area

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.980
of the entire thing.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.790
So let's see, what's this height
right Here Or this

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.000
width I should say.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.430
Well we're going from
zero to what?

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.480
x is equal to 8 here.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.390
I just went straight down
from x is equal to 8,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.260
y is equal to 5.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.720
So this dimension is 8.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.190
And then we go from x is equal
to 8 to x is equal to 12, how

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.210
far is that?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060
Well, that's going to be 4.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.840
So this is 4 and this is 8.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.080
Fair enough.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.000
And then how high is
this rectangle?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.380
We're going from y is equal
to zero to y is equal to

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.030
5, so that's 5.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.035
And of course this
is 5 as well.

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:13.450
So we're done.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.620
We're ready to figure
out the area.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.730
The area of the rectangle part
is 8 times 5, that's 40.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.030
The area of this triangle
is 5 times 4 times 1/2.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.690
If we didn't put that 1/2 we
would be figuring out the area

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.310
of this rectangle right there.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.710
So 5 times 4 is 20
times 1/2 is 10.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.050
So the area of both of these
combined is 10 plus 40 is 50.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.770
37.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.380
The figure below is a square
with 4 congruent

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.615
parallelograms in side.

00:01:41.615 --> 00:01:43.030
This looks interesting.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.180
What is the area in square units
of the shaded portion?

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.240
So the shaded portion is the
whole square minus the area of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.960
the parallelogram.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.780
So the whole square, that's
easy, it's 12.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.540
And the height is 12, but since
you know it's a square

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.830
we know the width also
has to be 12.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.670
So the area of the whole
square is 144.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.700
If we know the area of one of
the parallelograms, we know

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.930
the area of all of the
parallelograms because they

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.419
are congruent.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.140
So let's see if we can figure
out the area of one of the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.870
parallelograms.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.840
So there is actually a formula
for the area of a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.200
parallelogram, it's
actually just the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.360
base times the height.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.420
And they actually
give us that.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.600
But let me show you that they
give us that because it might

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.090
not be obvious to you.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.510
Let me try to draw it.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.370
I'll use my line tool.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.900
Nope, that's not
the line tool.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.430
One side, then go straight
like that, come down like

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.590
that, good enough.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.000
OK, now if I look at just this
parallelgoram, they tell us

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.320
that the height here is 3.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.650
And I know it's the height
because they told me it's a 90

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.400
degree angle.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.930
And they tell us at
the base is 5.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.250
And I'm telling you that the
area of a parallelogram is

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.340
just the base times the
height is equal to 15.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.010
But you shouldn't just
take my word for it.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.000
That should make intuitive
sense to you.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.970
And the way to think about it
intuitively is imagine if we

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.970
were to take this part of the
parallelogram, and if we were

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.750
to move it over here.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.710
If we were to cut that off
and move it over here.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.460
Then the parallelogram would
look something like this.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.250
You'd have the part that
we didn't cut off.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.250
And then you move the cut-off
part over here.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.230
And now the dimensions, this
base would be 5, and this

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.110
height would be 3.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.040
And the area of this
rectangle is 15.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.850
And there's no reason why the
area of this should be any

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.460
different than that.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.240
We just rearranged its parts.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.130
So that's why the area of a
parallelogram is just the base

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.160
times the height.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.700
So the area of each of these
parallelograms is 15.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.050
So the area of all of
them combined is 15

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.960
times 4, which is 60.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.655
So 144 minus 60 is 84.

00:04:03.655 --> 00:04:08.250
And that's choice B.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.680
Problem 38.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.690
What is the area in square
meters of the

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.000
trapezoid shown below.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.510
So to figure out the area and
we could break it up into

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.970
these rectangles
and triangles.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.700
To figure out the area
of this rectangle we

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.300
need to know its height.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.170
And actually we'll need that to
figure out the area of the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.670
triangles as well.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.250
So what's this height
right there?

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.030
Let's see, we know that this
distance is going to be 6.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.280
It's a rectangle.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.550
If that distance is 6 and both
of these are 5, both of these

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.920
triangles here are going
to be congruent.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.090
Because this length is
equal to this length.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.600
This length is equal
to this length.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.590
And we also we make this angle
is equal to that angle.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.200
But anyway, let me do
it in another color.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.370
What's the length of these
two green sides?

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.180
Let's call it x.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.460
Well we know that when you
add x plus 6 plus x it

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.440
has to equal 12.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.070
The whole top part.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.850
So you get x plus x is 2x
plus 6 is equal to 12.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.410
2x is equal to 6.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.840
x is equal to 3.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.410
And you might have been able
to solve that in your head.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.990
That if that's 6 and these are
the same, then both of these

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.630
are going to be 3.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.870
And now we can use that
information to figure out this

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.170
height right there.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.230
Because if we just draw this
triangle right there, that's

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.970
3, that's 5, this is some
unknown side, a.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.690
You might already recognize,
we're going to use the

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.390
Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.490
And this is a very typical
type of right triangle.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.390
So might already be able
to guess what a is.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.680
But we'll solve for it.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.150
So we know that a squared plus
3 squared is equal to the

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.510
hypotenuse squared, the side
opposite the 90 degree angle.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.230
So that's equal to 25.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.230
5 squared is 25.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.020
a squared plus 9
is equal to 25.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.190
a squared is equal to 16.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.420
a is equal to 4.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.580
a is equal to 4.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.260
And now we're ready to
figure out the area.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.920
What's the area of
the rectangle?

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.140
6 times 6, it's 24.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.590
What's the area of each
of these triangles?

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.730
3 times 4 times 1/2.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.020
3 times 4 is 12 times
1/2 is 6.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.620
So the area of that
triangle is 6.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.310
The area of this
triangle is 6.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.050
So 6 plus 24 plus 6 is 36.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.930
B.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.010
Problem 39.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.660
What is the area in square
inches of the triangle below.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.800
Interesting.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.710
OK, so this is an equilateral
triangle, all

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.070
the sides are equal.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.270
And so we could actually say
that since these two triangles

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.790
are symmetric.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.160
That's equal to that.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.820
And this comes to a general
formula for the area of an

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.330
equilateral triangle.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.770
But let's just figure
it all out.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.740
So this side is going to be 5.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.390
And this side is
going to be 5.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.810
If this is 5 and that's 10, what
is this side right here?

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.520
Let's call it x.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.600
Pythagorean theorem.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.520
This is the hypotenuse.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.080
So x squared plus 5 squared plus
25 is going to be equal

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.440
to the hypotenuse squared,
it's equal to 100.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.460
x squared is equal to
100 minus 25, 75.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.860
x is equal to the square
root of 75.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.900
75 is 25 times 3.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.710
So that's equal to the square
root of 25 times 3.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.390
Which is equal to the square
root of 25 times the

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.830
square root of 3.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.250
Which is equal to
5 roots of 3.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.410
And now, what's the area
of just this right

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.380
triangle right here?

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.080
This one on the right side.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.000
Well its base is 5, its height
is 5 roots of 3.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.310
So it's going to be 1/2 times
the base, 5, times the height,

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.080
5 roots of 3.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.360
And that's what?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.730
1/2 times 5 times 5.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:14.380
So it's 25 root 3 over 2 and
that's just this triangle

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.460
right there.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.720
Well this triangle's going to
have the the exact same area.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.540
They are congruent triangles.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.530
So the area of the figure
is this times 2.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.410
So 2 times that is equal
to just the 25 root 3.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.000
And that's choice B.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.700
Next problem, problem 40.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.600
The perimeter of two squares
are in a ratio of 4:9.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.250
What is the ratio between the
areas of the two squares?

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.630
Let me draw two squares.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.300
That's one square.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.090
Let me draw another square.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.610
That's another square.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:58.210
Let's say that the sides of this
are x and the sides of

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.460
this one are y.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.460
So they say the perimeters of
those two squares are in a

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.460
ratio of 4:9.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.890
So the perimeter of the
first square is 4x.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.190
x plus x plus x plus x.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.770
So the perimeter of the
first square is 4x.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.540
The perimeter of the second
square is 4y.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.880
So that's the ratio of the
perimeter of the first square

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.400
to the perimeter of
the second square.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.600
And then that is equal to 4:9.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.800
And they say, what is the ratio
between the areas of the

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.450
two squares?

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.685
So they want us to figure out
the area of the first square

00:09:33.685 --> 00:09:36.700
is x squared.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.630
Base times height, x times x.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.580
And the are of the second
square is y times y.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.700
So they want us to figure out
what that is equal to.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.140
Well this is x squared
over y squared.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:55.690
This is the same thing
as x over y squared.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.150
So if we can figure out what x
over y is equal to, we can

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.430
just square it and we'll get
x squared over y squared.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.290
So let's try to do that.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.540
So they gave us this.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.235
Well this just simplifies.

00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:11.213
x over y is equal to 4 over 9.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.210
So let's substitute that here.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:20.360
So x squared over y squared is
equal to x over y squared.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.910
Which is equal to 4/9 squared.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.430
Which is equal to 16 over 81.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.680
Or the ratio of the areas of
the two squares is 16:81.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.830
Choice D.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.060
I think we can fit one more
problem in there.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.330
Actually no, I'm over
10 minutes.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.510
I'll stop right there.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.360
See you in the next video.
