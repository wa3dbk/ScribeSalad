00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.390
In the last a video we figured
out the volume between this

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.570
surface, which was xy squared
and the xy-plane when x went

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.540
from 0 to 2 and y
went from 0 to 1.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.390
And the way we did it
is we integrated with

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.890
respect to x first.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.680
We said, pick a y, and
let's just figure out the

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.860
area under the curve.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.640
And so we integrated with
respect to x first, and then we

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.850
integrated with respect to y.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.390
But we could have done it
the other way around.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.080
So let's do that and just make
sure we got the right answer.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.716
So let me erase a lot of this.

00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:37.636
So remember, our answer was 2/3
when we integrated with respect

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:40.440
to x first, and then
with respect to y.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.560
But I will show you that we can
integrate the other way around.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.610
That's good when you can
get the same answer in

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.160
two different ways.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.400
So let me redraw that graph
because I want to give

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.570
you the intuition again.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.626
So that's my x-axis,
y-axis, z-axis.

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:10.850
x, y, z.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.540
Then this is my xy-plane.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.180
down here.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.370
y goes from 0 to 1; x goes from
0 to 2, This is x equals 1,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.650
this is equals 2, this is y
equals 1, and then the graph--

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.290
I will do my best to draw it.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.060
Looks something-- let me get
some contrast going here.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.310
So the graph looks
something like this.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.380
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.260
On this side it looks something
like that and then it comes

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.070
down like that, straight.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.910
And then, the volume
we care about.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.925
It's actually this volume
underneath the graph.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.690
This is the top of the
surface on that side.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.150
We care about this volume
underneath the surface.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.730
And then when we draw the
bottom of the surface-- let

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.050
me do it in a darker color--
looks something like this.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.060
This is the bottom
underneath the surface.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.060
I can even shade it a little
bit just to show you that

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.750
it's the underneath.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.970
Hopefully that's a
decent rendering of it.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.670
Let's look back at
what we had before.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.840
It's like a page that I just
flipped up at this point, and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.560
we care about this volume,
kind of the colored

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.120
area under there.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.250
So let's figure
out how to do it.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.900
Last time we integrated
with respect to x first.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.330
Let's integrate with
respect to y first.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.520
So let's hold x constant.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.600
So if we hold x constant what
we could do is for a given

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.560
x-- let's pick an x.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.170
So if we pick a given x,
let's pick the x here.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.900
Then what we can do, for a
given x, you can view that

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.310
function of x and y.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.070
If x is a constant, let's say
if x is 1 then z is just

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.490
equal to y squared.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.710
That's easy to figure out the
area under because we can see

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.650
that x isn't the constant, but
we can treat it as a constant.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.640
So for example, for any
given x, we would have

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.730
a curve like this.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.200
What we could do is we could
try to figure out the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.610
area of this curve first.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.300
So how do we do that?

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.650
Well, we just said, we could
kind of view this function up

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.860
here as z is equal to xy
squared because that's

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.830
exactly what it is.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.610
But we're holding x constant.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.010
We're treating it
like a constant.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.360
To figure out that area we
could take a dy, a change

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.665
in y, multiply it by the
height, which is xy squared.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:02.830
So we take xy squared, multiply
it by dy, and then if we want

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.020
this entire area we integrate
it from y is equal to

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.910
0 to y is equal to 1.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.600
Fair enough.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.570
Now once we have that area, if
you want the volume underneath

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.210
this entire surface what we
could do is we can multiply

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.450
this area times dx and
get some depth going.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.780
Let me pick a nice
color, that's green.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.120
So that's our dx.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.640
So if we multiply that times
dx we would get some depth.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.950
Let me do a darker color,
get some contrast.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.080
Sometimes I feel like that
guy who paints on PBS.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.820
So now we have the volume of
this, you kind of view it-- the

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.950
area under the curve times a
dx, so we have some depth here.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.750
So it's time dx.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.540
And if we want to figure out
the entire volume under this

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.030
surface-- between the surface
and the xy-plane given this

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.370
constraint to our domain-- we
just integrate from x

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.930
is equal to 0 to 2.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.050
All right, so let's
think about it.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.870
This area in green here
that we started with, that

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.100
should be a function of x.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.600
We held x constant, but
depending on which x you pick

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.780
this area is going to change.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.820
So when we evaluate this
magenta inner integral with

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.330
respect to y we should
get a function of x.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.470
And then when you evaluate
the whole thing we'll

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.220
get our volumes.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.320
So let's do it.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.700
Let's evaluate this
inner integral.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.420
Hold x constant.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.090
What's the antiderivative
of y squared?

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.020
It's y of the third over 3.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.586
The x is a constant, right?

00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:42.290
We're going to evaluate
that at 1 and at 0.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.670
The outer integral is still
with respect to x dx.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.730
This is equal to-- let's see.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.860
When you evaluate y is equal
to 1 you get 1 to the third.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.370
That's 1.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.050
So it's x/3 minus when
y is 0 then that whole

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.560
thing just becomes 0.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.870
This purple expression
is just x/3.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.120
And then we still have
the outside integral

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.560
from 0 to 2 dx.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.290
So given what x we have, the
area of this green surface--

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.410
that was where we started.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.430
Given any given x, that
area-- I wanted something

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.700
with some contrast.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.550
This area is x/3 depending
on which x you pick.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.830
If x is 1, this area
right here is 1/3.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.580
But now we're going to
integrate underneath the entire

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.550
surface and get our volume.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.160
And like I said, when
you integrate it,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.870
it's a function of x.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.220
So let's do that.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.440
And this is just plain old
vanilla, standard integral.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.930
So what's the
antiderivative of x?

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.930
It's x squared over 2.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.890
We have a 1/3 there so
it equals x squared

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.180
over 2 times 3.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.410
So x squared over 6.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.410
And we're going to evaluate
it at 2 and at 0.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.030
2 squared over 6 is 4/6.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.110
Minus 0/6, which is equal to 0.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.640
Equals 4/6.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.560
What is 4/6?

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.850
Well, that's just the
same thing as 2/3.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.360
So the volume under the surface
is 2/3, and if you watched

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.150
the previous video you will
appreciate the fact that when

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.590
we integrated the other way
around, when we did it with

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.540
respect to x first and then y,
we got the exact same answer.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.950
So the universe is in
proper working order.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.580
And I've surprisingly,
actually finished this

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.090
video with extra time.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.400
So for fun, we can just spin
this graph and just appreciate

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.290
the fact that we have figured
out the volume between this

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.710
surface, xy squared
and the xy-plane.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.950
Pretty neat.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.360
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
