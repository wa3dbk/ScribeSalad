00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.860
Let's solve some quadratic
equations by factoring.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:12.490
So let's say I had x squared
plus 4x is equal to 21.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.260
Now your impulse might be to
try to factor out an x and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.250
somehow set that equal to 21.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.650
And that will not lead you
to good solutions.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.670
You'll probably end up doing

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.880
something that's not justified.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.910
What you need to do here is
put the entire quadratic

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.460
expression on one side
of the equation.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.460
We'll do it onto the
left-hand side.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.710
So let's subtract 21 from both
sides of this equation.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.680
The left-hand side then
becomes x squared

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.080
plus 4x minus 21.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.130
And then the right-hand side
will be equal to 0.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.710
And the way you want
to solve this, this

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.170
is a quadratic equation.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.230
We have a quadratic expression
being set equal to 0.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.560
The way you want to solve this
is you want to factor them,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.500
and say, OK, each of
those factors could

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.470
then be equal to 0.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.040
So how do we factor this?

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.910
Well, we saw in the last video
that we have to figure out two

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.040
numbers whose product is equal
to negative 21, and whose sum

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.580
is equal to 4.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.900
This would be a plus b would
have to be equal to 4.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.990
Since their product is negative,
they have to be of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.270
different signs.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.050
And so let's see, the number
that jumps out

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.530
at me is 7 and 3.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.280
If I have negative 7 and
positive 3, I would get

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.580
negative 4.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.210
So let's do positive
7 and negative 3.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.180
So the a and b are positive
7 and negative 3.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.250
When I take the product,
I get negative 21.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.660
When I take their sum,
I get positive 4.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.070
So I can rewrite this
equation here.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.180
I could rewrite it as x
plus 7, times x minus

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.150
3, is equal to 0.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.680
And now I can solve this by
saying, look, I have two

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.690
quantities.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.040
Their product is equal to 0.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.610
That means that one or both of
them have to be equal to 0.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.770
So that means that x plus
7 is equal to 0.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.040
That's an x.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.580
Or x minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.419
I could subtract 7 from both
sides of this equation.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.990
And I would get x is equal
to negative 7.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.270
And over here, I can add 3 to
both sides of this equation.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.320
And I'll get x is equal to 3.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.540
So both of these numbers are
solutions to this equation.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.750
You could try it out.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.300
If you do 7-- negative
7 squared is 49.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.200
Negative 7 times 4 is minus
28, or negative 28.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.010
And that does indeed equal 21.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.280
And I'll let you try it out
with the positive 3.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.290
Actually, let's just do it.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.190
3 squared is 9, plus
4 times 3 is 12.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.170
9 plus 12 is, indeed, 21.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.920
Let's do a bunch
more examples.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.300
Let's say I have x squared
plus 49 is equal to 14x.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.090
Once again, whenever you see
anything like this, get all of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.140
your terms on one side of the
equation and get a 0 on the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.540
other side.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.410
That's the best way to solve
a quadratic equation.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.090
So let's subtract 14x
from both sides.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.430
We could write this as x squared
minus 14x plus 49 is

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.570
equal to 0.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.140
Obviously, 14x minus 14x is 0.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.780
This quantity minus 14x is this
quantity right there.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.590
Now we just have to think about
what two numbers, when I

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.580
take their product, I'm going
to get 49, and when I take

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.670
their sum, I'm going
to get negative 14.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.520
So one, they have to be the same
sign because this is a

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.880
positive number right here.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.290
And they're both going to
be negative because

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.940
their sum is negative.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.480
And there's something
interesting here.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.400
49 is a perfect square.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.890
Its factors are 1, 7, and 49.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.020
So maybe 7 will work, or
even better, maybe

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.530
negative 7 will work.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.410
And it does!

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.980
Negative 7 times negative
7 is 49.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.100
And negative 7 plus negative
7 is negative 14.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.540
We have that pattern there,
where we have 2 times a

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.250
number, and then we have
the number squared.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.000
This is a perfect square.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.209
This is equal to x minus
7, times x minus

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.839
7, is equal to 0.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.750
Don't want to forget that.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.000
Or we could write this as x
minus 7 squared is equal to 0.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.120
So this was a perfect square
of a binomial.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.010
And if x minus 7 squared is
equal to 0, take the square

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.220
root of both sides.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.990
You'll get x minus
7 is equal to 0.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.890
I mean, you could say x minus
7 is 0 or x minus 7 is 0.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.210
But that'd be redundant.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.640
So we just get x minus 7 is 0.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.400
Add 7 to both sides, and you
get x is equal to 7.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.620
Only one solution there.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.240
Let's do another one in pink.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.350
Let's say we have x squared
minus 64 is equal to 0.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.630
Now this looks interesting
right here.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.780
A bell might be ringing
in your head on

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.010
how to solve this.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.300
This has no x term, but
we could think of it

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.410
as having an x term.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.660
We could rewrite this as x
squared plus 0x minus 64.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.070
So in this situation, we could
say, OK, what two numbers,

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.130
when I multiply them,
equal 64, and when I

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.580
add them equal 0?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.720
And when I take their product,
I'm getting a

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.980
negative number, right?

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.080
This is a times b.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.220
It's a negative number.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.195
So that must mean that they
have opposite signs.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.590
And when I add them, I get 0.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.740
That must mean that a plus minus
b is equal to 0, or that

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.870
a is equal to b, that we're
dealing with the same number.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.500
We're essentially dealing with
the same number, the negatives

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.790
of each other.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.270
So what can it be?

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.650
Well, if we're doing the same
number and they're negatives

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:14.505
of each other, 64 is
exactly 8 squared.

00:06:14.505 --> 00:06:17.300
But it's negative 64, so maybe
we're dealing with one

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.010
negative 8, and we're dealing
with one positive 8.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.250
And if we add those two
together, we do

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.720
indeed get to 0.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.840
So this will be x minus
8 times x plus 8.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.300
Now you don't always have
to go through this

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.250
process I did here.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.790
You might already remember that
if I have a plus b times

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.000
a minus b, that that's equal to
a squared minus b squared.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.400
So if you see something that
fits the pattern, a squared

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.100
minus b squared, you could
immediately say, oh, that's

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:58.330
going to be a plus b-- a is x,
b is 8-- times a minus b.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.720
Let's do a couple more of just
general problems. I won't tell

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.270
you what type these
are going to be.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.110
Let me switch colors.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.490
It's getting monotonous.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:14.280
Let's say we have x squared
minus 24x plus

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.530
144 is equal to 0.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.650
Well, 144 is conspicuously
12 squared.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.290
And this is conspicuously
2 times negative 12.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.570
Or this is conspicuously
negative 12 squared.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.510
So this is negative 12
times negative 12.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.400
This is negative 12
plus negative 12.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.060
So this expression can be
rewritten as x minus 12 times

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.050
x minus 12, or x minus
12 squared.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.550
We're going to set
that equal to 0.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.790
This is going to be 0 when
x minus 12 is equal to 0.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.230
You can say either of these
could be equal to 0, but

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.510
they're the same thing.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.580
Add 12 to both sides of that
equation and you get x is

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.560
equal to 12.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.020
And I just realized, this
problem up here, I factored

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.830
it, but I didn't actually
solve the equation.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.200
So this has to be equal to 0.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.070
Let's take a step back to
this equation up here.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.470
And the only way that this thing
over here will be 0 is

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.670
if either x minus 8 is
equal to 0 or x plus

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.110
8 is equal to 0.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.200
So add 8 to both
sides of this.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.100
You get x could be equal to 8.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.460
Subtract 8 from both
sides of this.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.770
You get x could also be
equal to negative 8.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:33.820
Let's do one more.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.159
Just to really, really get the
point drilled in your head.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.650
Let's do one more.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:47.180
Let's say we have 4x squared
minus 25 is equal to 0.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.870
So you might already
see the pattern.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.870
This is an a squared.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.780
This is a b squared.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.180
We have the pattern of a squared
minus b squared,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.140
where, in this case, a would
be equal to x, right?

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.020
This is 2x squared.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.230
And b would be equal to 5.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.570
So if you have a squared minus b
squared, this is going to be

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.820
equal to a plus b
times a minus b.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.590
In this situation, that means
that 4x squared minus 25 is

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:26.660
going to be 2x plus 5
times 2x minus 5.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.520
And of course, that will
be equal to 0.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.400
And this will only be equal to 0
if either 2x plus 5 is equal

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.870
to 0 or 2x minus 5
is equal to 0.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.500
And then we can solve
each of these.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.210
Subtract 5 from both sides.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.550
You get 2x is equal
to negative 5.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.280
Divide both sides by 2.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.030
You could get one solution
is negative 5/2.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.950
Over here, add 5
to both sides.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.020
You get 2x is equal
to positive 5.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.420
Divide both sides by 2.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.310
You get x could also be
equal to positive 5/2.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.920
So both of these satisfy
that equation up there.
