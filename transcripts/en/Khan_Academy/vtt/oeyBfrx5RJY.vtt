00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.460
 

00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.820
We've done several videos now
on amines, which I forgot to

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.840
mention, and this is probably
the most fun notion about

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.932
amines, is that they
tend to be smelly.

00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:10.380
Let me write this down.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.440
Amines tend to be smelly.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.570
And I can make the smelly
smell a little bit.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.470
And in general, in their gaseous
state, they'll often

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.470
smell like ammonia, so it's a
very strong smell, or in their

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.840
liquid state, they usually
smell like fish,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.610
or even dead fish.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.910
They smell like fish.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.190
And, in particular, if you look
at trimethylamine, so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.270
this is-- let me draw
it like this.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.325
H3C, you have your nitrogen.

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:47.260
You have CH3 and then
you have your CH3.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.850
And you can even draw
the lone pair.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.980
This is trimethylamine.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.110
This is the fish smell.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.970
This right here is
the fish smell.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.950
Now, the whole reason why I
brought this up is because in

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.970
this video, we're going to
introduce a new type of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.030
molecule, and that's
an aldehyde.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.520
And I want to contrast
their smells.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.190
Now, some of the smaller
aldehydes still have a pretty

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.900
strong smell, in particular,
formaldehyde.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.140
And we'll talk a little
bit more about

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.030
why this is an aldehyde.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.750
So this right here is
formaldehyde, and that's the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.830
common name.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.610
And you've probably seen
it used as a kind of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.250
preservative.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.410
Maybe even in your biology
class, if there's like a dead

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.800
frog in a solution, it's
probably inside of

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.590
formaldehyde.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.350
Let me write this down.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.190
Formaldehyde.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.700
Once again, this is
the common name.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.680
I'm going to teach you in a
second how to systematically

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.860
name these things.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.630
But when you have larger
aldehydes, they actually can

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.500
have a pretty sweet or
even a rosy smell.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.480
So you have something like
benzaldehyde, which you

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.340
actually saw when we started
the benzene derivatives.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.040
So this is benzaldehyde
right over here.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.730
 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.410
Let me write this down.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.660
This is benzaldehyde.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.120
 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.700
And then this molecule here,
just when I tell you what it's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.270
called, you'll probably guess
what it smells like.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.670
So this has a benzene
ring like this.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.470
And then you have one,
two, three carbons.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.030
The last one's double bonded
to an oxygen and then a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.300
hydrogen like there, and
they have a double

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.670
bond right over here.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.410
And this is called
cinnamaldehyde.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:43.120
 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.720
And as you could guess, this
smells like cinnamon.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.070
And, in fact, this is the
molecule in cinnamon that

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.400
gives it its smell, although you
don't want to have large

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.170
quantities of it or it
might be poisonous.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.700
But in cinnamon, it's a
very pleasant thing.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.930
So larger aldehydes tend to
have kind of a nice, rosy,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.245
sweet, flowery smell.

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:02.250
The smaller ones tend to
be kind of pungent.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.950
If you open up that jar in your
biology class and smell

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.010
that frog, it will not
be a pleasant smell.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.560
So now that I've talked about
smell enough, I think, let's

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.030
talk about what makes an
aldehyde an aldehyde.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.480
And you might even see
a pattern here.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.510
In all of these aldehydes that
I've drawn, we have a carbon

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.760
double bonded to an oxygen.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.800
 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.990
And actually, this part of it
right here, and we'll see this

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.320
over and over again, this is
called a carbonyl group.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.420
So that is a carbonyl group.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.040
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.110
This right here is
a carbonyl group.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.990
And you even see it over here.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.140
But that by itself is
not the distinctive

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.060
feature of an aldehyde.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.510
You'll see that in other
types of molecules.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.180
Let me write it here.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.710
Carbonyl.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.120
What's distinctive about an
aldehyde is, attached to the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.280
carbon in the carbonyl,
you have a hydrogen.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.330
 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.890
And sorry, I forgot to draw
this hydrogen here on

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.670
benzaldehyde.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.260
You have a hydrogen here.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.040
 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.330
So, in general, an aldehyde
is something

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.230
that looks like this.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.130
You have a carbonyl group.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.870
You a carbonyl group.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.520
You have a hydrogen, and then
you just have some other type

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.680
of carbon chain.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.660
This right here is the simplest
possible aldehyde,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.840
and actually, this chain
ends up being

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.000
just another hydrogen.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.800
Now, these three that I've shown
right here, these are

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.740
their common names, and these
are the way that most people

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.460
will talk about formaldehyde,
benzaldehyde, or

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.830
cinnamaldehyde, so they're just
kind of good to know.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.130
And I'll show you one more.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.060
And this is a pretty
important one.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.730
Let me do it down here so
we have some space.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.430
So another one looks like this,
so bonded to a CH3 over

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.300
here and then a hydrogen.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.550
This right here is called
acetaldehyde.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.830
 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.400
And I just wanted to expose
you to these common names

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.150
because this is what
people normally

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.120
use for these molecules.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.440
Now, there is an IAPUC-- I
always forget the acronym.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.470
There is a systematic
way to name them.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.970
It's actually pretty
straightforward.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.340
You just look at the longest
carbon chain, and you always

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.060
start numbering at the carbon
that's in the carbonyl group.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.020
And it's always going to be at
the end of the chain because

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.080
that's always going to be
bonded to a hydrogen.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.250
Actually, let me just
make clear that

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.550
this is also an aldehyde.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.040
You have your carbonyl group,
and on one end, you have a

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.940
hydrogen, just like that.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.610
Now, the systematic way of it,
you just look at the longest

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.270
carbon chain.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.440
Over here, there's
just one carbon.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.150
So here, you would call this,
the systematic name, you would

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.280
call this methanal,
not methanol.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.940
Methanol would mean you would
have an OH group.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.120
But since you have this double
bond and you have a hydrogen,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.500
or you could say this double
bond is at the end of the

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.520
carbon chain, this
is an aldehyde.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.590
So the systematic name is
methanal, not methanol.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.900
Let me make that clear.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.120
This is methanal right there.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.210
This one, I won't do
cinnamaldehyde or

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.330
benzaldehyde, because this is
really the only way that

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.690
people name them.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.380
Actually, frankly, formaldehyde,
people never

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.640
call it methanal.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.860
And acetaldehyde, they'll never
call it what I'm about

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.300
to name it, but the systematic
name is, the longest carbon

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.470
chain, you have one, two
carbons, so it is ethanal.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.940
Ethanal, I don't want to
pronounce it incorrectly.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.400
So let's do a couple more of
these, just to make sure we

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.840
have a decent understanding of
the systematic names here.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.470
And in general, if you have
a really long chain, the

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.290
systematic names are
what is used.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.000
So this thing right here,
what would you call it?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.230
It's clearly an aldehyde.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.060
You have a carbonyl group, a
hydrogen, and you have one,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.440
two, three carbons.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.930
So three carbons, the prefix
is prop-, so it's propanal.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.270
It's an aldehyde.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:08.542
If we want to do something
slightly more complicated,

00:07:08.542 --> 00:07:11.080
let's do something like this.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.570
What would this be called?

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.590
Let's see, we have one, two,
three, four, five.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.960
We have five carbons.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.470
So it will be pent-.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.630
Penta-, and then it's
obviously an

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.180
aldehyde, so it's pentanal.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.980
And you always assume that you
start numbering at the carbon

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.920
in the carbonyl group, so one,
two, three, four, five.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.880
And on the two carbon, you
have a methyl group.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.440
So this is 2-methyl.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.100
So you have a methyl
group right here.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.020
So this is going to be
2-methylpentanal.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:47.999
