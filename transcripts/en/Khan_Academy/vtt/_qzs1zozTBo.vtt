00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:08.150
Round 24,259 to the
nearest hundred.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.590
You're going to find that
doing these problems are

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.910
pretty straightforward, but
what I want to do is just

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.750
think about what it means to
round to the nearest hundred.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.140
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to draw a number line.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.220
Let me draw a number line here,
and I'm just going to

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.970
mark off the hundreds
on the number line.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:37.290
So maybe we have 24,100, and
then we go to 24,200, then we

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.490
go to 24,300, and then
we go to 24,400.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.000
I think you see what I
mean when I'm only

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.250
marking off the hundreds.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.160
I'm going up by increments
of 100.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.130
Now, on this number line,
where is 24,259?

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.200
So if we look at the number
line, it's more than 24,200

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.930
and it's less than 24,300.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.220
And it's 259, so if this
distance right here is 100, 59

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.300
is right about there, so that
is where our number is.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.570
That is 24,259.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.110
So when someone asks you to
round to the nearest hundred,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.700
they're literally saying round
to one of these increments of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.370
100 or round to whichever
increment of 100 that it is

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.900
closest to.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.420
And if you look at it right like
this, if you just eyeball

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.760
it, you'll actually see that it
is closer to 24,300 than it

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.220
is to 24,200.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.160
So when you round it,
you round to 24,300.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.890
So if you round to the nearest
hundred, the answer

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.180
literally is 24,300.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.310
Now that's kind of the
conceptual understanding of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.230
why it's even called the
nearest hundred.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.200
The nearest hundred is 24,300.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.870
But every time you do a problem
like this, you don't

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.460
have to draw a number line and
go through this whole process,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.580
although you might want
to think about it.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.910
An easier process, or maybe a
more mechanical process, is

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.900
you literally look at
the number 24,259.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.470
We want to round to the nearest
hundred, so you look

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.080
at the hundreds place.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.860
This is the hundreds place right
here, and when we round,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.130
that means we don't
want any digits.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.650
We only want zeroes after
the hundreds place.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.490
So what you do is you look at
the place one less than the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.510
place you're rounding to.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.120
This is the hundreds place so
you look at the 5 right there,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.950
and if this number is 5 or
greater, if it's 5, 6, 7, 8,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.360
or 9, you round up.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.290
So 5 or greater, you round up.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.800
And so rounding up in this
situation, it is 5.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.640
It is 5 or greater, so rounding
up means that we go

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.270
to 24,000, and since we're
rounding up, we make

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.820
the 2 into a 3.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:13.540
We increment it by one, so
rounding up, so 24,300.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.570
That's what we mean
by rounding up.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.180
And just as kind of a
counterexample, if I had

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:28.610
24,249 and I wanted to round
to the nearest hundred, I

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.580
would say, OK, I want to round
to the nearest hundred.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.430
Let me look at the tens
place, this place one

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.150
level to the right.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.745
It is not 5 or greater,
so I will round down.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.640
And when you round
down, be careful.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.120
It doesn't mean you
decreases this 2.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.700
It literally means you
just only have the 2.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.410
Just get rid of everything
after it.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.820
So it becomes 24,200.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.580
That's the process where
you round down.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.300
If you round up, it
becomes 24,300.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.180
And it makes sense.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.410
24,249 is going to be sitting
right over here someplace, so

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.730
it's going to be closer
to 24,200.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.310
24,200 would be the nearest
hundred when we round

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.470
down in this case.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.390
For the case of the problem,
24,259, the

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.140
nearest hundred is 24,300.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.970
We round up.
