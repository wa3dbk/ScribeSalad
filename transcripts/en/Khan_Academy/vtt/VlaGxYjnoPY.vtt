00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.750
You've probably heard that the
top speed of some type of

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.060
aircraft is Mach 2.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.070
Or maybe you've watched some
type of science fiction movie,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.465
or some type of fighter movie,
where they say, hey we are

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:21.050
going to travel at Mach 1.8.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.480
And you had a sense, because
they're using it in the same

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.680
context that you would use
as speed, that this is

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.660
some type of speed.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.350
That these numbers represent
some type of speed.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.750
And if you assume that,
you were right.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.340
And the speeds they represent
are actually a multiple, or

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340
depending on how you want
to view it, multiples or

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.880
fractions of the speed of
sound in that medium.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.050
So if someone tells you that
the Mach number is 2, what

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.570
that tells you is that they are
traveling two times the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:07.340
speed of sound, in that medium,
for those conditions.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.460
And I make those last two
qualifiers on it because the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.840
speed of sound is not
always the same.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.100
It has a different speed
depending on whether it's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.430
traveling in air, or water, or
even depending on what makes

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.910
up the air.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.600
And even if it is only traveling
in a certain type of

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.050
air, or a certain makeup, a
mix of gases, it'll also

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.960
change depending on
the temperature.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.050
So if you're at sea level, at
roughly about 20 degrees

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.270
Celsius, the speed of sound is
300, so sea level-- do a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.230
different color, maybe blue for
sea level-- so if you're

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.960
at sea level, the speed
of sound is about

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.070
340 meters per second.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.080
This is at 20 degrees Celsius,
so it's a nice comfortable

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:03.820
temperature at sea level, which
is roughly about 760

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.800
miles per hour.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.240
Now if the temperature were to
drop, so if temperature goes

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.220
down, so does the
speed of sound.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.520
And likewise, if the temperature
goes up, the speed

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.870
of sound goes up.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.580
So when someone tells you that
something is traveling at Mach

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.320
2, they're saying its traveling
at two times the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.660
speed of sound for
that medium.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.250
Usually they're talking
about something

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.380
traveling through air.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.300
And for the speed of sound at
the temperature that they're

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.720
going through.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.250
So if they're at some super-high
altitude, and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.230
normally to travel at these
types of speeds, you have to

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.300
be at a fairly high altitude
where the air is less dense.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.270
You're also traveling in an
environment where the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.240
temperature is significantly
lower than 20 degrees Celsius.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.100
So you might say, hey, does
that mean if someone's

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.090
traveling at Mach 2, does that
mean that they're definitely

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.560
traveling at 680 meters
per second, or at

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.440
1520 miles per hour?

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.160
And of course, whenever someone
gives an air speed,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.270
it's relative to the air.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.310
And the answer is no.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.180
They're probably going to be
traveling a little bit slower

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.270
than that, because at the
altitude that they're

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.580
traveling the speed
of sound is lower.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.980
Now there are ground speed
records where they are

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.860
traveling in kind of the Mach
range where their velocities

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.070
are high enough to say
it in terms of Mach.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.400
And for those types of
situations, they are traveling

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.400
at multiples of 760 miles per
hour, 340 meters per second.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.280
Now you're probably saying, hey,
who is this person right

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.780
here that I've cut and pasted
from Wikipedia?

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.240
And this Ernst Mach.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.330
And this is who the Mach
number is named after.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.440
Ernst Mach, and he was this
Austrian physicist and

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.214
philosopher.

00:03:54.214 --> 00:03:57.780
He did a ton of research
on shockwaves and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.060
soundwaves, and whatnot.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.360
So the Mach number is
named after him.
