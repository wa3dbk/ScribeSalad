00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:07.125
In the last video company A took out a $1mn loan from lender 1 at a variable interest rate

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:12.521
and company B took out a fixed rate $1mn loan from lender 2.

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:19.618
and then they entered into this swap agreement where company A pays a fixed 7% every period.

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:26.146
7% on a notional 1mn. Notional meaning that the 1mn doesn't exchange hands, only the interest does.

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:29.938
A pays the 7% on the notional 1mn every period to B.

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:34.515
B pays LIBOR + 1% on that notional 1mn every period to A.

00:00:34.592 --> 00:00:37.825
So pays a variable rate on that notional amount.

00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:43.310
What I am going to do in this video is go through the numerical mechanics to show that in effect,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.633
Company A now has a fixed rate loan when you think of it from the point of view the interest it is paying

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:50.695
and company B now has a variable rate loan.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:54.692
They have kind of swapped the fixed and variable natures of their loans.

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:58.059
So lets think about what happens with company A in period 1.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.925
In period 1: So in the old period 1 it had to pay $70,000 of interest to the lender.

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:21.804
So it had to pay in period 1, comapny A had to pay $70,000 to lender 1 but now thats not all it has to do.

00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:24.833
Definitely it still has to do that. This loan is still in effect.

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:31.054
But now it also has to pay 7, has to pay 7% fixed to B on that notional 1mn

00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:41.833
so it also has to pay $70,000(7% on a mn) to company B,

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:46.300
But in exchange for that, it's going to get LIBOR +1% from B.

00:01:46.331 --> 00:01:53.033
So its going to get LIBOR (we are assuming it is 5% in period1).

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:58.029
5% + 1% = 6%, 6% on a notional $1mn is $60,000.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:09.571
$60k from B. So net net it pays 70, it pays 70 twice but then it gets back 60.

00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:17.054
So its paying $80,000. So the net is paying $80,000.

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:20.485
Now think about what happens in period 2 when LIBOR changes.

00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:26.085
So in period 2, now LIBOR changes to 4%

00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:33.552
and so A will have to pay 4% + the 2% on its loan which is 6% or $60,000.

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:37.254
A will have to pay $60,000 to its lender.

00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:48.685
It would have to pay B the 70,000 still, it would pay to B 70,000

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:58.823
but in exchange it would get LIBOR + 1% from B. LIBOR is 4%.

00:02:58.823 --> 00:03:01.254
4% + 1% is 5%.

00:03:01.254 --> 00:03:07.018
It would get $50,000. So it would get 50,000 in that period from B.

00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:13.536
So whats the total amount that it pays. It pays 60 +70 = 130,000.

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:16.285
But then it gets back 50,000 from the swap agreement.

00:03:16.285 --> 00:03:24.321
So it pays $80,000. Notice that it doesn't change from any period..

00:03:24.321 --> 00:03:31.018
I encourage you to try out changing the actual LIBOR rate and you see it doesn't change the amount that A pays.

00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:33.618
A is now in effect paying a fixed rate.

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:36.018
Now the opposite is going to happen with B.

00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:39.048
In the old one, every period it pays $80,000.

00:03:39.048 --> 00:03:41.285
But now its going to be a little bit different.

00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:47.705
In period 1, it still pays $80,000 so that we can write that in every period

00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:55.941
In period 2, it still pays $80,000 and then its going to get 7% every period from company A

00:03:55.941 --> 00:04:06.562
So it would get $70,000 but its going to be paying LIBOR + 1%

00:04:06.777 --> 00:04:15.695
So in Period 1, its going to pay $60,000.

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:21.090
And then in period 2, its going to pay $50,000.

00:04:21.152 --> 00:04:27.571
So net you pay 50, you get 70 so thats a part of, you are still paying 10 and you pay another 60

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:31.896
So net is your going to pay 70k in period 1

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:37.455
and then in period 2, you're going to pay 60k

00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:41.367
So now Comapny A is paying a fixed 8% every period.

00:04:41.367 --> 99:59:59.999
and company B is going to pay essentially a variable rate.
