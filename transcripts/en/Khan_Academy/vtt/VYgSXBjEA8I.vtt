00:00:00.744 --> 00:00:03.600
So I'm curious about how much acceleration

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.600
does a pilot, or the pilot and the plane,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.336
experience when they need to take off

00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:09.854
from an aircraft carrier?

00:00:09.854 --> 00:00:11.400
So I looked up a few statistics

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.166
on the Internet, this right here is

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.417
a picture of an F/A-18 Hornet right over here.

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:21.400
It has a take-off speed of 260 kilometers per hour.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.067
If we want that to be a velocity, 260 km/hour

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:27.330
in this direction, if it's taking off from

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.667
this Nimitz class carrier right over here.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:32.867
And I also looked it up, and I found

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:34.867
the runway length, or I should say

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.467
the catapult length, because these planes

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:38.824
don't take off just with their own power.

00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:40.658
They have their own thrusters going,

00:00:40.658 --> 00:00:42.400
but they also are catapulted off,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.164
so they can be really accelerated quickly

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:46.467
off of the flight deck of this carrier.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:49.000
And the runway length of a Nimitz class carrier

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.084
is about 80 meters. So this is where

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.933
they take off from. This right over here

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.533
is where they take off from.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.587
And then they come in and they land over here.

00:00:56.587 --> 00:00:58.421
But I'm curious about the take-off.

00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:01.667
So to do this, let's figure out, well let's just

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.333
figure out the acceleration, and from that

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.933
we can also figure out how long it takes

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.400
them to be catapulted off the flight deck.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.067
So, let me get the numbers in one place,

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:11.933
so the take-off velocity, I could say,

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:16.733
is 260 km/hour, so let me write this down.

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.414
So that has to be your final velocity

00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:20.200
when you're getting off, of the plane,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.757
if you want to be flying.

00:01:21.757 --> 00:01:24.867
So your initial velocity is going to be 0,

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:26.667
and once again I'm going to use the convention

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.800
that the direction of the vector is implicit.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.200
Positive means going in the direction of take-off,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.749
negative would mean going the other way.

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.933
My initial velocity is 0, I'll denote it as a vector

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.886
right here. My final velocity over here

00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:48.739
has to be 260 km/hour.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.667
And I want to convert everything to meters

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:53.000
and seconds, just so that I can get my,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.333
at least for meters, so that I can use my runway length

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.200
in meters. So let's just do it in meters per second,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.000
I have a feeling it'll be a little bit easier

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.137
to understand when we talk about acceleration

00:02:02.137 --> 00:02:04.067
in those units as well.

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:06.090
So if we want to convert this into seconds,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.639
we have, we'll put hours in the numerator,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.728
1 hour, so it cancels out with this hour,

00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:14.857
is equal to 3600 seconds.

00:02:14.857 --> 00:02:17.323
I'll just write 3600 s. And then

00:02:17.323 --> 00:02:20.200
if we want to convert it to meters,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.400
we have 1000 meters is equal to 1 km,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.133
and this 1 km will cancel out with those kms

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:30.667
right over there.

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:32.000
And whenever you're doing any type of

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.667
this dimensional analysis, you really should see

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.318
whether it makes sense.

00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:37.067
If I'm going 260 km in an hour,

00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:40.078
I should go much fewer km in a second

00:02:40.078 --> 00:02:41.402
because a second is so much shorter

00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:43.074
amount of time, and that's why we're dividing

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:45.233
by 3600. If I can go a certain

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:47.400
number of km in an hour a second,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.333
I should be able to go a lot,

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:50.867
many many more meters in that same amount

00:02:50.867 --> 00:02:52.547
of time, and that's why we're multiplying

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:54.600
by 1000. When you multiply these out,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.400
the hours cancel out, you have km canceling out,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.800
and you have 260 times 1000

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.295
divided by 3600 meters per second.

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:07.733
So let me get my trusty TI-85 out,

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:12.052
and actually calculate that.

00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:26.754
So I have 260 times 1000 divided by 3600

00:03:26.754 --> 00:03:29.467
gets me, I'll just round it to 72, because

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:31.133
that's about how many significant digits

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:34.645
I can assume here. 72 meters per second.

00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:37.641
So all I did here is I converted the take-off velocity,

00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:41.667
so this is 72 m/s, this has to be the final velocity

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:44.560
after accelerating. So let's think about

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.867
what that acceleration could be, given that we know

00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:49.267
the length of the runway, and we're going to assume

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:51.667
constant acceleration here, just to simplify things

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:52.933
a little bit. But what does that

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:54.667
constant acceleration have to be?

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.890
So let's think a little bit about it.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.630
The total displacement, I'll do that in purple,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.467
the total displacement is going to be

00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:07.966
equal to our average velocity while we're accelerating,

00:04:07.966 --> 00:04:13.800
times the difference in time, or the amount of time

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.046
it takes us to accelerate.

00:04:16.046 --> 00:04:19.467
Now, what is the average velocity here?

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:23.600
It's going to be our final velocity, plus our initial velocity,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.144
over 2. It's just the average of the initial and final.

00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:28.608
And we can only do that because we are dealing

00:04:28.608 --> 00:04:30.733
with a constant acceleration.

00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:33.133
And what is our change in time over here?

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:35.067
What is our change in time?

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:37.800
Well our change in time is how long does it take

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.133
us to get to that velocity? Or another way to think about it is:

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:45.884
it is our change in velocity divided by our acceleration.

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:50.505
If we're trying to get to 10 m/s, or we're trying to get

00:04:50.505 --> 00:04:54.267
10 m/s faster, and we're accelerating at 2 m/s squared,

00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:55.467
it'll take us 5 seconds.

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:57.610
Or if you want to see that explicitly written in a formula,

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.467
we know that acceleration is equal to

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:05.760
change in velocity over change in time.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.267
You multiply both sides by change in time,

00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:10.000
and you divide both sides by acceleration,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.400
so let's do that, multiply both sides by change in time

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.259
and divide by acceleration.

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.200
Multiply by change in time and divide by acceleration.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.267
And you get, that cancels out, and then you have

00:05:22.267 --> 00:05:24.499
that cancels out, and you have change in time

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:29.667
is equal to change in velocity divided by acceleration.

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:32.800
Change in velocity divided by acceleration.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.507
So what's the change in velocity?

00:05:34.507 --> 00:05:36.733
Change in velocity, so this is going to be

00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:41.357
change in velocity divided by acceleration.

00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:42.867
Change in velocity is the same thing as your

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:46.133
final velocity minus your initial velocity,

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:49.467
all of that divided by acceleration.

00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:52.267
So this delta t part we can re-write as

00:05:52.267 --> 00:06:00.867
our final velocity minus our initial velocity, over acceleration.

00:06:00.867 --> 00:06:03.400
And just doing this simple little derivation here

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.459
actually gives us a pretty cool result!

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:08.872
If we just work through this math, and I'll try to

00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:11.667
write a little bigger, I see my writing is getting smaller,

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.733
our displacement can be expressed as

00:06:13.733 --> 00:06:15.954
the product of these two things.

00:06:15.954 --> 00:06:17.626
And what's cool about this, well let me just

00:06:17.626 --> 00:06:21.620
write it this way: so this is our final velocity

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:29.027
plus our initial velocity, times our final velocity

00:06:29.027 --> 00:06:32.067
minus our initial velocity,

00:06:32.067 --> 00:06:36.783
all of that over 2 times our acceleration.

00:06:36.783 --> 00:06:40.733
Our assumed constant acceleration.

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:43.133
And you probably remember from algebra class

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:47.200
this takes the form: a plus b times a minus b.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.800
And so this equal to -- and you can multiply it out

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.667
and you can review in our algebra playlist

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:54.801
how to multiply out two binomials like this,

00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:56.933
but this numerator right over here,

00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:59.027
I'll write it in blue, is going to be equal to

00:06:59.027 --> 00:07:03.867
our final velocity squared minus our initial velocity squared.

00:07:03.867 --> 00:07:06.272
This is a difference of squares, you can factor it out

00:07:06.272 --> 00:07:10.267
into the sum of the two terms times the difference

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:13.067
of the two terms, so that when you multiply these two out

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:21.452
you just get that over there, over 2 times the acceleration.

00:07:21.452 --> 00:07:24.667
Now what's really cool here is we were able to derive

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:27.267
a formula that just deals with the displacement,

00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:31.600
our final velocity, our initial velocity, and the acceleration.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.067
And we know all of those things except for the acceleration.

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:38.176
We know that our displacement is 80 meters.

00:07:38.176 --> 00:07:40.521
We know that this is 80 meters.

00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:42.774
We know that our final velocity, just before

00:07:42.774 --> 00:07:45.267
we square it, we know that our final velocity is

00:07:45.267 --> 00:07:50.133
72 meters per second. And we know that

00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:53.362
our initial velocity is 0 meters per second.

00:07:53.362 --> 00:07:55.133
And so we can use all of this information

00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:59.267
to solve for our acceleration.

00:07:59.267 --> 00:08:02.267
And you might see this formula, displacement,

00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:03.933
sometimes called distance, if you're just using

00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:07.271
the scalar version, and really we are thinking only

00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:08.757
in the scalar, we're thinking about the magnitudes

00:08:08.757 --> 00:08:10.684
of all of these things for the sake of this video.

00:08:10.684 --> 00:08:12.200
We're only dealing in one dimension.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.200
But sometimes you'll see it written like this,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.022
sometimes you'll multiply both sides times the 2 a,

00:08:18.022 --> 00:08:19.800
and you'll get something like this, where you have

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.400
2 times, really the magnitude of the acceleration,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.067
times the magnitude of the displacement,

00:08:26.067 --> 00:08:27.133
which is the same thing as the distance,

00:08:27.133 --> 00:08:31.600
is equal to the final velocity, the magnitude of

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:41.845
the final velocity, squared, minus the initial velocity squared.

00:08:41.845 --> 00:08:44.733
Or sometimes, in some books, it'll be written as 2 a d

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.933
is equal to v f squared minus v i squared.

00:08:46.933 --> 00:08:48.602
And it seems like a super mysterious thing,

00:08:48.602 --> 00:08:50.600
but it's not that mysterious. We just very simply

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.268
derived it from displacement, or if you want to say distance,

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:55.847
if you're just thinking about the scalar quantity,

00:08:55.847 --> 00:08:59.533
is equal to average velocity times the change in time.

00:08:59.533 --> 00:09:02.023
So, so far we've just derived ourselves a kind of a

00:09:02.023 --> 00:09:05.274
neat formula that is often not derived in

00:09:05.274 --> 00:09:07.267
physics class, but let's use it to actually

00:09:07.267 --> 00:09:10.127
figure out the acceleration that a pilot experiences

00:09:10.127 --> 00:09:14.267
when they're taking off of a Nimitz class carrier.

00:09:14.267 --> 00:09:18.867
So we have 2 times the acceleration

00:09:18.867 --> 00:09:21.467
times the distance, that's 80 meters,

00:09:21.467 --> 00:09:25.267
times 80 meters, is going to be equal to

00:09:25.267 --> 00:09:27.400
our final velocity squared.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.421
What's our final velocity? 72 meters per second.

00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:35.667
So 72 meters per second, squared,

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:37.867
minus our initial velocity.

00:09:37.867 --> 00:09:40.467
So our initial velocity in this situation is just 0.

00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:42.200
So it's just going to be minus 0 squared,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.933
which is just going to be 0, so we don't even have to

00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:46.838
write it down. And so to solve for acceleration,

00:09:46.838 --> 00:09:49.578
to solve for acceleration, you just divide,

00:09:49.578 --> 00:09:52.086
so this is the same thing as 160 meters,

00:09:52.086 --> 00:09:55.667
well, let's just divide both sides by 2 times 80,

00:09:55.667 --> 00:10:03.708
so we get acceleration is equal to 72 m/s squared

00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:11.361
over 2 times 80 meters.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:12.267
And what we're gonna get is,

00:10:12.267 --> 00:10:13.733
I'll just write this in one color,

00:10:13.733 --> 00:10:16.867
it's going to be 72 divided by 160,

00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:20.832
times, we have in the numerator,

00:10:20.832 --> 00:10:22.400
meters squared over seconds squared,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.173
we're squaring the units, and then we're

00:10:26.173 --> 00:10:28.680
going to be dividing by meters.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.533
So times, I'll do this in blue,

00:10:30.533 --> 00:10:33.733
times one over meters. Right?

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:35.000
Because we have a meters in the denominator.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.341
And so what we're going to get is this

00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:39.431
meters squared divided by meters,

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:40.940
that's going to cancel out, we're going to get

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.267
meters per second squared. Which is cool

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.841
because that's what acceleration should be in.

00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:46.933
And so let's just get the calculator out,

00:10:46.933 --> 00:10:48.766
to calculate this exact acceleration.

00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:53.267
So we have to take, oh sorry, this is 72 squared,

00:10:53.267 --> 00:10:57.600
let me write that down. So this is, this is going to be

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.200
72 squared, don't want to forget about this part

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.001
right over here. 72 squared divided by 160.

00:11:02.001 --> 00:11:06.267
So we have, and we can just use the original number

00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:07.867
right over here that we calculated,

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:12.845
so let's just square that, and then divide that by 160,

00:11:12.845 --> 00:11:17.140
divided by 160. And if we go to 2 significant digits,

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.551
we get 33, we get our acceleration is, our acceleration

00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:28.286
is equal to 33 meters per second squared.

00:11:28.286 --> 00:11:31.800
And just to give you an idea of how much acceleration

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.467
that is, is if you are in free fall over Earth,

00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:40.709
the force of gravity will be accelerating you,

00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:46.630
so g is going to be equal to 9.8 meters per second squared.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:52.400
So this is accelerating you 3 times more than what

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.667
Earth is making you accelerate if you were to

00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:56.034
jump off of a cliff or something.

00:11:56.034 --> 00:11:59.470
So another way to think about this is that the force,

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.800
and we haven't done a lot on force yet,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.048
we'll talk about this in more depth,

00:12:02.048 --> 00:12:05.533
is that this pilot would be experiencing

00:12:05.533 --> 00:12:08.400
more than 3 times the force of gravity,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.800
more than 3 g's. 3 g's would be about

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.533
30 meters per second squared, this is more than that.

00:12:15.533 --> 00:12:19.625
So an analogy for how the pilot would feel

00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:22.867
is when he's, you know, if this is the chair right here,

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:26.707
his pilot's chair, that he's in, so this is the chair,

00:12:26.707 --> 00:12:29.133
and he's sitting on the chair, let me do my best

00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:32.733
to draw him sitting on the chair, so this is him

00:12:32.733 --> 00:12:37.133
sitting on the chair, flying the plane, and this is the pilot,

00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:41.000
the force he would feel, or while this thing is accelerating

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.401
him forward at 33 meters per second squared,

00:12:44.401 --> 00:12:48.067
it would feel very much to him like if he was lying down

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:52.467
on the surface of the planet, but he was 3 times heavier,

00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:56.475
or more than 3 times heavier. Or if he was lying down,

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:59.958
or if you were lying down, like this, let's say this is you,

00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:04.667
this is your feet, and this is your face, this is your hands,

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:07.040
let me draw your hands right here, and if you had

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.475
essentially two more people stacked above you,

00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:14.067
roughly, I'm just giving you the general sense of it,

00:13:14.067 --> 00:13:16.467
that's how it would feel, a little bit more than two people,

00:13:16.467 --> 00:13:19.733
that squeezing sensation. So his entire body

00:13:19.733 --> 00:13:22.876
is going to feel 3 times heavier than it would

00:13:22.876 --> 00:13:25.600
if he was just laying down on the beach or something

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.518
like that. So it's very very very interesting, I guess,

00:13:29.518 --> 00:13:32.733
idea, at least to me. Now the other question

00:13:32.733 --> 00:13:34.486
that we can ask ourselves is how long will it take

00:13:34.486 --> 00:13:39.067
to get catapulted off of this carrier? And if he's

00:13:39.067 --> 00:13:45.930
accelerating at 33 meters per second squared,

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.675
how long would it take him to get from 0

00:13:47.675 --> 00:13:50.133
to 72 meters per second?

00:13:50.133 --> 00:13:53.067
So after 1 second, he'll be going 33 meters per second,

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:56.533
after 2 seconds, he'll be going 66 meters per second,

00:13:56.533 --> 00:13:58.800
so it's going to take, and so it's a little bit more

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.067
than 2 seconds. So it's going to take him

00:14:00.067 --> 00:14:01.533
a little bit more than 2 seconds.

00:14:01.533 --> 00:14:04.161
And we can calculate it exactly if you take

00:14:04.161 --> 00:14:07.733
72 meters per second, and you divide it by 33,

00:14:07.733 --> 00:14:13.600
it'll take him 2.18 seconds, roughly, to be catapulted

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.267
off of that carrier.
