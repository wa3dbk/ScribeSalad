00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.490
Now let's do a slightly fancier
example, then we'll try to

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.610
analyze the vector field.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.780
And hopefully this will
make everything a little

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.580
bit more tangible.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.710
So let's say that the velocity
of the fluid, or the particles

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.150
in the fluid, at any given
point in the x-y plane, let's

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:28.490
say in the x-direction, it is x
squared, x squared minus 3x

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:38.170
plus 2 in the x-direction, plus
y squared minus 3y plus

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.770
2 in the y-direction.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.250
Make it simple so that we only
have one thing to factor.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.910
So let's just do
the math first.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.730
Let's figure out the divergence
of our vector field, the

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.050
divergence of our field.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.280
And going to show you a graph
of this field soon, so we'll

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.270
get an intuition of what it
actually looks like, instead of

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.870
my not-so-accurate drawings.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.880
So what's the divergence?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.200
We take the partial derivative
of the x-component

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.940
with respect to x.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.430
So that's just, there's only an
x-variable here, so we don't

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.645
really have to worry about
keeping y or z constant.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:13.650
It's really just a derivative
of this expression

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.150
with respect to x.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.820
So it's 2x minus 3.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.520
And then we add that to the
partial derivative of the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.290
y-component, or the y-function,
with respect to y.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.800
There's only y's in the
y-component, so we just

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.000
take the derivative
with respect to y.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.910
So it's plus 2y minus 3.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.300
Or we could just say that the
divergence of v, at any point

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:48.120
xy, so this is a function of x
and y, is 2x plus 2y minus 3.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.750
Now before I show you the
graph, let's analyze this

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.010
function a little bit.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.270
First of all, let's just look
at the original vector field,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.750
and think about when does that
vector field have some

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.400
interesting points?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.120
Well, I think some interesting
points are when either the x-

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.020
or the y-components
are equal to 0.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.590
So when is the
x-component equal to 0?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.480
Well, if we factor the
x-component, that's the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.420
same thing as, we could
rewrite our vector field.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.010
If we just factored that,
that's x minus 1 times x minus

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.910
2i plus, and it's the same
polynomial, just with y, for

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:38.500
the y-component, so y minus
1 times y minus 2 times j.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.130
So the x-component is 0 when x
is equal to 1, these are just

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.060
the roots of this polynomial,
when x is equal to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.050
1 or 2, right?

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.980
And the y-component is 0
when y is equal to 1 or 2.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.790
And they're both equal to 0
if we have any combination

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.420
of these points.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.240
So the points where they're
both equal to 0 are 1, 1, x's

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.690
is 1, y is 2, right, because
then both components

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.340
are 0, 2, 1, or 2, 2.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.090
So these are the points where
the magnitude of the velocity

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.490
of our fluid, or the particles
of the fluid, are 0.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.200
And we'll see that on
our graph in a second.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.670
And let me ask
another question.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.960
At what points are, well, let's
first decide, what point is

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.290
the divergence equal to 0?

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.500
Let's say, at what point is
a divergence equal to 0.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.460
Let me click clear
up some space.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.570
I think I can delete this.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.140
We got our points, we figured
out what coordinates are the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.072
magnitude of the
vector field 0.

00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:47.790
So let's try to figure out,
when is the divergence

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.870
equal to 0?

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.940
So this is divergence.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.610
So if we set that equal
to 0, 2x plus 2y, 2x

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.250
plus 2y, oh, sorry.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.330
You know what, this is 2x
minus 3 plus 2y minus 3.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.640
So this is minus 6, right?

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.480
Minus 3 minus 3,
that's minus 6.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.880
That's my major flaw,
adding and subtracting.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.560
Anyway, so the divergence.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.710
2x plus 2y, minus 6.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.860
And we want to know,
when does that equal 0?

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.950
So let's set it equal to 0.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.090
And we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.760
We can divide both sides of the
equation by 2, and you get x

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.940
plus y minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.640
You get x plus y is equal to 3.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.190
We could be finished there, or
we could just put it in our

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.690
traditional mx plus b form,
that's the way I find it

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.330
easier to visualize a line.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.930
We could say y is
equal to 3 minus x.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.960
So along this line, the
divergence of the vector fields

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.830
b is equal to 0, along the line
y is equal to 3 minus x.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.990
And if we're above that line,
the divergence is going to be

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.210
positive, right, because if you
just made this a greater than

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.520
sign, that would carry over.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.890
You'd have y is
greater than 3-x.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:13.640
So y greater than 3-x, the
divergence is positive.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.420
And y is less than 3 minus x,
the divergence is negative.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.880
And you could just make this a
less than sign then solve, and

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.310
you'll get y is less than 3-x,
you want to know when the

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.640
divergence is negative.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.510
So I think we've done all of
the analyzing we can do.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.020
So let's take a look at the
graph and see if it if it's

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.760
consistent with our intuition
of what a divergence is,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.755
and the numbers we found.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.280
I hope you can see this.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.450
So this is the vector field.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.630
I don't have space to show it,
but I think you remember, this

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.620
is, you know, x squared
minus 3x plus 2.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.370
This is the definition
of our vector field.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.590
Have it graphed here.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.040
And we figured out, we just
figured out when the

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.130
x-components and the
y-components are equal to 0,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.980
and then we said, when are
both of them equal to 0?

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.370
And we said, oh, well
at the point 1, 1.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.290
Well, this is the point 1, 1,
and we that the magnitudes of

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.210
the vectors are 0
at that point.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.600
And actually, I could
zoom in a little bit.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.750
Right around here, they're all
pointing inwards,, but they get

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.130
smaller and smaller as you
approach the point 1, 1, right?

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.690
We also said at the point
1, 2. x is 1, y is 2.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.290
And here, too, we see that
the magnitude of the vectors

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.680
get very, very, very small.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.480
We could zoom in again.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.020
And we see, the magnitude
gets very small.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.460
The other point, 2, 1, once
again, we see the magnitude

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.060
get small, and then 2, 2.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.590
So that's consistent with what
we found out, that the vector

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.980
field gets very small
at this point.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.900
And the other interesting
thing we said, OK, when does

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.500
the divergence equal 0?

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.160
Well, the divergence equaled
0 along the line y is

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.800
equal to 3 minus x.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.250
So the line y is equal to 3
minus x starts, the y-intercept

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.640
is going to be 3, and it's
going to come down like this.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.020
Right?

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.730
So anything along, at any
point along that line,

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.270
the divergence is 0.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.310
And if we actually look at
the graph, it makes sense.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.570
Because I can't draw on this
graph, but if we drew a circle

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.450
right there, let's assume that
that's on that, the line y is

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.920
equal to 3 minus x, we would
see that in a given amount of

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.000
time, just as many particles
are entering through the top

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.990
right as leaving through
the bottom left, right?

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.670
A lot of entering through the
top right and a lot of leaving

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.340
through the bottom left.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.740
And the vectors, though,
are about the same.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.030
And if we go to the bottom, if
we go here on the line, it

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.860
looks like maybe there are less
entering, but there's

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.970
also less leaving.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.520
I know it's hard to see, but
anywhere along the line,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.450
you see just as much
entering as leaving.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.240
And that's why the
divergence is 0.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.650
Now, let's look at some
of the other points.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.630
Up here, we figure the
diverge is positive.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.740
And does that make
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.310
an arbitrary point.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.150
If we were to draw a circle
around here, we see the vectors

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.080
on the left-hand side of that
circle that you can't see,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.050
because I can't draw
on this graph.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.790
But actually, let's
just say the square.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.690
Let's say the square
is my region, right?

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.210
This one right here.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.320
If that square is my region,
we see the vectors on the

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.980
left-hand side are larger, than
factors leaving are larger than

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.830
the vectors entering it, right?

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.540
So if, in a given amount of
time, more is leaving than

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.180
entering, then I'm becoming
less dense, or you could say

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.860
that the particles
are diverging.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.070
And that makes sense, because
I have a positive divergence.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.210
And if we go here, where the
divergence is negative, let's

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.880
pick an arbitrary spot.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.600
Let's say this
square right here.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.710
We see that the vectors
entering it, the magnitude of

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.470
the vectors entering it, are
larger than the magnitude of

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.800
the vectors exiting it.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.390
So in any given amount of time,
more is coming in than leaving.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.850
So it's getting denser,
or it's converging.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.600
So negative divergence, you can
view it as getting denser,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.610
or it's actually converging.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.770
Actually, something
interesting is happening

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.240
at these two points.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.220
So we said that at the point
2, 1, we see that in the

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.580
y-direction it's actually
converging, right?

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:18.030
Above y is equal to 1, the
arrows are pointing down,

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.630
and below it the arrows
are pointing up, right?

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.310
So in the y-direction, we're
actually converging, or we

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.490
have a negative divergence.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.990
Things are entering
any given spot.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.690
But in the x-direction, things
are getting pushed out, right?

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.890
So the reason why the
divergence is 0 here, you might

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:38.020
have particles entering above
and below a certain space, but

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.090
you have just as many particles
exiting to the left

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.650
and the right.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.160
So it's kind of like particles
are getting deflected out.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.710
So on a net basis, between both
dimensions, you have no

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.030
increase or decrease in density
along that line y is

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.680
equal to 3 minus x.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.180
And before I run out of time, I
just want to give you that core

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.880
intuition again, of why the
divergence is positive, and why

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.930
that means that things are
flowing out, when the rate

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.300
of change is positive.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.590
So we said the
divergence is positive.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.420
Let's say at the spot, right?

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.350
So it makes sense, if our
partial derivatives are

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.710
positive, that means that the
magnitude of our vector is

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.690
getting larger and larger for
larger values of our

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.510
x's and y's, right?

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.760
So if the magnitude of our
vectors are getting larger and

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.120
larger for larger values of x
and y, the vectors on the

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.310
right are going to have
a larger magnitude than

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.290
the factors on the left.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.190
They're increasing
in magnitude.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.390
And so if I were to draw a
boundary, more is going to

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.290
be coming out of the right
than entering to the left.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.220
And so you have a positive
diverge, or you're

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.520
getting less dense.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.840
Anyway, I hope I haven't
confused you too much,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.690
but I have run out
of time once again.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.080
I'll see you in the next video.
