00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:09.240
I've talked a lot about what
fractional reserve banking is,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.260
but I have kind of reserved
making any commentary on it,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.310
and that's what I'm actually
going to do in this video.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.760
So just as a bit of a review on
the whole banking playlist,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.610
I started off with a
very simple example

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.390
of we're on an island.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.600
Let's say you had all of the
gold on an island and you give

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.530
it to me for safekeeping.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.000
So now, I have this asset called
gold, and let's say

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.740
it's 100 gold pieces
that you gave me.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.610
And I also have a liability.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.950
This is my primitive island
bank, and my liability is that

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.580
you could demand this gold from
me whenever you want, so

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.150
this is my liability.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.660
If I were to draw your
balance sheet, this

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.510
would be your asset.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.435
So this would be an
IOU to depositor.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.730
So at any point in time, I've
told you, look, I have this

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.290
nice safe, this vault there,
but you can come to me any

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.180
time and take as much of
your gold as you want.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.640
And we, of course, know from the
fractional reserve banking

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.150
playlist that there's a slight
discrepancy between what I

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.790
told you, the depositor, and the
reality of the situation,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.440
because the first thing that I'm
going to do when you take

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.490
this is, you know, I've taken
your deposits and I could

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.220
charge you for keeping your
money with me, but I've come

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.390
up with a slightly sneakier
scheme, where I say, hey, I've

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.620
seen your behavior.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.990
You never withdraw more than 10
gold pieces out at a time.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.960
So what I do is I lend out all
but 10 of your gold pieces.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.210
So we end up with
the situation.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.810
I have an IOU to you of 100 gold
pieces like that, and I

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.600
take the other 90 gold pieces
and I lend it out to random

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.900
entrepreneurs on our island.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.930
So loan to A and that
is loan to B.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.910
And I think this is great,
because I obviously collect

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.080
interest from these guys, and
assuming that these guys don't

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.040
blow the money, I'll get all the
money back, so you'll get

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.210
all your money back and I'll get
some interest, and I can

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.880
say, hey, I'm keeping
your money for free.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.460
You get safekeeping, and I
collect the interest on it,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.450
and maybe that helps to fund
making the vault nice, and

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.550
everyone's happy.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.720
But clearly here, there
is a discrepancy.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.650
What did I tell you?

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.125
What did I tell you,
the depositor?

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.990
I told you that you can
withdraw 100 gold

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.240
pieces at any time.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.280
Now, what is the reality?

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:07.830
The reality is you can withdraw
10 gold pieces at any

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.250
time, and clearly, this is-- I
don't know if you want to call

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.250
this a lie or not,
but this isn't

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.460
completely true right here.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.660
And I know some of you might be
saying, hey, Sal, this is

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.190
kind of a very primitive example
of gold pieces, but

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.990
our current banking system
doesn't work quite like this.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.220
And just to make sure that you
understand that the analogy

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.570
isn't completely off from our
current baking system, our

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.660
current banking system is more
like this: You have 10 gold

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.080
pieces that you give me.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.320
I'll draw it here.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.930
This is the modern
banking system.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.780
What you do is you give me a
deposit of 10 gold pieces like

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.686
that, and so I say that,
yeah, sure, I

00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:56.960
owe you 10 gold pieces.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.610
So this is my IOU to you.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.120
Everything looks nice and clean
right now, but what I

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.230
then do is then I issue checking
deposits to other

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.030
people, and my limit on how many
checking deposits I can

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.400
issue is based on the reserve
requirements and all of that.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.660
But let's say I have to keep
at least 10% reserves, just

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.540
keep the math simple.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:24.470
So what I do in our modern
system is I make a loan to B

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.190
like that and I gave B a
checking account that is

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.910
equivalent to your
checking account.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.350
So this is an IOU to B.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.410
So this is essentially a promise
to B that, look, this

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.290
is a checking account, and
any time you can come

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.830
and get this much.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.680
Maybe this was 40, maybe
this is 50 gold pieces.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.760
This means that you can come
at any time and get 40 gold

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.590
pieces from me.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.850
But we know the reality that
people actually don't actually

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.940
get the gold pieces.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.820
In our modern system, we're not
even dealing with gold.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.270
This will be reserve currency,
but it's the same idea that

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.480
people are getting money that
really isn't necessarily in

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.980
the reserves.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.650
And, of course, I'm going to
make another loan to person A,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.130
and I'm just going to
create a checking

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.890
account deposit for them.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.070
I'm just going to create an IOU
to A for 50, and the whole

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.140
reason why this works is because
people use these

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.980
checking account deposits
as a form of money.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.690
When I write you a check,
notice what's happening.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.420
I'm just transferring one of
these checking account

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.080
deposits from me to you without
any gold or without

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.720
any reserve currency actually
changing hands.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.530
So that's how it works.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.120
But if you look at these two
balance sheets, one is kind of

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.790
the primitive example.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.570
On my island where I had 100
gold pieces and I lent

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.460
out 90, I owe 100.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.660
I've told people, maybe it's
just one person, that hey, you

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.560
can come to me at any time and
get your 100 gold pieces, but

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.180
the reality is I've lent
all but 10 of it

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.490
out to other people.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.460
Now what's the situation
in the modern?

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.550
Well, I've told people that
there's 100 gold pieces that

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.940
can come from me, right?

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.190
10 to the original depositor,
40 to this guy that I gave a

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.490
loan to, and another 50 to that
guy, but the reality is

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.540
that I only have 10 gold pieces
in my vault and my

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.340
other assets are just
loans to people.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.000
So if you look at these two
balance sheets, you see that

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.980
they are equivalent.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.130
I always like to start with this
one because this one at

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.320
least makes more sense.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.910
If you were to just walk up to a
five-year-old and say, look,

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.230
this is what fractional reserve
banking is, this one

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.830
starts to seem even a little
bit even shadier, because

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.750
you're creating these loans and
you're creating these IOUs

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.490
out of thin air, but your end
result is that they're equally

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.320
shady because they both
have the same

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.300
resulting balance sheet.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.850
So your next question is, hey
Sal, what's wrong with this?

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.410
And I could ask my son, once
he learns to talk, what's

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.640
wrong with this is that there's
a discrepancy between

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.800
what I told the depositor-- so
in this case, I told the

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.460
depositor you can withdraw 100
gold pieces at any time, when

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.250
the reality is they
can withdraw 10.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.680
Here, I'm telling the depositor,
you can take your

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:21.800
money whenever, where the
reality in this modern system

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.150
is that you can demand
whenever-- and I would throw

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:37.970
an asterisk there-- as long as
no more than 10% ask for the

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.220
money at the same time.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.460
Now, obviously, I think this
is-- everyone already becomes

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.270
a little uncomfortable when
you say this, but you say,

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.310
look, this is what our modern
financial system is based on

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.150
and what this allows is this
guy, this bank, however you

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.680
want to view it, is allowed to
be an intermediary between the

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.780
savers, the people who are
giving their deposits, and the

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.360
people who need to invest the
capital in building new

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.340
projects and whatever else.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.130
And the counterargument to that
for someone who's against

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.160
fractional banking is there's
nothing to stop

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.330
you from doing this.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.390
All you have to do is tell
this guy the truth.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.940
What you do is, you do this
exact same scenario.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.410
You don't tell him you
can withdraw 100 gold

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.940
pieces at any time.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:39.330
You tell him you can withdraw 10
gold pieces at any time and

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:47.030
that maybe another 40 gold
pieces will be available

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.540
whenever this guy is supposed to
pay back his loan, maybe in

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:58.210
a year, and that the other 50
gold pieces would be available

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.970
whenever this guy pays
his loan back.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.460
Maybe it's in two years.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.960
So the question is why
doesn't this happen?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.830
Well, the reality is because if
you told the depositor that

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.140
they can't have all of their
money on demand,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.760
he'd say, OK, fine.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.770
One, assuming that you're giving
these guys-- these are

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.890
legitimate people to give your
money to-- I want some of the

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.720
interest that you're taking
because you're just lending

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.330
out my money.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:34.530
If you were to lock up your
money for longer, people would

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.740
want interest for this.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.390
But when the bank is allowed
to kind of tell this

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.220
half-truth, they don't have to
give as much interest on it,

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.440
because when people say, oh, I
can get my money whenever I

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.790
want, they say, well, then I
don't need that much interest

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.160
on it, because it's on demand.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.730
But the reality is they
can't get all of their

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:49.740
money at any time.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.680
They can only get some
fraction of their

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.300
money at any time.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.110
So the next thought might be,
OK, you're being a little bit

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.970
disingenuous when you tell the
depositor that it's on demand

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.230
and because you're being
disingenuous, you're allowed

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.220
to kind of not give them as
much interest as you would

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.350
have to give them if you told
them that their money is

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.980
locked up, but what's wrong
as long as you are a good

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.030
investor and that you put
this money to good use?

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.570
Doesn't the whole
world benefit?

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.030
And that might be true most of
the time, assuming everything

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.250
I just told you, but imagine
a situation where we have

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.530
multiple banks in
our universe.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.800
Let me draw my multiple banks.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:39.390
So this is bank one, I have bank
two, and then bank three.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.360
And bank one and bank
two are very

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.370
honest and good investors.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.470
And we all know it's very hard
to know who's a good or a bad

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.170
investor, especially when times
are good, because then

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.650
most loans tend to
come out good.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.190
So they're good investors.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.210
But bank three takes
on extra risk.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.870
Let me write it down.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.980
And what's their incentive
for taking extra risk?

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.950
Let's say that bank three is
willing to lend to people that

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.210
banks one and two weren't
willing to lend to.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.190
So bank three's balance sheet
here, these loans, are going

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.800
to be riskier loans.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.830
Now why would they do that?

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.950
Because when you give it to
riskier people, you're able to

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.430
take more interest from them.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:29.820
So they take extra risk, which
leads to extra interest. And

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.740
actually, if you were to look at
these banks, you would say

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.050
that this guy's the most
profitable bank.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.180
Even worse, because he's getting
extra interest, he can

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.580
actually share more of that
extra interest with their

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.790
depositors.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.340
So you can give higher yielding
checking accounts, I

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.010
guess I could call it.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:12:00.090
Higher interest on deposits.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.620
So in this situation, the person
who's taking the most

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.240
risk is going to be the most
profitable and they're going

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.690
to give the higher interest
and that might actually

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.910
attract the most deposits,
right?

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.100
If all these guys look the same
to me, and we all know

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.930
it's very hard to know what
banks are actually doing with

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.250
their money, then I'll say,
hey, I'm going to give my

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.410
money to this guy right
over there.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.090
But then what happens as
soon as things go bad?

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.320
As soon as the world gets a
little bit of difficult, this

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.180
extra risk actually starts
rearing its ugly head and then

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.600
this guy becomes insolvent.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.040
So this guy's-- let me see if I
can draw his balance sheet.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.170
His balance sheet will look
something like that.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.650
He has a bunch of loans out.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.470
He's got some reserves right
there and then he's got a

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:49.050
bunch of deposits that you or
I might have given him.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.710
These are our IOUs to us.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.840
These are his loans out.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.210
As soon as things start going
bad, some of these loans are

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.190
going to go bad.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.440
As soon as one of those loans
go bad, I'm going to hear

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.775
about it on the news, and I'm
going to run over to the bank,

00:13:02.775 --> 00:13:05.400
and I'm going to say, let me get
my money back as quickly

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:05.990
as possible.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.950
And let's say I'm the first
one there and I

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:08.870
get my money back.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.120
They promised it to me.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.500
So I withdraw my account right
there, and I get all my money

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.780
back, and I essentially
deplete the reserves.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.500
Now the next guy's going
to come along.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.980
This guy was a little bit of
a slower runner than me.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.680
He comes to the bank, and he
says give me back my reserves.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.910
And the bank says there
are no reserves.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.820
And then this guy is mad.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.850
He has no reserves.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.920
And, of course, the whole time
this guy's assets are just

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.980
becoming worthless because he's
loaned it to people who

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.440
invested it badly.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.235
And so you have all of these
people-- when he finds out

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:41.450
that this guy didn't get his
money, all of these people are

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.780
going to go there and demand
their money and the bank is

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.340
going to be insolvent.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.490
It's going to be two things.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.330
It's going to be illiquid
and insolvent.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.170
And I've explained the
difference, but illiquid might

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.980
mean the loans might be good--
and actually I'll reiterate it

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.980
in this video-- but the loans
might be good, it just doesn't

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.900
have the cash.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.100
Insolvent means that these loans
aren't good, that the

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.690
value of these loans aren't
equal to these deposits.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.190
So I'll say that this risky
bank is insolvent.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.430
Now, you might say these guys
right here deserve it.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:17.760
They guys deserve what they got
because they were greedy.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.310
They invested in this risky
bank that was doing shady

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.010
things just to get a
little bit higher

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.470
interest on their deposits.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.780
But what happens when
this happens?

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.010
Well, you have these good banks
over here that maybe did

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.370
really conservative lending.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.110
So this is what their balance
sheets-- maybe both of their

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.050
balance sheets look like this.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.450
They have some reserves
right there.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:44.190
They've made out some good loans
to good entrepreneurs

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.450
and then you have their
depositors.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.270
But as soon as this guy finds
out about what happened at

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.370
that bank, he's like, things
are really bad.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.060
Let me just be careful and go
to my bank-- let's say it's

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.490
this depositor right here-- and
take my money out and put

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.800
it into my mattress.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.500
So he goes to the bank and
he's the first one there.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.500
He's the fastest runner of
all of the depositors.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.970
So he claims his deposit.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.120
So his deposit, he
withdraws, and he

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.370
depletes all of the reserves.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.750
Now, he wasn't the only
guy who was afraid.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.610
This guy was afraid as well.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.330
So he comes running to the bank,
and the bank now says,

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.820
gee, I know I made this promise
to you that you have

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.150
an on-demand account, but that
guy you saw leaving the bank

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.360
with the running shoes on, he
actually just took all of the

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.200
reserves, and I guess I have
to admit now that I lied to

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.130
you, that it isn't completely
on demand.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.390
I actually loaned out the
rest of your money.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.620
But I was a good banker.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.680
These are actually good loans.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.340
These loans are still worth
what they want.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.970
If you just wait long enough,
you'll get your money back.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.280
And, of course, this guy's
going to be not so happy

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.590
because he was lied to.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.430
And that's not going
to be the only guy.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.390
Slightly slower runners are
going to come there and also

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.550
demand their money.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.200
And this is known
as a bank run.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.950
Where because one maybe bad
apple in the system actually

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.220
is insolvent, everyone becomes
afraid and comes and says,

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.420
give me my money, and because
we have this fractional

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.700
reserve system, the
money isn't there.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.200
It just will not be there
because 90% of it is lent out.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.230
And so once this happens there,
then you're going to

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.830
have a run on bank two, and then
everyone is going to take

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.610
their money out of the
banking system.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.240
So the whole banking system,
this situation right here

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.810
where the assets maybe still
are worth the same or more

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.780
than the liabilities, this guy's
still solvent, but he

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.720
doesn't have any money to pay
these on-demand accounts, so

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.460
this guy is running into
a liquidity problem.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.460
He doesn't have the reserves,
and that's why we have the

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.920
whole Federal Reserve that's
a lender of last resort.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.140
This guy can walk to the Federal
Reserve and say, hey,

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.630
I have some people knocking
on my door.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.590
Give me some loans.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:02.870
The Federal Reserve will lend
this guy some money, and, of

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:08.020
course, then this guy's going
to have another lender to it

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.319
called the Federal Reserve and
he can use this to pay off

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.400
these guys.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.420
But that leaves another
question: How does the Federal

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.510
Reserve really know the
difference between this guy--

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.650
he might say, OK,
this guy's good.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.810
Let me just lend to him to make
sure that he doesn't have

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.010
a liquidity problem.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.940
How does the Federal Reserve
really know the difference

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.750
between this guy and this
guy right here?

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.480
This guy's going to also run
to the Federal Reserve.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.260
Hey, Federal Reserve, these
loans are still good.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.940
Just give me a loan so I can pay
these people right there.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.640
So the Federal Reserve says,
hey, you look good.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.500
You're a nice clean banker in a
nice, fancy building wearing

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.680
a Rolex on your arm.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.650
You must be good for it.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.460
So the Federal Reserve will also
lend this guy, and now

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.170
this guy also owes the Federal
Reserve some money.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.920
We can already see that in
this fractional reserve

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.750
banking system, you have two
problems. You have an unstable

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:04.370
equilibrium, where one bad apple
can lead to a run on the

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.620
entire system.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.590
And I'll talk about what's been
engineered to fix this

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.310
problem: essentially
banking insurance.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.000
I'll probably wait for that
to the next video.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.130
So this is the first
problem right here.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.520
And then the second problem is
that it really becomes hard to

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.710
differentiate between the
good and bad banks.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.810
I mean, it's not so hard to
differentiate at face-- well,

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.790
it is hard to differentiate at
first and becomes even harder

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.610
to differentiate when you
always have the Federal

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.320
Reserve willing to be a
lender of last resort.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.500
And when I talk about the
Federal Reserve insurance,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.740
that makes it even harder to
differentiate, and because

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.345
it's harder to differentiate,
there's a huge incentive for

00:18:55.345 --> 00:18:56.630
banks to take on risk.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.430
Because when times are good,
they'll make more money than

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.630
everyone else, and then when
times are bad, it's really

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.510
hard, that they'll all
suffer equally.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.560
So in the video, I'll talk about
some of what has been

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.960
engineered to fix these problems
and see if they

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.770
actually make sense.
