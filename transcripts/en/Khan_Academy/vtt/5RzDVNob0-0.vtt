00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.950
Use the associative law of
multiplication to write-- and

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.910
here they have 12 times 3 in
parentheses, and then they

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.360
want us to multiply that times
10-- in a different way.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.730
Simplify both expressions
to show they

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.090
have identical results.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.160
So the way that they wrote it
is-- let me just rewrite it.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.160
So they have 12 times 3 in
parentheses, and then they

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.410
multiply that times 10.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.820
Now whenever something is in
parentheses, that means do

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.390
that first. So this literally
says let's do the 12 times 3

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.920
first. Now, what
is 12 times 3?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.670
It's 36.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.950
So this evaluates to 36, and
then we still have that times

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.040
10 over there.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.870
And we know the trick.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.960
Whenever we multiply something
times a power of ten, we just

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.930
add the number of zeroes that we
have at the back of it, so

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.440
this is going to be 360.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.390
This is going to be
equal to 360.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.160
Now, the associative law of
multiplication, once again, it

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.950
sounds like a very
fancy thing.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.630
All that means is it doesn't
matter how we associate the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.370
multiplication or it doesn't
matter how we put the

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.310
parentheses, we're going to get
the same answer, so let me

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.840
write it down again.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.020
If we were to do 12 times 3
times 10, if we just wrote it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.180
like this without parentheses,
if we just went left to right,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.000
that would essentially be
exactly what we just did here

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.860
on the left.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.890
But the associative law
of multiplication

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.910
says, you know what?

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.560
We can multiply the 3 times 10
first and then multiply the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.260
12, and we're going to get the
exact same answer as if we

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.710
multiplied the 12 times
the 3 and then the 10.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.620
So let's just verify
it for ourselves.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.580
So 3 times 10 is 30, and we
still want to multiply the 12

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.490
times that.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.150
Now, what's 12 times 30?

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.230
And we've seen this several
times before.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.390
You can view it as a 12 times
3, which is 36, but we still

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.970
have this 0 here.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.340
So that is also equal to 360.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.720
So it didn't matter how we
associated the multiplication.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.570
You can do the 12 times 3 first
or you can do the 3

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.340
times 10 first. Either way, they
both evaluated to 360.
