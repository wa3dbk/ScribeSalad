00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.655
Let's do some equations of lines
in point-slope form.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.645
And this is different from y or
from slope-intercept form.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.200
But they really are just two
different ways of writing the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.330
same equation.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.220
We'll see that with a
couple of examples.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.450
And you might remember that
slope-intercept form were

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.030
equations of the form, y is
equal to mx plus b-- we did

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.280
this in the last video-- where
m is the slope, b is the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.850
intercept, the y-intercept.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.060
That's why it's called
slope-intercept.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.320
You have the slope and
the intercept.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.650
In point-slope form, it takes
the form y minus y1-- and I'll

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.680
tell you what y1 is in a
second-- is equal to m times x

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.590
minus x1, where the coordinate
x1, y1 is a point on the line.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.530
That's why this is called
point-slope form.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.440
Now, these are just two
different ways of writing the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.520
exact same thing.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.960
You can always algebraically
manipulate this to get that,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.870
or algebraically manipulate
that to get that.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.800
And I'll show you that with
a couple of examples.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.960
But let's just do a few in
point-slope form, just to make

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.140
things concrete in your head.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.030
So here we have a line that has
a slope of negative 1 over

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.160
10, so m is equal to
negative 1 over 10.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.460
And it goes through the
point 10 comma 2.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.320
So we can directly go
to point-slope form.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.430
So let's get a point.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.470
A point here is the
point 10 comma 2.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.470
So we can immediately go to
point-slope form. y minus,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.730
this is a y-value that's
on the line.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.730
So y minus 2 is going to be
equal to the slope, negative 1

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.530
over 10 times x minus an
x-value, times x minus 10,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.020
just like that.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.780
And we're done.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.650
We just put it in point-slope
form.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.410
There's two things I want
to point out to you.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.610
One, why this makes sense.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.150
And I also want to show
you that this is

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.300
equivalent to that.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.910
So the first thing is why
does this make sense?

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.920
Well, all this is saying, if you
divide both sides of this

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.710
equation by that right over
there, you get y2 over x minus

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.880
10 is equal to negative
1 over 10.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.540
Or you get the change in y
between any point and 2, and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.380
the point 2, over
the change in x.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.400
So you get the change in y over
the change in x for any

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.200
point x, y on that line,
relative to the point 10 comma

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.690
2, is going to be negative
1 over 10.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.370
This is just the definition
of your slope.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.580
Hopefully I don't confuse
you there.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.720
I'm just showing you that this
is just using the definition

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.190
of the slope to create the
equation of the line.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.140
Now, the other thing I want
to show is that this is

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.100
completely equivalent to this.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.110
We can just algebraically
manipulate this to get that.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.060
And let's do that.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.280
So this right here is the
answer to the problem.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.340
But let's play around with
it algebraically to

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.780
get it in that form.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.170
So if we get y minus 2 is equal
to-- let's distribute

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.720
the negative 1 over 10.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.640
So it's negative 1 over 10 x,
and then negative 1 over 10

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.020
times negative 10 is plus 1.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.990
Now we can add 2 to both
sides of this equation.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.850
And you get y is equal to
negative 1 over 10 x plus 3.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.370
So just algebraically
manipulating it, we were able

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.830
to put it into slope-intercept
form.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.750
So these two things are
completely equivalent.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.680
Let's do a couple more problems.
The line contains

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.630
the points 10 comma
12 and 5, 25.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.040
So let's figure out the slope.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.060
So the slope, which is equal to
change in y over change in

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.000
x, is equal to-- well, let's
just use this point first. So

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:19.870
let's say it's 12 minus
25 over 10 minus 5.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.760
This is going to be equal to--
12 minus 25 is negative 13,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.530
over 10 minus 5, which is 5.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.270
So the slope here is
negative 13 over 5.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.980
Let's put it in point-slope
form, the equation.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.040
So it's going to be y minus--
let's use this point right

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.440
here-- y minus 25 is equal to
the slope negative 13 over 5

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.690
times x minus this point, 5.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.350
We just knew that the point
5 comma 25 is on the line.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.890
So y minus 25 is equal to the
slope, which we figured out,

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.850
times x minus 5.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.060
And we're done.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.650
That's all.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.580
If you want, out of interest,
you could do the algebra to

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.470
put this into the
slope-intercept form, to the

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.930
mx plus b form, and see that
they are completely

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.460
equivalent.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.770
Let's do another one.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.050
So they gave us our slope.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.700
It's 3/5, and the y-intercept
is negative 3.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.945
So here, immediately, this would
be very easy to put it

00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:27.420
in the slope-intercept form.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.650
The equation of this line is y
is equal to the slope 3/5x,

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.200
plus the y-intercept, minus 3.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.070
And we'd be done.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.590
But how do you put this
into point-slope form?

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.830
Well, we know the slope.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.950
We know that m is
equal to 3/5.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.750
But do we know any points
on this line?

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.150
You need a point and a slope
to immediately put it into

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.660
point-slope form.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.180
Well, we know one point.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.300
We know the y-intercept.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.150
The y-intercept is negative 3.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.420
That means when x is equal to
0, y is equal to negative 3.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.520
So our point is, the point
0, negative 3.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.120
You could have tried to figure
out other points.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.450
You could have said, oh,
when x is equal to 5,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.500
y is equal to 0.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.090
There's all sorts of things
you could've tried out.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.500
But this one was just sitting
there for us.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.840
The y-intercept is negative 3.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.640
That means that the point 0,
minus 3 is on the line.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.180
So let's write it in
point-slope form.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:42.150
y minus this y-value, so y minus
negative 3, is equal to

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:48.080
the slope 3/5 times x minus
this x-value, this

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.000
x-coordinate, x minus 0.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.420
And this is point-slope form.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.810
This could be y plus 3 is equal
to 3/5 times-- we could

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.200
write times x minus 0.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.610
If you really wanted to make it
look like point-slope form,

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.510
this would be point-slope form,
but it's kind of silly

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.080
to write x minus 0.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.936
So you could just write y
plus 3 is equal to 3/5x.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.380
It's not 100% clear that
you're in point-slope

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.230
form yet right now.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.480
But I think you still need
to write x minus 0.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.870
And obviously, to go from here
to there, you just have to

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.110
subtract 3 from both sides
and you'll get that.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.920
So these are almost
equivalent.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.720
I mean, they are equivalent in
terms of what they represent.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.750
They're even almost equivalent
in how you write them.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.300
You just have to subtract 3
from both sides of this

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.350
equation to get to that one.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.770
Let's do another one.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.260
Let's put this in point-slope
form.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.880
They're giving us information.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.570
They're giving it in the
form of x, f of x.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.680
So in this situation, when
x is negative 7, f of

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.860
x is equal to 5.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.580
And this coordinate, they're
telling us when x is equal to

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.810
3, f of x is equal
to negative 4.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.220
So just like that, we can figure
out the slope first. So

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:14.895
the slope, which is equal change
in y over change in x.

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:15.950
So let's do this.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:29.130
It's negative 4 minus 5, over
3 minus negative 7.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.900
And this is going to be equal
to-- negative 4 minus 5 is

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.460
negative 9.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.299
And then 3 minus negative 7,
that's the same thing as 3

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.049
plus 7, that's 10.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.870
So slope is negative 9/10.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.830
And so to put this
in point-slope

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.083
form is really easy.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.710
It's just going to be y--
let's do it this way-- y

00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:01.770
minus-- I'll color code it-- 3
is equal to-- I'll do this

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.480
back to the green color-- is
equal to the slope, is equal

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:16.415
to negative 9 over 10, times
this x minus this coordinate,

00:09:16.415 --> 00:09:20.180
x minus negative 4.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.090
Then we can close it.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.560
So this is in point-slope
form.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.050
We obviously can simplify this
negative a little bit.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:32.210
We can rewrite it as y minus
3 is equal to negative 9/10

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.330
times x, plus 4.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.340
And we are done.
