00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.646
Problem 15.

00:00:03.646 --> 00:00:06.501
Let's see, they have a square.

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:07.560
It looks like a square.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.940
I don't know if it's
a square just yet.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.540
And they have a triangle
that comes off of

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.790
the square like this.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.300
Ah, close enough.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.420
And what do they tell us?

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.790
They tell us that this
is 90 degrees.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.585
This is 60 degrees.

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:30.445
And this is A, B, C, D, and E.

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:31.870
And what other thing?

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:38.640
In the figure above, E, B, C, D
is a square, OK, and A, E is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.210
equal to 8.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.030
What is the area
of E, B, C, D?

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.760
So we just have to figure out
one side of the square.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.040
And it's a square, so all
the sides are equal

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.130
and then we're done.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.080
And this is actually just a
30-60-90 triangle problem.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.600
How do I know it?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.700
Because this angle is 60,
this is 90, so this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.590
one has to be 30.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.450
Or I could add it up to 180.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.950
And if you don't even remember
what a 30-60-90 triangle is,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.000
where they add up, you could
go back to page 838,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.670
and they tell you.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.020
If you look in the middle of
that page, they have special

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.920
right triangles, and they tell
you that if the hypotenuse is

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.040
2x that the side opposite the 30
degree side is x, and then

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.060
the side opposite the 60 degree
side is x square root

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.430
of 3, right?

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.670
So if x is equal to 8, what's
x squared of 3?

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.500
x squared of 3 is going to be
equal to 8 square roots of 3.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.680
And, of course, this side will
be 2 times 8, which is 16.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.760
I always think of the 30 degree
side as half of the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.680
hypotenuse, and then the
60-degree side as square root

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.430
of 3 times the 30-degree side.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.420
That's how I think about it.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.410
But you can just look at
what they do on page

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.140
838 and you'll know.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.280
If this is 2x, the side opposite
the 30-degree side is

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.186
x, And the side opposite the
60-degree side is x times the

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:57.153
square root of 3, so this
has to be 8 times the

00:01:57.153 --> 00:01:58.660
square root of 3.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.790
If this side is 8 square root
times the square root of 3,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.990
then so is this side.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.150
And so to figure out the area of
the square, you just say 8

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.170
times the square root of
3 times 8 times the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.860
square root of 3.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.930
And what does that equal?

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.450
That's 8 times 8, that's
64, times the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.560
square root of 3 squared.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.540
And what's the square root
of three squared?

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.170
That's just 3.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.520
So it would become 64 times
3, and that's what?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.870
180 plus 12, that's
equal to 192.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.120
Next problem.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.660
It's really good to become
comfortable with

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.140
the 30-60-90 triangles.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.800
You'll probably get one or two
extra problems on the SAT if

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.550
you get really proficient
at that.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.750
In a mixture of peanuts and
cashews, the ratio by weight

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.640
of peanuts to cashews is 5:2.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.620
Peanuts to cashews, and that's
really the weight is 5:2.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.380
How many pounds of cashews will
there be in four pounds

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.670
of this mixture?

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.600
How many pounds of cashews
there'll be in 4 pounds of

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.700
this mixture?

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.300
So we know that cashews
plus peanuts is

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.590
going to be 4 pounds.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.890
And we also know-- I could
multiply both sides of this

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.660
equation by C, this top one.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.400
We also know that peanuts are
going to be 5/2 the number of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.160
cashews, right?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.290
Because the weight of peanuts
to cashews is 5:2.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.440
So peanuts is going to
be 5/2 of cashews.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.890
And the cashews plus the
peanuts is equal to 4.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.850
So why don't we just substitute
this in for this?

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.550
So we get cashews plus 5/2
of cashews is equal to 4.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.830
And what is this equal to?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.850
This is equal to dot common
denominator 2.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.400
This is like one
cashew, right?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.080
So that's 2/2 plus 5/2 cashews
is equal to 4.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.120
So going up here, that's
7/2 times cashews is

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.850
equal to the 4.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.800
Let's multiply both sides
of this times 2.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.650
So then you get 7 cashews
is equal to 8.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.329
Divide both sides by 7, you get
cashews is equal to 8/7

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.770
pounds, right?

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.380
8/7 pound, so 1 and 1/7 pound
is going to be cashews.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.930
And this stuff here, I could
just multiply both sides by

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.590
2/7, times 2/7.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.040
This would have canceled out,
and I would have gotten the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.000
same thing, 8/7.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.110
So there are 8/7 pounds
of cashews here.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.360
Next problem.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.860
Kind of an odd number, but I
think on these free answer,

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.480
they sometimes give you problems
that might have not

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.810
the most clean numbers
just to trip you up.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.240
OK, so that's the y-axis.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.650
That's my x-axis.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.680
After this problem and the
next, I will go to bed.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.420
So, let's see, that's
the y-axis.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.326
And then they drew
a line here.

00:05:13.326 --> 00:05:15.510
It looks something like that.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.760
They call that line l.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.185
They draw another
line like this.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.770
Let's see, this is A, this is
B, and they say that this

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.610
point right here is
the point 8, 3.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.580
OK.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.980
line m, not shown, passes
through the origin, that's o,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.370
and intersects A, B
between A and B.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.320
What is one possible value
of the slope of line m?

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.440
So line m intersects at the
origin and intersects this

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.110
line someplace.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.980
It's going to look something
like this.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.630
So the whole issue here is that
this line is going to

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.450
have a lower slope than this
line, than line l.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.860
So what is the slope
of line l?

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.210
Well, it goes through the point
8, 3, and it also goes

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.330
through the point 0, 0.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.040
So what's the slope of line l?

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.780
Change in y over change in x.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:25.570
3 minus 0 over 8 minus 0
is equal to 3/8, right?

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.780
So this slope is 3/8.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.950
So in order for this slope-- it
has to be less than this.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.750
And it's also going to be
greater than 1, right?

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.300
Because it's still in the first
quadrant, so it's still

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.580
going to be in this range.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.250
So what's a slope that's less
than 3/8 and greater than 1?

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.960
Well, I don't know.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.240
2/8, which equals 1/4?

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.190
That would work.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.690
That's less than 3/8
and greater than 1.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.460
I mean, you could say 1/8.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.010
That would work.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.100
1/16 would work.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.410
1/1,000 would work.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.120
Any of those, that's all
possible values for the slope

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.770
of m because they just say
it intersects A, B

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.610
between A and B.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.000
It doesn't say where.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.685
So any line, you know, it
could look like this.

00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:07.090
The line could look really
small, so that would be like a

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.100
slope of 1/1,000, but
it would still work.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:19.430
Next problem, problem 18.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.990
OK, so they gave us a table.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:34.808
So they say year, number
of students.

00:07:34.808 --> 00:07:43.410
And then they go 92,
93, 94, 95, 96.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:58.680
In 92, there was x, then 1,552,
1,238 1,459, and 1,351

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.320
The table above shows student
enrollment in Weston High

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.780
School from 1992 to 1996.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.920
If the median enrollment for the
five years was 1,351-- so

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.490
this is the median; this is the
middle number-- and no two

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.140
years have the same enrollment,
what is the

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.480
greatest possible value for x?

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.270
So 1,351 has to be the
middle number.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.440
Let me make another
list. 1,351 has to

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.150
be the middle number.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.890
And let's see, what are the
numbers that we know are

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:26.910
definitely greater?

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:35.169
We have 1,451, and then
we have 1,552.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.220
And the numbers that
are less, we know--

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.630
so this is the median.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.440
We know that 1,238 is less.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.610
And we know that if 1,351 is
the median, then x is also

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.850
going to have to be less than--
there has to be two

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:57.470
numbers less than 1,351, so x
has to be less than 1,351,

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.290
although x could be
here as well.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.880
It could be larger than 1,238.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:10.110
So we know that x is
less than 1,351.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.750
And it could have been equal
to 1,351, but they tell us

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.010
that no two years have
the same enrollment.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.770
So what is the largest
possible value for x?

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.100
Well, it's 1,350, right?

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.040
Because you know that's the
largest number that's less

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.180
than 1,351.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.410
And then this would
be 1,350 here.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.505
And then 1,351 would still
be the median.

00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:29.900
And we are done!

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.890
I'll see you in the
next section.
