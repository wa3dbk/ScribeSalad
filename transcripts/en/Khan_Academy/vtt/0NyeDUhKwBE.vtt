00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.780
And, in the last video, we had
this differential equation.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.350
And it at least looked like
it could be exact.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.690
But when we took the partial
derivative of this expression,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.800
which we could call M with
respect to y, it was different

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.920
than the partial derivative of
this expression, which is N in

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.940
the exact differential
equations world.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.610
It was different than
N with respect to x.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.020
And we said, oh boy,
it's not exact.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.810
But we said, what if we could
multiply both sides of this

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.010
equation by some function that
would make it exact?

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.030
And we called that mu.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.800
And in the last video, we
actually solved for mu.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.640
We said, well, if we multiply
both sides of this equation by

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.200
mu of x is equal to x, it should
make this into an exact

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.310
differential equation.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.280
It's important to note, there
might have been a function of

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.340
y that if I multiplied by
both sides it would

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.490
also make it exact.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.375
There might have been a function
of x and y that would

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:51.140
have done the trick.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.280
But our whole goal is just
to make this exact.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.760
It doesn't matter which one
we pick, which integrating

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.380
factor-- this is called the
integrating factor-- which

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.010
integrating factor we pick.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.190
So anyway, let's do it now.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.190
Let's solve the problem.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.250
Let's multiply both sides of
this equation by mu, and mu of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.150
x is just x.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.060
We multiply both sides by x.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:19.460
So see, if you multiply this
term by x, you get 3x squared

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:28.320
y plus xy squared, we're
multiplying these terms by x

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:36.060
now, plus x to the third
plus x squared y, y

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.910
prime is equal to 0.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.890
Well now, first of all, just as
a reality check, let's make

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.850
sure that this is now
an exact equation.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.580
So what's the partial of this
expression, or this kind of

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.160
sub-function, with
respect to y?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.590
Well, it's 3x squared, that's
just kind of a constant

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.370
coefficient of y, plus 2xy,
that's the partial with

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.860
respect to y of that
expression.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.790
Now let's take the partial of
this with respect to x.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:12.190
So we get 3x squared plus 2xy.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.120
And there we have it.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.760
The partial of this with respect
to y is equal to the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.580
partial of this with
respect to N.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.520
So we now have an exact equation
whose solution should

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.270
be the same as this.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.762
All we did is we multiplied
both sides of

00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:24.650
this equation by x.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.910
So it really shouldn't change
the solution of that equation,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.610
or that differential equation.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.830
So it's exact.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.990
Let's solve it.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.190
So how do we do that?

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.490
Well, what we say is, since
we've shown this exact, we

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.590
know that there's some function
psi where the partial

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.730
derivative of psi with respect
to x is equal to this

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.330
expression right here.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.590
So it's equal to 3x squared
y plus xy squared.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.720
Let's take the antiderivative of
both sides with respect to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.220
x, and we'll get psi
is equal to what?

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.890
x to the third y plus,
we could write,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.910
1/2 x squared y squared.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.110
And of course, this psi is a
function of x and y, so when

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.180
you take the partial with
respect to x, when you go that

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.110
way, you might have lost some
function that's only a

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.880
function of y.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.460
So instead of a plus c here,
it could've been a whole

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.250
function of y that we lost. So
we'll add that back when we

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.070
take the antiderivative.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.950
So this is our psi.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.880
But we're not completely done
yet, because we have to

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.620
somehow figure out what
this function of y is.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.190
And the way we figure that out
is we use the information that

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.820
the partial of this
with respect to y

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.680
should be equal to this.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.150
So let's set that up.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.370
So what's the partial of this
expression with respect to y?

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.940
So I could write, the partial
of psi with respect to y is

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:08.490
equal to x to the third plus
2 times 1/2, so it's just x

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.160
squared y plus h prime of y.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.560
That's the partial of a function
purely of y with

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.779
respect to y.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:22.410
And then that has to equal our
new N, or the new expression

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.930
we got after multiplying by
the integrating factor.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.530
So that's going to be equal
to this right here.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.120
This is, hopefully, making sense
to you at this point.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.170
And that should be equal to x to
the third plus x squared y.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.420
And interesting enough,
both of these

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.350
terms are on this side.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.400
So let's subtract both of those
terms from both sides.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.330
So x to the third, x to
the third, x squared

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.480
y, x squared y.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.560
And we're left with h prime
of y is equal to 0.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.315
Or you could say that h of y
is equal to some constant.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.810
So there's really no y, the
extra function of y.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.890
There's just some constant
left over.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.840
So for our purposes, we
can just say that

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.190
psi is equal to this.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.900
Because this is just a constant,
we're going to take

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.840
the antiderivative anyway,
and get a constant on

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.620
the right hand side.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.960
And in the previous videos, the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.760
constants all merged together.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.910
So we'll just assume that
that is our psi.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.250
And we know that this
differential equation, up

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.710
here, can be rewritten as, the
derivative of psi with respect

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.820
to x, and that just falls out
of the partial derivative

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.210
chain rule.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.510
The derivative of psi with
respect to x is equal to 0.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.370
If you took the derivative of
psi with respect to x, it

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.320
should be equal to this whole
thing, just using the partial

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.690
derivative chain rule.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.240
And we know what psi is.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.310
So we can write-- or actually
we don't even have to.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.830
We could use this fact to say,
well, if we integrate both

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.770
sides, that a solution of this
differential equation is that

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.690
psi is equal to c.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.170
I just took the antiderivative
of both sides.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.960
So, a solution to the
differential equation is psi

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.840
is equal to c.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.840
So psi is equal to x
to the third y plus

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.520
1/2 x squared y squared.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.200
And we could have said plus c
here, but we know the solution

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.770
is that psi is equal to c, so
we'll just write that there.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.840
I could have written a plus
c here, but then you

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.620
have a plus c here.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.850
You have another
constant there.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.860
And you can just subtract
them from both sides.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.380
And they just merge into another
arbitrary constant.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.140
But anyway, there we have it.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.670
We had a differential equation
that, at least superficially,

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.750
looked exact.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.970
It looked exact, but then, when
we tested the exactness

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.160
of it, it was not exact.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.300
But we multiplied it by
an integrating factor.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.140
And in the previous video, we
figured out that a possible

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.020
integrating factor is that
we could just multiply

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.700
both sides by x.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.450
And when we did that,
we tested it.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.570
And true enough, it was exact.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.280
And so, given that it was exact,
we knew that a psi

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.050
would exist where the derivative
of psi with respect

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.300
to x would be equal to this
entire expression.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.520
So we could rewrite
our differential

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.420
equation like this.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.560
And we'd know that a solution
is psi is equal to c.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.570
And to solve for psi, we just
say, OK, the partial

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.330
derivative of psi with
respect to x is

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.590
going to be this thing.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.310
Antiderivative of both sides,
and there's some constant h of

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.230
y-- not constant, there's some
function of y-- h of y that we

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.950
might have lost when we took the
partial with respect to x.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.350
So to figure that out, we
take this expression.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.020
Take the partial with respect
to y, and set that equal to

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.180
our N expression.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.680
And by doing that, we figured
out that that function of y is

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.480
really just some constant.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.520
And we could have written
that here.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.840
We could have written
that plus c.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.320
We could call that
c1 or something.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.000
But we know that the solution
of our original differential

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.250
equation is psi is equal to c.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.553
So the solution of our
differential equation is psi x

00:08:00.553 --> 00:08:03.720
to the third y plus
1/2 x squared y

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.040
squared is equal to c.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.540
We could have had this
plus c1 here, then

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.470
subtracted both sides.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.930
But I think I've said it
so many times that you

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.440
understand, why if h of
y is just a c, you can

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.640
kind just ignore it.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.950
Anyway, that's all for
now, and I will see

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:20.900
you in the next video.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.670
You now know a little bit about
integrating factors.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.230
See you soon.
