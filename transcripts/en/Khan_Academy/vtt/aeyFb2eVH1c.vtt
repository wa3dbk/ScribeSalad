00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.060
We've got the function f of x
is equal to x plus 2 squared

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.350
plus 1, and we've constrained
our domain that x has to be

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.380
greater than or equal
to negative 2.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.390
That's where we've
defined our function.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.180
And we want to
find its inverse.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.560
And I'll leave you to think
about why we had to constrain

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.750
it to x being a greater than
or equal to negative 2.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.960
Wouldn't it have been possible
to find the inverse if we had

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.390
just left it as the
full parabola?

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.900
I'll leave you -- or maybe I'll
make a future video about that.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.450
But let's just figure
out the inverse here.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.520
So, like we've said in
the first video, in the

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.930
introduction to inverses, we're
trying to find a mapping.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.120
Or, if we were to say that y --
if we were to say that y is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.350
equal to x plus 2
squared plus 1.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.480
This is the function you give
me an x and it maps to y.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.870
We want to go the other way.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.980
We want to take, I'll give you
a y and then map it to an x.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.430
So what we do is, we
essentially just solve

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.920
for x in terms of y.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.610
So let's do that one
step at a time.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.600
So, the first thing to do, we
could subtract 1 from both

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.610
sides of this equation.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.200
y minus 1 is equal to
x plus 2 squared.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.440
And now to solve here,
you might want to

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.270
take the square root.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.180
And that actually will be
the correct thing to do.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.115
But it's very important to
think about whether you want

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:17.680
to take the positive or
the negative square

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.080
root at this step.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.200
So we've constrained our domain
to x is greater than or

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.770
equal to negative 2.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.500
So this value right here, x
plus 2, if x is always greater

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.870
than or equal to negative
2, x plus 2 will always be

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.480
greater than or equal to 0.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.170
So this expression right here,
this right here is positive.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.160
This is positive.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.130
So we have a positive squared.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.840
So if we really want to get to
the x plus 2 in the appropriate

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.370
domain, we want to take
the positive square root.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.530
And in the next video or the
video after that, we'll solve

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.530
an example where you want to
take the negative square root.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.650
So we're going to take
theundefined positive square

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.880
root, or just the principal
root, which is just the square

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.910
root sign, of both sides.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:06.740
So you get the square root of y
minus 1 is equal to x plus 2.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.800
And one thing I should have
remembered to do is, from

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.630
the beginning we had
a constraint on x.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.840
We had for x is greater than
or equal to negative 2.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.520
But what constraint
could we have on y?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.000
If you look at the graph right
here, x is greater than

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.430
equal to negative 2.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.610
But what's why?

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.880
What is the range of y-values
that we can get here?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.620
Well, if you just look at
the graph, y will always be

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.060
greater than or equal to 1.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.670
And that just comes from the
fact that this term right

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.400
here is always going to be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.910
So the minimum value that the
function could take on is 1.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.620
So we could say for x is
greater than or equal to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.960
negative 2, and we could add
that y is always going to be

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.790
greater than or equal to 1.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.710
y is always greater
than or equal to 1.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.130
The function is always
greater than or equal

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.160
to that right there.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.530
To 1.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.730
And the reason why I want to
write it at the stage is

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.830
because, you know, later
on, we're going to swap

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.000
the the x's and y's.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.800
So let's just leave that there.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.130
So here we haven't explicitly
solved for x and y.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.700
But we can write for y is
greater than or equal to 1,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.300
this is going to be the domain
for our inverse, so to speak.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.040
And so here we can keep
it for y is greater

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.980
than or equal to 1.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.790
This y constraint's
going to matter more.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.260
Because over here,
the domain is x.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.710
But for the inverse, the domain
is going to be the y-value.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.480
And then, let's see.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.520
We have the square root of y
minus 1 is equal to x plus 2.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.990
Now we can subtract
2 from both sides.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.570
We get the square root of y
minus 1 minus 2, is equal

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.430
to x for y is greater
than or equal to 1.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.810
And so we've solved
for x in terms of y.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.960
Or, we could say, let me just
write it the other way.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.420
We could say, x is equal to,
I'm just swapping this. x is

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.200
equal to the square root of y
minus one minus 2, for y is

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.110
greater than or equal to one.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.550
So you see, now, the way
we've written it out.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.640
y is the input into the
function, which is going to be

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.970
the inverse of that function.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.880
x the output. x is
now the range.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.440
So we could even rewrite
this as f inverse of y.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.170
That's what x is, is equal to
the square root of y minus 1

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.110
minus 2, for y is greater
than or equal to 1.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.760
And this is the
inverse function.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.160
We could say this
is our answer.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.600
But many times, people want
the answer in terms of x.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.400
And we know we could
put anything in here.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.750
If we put an a here, we
take f inverse of a.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.750
It'll become the square root
of a minus 1 minus 2, 4.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.180
Well, assuming a is greater
than or equal to 1.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.530
But we could put an x in here.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.840
So we can just rename
the the y for x.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.950
So we could just do
a renaming here.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.630
So we can just rename y for x.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.340
And then we would get -- let
me scroll down a little bit.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.150
We would f inverse of x.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.870
I'll highlight it here.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.530
Just to show you, we're
renaming y with x.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.180
You could rename it with
anything really, is equal to

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.680
the square root of x minus 1.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.980
Of x minus 1.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.380
Minus 2 for, we have to
rename this to, for x being

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.840
greater than or equal to 1.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.300
And so we now have our inverse
function as a function of x.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.200
And if we were to graph it,
let's try our best to graph it.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.290
Maybe the easiest thing to do
is to draw some points here.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.700
So the smallest value
x can take on is 1.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.370
If you put a 1 here,
you get a 0 here.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.880
So the point 1, negative 2,
is on our inverse graph.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.000
So 1, negative 2
is right there.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.040
And then if we go to 2,
let's see, 2 minus 1 is 1.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.430
The principle root
of that is 1.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.100
Minus 2.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.710
So it's negative 1, so
the point, 2, negative

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.960
1 is right there.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.890
And let's think about it.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.180
Let's see.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.410
If we did 5, I'm trying
take perfect squares.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.730
5 minus 1 is 4, minus 2.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.330
So the point 5, 2 is,
let me make sure.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.350
5 minus 1 is 4.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.220
Square root is 2.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.090
Minus 2 is 0.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.850
So the point 5, 0 is here.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.330
And so the inverse graph, it's
only defined for x greater

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.200
than or equal to negative 1.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.040
So the inverse graph is going
to look something like this.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.260
It's going to look something
like, I started off

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.200
well, and it got messy.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.760
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.820
Just like that.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.520
And just like we saw, in the
first, the introduction to

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.190
function inverses, these are
mirror images around

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.510
the line y equals x.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.070
Let me graph y equals
x. y equals x.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.370
y equals x is that
line right there.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.060
Notice, they're mirror
images around that line.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.520
Over here, we map
the value 0 to 5.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.250
If x is 0, it gets mapped to 5.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.270
Here we go the other way.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.120
We're mapping 5 to -- we're
mapping 5 to the value 0.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.660
So that's why they're
mirror images.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.660
We've essentially
swapped the x and y.
