00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.930
I don't want to beat a dead
horse by showing you all of

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.610
the different ways to find a
determinant, but it might be

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.110
useful to beat this dead horse
because you'll see it done in

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.830
different ways, in different
context.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.230
And I thought I would at least
show you that what we have

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.190
been covering, so far, is very
consistent with a way of

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.880
determining, or finding
determinants, that you might

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.370
have been exposed to in your
Algebra Two class.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.250
It's called the rule
of Sarrus.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.470
Let me just prove it for you.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.520
Let's say we want to
find a determinant.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.850
Let's say you want to find
this determinant.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.870
So our matrix is a, b,
c, d, e, f, g, h, i.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.980
We know how to do this.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.180
This is equal to, let's just
go down that first row, a

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:49.710
times the determinant of e,
f, h, i minus b times the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.830
determinant of d, g, f,
i plus c times the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.065
determinant of d, e, g, h.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.989
And what are these equal to?

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.160
This is going to be equal to
a, so let me write this, a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.460
times ei minus fh.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.645
And this is going to be minus
b times dI minus fg.

00:01:24.645 --> 00:01:33.160
This is going to be plus c times
dh minus eg and if we

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:41.550
multiplied this out we get this
is equal to aei minus afh

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:51.610
minuses bdi plus right, minus
times a minus, plus bfg plus

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.120
cdh minus ceg.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.840
Now let me group the positive
and the negative terms.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.980
So this term is positive, this
term is positive and that term

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.600
is positive.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.410
So we have this being equal
to aei plus bfg plus cdh.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.900
Those are our positive terms.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.640
And then our negative
terms are here.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.250
We have that term, that
term, and that term.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:29.450
So we have minus afh minus
bdi minus ceg.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.320
So this is a formula for the
determinant of this matrix

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.800
right here.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.170
Let's see what it actually
looks like.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.570
Let me rewrite it.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.570
Let me rewrite our matrix.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.790
We do it in green.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:50.560
So we have a, b, c,
d, e, f, g, h, i.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.230
We wanted to find
its determinant.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.590
So let me show you something
interesting here.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.750
aei is what?

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.930
aei is a product of this guy,
this guy, and that guy.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.270
So, you're essentially
going along that

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.340
diagonal right there.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.490
Now what is bfg?

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.600
You're going this guy, this guy,
and then you're going all

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.650
the way down to this guy.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.320
So it's like if you imagine that
when you come out of this

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.490
side, you come out
of this side.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.830
There's some video games where
you go out one end and you end

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.610
up showing up on the other
end like that.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.770
It would also be a diagonal.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.070
Or even a better way to
visualize it, let me redraw

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.080
these two columns.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.810
Let me augment this
determinant.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.770
It's not official terminology,
but I think you'll get what

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.410
I'm trying to do.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.060
So if I write these first
two columns again. a, d,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.430
g, and b, e, h.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.780
This guy right here bfg, it's
this one right here, this

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.420
diagonal right there.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.800
And then you might guess
what's about to happen.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.290
Where is cdh?

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.990
It's this diagonal.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.210
It's that diagonal
right there.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.800
So you take this product, add it
to this product, add it to

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.770
this product.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.330
And then you subtract
these guys.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.320
Now what are these guys?

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.570
Where is the afh?

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.830
That one right there.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.770
So you subtract out afh, and
then you subtract out bdi.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.380
bdi is that one right there.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.220
And then you have ceg, which
is this one right there.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.330
So the Rule of Sarrus, sounds
like something in

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.510
The Lord of the Rings.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:37.560
The Rule of Sarrus is
essentially a quick way of

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.450
memorizing this little
technique.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.560
You write the two columns
again, you say, ok, this

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.620
product plus this product plus
this product, minus this

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.220
product minus this product
minus that product.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.625
Let's actually do it with the 3
by 3 matrix to make it clear

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:55.800
that the Rule of Sarrus
can be useful.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.990
So let's say we have the
matrix, we want the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:08.710
determinant of the matrix, 1, 2,
4, 2, minus 1, 3, and then

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.740
we have 4, 0, minus 1.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.720
We want to find that
determinant.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.550
So by the Rule of Sarrus,
we can rewrite

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.830
these first two columns.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.360
So 1, 2, 2, minus 1, 4, 0.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.610
We rewrote those first
two columns.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.950
And to figure out this
determinant we take this guy.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.670
What is this going to be?

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.410
1 times minus 1 times minus 1.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.280
That is just a 1.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.220
Right, the minuses cancel out.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.320
Plus this guy, plus this
product right here.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.890
I should draw a little
bit neater.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.380
So what is this?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.130
2 times 3 times 4.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.500
2 two times 3 is 6.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.680
6 times 4 is 24, plus 24.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.480
And then we take this
guy right here.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.110
4 times 2 times 0, anything
times 0 is a 0.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.570
So that's going to be plus 0.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.810
And then we subtract
out these guys.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.780
So you have 4 times
4, times minus 1.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.276
That's minus 16.

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:09.700
It's minus 16, but we're
going to be on the

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.350
minus side of things.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.300
So it's 4 times minus 1
times 4, is minus 16.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.340
But since were going to
do a minus on it, it's

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.310
going to be plus 16.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.660
So it's 16.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.230
Then you have a 0
times 3 times 1.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.510
That of course is
going to be 0.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.350
Would be a minus 0, but
we can ignore it.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.270
So we can say plus 0 or
minus 0 same thing.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:37.020
Then you have a minus
1 times 2 times 2.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.880
So that's 4 times minus
1 which is minus 4.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.050
When you go in this direction,
from the top right to the

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.780
bottom left, you are
subtracting.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.380
So this would be a minus 4 but
since we're subtracting, this

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.530
becomes a plus 4.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.390
So the value of our determinant
is equal to, by

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.230
the Rule of Sarrus, we're
going to have

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.370
16 plus 4 is a 20.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.960
20 plus 25 which
is equal to 45.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.120
So that actually is, I'd have
to say, a faster way of

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.580
computing this 3 by
3 derivative.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.330
And I just want to show you this
is completely equivalent

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.200
to the definition that I
introduced you to a couple

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.450
videos ago.
