00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome back.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.400
Let's do some more
derivative problems.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:11.910
Let's say I want to figure out
the derivative d over dx of--

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.856
and let me give something that
looks a little bit different--

00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:27.070
x to the third minus 5x to the
fifth, all of that to the third

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:41.820
power over 2x plus 5
to the fifth power.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.850
This is a parentheses.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.610
This is just saying that I want
to take the derivative of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.840
this entire expression.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080
So you're saying Sal, we've
never learn how to do this,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.090
you have something in the
numerator, you have something

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.710
in the denominator I don't
know what to do next.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.050
Well let's just rewrite this.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.310
Actually in your calculus
textbooks there's something

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.350
called the quotient rule, which
I think is mildly lame, because

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.290
the quotient rule is just the
product rule where you have a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.860
negative exponent and they make
it another rule, and they

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.720
clutter your brain.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.470
So instead of using the
quotient rule, we're just

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.780
going to rewrite this bottom
expression as a product,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.130
and then we can use
the product rule.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.500
So this is the same thing as
taking the derivative of x to

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.830
the third minus 5x to the
fifth, all of that to the third

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.120
power, times 2x plus 5 to what?

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.380
The minus fifth power.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.060
And now we can use
the product rule.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.140
Take the derivative of the
first term-- and the derivative

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.220
of the first term isn't a
joke-- you take the derivative

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.190
of the inside first, let's do
the chain rule, derivative

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.760
of the inside first.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:52.010
That is 3x squared minus 25x to
the fourth times the derivative

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.700
of the outside, 3 times this
entire expression x to the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.580
third minus 5x to the fifth.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.610
And then all of that, take this
exponent down one to the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.510
squared, and then multiply
it times this whole term.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.630
So 2x plus 5 to
the minus fifth.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.240
And then to that we
add the derivative of

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.570
this term, so plus.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.400
So the derivative of this term
we take the derivative of the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.600
inside, which is pretty easy.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.060
It's just 2 times the
derivative of the outside,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.065
which is minus 5.

00:02:31.065 --> 00:02:33.620
And just so you know I didn't
skip a step, the derivative of

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.610
2x plus 5, the derivative of 2x
is 2, derivative of 5 is 0.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.270
So the derivative of
2x plus 5 is just 2.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.990
So it's 2 times
minus 5 2x plus 5.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.410
We just keep that the same to
the minus fifth power, and then

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.360
we multiply it times this first
expression, x to the third

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.340
minus 5x to the fifth
to the third power.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.270
I know that's really messy and
you'll probably not see

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.570
problems this messy, but I just
wanted to show you that the

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.630
product rule we learned-- it's
actually the product and the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.430
chain rule-- they can apply to
a lot of different problems,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.696
and even though you hadn't seen
something like this where you

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:08.880
had numerator and a
denominator, you can easily

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.150
rewrite what you had in
the denominator as a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.190
negative exponent.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.080
And then of course it's just
the product for when you don't

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.090
have to memorize that silly
thing called the quotient rule.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.460
So with that out of the way,
I'm now going to introduce you

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.450
to some common derivatives
of other functions.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.840
And these things are actually
normally included in the inside

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.340
cover of your calculus book,
and they're just good to

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.820
know, good things to know.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.030
And maybe in a later
presentation I'll actually

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.000
prove these things.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.710
You should never take
things at face value.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.290
So you should to some degree
memorize these, although you

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.640
should prove it to
yourself first.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.140
So the derivative of e to the
x-- and I find this to be

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.855
amazing. e shows up all sorts
of crazy places in mathematics,

00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:56.770
and it's you know the strange
number 2.7 whatever, whatever

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.560
and it has all sorts of
strange properties.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.660
And I think this is one of the
most bizarre properties of e.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.930
The derivative of e to the x.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.880
So if I want to figure out
the slope of any point along

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.820
the curve e to the x-- this
just might blow your mind.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.610
I think the more you think
about it, the more it'll blow

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.010
your mind-- is e to the x.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.950
That's amazing.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.810
At any point along the curve
e to the x, the slope of

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.900
that point is e to the x.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.230
Just to hit the point home.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.150
I'm diverging, a little bit.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.640
But if I said f of x is
equal to e to the x, right?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.590
And let's say f of 2 is
equal to e squared.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.540
And I asked you, friend-- I
don't know your name-- what

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:52.010
is the slope of e to the x
at the point 2,e squared.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.540
And you could say Sal,
the slope at that

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.510
point is e squared.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.720
That blows my mind that it's a
function where the slope at

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.960
any point on that line is
equal to the function.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.570
And it's e. e shows up
all sorts of places.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.070
I might do a whole series of
presentations called the

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.530
magic of e, because e shows
up all over the place.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.360
Well I don't want to diverge
too much, so that's

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.530
pretty amazing.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.760
Next I'm going to show you what
I think is probably the second

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.980
most amazing derivative-- and I
don't think this has been fully

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.740
explored in mathematics yet,
because this also blows my

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.870
mind-- is that the derivative
of the natural log of x, right.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.980
So the natural log is just the
logarithm with base e, and I

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.440
hope you remember
your logarithms.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.220
So what's the derivative
of the natural log of x?

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.480
So once again this
is e related.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.430
Well it's 1/x.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.730
That also blows my mind.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.800
Because think about it.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.270
Let's draw a bunch
of functions.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:06:00.940
If I said the derivative
of x to the minus 3 is

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.460
minus 3x to the minus 4.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.690
The derivative of x to
the minus 2 is minus

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.480
2x to the minus 3.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.850
The derivative of x to
the minus 1 is minus

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.870
1 x to the minus 2.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:30.750
The derivative of x to the 0--
well this is just 1, right?

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.920
The derivative of x to the 0 is
just 1, so the derivative is 0.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.382
The derivative of x is 1,
derivative of x squared

00:06:39.382 --> 00:06:42.470
is 2x and so on, right?

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.420
So it's interesting.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.130
We have this pattern from all
the derivatives of all of the

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.940
of kind of the exponents in
increasing order where you go

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.360
from x to the minus 4 x to the
minus 3, x to the minus 2 and

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.100
then there's no x to
the minus 1 here.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.920
We go straight to x to the 0.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.040
What happened to x the minus 1?

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.590
What happened to this?

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.290
What function's derivative
is x to the minus 1?

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.860
This is bizarre to me.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.490
Where did it go?

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.260
And it turns out that
it's a natural log.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.260
This I still think about before
I go to bed sometimes because

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.830
it is kind of mind blowing.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.370
And later in another
presentation I might

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.240
actually prove this to you.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.370
But just to know that this is
true, that the derivative of

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.810
the natural log of x is 1/x
I think is mind blowing.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.870
And so for now you can
just memorize it.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.150
But both of these
are mind blowing.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.830
The derivative of e to the x is
e to the x, and the derivative

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.780
of the natural log of x is 1/x.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.700
And I'll just do a couple of
more just to present them to

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.950
you, and then in the next
presentation we'll actually use

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.680
them using the product rule and
the chain rule and et

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.170
cetera, et cetera.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.120
And you might want to rewatch
this and memorize them.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.760
I want to clear image.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.910
OK.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.920
And now I'll just do the basic
trig functions, and you should

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.240
memorize these as well.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.510
The derivative of sin of x--
this is pretty easy to

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.140
remember-- is cosine of x.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.850
So the slope at any point
along the [? line ?]

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.260
sin of x is actually the
cosine of that point.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.050
That's also interesting.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.460
One day I'm going to do this
holographically because I

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.060
think that might not be
sinking in properly.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:19.610
The derivative of cosine
of x is minus sin of x.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.710
There are good to memorize
though, because you'll be

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.500
able to recall is quickly
on a test and then use it.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:31.620
And then finally the derivative
of tan of x is equal to 1 over

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.900
cosine square of x which you
could also write as the

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.580
secant squared of x.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.170
You might want to memorize
these now, and actually I

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.790
encourage you to explore these
things, I encourage you to

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.980
graph each of these functions.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.160
Graph a function, graph its
derivative and look at them,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.080
and really intuitively
understand why the derivative

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.040
function actually does
describe the slope of

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.820
the original function.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.610
And actually I'll probably
do a presentation on that.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.065
But I'm almost out of time
in this presentation,

00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:03.950
so just memorize these.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.380
And memorize the derivative of
e to the x, e to the x, and

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.940
the natural log of x is 1/x.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.720
And in the next presentation
we're going to start mixing and

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.910
matching all of these
functions, and we can use the

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.490
product and chain rule on them
to solve kind of arbitrarily

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.520
complex derivatives.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.320
Between what we've just seen,
we could probably solve 95% of

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.100
the derivative problems
you'll see on say the

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.140
calculus AP test.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.810
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
