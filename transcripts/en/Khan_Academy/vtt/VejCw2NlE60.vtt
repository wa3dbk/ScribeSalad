00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.710
What I want to do in this video is prove

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.080
that the circumcenter of a right triangle,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.990
is actually the midpoint of the hypotenuse, and to do that,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.660
I'm gonna take, first take a look at the perpendicular bisector

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.880
of one of the legs, of this, of this right triangle

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.600
So, let me construct the perpendicular bisector

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.330
of leg BC right over here, so it's going to look something like this,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.000
it's going to look something like this, this,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.480
it intersects at a right angle, its perpendicular, and it bisects it

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.540
So B, this is from B to this point

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.800
which we'll call M, maybe M for midpoint,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.770
is the same, as it is from M to C,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.230
so those two distances are going to be equal,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.130
and let's call the point where this perpendicular bisector

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.660
intersects the hypotenuse,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.110
let's call this O,and we're gonna prove that O

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.300
is the circumcenter of this right triangle

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.550
Now, the first thing that you might realize,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.530
and this is what we've seen in many problems,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.670
the triangle OBM, looks similar to triangle ABC,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.400
and its actually not too hard to prove,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.600
they both already have a 90 degree angle,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.260
so if we show that they, they both have another angle

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.870
Another set of corresponding angles

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.520
that are congruent to each other, then we know that they're similar

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.490
By AA similarity, and they both clearly share this angle,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.250
right over here, OBC is part of the smaller triangle,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.710
and ABC which is really the same angle,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.070
is part of the larger triangle, and so, and they also obviously share

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.870
a 90 degree angle, so by AA triangle similarity,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:40.700
we have triangle OBM, OBM is similar, is similar to triangle ABC,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.350
is similar to triangle ABC, and what's useful about this?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.530
Is we know similar triangles are ratios between corresponding sides

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.270
are constant, so for example, we know that the ratio between side BM,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.290
which is on the smaller triangle, we know that the ratio between BM

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.740
Let me do this in a different color, just to, just for the sake of it,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.840
we know that the ratio between BM

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.500
and BC, BM and BC, the ratio of this side on the smaller

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.740
triangle to the corresponding side on the larger triangle

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.030
Is going to be the same as the ratio of the hypotenuse

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.510
on the smaller triangle, BO to the hypotenuse of the larger triangle,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.280
because they are similar, well we know what the ratio of BM to BC is,

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.150
BM is half of BC, so this ratio over here

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.550
is going to be equal to one half, this is M is the bi,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.590
of the midpoint of these things,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.200
so this is exactly the same distance as this,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.640
so this is one half of the entire BC,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.430
so if one half is equal to BM, over BC is equal to BO over BA

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.740
We then know, if we just kind of ignore this middle part,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.970
right over here, that one half is equal to BO over BA,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.900
over BA, if you cross multiply it,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.590
if you cross multiply, you see that, well there's multiple ways

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.760
to think about, but you could just cross multiply, and you say BA,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.130
is equal to 2BO, or if you divide both sides by two,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.990
and their really equivalent statements one half BA is equal to BO,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.420
so BO is one half of BA, so this is one half BA,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.530
and so this other length, AO right over here

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.760
This is going to be B, this is going to be, this going to be BA,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.810
minus one half BA, so this is also going to be, one half BA,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.950
and so, this segment right over here,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.420
AO, AO is going to be congruent to OB

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.110
So what we just shown, first of all,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.590
is that this perpendicular bisector, right over here,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.360
The perpendicular bisector of segment BC,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.890
it intersects the hypotenuse of our right triangle at the midpoint,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.440
So we've already established,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.350
so we, one thing that we've already established,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.950
is O, is the midpoint, is the midpoint,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.950
of the hypotenuse, of the hypotenuse, of the hypotenuse AB,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.780
well, that by itself is interesting,

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.180
but, we also know that if a point sits on a perpendicular bisector

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.220
of a segment, is equidistant, it's equal distant

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.490
from the end point of the segment, we'd show that in a previous video

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.730
So we also know that O, OB that's equidistant to the end points

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.550
of the segment, right over here, that OB is equal to OC, but we know,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.190
from this first statement right over here,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.510
that OB is alsoequal to OA, OB is also equal to OA,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.410
its of OB is equal to OC

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.900
OB is equal to OA, that means OC must be equal to OA,

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.850
OC must be equal to OA

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.600
Or another way to think about it, is at this point O,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.570
Is equal distant from all of the points on our tri,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.860
all of the vertices, I should say, this point O is equidistant,

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.320
from all of the vertices of our triangle, of our triangle,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.170
So this distance, this distance, which is really going to become

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.290
our circumradius, is the same as this distance right over here,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.540
which is the same as this distance right over there

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.850
So that we know that O is equidistant,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.480
equidistant to all, all vertices, which is another way of saying

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.570
that O is the circumcenter, O is the circumcenter, so we've just

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.300
proven that if you have the circumcenter of a right triangle,

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.660
it is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of the right triangle,

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.920
or the other way around, that the hypotenuse of the right triangle

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.320
is the circumcenter, because you only have one circumcenter of any,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.880
of any triangle
