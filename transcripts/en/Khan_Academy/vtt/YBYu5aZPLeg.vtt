00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.190
Write an inequality that fits
the graph shown below.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.520
So here they've graphed a line
in red, and the inequality

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.280
includes this line because
it's in bold red.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.380
It's not a dashed line.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.720
It's going to be all of
the area above it.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.600
So it's all the area y is going
to be greater than or

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.530
equal to this line.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.630
So first we just have
to figure out the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.680
equation of this line.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.360
We can figure out its
y-intercept just

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.470
by looking at it.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.470
Its y-intercept is
right there.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.480
Let me do that in
a darker color.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.880
Its y-intercept is right there
at y is equal to negative 2.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.530
That's the point
0, negative 2.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.550
So if you think about this line,
if you think about its

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.440
equation as being of the form
y is equal to mx plus b in

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.680
slope-intercept form, we figured
out b is equal to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.050
negative 2.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.560
So that is negative
2 right there.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.430
And let's think about
its slope.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.530
If we move 2 in the x-direction,
if delta x is

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.960
equal to 2, if our change in x
is positive 2, what is our

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.990
change in y?

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.850
Our change in y is equal
to negative 1.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.560
Slope, or this m, is equal to
change in y over change in x,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.280
which is equal to, in this case,
negative 1 over 2, or

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.670
negative 1/2.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.360
And just to reinforce, you could
have done this anywhere.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.800
You could have said, hey, what
happens if I go back 4 in x?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.450
So if I went back 4, if delta
x was negative 4, if delta x

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.330
is equal to negative
4, then delta y is

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.580
equal to positive 2.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.020
And once again, delta y over
delta x would be positive 2

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.700
over negative 4, which
is also negative 1/2.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.620
I just want to reinforce that
it's not dependent on how far

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.370
I move along in x or whether
I go forward or backward.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.840
You're always going to get or
you should always get, the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.660
same slope.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.030
It's negative 1/2.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.150
So the equation of that line
is y is equal to the slope,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.050
negative 1/2x, plus the
y-intercept, minus 2.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.530
That's the equation of this
line right there.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.940
Now, this inequality includes
that line and everything above

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.490
it for any x value.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.950
Let's say x is equal to 1.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.750
This line will tell us-- well,
let's take this point so we

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.770
get to an integer.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.360
Let's say that x
is equal to 2.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.590
Let me get rid of that 1.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.190
When x is equal to 2, this
value is going to give us

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.535
negative 1/2 times 2, which is
negative 1, minus 2, is going

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:41.550
to give us negative 3.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.620
But this inequality isn't just
y is equal to negative 3.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.290
y would be negative 3 or all
of the values greater than

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.900
negative 3.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.500
I know that, because
they shaded in this

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.180
whole area up here.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.920
So the equation, or, as I should
say, the inequality

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.370
that fits the graph here below
is-- and I'll do it in a bold

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.970
color-- is y is greater
than or equal to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.680
negative 1/2x minus 2.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.600
That is the inequality that is
depicted in this graph, where

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.180
this is just the line, but we
want all of the area above and

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.220
equal to the line.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.600
So that's what we have
for the inequality.
