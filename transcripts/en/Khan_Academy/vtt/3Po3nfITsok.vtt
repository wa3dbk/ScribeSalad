00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.570
Let's do some order of
operations problems, and for

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.435
the sake of time I'll do
every other problem.

00:00:05.435 --> 00:00:08.730
So let's start with 1b.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.900
1b right there.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:21.290
They have 2 plus 7 times 11
minus 12 divided by 3.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.890
So just remember, the top
priority is always going to be

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.320
your parentheses.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.900
So you have your parentheses--
Let me write it this way.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.730
Your top priority's going to
be your parentheses, after

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.410
that you're going to have your
exponents, after that you have

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.990
multiplying and dividing, and
after that you have addition

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.190
and subtraction.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.320
So let's remember that and
tackle these order of

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.930
operations problems.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.940
So priority, there's no
parentheses here, there's no

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.840
exponents, so the priority's
going to go to multiplication

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.060
and division.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.990
So you could view this as being
equivalent to-- So we're

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.640
going to do our multiplication
before we do any addition or

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.590
subtraction, and we're going
to do our division before

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.040
doing any addition
or subtraction.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.100
Problem 1b is exactly equivalent
to this, the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.680
parentheses are just-- I'm
reinforcing the notion that

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.730
I'm going to do my
multiplication and division

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.210
before I do the addition
and the subtraction.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:27.230
So 7 times 11 is 77, and then
12 divided by 3 is 4.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.380
And the rest of the problem was
2 plus this thing, which

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.420
is 77, minus this thing.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.770
And here, since everything is
in addition or subtraction,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.560
let's just go left to right.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.210
2 plus 77 is 79 minus 4,
which is equal to 75.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.380
So 1b is equal to 75.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.160
Let's do 1d.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.140
This is a nice hairy problem
right there.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.400
So 1d.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.900
It says 2 times 3
plus 2 minus 1.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:15.110
Closing two parentheses, all of
that over 4 minus 6 plus 2

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.890
minus 3 minus 5.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.540
Let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.060
As we said, parentheses
take our priority.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.050
So let's do the parentheses
first. 2 minus 1.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.120
2 minus 1 is just 1.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000
3 minus 5.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.560
That is minus 2, or negative
2, I should say.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.895
6 plus 2 is 8.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.860
Now let's keep looking at the
parentheses to see where we

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.730
can simplify things.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.190
We have this parentheses
right here.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.420
So 3 plus this 1 is now going
to be equal to 4.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.328
Actually, let me rewrite it.

00:02:51.328 --> 00:02:55.250
So we're going to have 2 times
this whole expression, 3 plus

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.000
1, so it's 2 times 4.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.400
That right there is 4.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.820
All of that over 4 minus
8, that's negative 4.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.080
This right here is negative 4.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.150
And then minus this
negative 2.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.860
So minus negative 2.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.770
2 times 4 is 8, so this whole
thing simplifies to-- A minus

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.980
of a negative, that's just
the plus of the plus, the

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.470
negatives cancel out.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.280
So this whole thing simplifies
to 8 divided by negative 4 is

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.410
negative 2 plus 2.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.620
So it equals 0.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.890
So this big, hairy thing
simplified to 0.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.140
Now let's do 2b.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.400
Let me clear some space here.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.820
I'll leave the order of
operations stuff there.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.880
Let me clear that and
let me clear this.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.800
All right, 2b.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.800
Evaluate the following

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.280
expressions involving variables.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.810
Fair enough.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.600
So they wrote 2y squared, and
they're saying that x is equal

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.270
to 1, which is irrelevant
because there is no x here,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.310
and y is equal to 5.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.690
So if y is equal to 5, this
thing becomes the same thing

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.840
as 2 times 5 squared.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.890
And notice, I put parentheses
there.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.070
I could have written this as,
this is the same thing as 2

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.590
times 5 squared.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.550
And if you look at the order of
operations, exponents take

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.120
priority over multiplication.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.240
That's why in my head I just
automatically put those

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.950
parentheses.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.170
We're going to do the
exponent first.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:53.130
So this is 25, so you get 2
times 25 is equal to 50.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.030
So that is 2b, this is equal
to-- use a darker color --that

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.090
is equal to 50.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.340
Let's do 2d.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.506
They're giving us y squared
minus x, whole thing squared.

00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:16.330
x is equal to 2 and
y is equal to 1.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.920
Well, we just substitute.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.580
Where we see a y we put a 1.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.370
So this is going to be 1 squared
minus x squared--

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.600
Sorry, minus x, not x squared.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.755
So we just put a regular
x there.

00:05:28.755 --> 00:05:30.410
That's where we put a 2.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.880
And then all of that squared.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.310
Well 1 squared is just
1, so that is just 1.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.420
1 minus 2 is negative 1.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.600
And then we're going to want to
square our negative 1, so

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.460
that will be equal
to positive 1.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.180
So that is equal to 1.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.810
Negative times a negative
is a positive.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.110
All right, let's do 3b.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.210
Doing every other problem.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.050
I'll do it in yellow.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.160
Evaluate the following

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.850
expressions involving variables.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:07.300
All right.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.010
Same idea.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:15.250
So they're giving us
4x over 9x squared.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.130
Oh, actually I said I'd
do 3b, I was doing 3a.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.890
So here we go.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:29.060
We have z squared over x
plus y plus x squared

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.530
over x minus y.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.220
And they're telling us that x
is equal to 1, y is equal to

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.310
negative 2, and z
is equal to 4.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.660
So let's just do our
substitutions first.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.130
So z squared, that's the same
thing as-- I'll do it in a

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:53.480
different color --4 squared over
x, 1, plus y, negative 2,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.410
plus x squared, that's
1 squared, over x,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.770
which is 1, minus y.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.330
y is negative 2.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.700
So this is going to be equal to
4 squared is 16 over 1 plus

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.830
negative 2, that's 1 minus 2--
it's just a negative 1 --plus

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.310
1 squared, which is 1, over
1 minus negative 2.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.840
That's the same thing
as 1 plus 2.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.180
So it's 1/3.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.410
And so this will be 16 divided
by negative 1.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:37.100
We could write that as that's
equal to negative 16 plus 1/3.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.480
Now if we want to actually add
these as fractions we could

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.460
have a common denominator.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:48.640
Negative 16 is the same thing
as minus 48 over 3, or

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.210
negative 48 over 3.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.480
If you take 48 divided by 3
you'll get 16, and I'm just

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.970
keeping the negative sign.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.800
And then you add
that plus 1/3.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.890
We have a common denominator
now, 3.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:10.740
Negative 48 plus 1
is negative 47.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:16.760
So our answer is negative
47 over 3.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.010
Problem 3d.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.970
Same type of situation.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:35.240
x squared minus z squared over
xz minus 2x times z minus x.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:41.510
x is equal to negative
1, z is equal to 3.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.299
Let's do our substitutions.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.560
So this is x squared.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.220
That's minus 1 squared.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.670
Minus z squared, so
minus 3 squared.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.816
All of that over x times z.

00:08:56.816 --> 00:09:06.200
x times z is minus 1 times 3,
minus 2 times x, x is negative

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.280
1, times z minus x,
times 3 minus x.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.940
x is negative 1 minus x.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.370
Wherever we saw an x
we put a minus 1.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.440
So this is going to be equal
to-- Remember, you do your

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.280
exponents first. Well,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.690
parentheses first, then exponents.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.330
So we have negative 1 squared,
that's just a positive 1.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.090
3 squared, that's just
a positive 9.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.420
So our numerator becomes 1 minus
9, that's minus 8 or

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.170
negative 8.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.160
And then our denominator.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.040
Negative 1 times 3
is negative 3.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.300
And then let's go to our
parentheses here.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.540
We have 3 minus negative 1,
that's the same thing as 3

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.390
plus plus 1.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.080
So that right there becomes 4.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.650
So our denominator becomes
negative 3 minus 2 times

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.010
negative 1 times 4, so
that's negative 8.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.880
Minus negative 8.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.230
Minus of a negative is the
same thing as a plus.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:21.320
So this whole thing becomes
negative 8 over negative 3

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.160
plus 8 is 5.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.350
So it's negative 8/5,
minus 8 over 5.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.170
All right, let me clear up
some space just so we can

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.500
reference this problem
properly.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.930
Let me clear all of this
out of the way.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.350
These are interesting now.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.770
Problem 4: insert parentheses in
each expression to make it

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:42.790
a true equation.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.040
Fascinating.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.110
So 4b.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:56.810
You have 12 divided by 4 plus
10 minus 3 times 3 plus 7 is

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.100
equal to 11.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.270
So let's see what happens if we
just do traditional order

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.500
of operations, and I'll do a
little bit in my head because

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.570
this is going to take some
experimentation.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.420
Oh yeah, this is 4b,
12 divided by 4--

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.740
Yep, that's the problem.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.220
So if did 12 divided by 4 first,
and we would get 3.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.570
So let me just do
this in yellow.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:20.670
So if we did regular order of
operations this would be a 3.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.010
This right here would
it be a 9.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:32.940
So you would have 3 plus 10,
which is 13, minus 9, 13 minus

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.210
9 is 4 plus 7.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:36.990
Actually, that seems right.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.980
Let me make sure I
did that right.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.410
3 plus 10-- Right,
that looks right.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.060
So we really just have to do
regular order of operations.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.760
So it already looks like
a true equation.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.030
So if you do 12 divided by 4
plus 10 minus 3 times 3 plus

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.730
7, I think it turns out right.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.030
Let me confirm.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.740
Make sure I'm not making
a mistake.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:04.900
12 divided by 4 is 3 plus 10
minus 3 times 3 is 9 plus 7.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:11.650
This is equal to 13 minus 9,
which is equal to-- So all of

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:18.910
this is equal to 13 minus 9 is
equal to 4 plus 7 is, indeed,

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.940
equal to 11.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.140
So that one wasn't too bad.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.400
You actually wouldn't have to
put any parentheses to make

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.220
this a true expression.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.330
You would just have to follow
the order of operations.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.450
But throwing those parentheses
there makes it a little bit

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.170
easier to read.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.210
Let's try 4d.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:43.390
12 minus 8 minus 4 times
5 is equal to minus 8.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.260
So first let's just see what
happens if we did traditional

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.260
order of operations.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.170
If we did traditional order of
operations we would do this 4

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.050
times 5 first, which would
give us 20 over there.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:13:00.380
And then we would have
12 minus 8 is 4.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.010
And then we would do 4 minus
20-- No, that's not right.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.410
That would give us
negative 16.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.465
So that's not going
to be right.

00:13:07.465 --> 00:13:09.100
So we can't just do traditional
order of

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.050
operations.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.040
Sorry, this is a minus
8 right there.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.390
So let's see how we can
experiment with this.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.780
Let's try out a couple
of situations.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:25.650
What if we did 12 minus 8 minus
4 and then multiplied

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.650
that times 5.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:27.740
Let's see what this give us.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.230
I'm just experimenting
with parentheses.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:36.170
So if you do 8 minus 4, that
right there would be

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.960
8 minus 4 is 4.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.240
And then 4 times 5 would be
20, and then 12 minus 20--

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.270
yeah, that works.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.090
So let me confirm that.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.370
So I'm saying I'm going to put
parentheses right there and

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.740
right there and let's
work it out.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.370
You would get 8 minus 4 is 4.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.190
So this whole thing was
simplified to 12

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.990
minus 4 times 5.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.890
And you just do order of
operations, you do

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.360
multiplication first.
So that is just 20.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.370
And if I wanted to make it very
clear I could actually

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:09.890
write it like this.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.480
I could actually put
another round of

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.040
parentheses right like that.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.450
But order of operations would
tell us to do it anyway.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:20.870
So it becomes 12 minus 20, which
is, indeed, minus 8 or

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.540
negative 8.
