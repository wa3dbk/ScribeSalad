00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.100
Multiply and express as
a simplified rational.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.710
State the domain.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.340
Let's multiply it, and then
before we simplify it, let's

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.370
look at the domain.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.880
This is equal to, if we just
multiplied the numerators, a

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:22.210
squared minus 4 times a plus 1,
all of that over-- multiply

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.010
the denominators-- a squared
minus 1 times a plus 2.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.270
Now, the a squared minus 4 and
the a squared minus 1 might

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.650
look familiar to us.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.880
These are the difference in
squares, a special type of

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.040
binomial that you could
immediately, or hopefully

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.005
maybe immediately recognize.

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:45.950
It takes the form a squared
minus b squared, difference of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.570
squares, and it's always going
to be equal to a plus b

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.530
times a minus b.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.590
We can factor this a squared
minus 4 and we can also factor

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.010
this a squared minus 1, and
that'll help us actually

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.370
simplify the expression or
simplify the rational.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:10.400
This top part, we can factor
the a squared minus 4 as a

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.300
plus 2-- 2 squared is 4-- times
a minus 2, and then that

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.550
times a plus 1.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.650
Then in the denominator, we can
factor a squared minus 1--

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.540
let me do that in a
different color.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.290
a squared minus 1 we can
factor as a plus 1

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.110
times a minus 1.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.620
If you ever want to say, hey,
why does this work?

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.640
Just multiply it out and you'll
see that when you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.120
multiply these two things, you
get that thing right there.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.020
Then in the denominator, we
also have an a plus 2.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.400
We've multiplied it, we've
factored out the numerator, we

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.980
factored out the denominator.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.640
Let's rearrange it
a little bit.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.690
So this numerator, let's put the
a plus 2's first in both

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.820
the numerator and
the denominator.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.550
So this, we could get a plus 2
in the numerator, and then in

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.460
the denominator, we also
have an a plus 2.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.490
In the numerator, we took
care of our a plus 2's.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.270
That's the only one that's
common, so in the numerator,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.200
we also have an a minus 2.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.690
Actually, we have an
a plus 1-- let's

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.970
write that there, too.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.240
We have an a plus 1
in the numerator.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.510
We also have an a plus
1 in denominator.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.770
In the numerator, we have
an a minus 2, and in the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.680
denominator, we have
an a minus 1.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.550
So all I did is I rearranged
the numerator and the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.740
denominator, so if there was
something that was of a

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.270
similar-- if the same expression
was in both, I just

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.420
wrote them on top of each
other, essentially.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.430
Now, before we simplify, this is
a good time to think about

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.120
the domain or think about the
a values that aren't in the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.200
domain, the a values that would
invalidate or make this

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.550
expression undefined.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.880
Like we've seen before, the a
values that would do that are

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.570
the ones that would make the
denominator equal 0.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.320
So the a values that would make
that equal to 0 is a is

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.960
equal to negative 2.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.920
You could solve for i.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.040
You could say a plus 2 is equal
to 0, or a is equal to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.400
negative 2.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.040
a plus 1 is equal to 0.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.300
Subtract 1 from both sides.
a is equal to negative 1.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.920
Or a minus 1 is equal to 0.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.060
Add one to both sides, and
you get a is equal to 1.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.080
For this expression right here,
you have to add the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:30.520
constraint that a cannot equal
negative 2, negative 1, or 1,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.030
that a can be any real number
except for these.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.110
We're essentially stating
our domain.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.730
We're stating the domain is all
possible a's except for

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.970
these things right here, so we'd
have to add that little

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.010
caveat right there.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.000
Now that we've done that,
we can factor it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.715
We have an a plus 2
over an a plus 2.

00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:51.700
We know that a is not going to
be equal to negative 2, so

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.000
that's always going
to be defined.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.220
When you divide something
by itself, that is

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.250
going to just be 1.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.900
The same thing with the a plus
1 over the a plus 1.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.330
That's going to be 1.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.790
All you're going to be left
with is an a minus 2

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.590
over a minus 1.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.200
So the simplified rational is a
minus 2 over a minus 1 with

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.790
the constraint that a cannot
equal negative 2,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.079
negative 1, or 1.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.610
You're probably saying, Sal,
what's wrong with it equaling,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.970
for example, negative 1 here?

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.145
Negative 1 minus 1, it's only
going to be a negative 2 here.

00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:26.460
It's going to be defined.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.690
But in order for this expression
to really be the

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.400
same as this expression up here,
it has to have the same

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.950
constraints.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.530
It has to have the
same domain.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.450
It cannot be defined at negative
1 if this guy also is

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.930
not defined at negative 1.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.070
And so these constraints
essentially ensure that we're

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.070
dealing with the same
expression, not one that's

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.740
just close.
