00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.150
Write 18% as a decimal and as
a fraction in simplest form.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.550
So let's do it as a decimal
first. So 18% is the same

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.050
thing as 18 per 100,
or 18 per cent.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.230
I'm actually separating out the
percent, it's only going

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.460
to be one word, but
I'm writing it as,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.120
literally, per cent.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.120
Cent means the same
thing as 100.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.130
So this literally means
18 per 100.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.580
Actually, I said I would do the
decimal first, but we can

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.180
start putting it into a fraction
first. 18 per 100 as

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.790
a fraction literally
means 18/100.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.235
We're literally doing the
fraction first. This literally

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:48.270
means 18 per 100, or
18 hundredths.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.830
From here we can go straight
to a decimal or we could do

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.570
this fraction in
simplest form.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.470
Let's do the decimal first, just
because that's actually

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.800
what I said I would do first.
Let's do that first. This is

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.710
the same thing as
18 hundredths.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.100
And we know how to write
that in decimal form.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.230
It's 0.18.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.030
You could view this as 1 tenth
and 8 hundredths, which is the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.410
same thing, or 10 hundredths and
8 hundredths, which is 18

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.260
hundredths.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.470
So this is written
in decimal form.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.795
And if we write it as a
simplified fraction, we need

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:29.800
to see if there is a common
factor for 18 and 100.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.750
And they're both even numbers,
so we know they're both

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.300
divisible by 2, so let's divide
both the numerator and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.300
the denominator by 2.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.260
So we have 18 divided by 2
over 100 divided by 2.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.390
And we're going to get
18 divided by 2 is 9.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.840
100 divided by 2 is 50.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.700
And I don't think these guys
share any common factors.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.310
50 is not divisible by 3.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.880
9 is only divisible
by 3 and 1 and 9.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.050
So this is the fraction
in simplest form.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.420
So we have 18% is the same thing
as 0.18, which is the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.889
same thing, in simplest
form, as 9/50.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.780
Now, I went through a lot of
pain here to show you that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.520
this really just comes
from the word, from

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.440
percent, from per 100.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.990
But if you ever were to see this
in a problem, the fast

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.010
way to do this is to immediately
say, OK, if I have

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.910
18%, you should immediately say,
anything in front of the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.950
percent-- that's that anything,
whatever this

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.060
anything is-- it should be
equal to that anything.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.250
In this case it's 18/100.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.180
And another way to think
about it, you could

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.920
view this as 18.0%.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.530
I just added a trailing zero
there, just so that you see

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.970
the decimal, really.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.810
But if you want to express this
as a decimal without the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.770
percent, you just move
the decimal to

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.720
the left two spaces.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.200
So if we move the decimal to the
left two spaces, one, two,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.400
this becomes 0.18.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.700
Or you could immediately
say that 18% as

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.640
a fraction is 18/100.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.240
When you put it in simplified
form, it's 9/50.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.060
But you should also see that
18/100, and we have seen this,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.180
is the exact same thing as
18 hundredths, or 0.18.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.770
Hopefully, this made some
connections for you and didn't

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.490
confuse you.
