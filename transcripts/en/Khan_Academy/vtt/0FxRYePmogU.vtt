00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.970
In the second Geithner video,
I lay out a scenario where a

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.400
bank could-- let me draw
its balance sheet.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.840
Let's say-- oh, that's not
how I wanted to do it.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.170
Let's say this is a bank.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.476
It's holding-- let me draw its
assets and liabilities.

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:23.790
So it's holding some toxic
asset A right here.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.210
And that could be the bank's
equity, that's its

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.700
liabilities, And this is the
other assets for the bank.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.270
So it could hold some toxic
asset A, and we lay out a

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.640
scenario where, what the bank
could do, right now it has

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.380
100% exposure to A.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.310
What it could do is it could
take a little bit of cash,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.530
lend it to another party.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.635
Let's say it could lend it to a
hedge fund, so this becomes

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:47.310
a loan to the hedge fund.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.190
So now the hedge fund owes this
money to our bank and it

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.430
now has the cash on
its balance sheet.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.620
So this would now, instead of
being cash, it'll be called

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.470
loan to hedge fund.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.670
Now this is the hedge fund's
balance sheet.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.380
Its liability is
loan from bank.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.740
And now it has this cash, and
then it could use this cash to

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.540
invest in essentially the Legacy
Loans Program, the

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.560
public-private investor Legacy
Loans Program that Geithner

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.480
talks about.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.070
And if they did this, they could
take this-- let's say

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.900
this was $7.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.400
They could take this $7,
contribute it to the equity in

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.420
the program.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.210
The Treasury would contribute
another $7.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.205
The Fed would contribute $84,
and then they would have $100,

00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:50.150
and I know this is kind of
messy, but they would have

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.600
$100 that they can then use
to go buy these assets.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.810
And the net effect of this is
that this bank went from

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.570
having 100% exposure to this
toxic asset to having only $7

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.880
exposure through this loan to
this hedge fund, or this

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.770
special-purpose entity, or
whatever you want to call it.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.820
And I got a couple of emails,
even from some colleagues, to

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.340
say, well, can this
really be done?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.420
And my kind of knee-jerk
reaction was, well, if this

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.930
can't be done, they'll figure
out a way to do it, because

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.500
there's billions of dollars
at stake, and really, the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.320
incentive here is structured
to do it.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.860
And frankly, the Government
probably wants them to do it,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.300
because on some level, even
though this would be a massive

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.280
transfer of exposure and wealth
from the taxpayers to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.650
the banks, it would on some
level solve the problem.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.630
And if people really aren't
aware of it, everyone will be

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.310
happy about it, because all of
these banks, Citibank and Bank

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.420
of America, will just survive,
and they can just kind of say

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.880
that all's well.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.250
So what I wanted to do, just to
answer those questions, is

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.590
get a little bit particular
about the wording.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.580
And I got an email.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.990
Leigh Logan actually emailed
me, and she highlighted one

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.280
clause in the Legacy Loans
term sheet that seems to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.500
address what I talk about in
that second video there.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.680
And this is from the Legacy
Loans terms sheet.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.990
It says: "Private investors
may not participate in any

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.920
PPIF"-- so this is that
Private-Public Investment

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.200
Fund-- "that purchases assets
from sellers that are

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.420
affiliates of such investors or
that represent 10% or more

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.550
of the aggregate private
capital in the PPIF."

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.210
So the question is what's
an affiliate?

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.790
And I looked it up in the
Securities Exchange Act of

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.750
1934, and there are multiple
definitions.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.050
But this is probably
the best one.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.110
It says: "The term affiliate
means any company that

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.720
controls, is controlled by, or
is under common control with

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.930
another company." And that's an
area that I just outlined.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.220
This bank really
doesn't control

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.650
this hedge fund, right?

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.540
They just essentially gave them
a loan with very little

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.220
stipulations on it, and then the
hedge fund can go do it.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.590
But, you could say, oh, well,
you know, there's nothing that

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.150
this bank could do to force this
hedge fund to buy these

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.190
assets, so maybe this
plan won't work.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.459
And another thing is what's
the definition

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.700
of the private capital?

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.040
You also can't represent
10% more of the

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.950
aggregate private capital.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.990
Frankly, when I think of private
capital, I think more

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.440
in terms of equity investments,
but maybe the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.670
definition of private capital
also includes debt

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.720
investments, although,
I doubt it.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.500
So in this video I want to
lay out a scenario that,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.830
essentially, it can do the same
thing economically, and

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.850
in fact, the exact behavior
that they want in other

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.760
parties without being in any
way an affiliate of the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.670
counterparty and in
no way giving

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.820
capital directly to them.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.470
So what Bank A could do
instead-- let me redraw it.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.320
Actually, not Bank A.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.500
The bank that's holding
toxic asset A.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.760
And this is what I thought of
after kind of thinking about

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.300
it for about five
or ten minutes.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.780
You could imagine what the banks
will come up with when

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.130
they have billions of dollars
and careers on the line.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.260
So if you have a scenario where
you have this toxic

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.510
asset A, and you economically
want to do what I describe,

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.870
but you don't want to be an
affiliate and you don't want

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.990
to give the appearance of
self-dealing, what you do is

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.960
you sell credit defaults on A
that become supercheap, so you

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.420
have essentially $7 exposure
of credit defaults.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.160
Let me do it this way.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.780
So what you do is you sell
credit default swaps.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.190
So let's say you sell
$7 of exposure.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.430
So your liability right here,
is a seven-dollar CDS

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.710
exposure, and I'll go over
the economics of how

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.170
this works in a second.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.620
And you actually get some
of the income stream.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.900
It wouldn't even be accounted
this way.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.490
You normally just have to-- if
you're insuring $7 worth of

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.570
credit default swaps, your
liability isn't $7.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.260
You do the probability of
default and all that, so your

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.830
liability will probably be-- I
don't know, $1.00, whatever it

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.290
is, and you get some income
stream for it.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:14.530
But the general notion is that
you sell credit default swaps

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.710
on this toxic asset, on
A, for really cheap.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.970
And just so you know what a
credit default swap is, I've

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.400
made a couple of videos on it,
it is essentially an insurance

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.690
policy on a loan or on a
company, and if that company

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.380
or this loan defaults, you say
that you are going to pay up

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.350
essentially the insurance
amount.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:45.600
So what you do is you sell $7 of
credit defaults swaps on A.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.710
And just so you know, most of
these toxic assets that these

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.450
banks hold, these are assets
that they were the originators

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.000
for, and so, they're
very particular to

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.550
the individual banks.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.870
So a bank can definitely say I'm
selling a credit default

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.930
swap on A, and they know that,
in the end, when I kind of

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.910
outline this whole thing,
they'll be the main

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.670
beneficiary of it.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.420
So if you sell $7 of credit
defaults swaps on A, what

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.250
would I do?

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.010
Well, I'm a hedge fund.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.630
What I do is I buy those credit

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.240
defaults for really cheap.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.090
And then I invest in
the TALF, right?

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.250
So let's say I'm a hedge fund,
and I have two things.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:29.760
I have a $7 investment in the
TALF-- sorry, in this Geithner

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.800
Plan, and then I also have this
credit default swap, this

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.590
insurance contract.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.050
And just so you know, depending
on the price, you

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.920
pay a certain amount
every year.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.170
But the key here is that this
bank could sell it, if they

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.540
wanted to, for almost free.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.420
They could essentially
give away these

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.530
credit default swaps.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.820
So if that bank did it, then the
hedge fund's assets would

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.825
have the $7 investment in this
Geithner program, and then

00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:04.150
it'll have $7 of credit default
swap protection.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.350
Now what happens to
this hedge fund?

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.670
In the world where asset A is
worth a lot, they get all of

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.410
the upside through their
investment in

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.880
the Geithner Plan.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.330
That $7 investment gets
levered to $100.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.710
Let me actually draw
that again.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.510
So that $7 investment
is here, $7

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.550
capital, $7 from the Treasury.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:36.120
You have $86 from the Fed, and
they use this to give the cash

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.820
here, and then that goes
back here, and you're

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.970
holding toxic asset A.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.380
Now if toxic asset A ends up
being worth a lot of money,

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.140
then this is worth a lot, and
this is worth nothing, And

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.240
that's OK, because the hedge
fund essentially paid nothing

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.110
for it or paid next to nothing
for it, in which case,

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.970
everyone kind of works out
well in that scenario.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.260
On the other hand, let's say
that this thing is worth zero.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.820
Let's say that this
thing defaults.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.380
If that thing defaults, then
this investment is worth zero.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.060
But guess what?

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.140
The hedge fund had an insurance
policy, where this

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.070
guy was a counterparty.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.740
So he says, hey, this thing
here defaulted.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.720
I'm going to claim my insurance
policy, so this

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.720
guy's going to have
to send him $7.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.850
So it's economically the exact
same thing that I outlined in

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.600
the Geithner Two video, but in
this situation, these guys,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.560
it's almost an arms-length
transaction.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.380
But this bank can make that
behavior happen by essentially

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.810
going into the market and
selling credit default swaps

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.020
for this exact asset for
really, really cheap.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.540
And this is just the first
way I thought about it.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.620
There's other ways
you could do it.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.090
If you're just a separate hedge
fund and you own enough

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.000
of the shares in a bank, let's
say you owned all of the

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.580
shares of the bank or a good
percentage of the shares of

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.760
the bank, then you would also
have an incentive to go out

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.260
there and use the Geithner
Plan and lever up and buy

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:03.790
these assets.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.760
Another thing is-- I don't want
to get too technical --if

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.450
you kind of hold one of the
fulcrum pieces of debt, the

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.310
pieces of debt that are trading
at a discount, because

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.740
you're afraid that this bank is
going to fail, if you hold

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.350
a bunch of those assets,
you still would want to

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.070
participate in the Geithner Plan
and funnel money and use

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.280
the Government money to
essentially buy this asset A.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.630
I mean, the general theme here
is, if you have two people, if

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.500
this is the private world and
you have a scenario where

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:35.360
person A, if a transaction can
make $100 or he gets rid of

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.770
$100 exposure, and person B
essentially has a potential

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.640
loss of minus $7 of exposure,
there's a net transfer of

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.240
wealth here.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.190
You went from $100 of exposure
to $7 exposure for this guy.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.110
So someone is offloading the $93
of exposure to this stuff,

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.090
and that's the Government.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.670
The Government's only taking
the down side.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.100
So this is a huge subsidy of
exposure, and it depends what

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.860
these are really worth, if this
thing is really worth $30

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.680
and it's a $63 exposure, but
any time you have this, the

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.680
private sector is going to
figure out a way to make this

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.870
subsidy happen.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.940
And everything I've outlined
so far is if A is the bank

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.450
that has 100% exposure, all they
have to do is, through

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.460
whatever back-door scheme or
financial product or insurance

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.790
or whatever they want to do, or
loans that have very little

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.050
stipulations on it, they just
have to give this guy

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:40.390
essentially $7 of compensation
somehow that gets around the

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.930
Government rules, and then this
transaction will occur.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.740
And I hope it doesn't occur,
and it's very possible it

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.400
won't, because maybe I'm missing
something here, but

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.040
I'm just saying that everything
I understand about

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.280
the Geithner Plan is that
there's a huge incentive for

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.090
this to occur, and this is
frankly the only reason why

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.240
the plan would work.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.000
Because, as I outlined in the
other videos, for a private

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.020
investor who's not incentivized
in this way, the

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.380
put option that the Government
is giving them still is not

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.220
enough of a rationale to go from
paying $30 for an asset

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.510
to going to pay $60 an asset.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.930
So it won't work if this
behavior doesn't occur.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.900
The only way that the plan quote
unquote will work and

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.410
people will overpay for the
assets is if you have this

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.650
type of action going on.
