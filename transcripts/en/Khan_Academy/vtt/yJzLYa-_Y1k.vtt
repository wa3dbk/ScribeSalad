00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:06.443
Multiply (5a - 2)(4a^2 + 3a - 1)

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:09.659
So here we are multiplying a binomial by a trinomial

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.591
So the FOIL tool will not work here

00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:16.509
It would only work if you were multiplying a binomial by another binomial

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.292
So here we really have to rely on the distributive property. What we can do is

00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:26.592
we can distribute this entire trinomial onto the binomial. We we can multiply 4a^2

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:35.926
plus 3a -1 times 5a and then multiply (4a^2 + 3a -1) times -2.

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:47.592
So that would give us, let me do it this way. That would give us 5a times 4a^2 +3a -1

00:00:47.592 --> 00:01:05.328
and then we would have a plus -2 times 4a^2 plus 3a -1. I've just distributed this

00:01:05.328 --> 00:01:11.425
onto each term over here you see the 5a -2 each term is now being multiplied by this entire thing.

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:17.644
And now we can distribute the 5a onto this term. So we have 5a times 4a^2.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:26.194
So we can multiply the 5 times the 4 we get 20. a times the a^2 is a^3. Then we do

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:33.794
5a times 3a. 5 times 3 is fifteen. a times a is a^2.

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:42.042
Then we have 5a times -1, well thats just going to be -5a. Now we do this part,

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:51.542
Plus -2 times 4a^2. -2 times four is -8a^2. So we just did that...

00:01:51.542 --> 00:02:03.978
-2 times 3a is -6a. And then finally you have -2 times -1. Well a negative times a negative is a positive.

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:08.744
So that is postive 2 and now we can combine like terms.

00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:15.060
We only have one ^3 term over here. We only have the 20a^3. So lets just write that down.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.195
And then lets look at our a^2 terms we have a 15a^2 right over here and we have another

00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:31.960
-8a^2. So if I have 15 of something and I subtract 8 from that then I have 7 of that something left.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:44.945
So 15 minus 8 is 7. And then we have a -5a. And to that we're going to add -6a.

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:48.944
So we are already -5 and to that we're going to be another -6.

00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:56.043
We going to be 6 more negative. So that is -11a. And then finally we have this constant out here.

00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:59.678
We have this plus 2. No I'll show you another way to get this exact same answer.

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:03.661
We are done. We have simplified, and we have combined all our like terms.

00:03:03.661 --> 00:03:07.210
Another way to do this is just like doing the distributive property twice. But it's essentially

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.327
more analogous to how we multiply numbers. So if we do it like this we could take this

00:03:13.327 --> 00:03:23.993
expression up here. We could take 4a^2 plus 3a -1. And then multiply it by this second expression.

00:03:23.993 --> 00:03:29.361
So times.... and I'll write it in the same places.. and when I say places. I'm not saying

00:03:29.361 --> 00:03:34.211
powers of ten, I'm saying powers of a. So this is in the first a power of a space.

00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:39.794
So 5a, see we have first powers of a in this space. Minus 2 this is the zeroth power of a.

00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:46.761
This a to zeroth place instead of the ones place. This is the a to the first power

00:03:46.761 --> 00:03:51.580
instead of the tens place. And this is a to the square power instead of the hundreds place.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.894
Completely analogous to what you do when you learn to multiply numbers in the first

00:03:54.894 --> 00:04:01.560
or second grade. So let's multiply these. First we'll multiply -2 by this entire thing.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.728
Remember we're just essentially doing the distributive property. When I multiply -2 by this entire thing

00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:15.011
I'm doing this step right over here. So -2 times -1 is positive 2. And once again theres no a there.

00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:19.561
So I'm going to write this in the a^0 place or the ones place.

00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:27.578
So it's going to be positive 2. -2 times 3a. Well that is -6a. And it's going to be in the a place.

00:04:27.578 --> 00:04:35.725
-6a, a to the first power place. And then -2 times 4a^2, well that's just going to be -8a^2.

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:45.580
So this is-2 being multiplied by all of that gives me this. And then when I take my 5a and I multiply

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:54.480
it by -1 that going to be -5a. That's going to the a place, that goes under a like term.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.813
then 5a times 3a, 5 times 3 is 15 and a times a is a^2. So it goes under the other a^2.

00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:10.780
So it's 15a^2 and then finally 5a times 4a^2 . 5 times 4 is 20. a times a^2 is a^3. So you have 20a^3.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:26.813
And now you can just add it all up. And we get 2 plus nothing is 2. -6a -5a well that's just -11a

00:05:26.813 --> 00:05:33.197
We still have this plus 2 here. -8a^2 plus 15a^2 well thats going to be 7a^2.

00:05:33.197 --> 00:05:41.248
So plus 7a^2. And then you're adding this to nothing so you have 20a^3. And we got the exact same answer.

00:05:41.248 --> 99:59:59.999
Cause we really did the same exact thing we just wrote it in a different way.
