00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
We're asked to convert 10 to the second power,

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:08.104
or 10 squared, equals 100 into a logarithmic equation.

00:00:08.104 --> 00:00:12.817
Now this is saying, if I take base 10-- so I'll do 10 in yellow --

00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:19.770
I take the base 10 to the exponent 2, then I get 100.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.567
When you do a logarithm, it is really kind of the inverse of that,

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:25.840
it is really kind of the other way of thinking about it.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:37.361
A logarithm says: "what power do I have to raise the base to, to get 100?"

00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:45.372
So if I were to write log, base 10, of 100-- and I wrote the ten a little bit bigger than is typically done,

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:50.037
let me write it this way-- log base 10 of 100, this says

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:55.769
what power do I have to raise 10 to, my base, to get 100?

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.914
And we know from this, and probably you knew this even if we didn't have this written down,

00:00:58.914 --> 00:01:01.839
you would have to raise it to the second power.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.316
So this is equal to 2.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:11.838
So right over here we are saying in an exponential equation, the base ten, to the second power

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:15.505
is equal to 100. Here in the logarithmic equation we are

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:22.105
saying that the power that we have to raise 10 to to get 100 is equal to 2.

00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:27.371
So these are really saying the exact same thing.

00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:31.304
And just so you get the terminology right, this, in both cases,

00:01:31.304 --> 00:01:35.706
the ten is referred to as the base, this is the base,

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:39.234
and in both cases the 2, -- let me write it--

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:47.402
so in both cases the 2 is referred to, and I think you know this already, as the exponent.

00:01:47.402 --> 00:01:52.105
And then the 100 is what you get when you raise the base to the exponent.

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:56.105
So these are two ways of writing the exact same truth about 10 to the second power equaling 100.
