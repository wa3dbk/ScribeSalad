00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.140
Find the volume of a cube with
a side length of 8xy squared.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.600
So we have a cube right here.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.190
And they're saying that each of
the sides, for a cube all

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.430
the sides have the same length,
each of them have

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.240
length 8xy squared.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.980
So the length of this side,
maybe we call this the width,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.770
is 8xy squared.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.660
The length of this side, maybe
we can call that the depth, or

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.210
the length, depending
on how you want to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.460
label it, is 8xy squared.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.870
The height of this cube is also
going to be 8xy squared.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.540
A cube, all of the dimensions
are the same.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.770
Now, if you want to take the
volume of any a rectangular

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.170
prism, you'll multiplied
these three dimensions.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.200
You"ll multiply the
width times the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.390
depth times the height.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.070
Now, in a cube, these are
all the same dimensions.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.460
So you can just take this
dimension and multiply it by

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.940
itself three times.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.740
Or you could take it
to the third power.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:06.710
So the volume of this cube is
8xy squared, I could just

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.760
multiply it by itself three
times, or I could say to the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.130
third power.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.120
That's why raising something
to the third power is

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.510
called cubing it.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.060
Because you're essentially
finding the volume of a cube,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.550
where the thing that you're
cubing is the dimension of

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.160
each of the sides.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.910
Now, what's this going to be?

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.610
Well, when you take a product
and you raise it to some

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.950
power, that's the same thing as
taking each of the terms to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.760
that power.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.230
So this is the same thing as 8
to the third power times x to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.120
the third power times y squared
to the third power.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.760
And what's 8 to the
third power?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.690
8 squared is 64, so we'll
multiply 64 times 8.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.670
4 times 8 is 32.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.570
6 times 8 is 48 plus 3 is 51.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.430
So it's 512.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.650
So this is equal to 512 times
x to the third and y squared

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.760
to the third power, that's the
same thing is y to the 2 times

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.105
3 power, or y to the
sixth power.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.050
And we're done.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.380
We found the volume
of the cube.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.710
It's 512 x to the third
y to the sixth.
