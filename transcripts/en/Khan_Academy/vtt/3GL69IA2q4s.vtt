00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.850
Multiply and express as
a simplified rational.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.270
State the domain.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.500
We'll start with the domain.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.240
The only numbers that will make
this expression undefined

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.560
are the ones that would make
the denominator equal to 0,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.500
and those are the situation, or
that situation would occur,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.750
when either a, b, x,
or y is equal to 0.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.750
If any of those are equal to 0,
then we have an undefined

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.930
expression.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:34.200
We could say the domain is
all real a's, b's, x,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.740
and y's, except 0.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.080
Or we could be specific: except
a, b, x, and y can't

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.840
equal to 0.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.410
Or you could write this: given
that a, b, x, and y does not

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.210
equal 0, that none of them
can be equal to 0.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.310
These are just multiple ways
of stating the same thing.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.550
With that stated, let's actually
multiply and simplify

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.660
this rational expression.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.610
So when we multiply, you just
multiply the numerator and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.190
multiply the denominator, so
you have 3x squared y times

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.380
14a squared b in
the numerator.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:31.550
Then in the denominator, we have
2ab times 18xy squared.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.780
Let's see where we can
simplify this thing.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.220
We can divide the 14 by 2, and
the 2 by 2, and we get 14

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.280
divided by 2 is 7, and
2 divided by 2 is 1.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.880
We could divide the 3 by 3 and
get 1, and divide the 18

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.180
by 3, and get 6.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.890
Every time we divided the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.640
by 2, now the numerator and the
denominator by 3, so we're

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.650
not changing the expression.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.960
Then we can divide a squared
divided by a, so you're just

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.940
left with an a in the numerator,
and a divided

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.620
by a is just 1.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.810
You have a b over a b.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.060
Those guys cancel
each other out.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.020
You have an x squared divided by
an x, so x squared divided

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.920
by x is x, and x divided by x
is just a 1, so this becomes

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.100
an x over 1, or just an x.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.040
Finally, you have a y
over a y squared.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.220
if.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.945
You divide the numerator
by y, you get 1.

00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:27.990
If you divide the denominator by
y, you just get a y, and so

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.430
what are we left with?

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.410
We're left with in
the numerator,

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.645
these 1's we can ignore.

00:02:33.645 --> 00:02:34.700
That doesn't really
change the number.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.200
We have a 7 times a times x.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.800
That's what we have
in the numerator.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.600
In the denominator,
we just have a 6y.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.350
And we have to add the
constraint that a, b, x, and y

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.290
cannot equal 0.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.380
When you just look at this
expression right here, you're

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.690
like, hey, what's
wrong with x?

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.810
There isn't even any b here,
so it's a little bit of a

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.340
bizarre statement, but you say,
hey, why can't x or a be

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.200
equal to 0 over here?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.450
It doesn't make it undefined.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.790
But in order for these
to really be the same

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.570
expressions, they have to
have the same domains.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.750
Or actually, if these were
functions that equal them, in

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.875
order for that f of x to be
equal to this f of x right

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.320
over here, you'd have to
constrain the domain in a

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.040
similar way.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.220
This is a fundamentally
different expression if you

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.280
allow x's and a's.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.070
In this one, you can't
allow x's and a's.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.510
For them to be really the same,
you have to put the same

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.500
constraints on it.
