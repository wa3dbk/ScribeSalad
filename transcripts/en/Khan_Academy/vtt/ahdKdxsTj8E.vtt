00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.710
We're asked to simplify 5x
squared plus 8x minus 3 plus

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.390
2x squared minus 7x plus 13x.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.830
So really, all we have to do
is we have to combine like

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.490
terms-- terms that have x raised
to the same power.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.140
And the first thing we can do,
we can actually get rid of

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.170
these parentheses right here,
because we have this whole

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.470
expression, and then we're
adding it to this whole

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.980
expression.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.890
The parentheses really don't
change our order

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.230
of operations here.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.870
So let me just rewrite it once
without the parentheses.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:41.410
So we have 5x squared plus 8x
minus 3 plus 2x squared.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.190
If this was a minus then we'd
have to distribute the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.790
negative sign, but it's not.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.775
So plus 2x squared minus
7x plus 13x.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.670
Now let's just look at the
different terms that have

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.850
different degrees of x.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.170
Let's start with the x squared
terms. So you have a 5x

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.570
squared term here and you have a
2x squared term right there.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.235
So 5 of something plus 2 of that
same something is going

00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:05.480
to be 7 of that something.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.080
So that's going to
be 7x squared.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.420
And then let's look at
the x terms here.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.970
So we have an 8x right there.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.300
We have a minus 7x.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.900
And then we have a plus 13x.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.240
So if you have 8 of something
minus 7 of something, you're

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.700
just going to have 1
of that something.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.400
And then if you add 14 of
that something more,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.330
you're going to 15.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.910
So this is going
to be plus 15x.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.980
8x minus 7x-- oh, sorry.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.310
You're going to have 14x.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.800
8 minus 7 is 1 plus 13 is 14.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.655
Plus 14x.

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:42.280
That's these three terms.
8x minus 7x plus 13x.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.550
And then finally, you have a
negative 3-- or minus 3,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.580
depending on how you
want to view it.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.600
And that's the only
constant term.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
You could say it's x
times x to the 0.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.320
But it's a constant term.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.690
It's not be multiplied by x.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.590
And that's the only one
there, so minus 3.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.070
And we've simplified it
as far as we can go.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.750
We are done.
