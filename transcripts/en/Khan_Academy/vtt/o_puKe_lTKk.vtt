00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.380
Let's see if we can get a little
bit more practice and

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.890
intuition of what cross products
are all about.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.450
So in the last example,
we took a cross b.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.580
Let's see what happens when
we take b cross a.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.250
So let me erase some of this.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.230
I don't want to erase all of it
because it might be useful

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.590
to give us some intuition
to compare.

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:27.170
I'm going to keep that.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.285
Actually, I can erase
this, I think.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.100
So the things I have drawn
here, this was a cross b.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.530
Let me cordon it off so you
don't get confused.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.970
So that was me using the right
hand rule when I tried to do a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.140
cross b, and then we saw that
the magnitude of this was 25,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.320
and n, the direction,
pointed downwards.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.330
Or when I drew it here, it would
point into the page.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.650
So let's see what happens with
b cross a, so I'm just

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.000
switching the order.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.760
b cross a.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.090
Well, the magnitude is going to
be the same thing, right?

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.610
Because I'm still going to take
the magnitude of b times

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.720
the magnitude of a times the
sine of the angle between

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.100
them, which was pi over 6
radians and then times some

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.585
unit vector n.

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:37.930
But this is going
to be the same.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.830
When I multiply scalar
quantities, it doesn't matter

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.510
what order I multiply
them in, right?

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.030
So this is still going to be
25, whatever my units might

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.900
have been, times
some vector n.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.920
And we still know that that
vector n has to be

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.020
perpendicular to both a and b,
and now we have to figure out,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.080
well, is it, in being
perpendicular, it can either

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.050
kind of point into the page here
or it could pop out of

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.450
the page, or point
out of the page.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.570
So which one is it?

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.290
And then we take our right hand
out, and we try it again.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.560
So what we do is we take
our right hand.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.990
I'm actually using my right hand
right now, although you

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.920
can't see it, just to make sure
I draw the right thing.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.800
So in this example, if I take
my right hand, I take the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.400
index finger in the
direction of b.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.140
I take my middle finger in the
direction of a, so my middle

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.230
figure is going to look
something like that, right?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.310
And then I have two leftover
fingers there.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.610
Then the thumb goes in the
direction of the cross

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.060
product, right?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.025
Because your thumb has a right
angle right there.

00:02:45.025 --> 00:02:46.920
That's the right angle
of your thumb.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.770
So in this example, that's the
direction of a, this is the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.480
direction of b, and we're
doing b cross a.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.020
That's why b gets your
index finger.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.410
The index finger gets the first
term, your middle finger

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.010
gets the second term, and the
thumb gets the direction of

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.330
the cross product.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.280
So in this example, the
direction of the cross product

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.820
is upwards.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.840
Or when we're drawing it in two
dimensions right here, the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.440
cross product would actually
pop out of the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.340
page for b cross a.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.250
So I'll draw it over.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.080
It would be the circle
with the dot.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.790
Or if I were to draw it
analogous to this, so this

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.650
right here, that
was a cross b.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.150
And then b cross a is the exact
same magnitude, but it

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.420
goes in the other direction.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.486
That's b cross a.

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:44.020
It just flips in the
opposite direction.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.340
And that's why you have to use
your right hand, because you

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.240
might know that, oh, something's
going to pop in or

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.960
out of the page, et cetera, et
cetera, but you need to know

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.110
your right hand to know
whether it goes in

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.350
or out of the page.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.380
Anyway, let's see if we can
get a little bit more

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.900
intuition of what this is all
about because this is all

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.540
about intuition.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.320
And frankly, I'll tell you, the
cross product comes into

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.430
use in a lot of concepts that
frankly we don't have a lot of

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.590
real-life intuition, with
electrons flying through a

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.780
magnetic field or magnetic
fields through a coil.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.880
A lot of things in our everyday
life experience,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.430
maybe if we were metal filings
living in a magnetic field--

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.570
well, we do live in
a magnetic field.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.380
In a strong magnetic field,
maybe we would get an

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.600
intuition, but it's hard to have
as deep of an intuition

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.780
as we do for, say, falling
objects, or friction, or

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.310
forces, or fluid dynamics even,
because we've all played

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.440
with water.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.810
But anyway, let's get a little
bit more intuition.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.800
And let's think about why is
there that sine of theta?

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.180
Why not just multiply the
magnitudes times each other

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.520
and use the right hand rule and
figure out a direction?

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.170
What is that sine of
theta all about?

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:57.840
I think I need to clear this up
a little bit just so this

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.400
could be useful.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.390
So why is that sine
of theta there?

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.780
Let me redraw some vectors.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.200
I'll draw them a
little fatter.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:22.870
So let's say that's a,
that's a, this is b.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.500
b doesn't always have
to be longer than a.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.630
So this is a and this is b.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.850
Now, we can think of
it a little bit.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.550
We could say, well, this is the
same thing as a sine theta

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.650
times b, or we could say this
is b sine theta times a.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.200
I hope I'm not confusing-- all
I'm saying is you could

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.020
interpret this as--
because these are

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.090
just magnitudes, right?

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.950
So it doesn't matter what order
you multiply them in.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.790
You could say this is a sine
theta times the magnitude of

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.600
b, all of that in the direction
of the normal

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.630
vector, or you could put the
sine theta the other way.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.890
But let's think about what
this would mean.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.050
a sine theta, if
this is theta.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.410
What is a sine theta?

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.210
Sine is opposite over
hypotenuse, right?

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.450
So opposite over hypotenuse.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:17.470
So this would be the
magnitude of a.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.935
Let me draw something.

00:06:18.935 --> 00:06:24.160
Let me draw a line here and
make it a real line.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.400
Let me draw a line there,
so I have a right angle.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.370
So what's a sine theta?

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.760
This is the opposite side.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.110
So a sine theta is a, and sine
of theta is opposite over

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.150
hypotenuse.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.230
The hypotenuse is the magnitude
of a, right?

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.880
So sine of theta is equal to
this side, which I call o for

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.720
opposite, over the
magnitude of a.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.850
So it's opposite over
the magnitude of a.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.440
So this term a sine theta is
actually just the magnitude of

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.170
this line right here.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.220
Another way you could--
let me redraw it.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.940
It doesn't matter where the
vectors start from.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.540
All you care about is this
magnitude and direction, so

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.970
you could shift vectors
around.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.830
So this vector right here, and
you could call it this

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.880
opposite vector, that's the
same thing as this vector.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.610
That's the same thing as this.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.035
I just shifted it away.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.470
And so another way to think
about it is, it is the

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.820
component of vector a, right?

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.260
We're used to taking a vector
and splitting it up into x-

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.360
and y-components, but now we're
taking a vector a, and

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.140
we're splitting it up into--
you can think of it as a

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.350
component that's parallel to
vector b and a component that

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.430
is perpendicular to vector b.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:54.460
So a sine theta is the magnitude
of the component of

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.250
vector a that is perpendicular
to b.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.060
So when you're taking the cross
product of two numbers,

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.500
you're saying, well, I don't
care about the entire

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.100
magnitude of vector a in this
example, I care about the

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.330
magnitude of vector a that is
perpendicular to vector b, and

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.860
those are the two numbers that
I want to multiply and then

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.120
give it that direction
as specified by

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.090
the right hand rule.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.340
And I'll show you some
applications.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.390
This is especially important--
well, we'll use it in torque

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.290
and we'll also use it in
magnetic fields, but it's

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.500
important in both of those
applications to figure out the

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.610
components of the vector that
are perpendicular to either a

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.600
force or a radius in question.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.659
So that's why this cross product
has the sine theta

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.070
because we're taking-- so in
this, if you view it as

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.210
magnitude of a sine theta
times b, this is kind of

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.030
saying this is the magnitude
of the component of a

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.435
perpendicular to b, or
you could interpret

00:08:49.435 --> 00:08:51.060
it the other way.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:59.120
You could interpret it as a
times b sine theta, right?

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.400
Put a parentheses here.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.500
And then you could view
it the other way.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.610
You could say, well, b sine
theta is the component of b

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.710
that is perpendicular to a.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.110
Let me draw that, just to
hit the point home.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:16.800
So that's my a, that's my b.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.950
This is a, this is b.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.510
So b has some component of it
that is perpendicular to a,

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.190
and that is going to look
something like-- well, I've

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.480
run out of space.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.640
Let me draw it here.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:41.210
If that's a, that's b, the
component of b that is

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.760
perpendicular to a is going
to look like this.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.370
It's going to be perpendicular
to a, and it's going to go

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.580
that far, right?

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.230
And then you could go back to
SOH CAH TOA and you could

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.850
prove to yourself that the
magnitude of this vector is b

00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:59.650
sine theta.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.410
So that is where the sine
theta comes from.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.990
It makes sure that we're not
just multiplying the vectors.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.320
It makes sure we're multiplying
the components of

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.540
the vectors that are
perpendicular to each other to

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.650
get a third vector that is
perpendicular to both of them.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.310
And then the people who invented
the cross product

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.010
said, well, it's still ambiguous
because it doesn't

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.475
tell us-- there's always two
vectors that are perpendicular

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:22.300
to these two.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.050
One goes in, one goes out.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.340
They're in opposite
directions.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.950
And that's where the right
hand rule comes in.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.080
They'll say, OK, well, we're
just going to say a convention

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.195
that you use your right hand,
point it like a gun, make all

00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:34.410
your fingers perpendicular,
and then you know what

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.760
direction that vector
points in.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.830
Anyway, hopefully, you're
not confused.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.670
Now I want you to watch
the next video.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.890
This is actually going to be
some physics on electricity,

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.400
magnetism and torque, and
that's essentially the

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.250
applications of the cross
product, and it'll give you a

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.770
little bit more intuition
of how to use it.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.470
See you soon.
