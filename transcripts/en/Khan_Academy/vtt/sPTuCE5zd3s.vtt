00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.380
Welcome back.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.460
We're doing the last part
of Problem 1 of the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.390
2008 Calculus BC exam.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.670
And I'll repeat the problem.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.800
It says, the region R models
the surface of a small pond.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.550
At all points in R at a
distance x from the y-axis, the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.300
depth of the water is given by
h of x is equal to 3 minus x.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.400
Find the volume of the
water in the pond.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.900
So we thought about, this is,
you know, a perspective drawing

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.950
of this, this is the surface
of the pond, right here.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.560
And I was trying to
draw the depth.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.480
So when x is equal to 0, the
pond is exactly 3, I guess, you

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.060
know, we could say feet, or
whatever the units are, deep,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.100
and then when x is equal to
2, the pond is 1 unit deep.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.340
And so to find the volume, we
think about it the same way.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.730
What does a cross section
at any point of the

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.040
pond look like?

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.430
Well if we, let's see.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.300
So if we were to take a cross
section, so let's say that

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.970
this, let's take this cross
section of the pond.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.230
Let me do it in a different
color, I know it can

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.560
be kind of confusing.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.610
That's not too different.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.110
So that's green.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.480
So the height along the surface
of the pond is going to be the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.730
difference between
the two functions.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.220
And we know that the top
function is sine of pi x, and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.990
we know that this bottom
function is x to the

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.280
third minus 4x.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.530
So if I were to draw, let
me see if I can draw

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.030
this cross section.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.730
So we know this the height,
sorry, the width along the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.410
surface of this cross section
is going to be the difference

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.460
between this function and
this function, right?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.850
So if I were to draw, let me
see if I can, so this is that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.790
same cross section, it's the
width along the top, I know I'm

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.120
confusing you, is going to be
this function minus

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.870
this function.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:15.580
It's going to be sine of pi x
minus x to the third minus 4x.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.200
And what's going to be
the height, right here?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.020
Well, they told us.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.400
The height of the pond, or
the depth of the pond, at

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.630
any point, is 3 minus x,
whatever x value we're at.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.720
So this is going
to be 3 minus x.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.450
So the area of this cross
section of the pond is going to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:45.010
be sine of pi x minus x to the
third minus four x times the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.110
depth of the pond, right?

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.410
That's the surface
width times the depth.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.470
So that times 3 minus x.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.610
So that's the area of
each cross section.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.630
So we want the volume for
the entire pond, we take

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.150
essentially the volume of
each of these kind of

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.950
slivers of the pond.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.730
So we take the area of each
cross section, and we multiply

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.060
it by a very small width to
get a very small sliver.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.240
So we take that and multiply
it by dx, and we integrate.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.720
We sum up all of these slivers
of the pond from x is equal

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.260
to 0 to x is equal to 2.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.680
So let's do that.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.660
Let's integrate from x is equal
to 0 from x is equal to 2.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.410
Once again, this is a
really hard integral.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.930
Or it's something that you can
do, especially if you use

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.440
integration by parts, but it's
a little bit messy, and you

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.170
only have 45 minutes to do all
three problems on the BC exam,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.890
so I'm assuming that they want
you to use the calculator here.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.970
So let's use the calculator
to evaluate it.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.080
So let's see.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.480
So this was part c that we
already have in our calculator.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.660
We could do second enter, and
we'll get the previous entry.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.236
Second enter.

00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:02.020
Because we already typed
in a bunch of stuff.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.350
The only difference between
what we did in Part C and now

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.590
is, now, instead of having in
Part C, we had this

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.960
expression squared.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.575
Now, we don't have it squared,
but we're multiplying

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:14.355
it by times 3 minus x.

00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:16.660
So let's do that.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.970
So if we go here, we can
delete this squared.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.710
We're not squaring it anymore.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.660
Deleted.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.420
And now let's do, I want
you to see my key strokes.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.590
So let's do second insert.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:40.180
So let's insert times 3
minus x close parentheses.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.000
And so, let's see.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.450
We have sine of pi x minus x
to the third plus 4x, right,

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.840
that's the same thing as this.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.160
Times 3 minus x.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.810
And our variable of integration
is x, and we're integrating

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.520
from x is equal to zero
to x is equal to 2.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.550
Let's hit enter.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.980
And it noticed, it
is calculating.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.760
And our answer is 8.37, I
think, is a fair answer.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.470
So the volume this time,
the volume of the pond,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.090
is equal to 8.37.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.270
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.250
I will, every day, try to do
a couple of these problems.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.340
See you in the next video.
