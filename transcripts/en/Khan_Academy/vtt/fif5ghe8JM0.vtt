This is Sal here and I'm at Stanford Medical School with Dr. Andy Connelly.

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:10.240
Hi there Sal, I'm here to discuss with you histology today.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.745
Histology! And, and forgive me, for what is probably a simple question, but what is histology?

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:20.178
So it will be the -ology, the study of, in this case the histo-, means tissues.

00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:28.800
We're going to be looking up the cellular components of organs.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.300
Cool... yeah.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.578
So what we're going to be looking at today is the histology of the colon.

00:00:32.578 --> 00:00:39.683
And so for the colon we often have colon specimens coming in from pathology.

00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:45.813
And so the colon, like you were saying before, is the large intestine.

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:53.150
So if you have this piece of large intestine, and its removed from the patient because there is an area

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.451
of cancer.

00:00:54.451 --> 00:01:01.324
It might be cancer, they're actually pretty good now about doing colonoscopy.

00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:03.460
Looking from the inside--

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.637
They'll often have looked inside think it looks like cancer

00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:12.795
take a little piece and send it to us before hand, and then they remove it.

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:15.488
And the reason why they want to send it to you is

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:18.089
even if they know its cancer how severe is this cancer?

00:01:18.089 --> 00:01:22.686
How severe is the cancer? They also want to get a really good tissue diagnosis

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:28.027
to make sure if they're going to go remove a piece of your colon, that they really know that its cancer

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:30.349
rather than it just looks like cancer.

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:32.485
So its the definitive proof before they remove it.

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:38.011
So then if this is the cancer that's removed they clearly want to be able to check the margins

00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:41.773
to make sure its removed in its entirety.

00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:46.417
But often inside of there, they'll find other pieces of tissues, like here's a polyp

00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:50.597
And when we say check the margins, this is literally, just making sure

00:01:50.597 --> 00:01:53.197
you've covered enough material so that you've gotten all the cancer in it

00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:56.030
that you're not kind of cutting through the cancer and that you've missed something.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.445
That's right, because this is actually one of the traditional

00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:01.464
surgical cures of cut it out to cure.

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:04.296
Colon cancer, that tends to still be the case.

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:07.036
Because you cut it out to make sure you cure it.

00:02:07.036 --> 00:02:09.916
There are many other kinds of cancers that which spread so widely early on

00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:12.238
that you don't usually cut out.

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:17.625
So then the polyp can be found in a piece of colon removed

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:20.458
a polyp is something that just sticks up.

00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:23.940
Any tissue that sticks up. It's not necessarily cancer.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.677
No, so for instance another common place you hear about is

00:02:28.677 --> 00:02:30.953
some people in the sinuses might have sinus trouble

00:02:30.953 --> 00:02:32.903
and they'll have a sinus polyp

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:34.947
those are almost always just inflamed.

00:02:34.947 --> 00:02:40.705
And then we'll find areas in which it's just the lining

00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:43.167
that's been roughened, and we'll take sections of those.

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:46.835
And that can happen from just someone being allergic to food

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:48.832
Yeah, irritations of such.

00:02:48.832 --> 00:02:51.108
Yes, irritations of certain sites.

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:54.544
So we're going to have the areas where its kind of irritated

00:02:54.544 --> 00:02:56.774
some in which there's a polyp sticking out

00:02:56.774 --> 00:02:59.328
and we'll look at it under a microscope

00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:02.439
and then that's the thing that we're mainly worried about

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.479
So that's what we're going to cover in the slides

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.616
that we look at today.

00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:11.170
So this first one we're looking at is an example of

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.842
a normal margin

00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:14.792
And so it's from a little piece

00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:16.139
from the edge

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.832
So they actually call the tissue margin?

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:20.040
Yeah, tissue margin

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.805
Normal tissue.

00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:25.613
So this is the edge of the specimen, and [the surgeons will] say, "Is the margin clear?"

00:03:25.613 --> 00:03:29.049
Dr: In this case this is an example where the margin IS clear.

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.814
This is normal-looking colon.

00:03:30.814 --> 00:03:34.808
S: This is a cross-section, crossing the boundary of the colon,

00:03:34.808 --> 00:03:43.306
this area at the top right here, would be the inside of the colon, where the poop is...

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:51.665
Dr: Doctors say stool. That's the stool in the middle, and the supportive tissue is underneath.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:53.941
S: Part of the structural tissue of the tube?

00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:59.328
Dr: Right. Now let's drive around the slide.

00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:04.622
This is a virtual slide where we took the typical glass microscope slide, and put it in a special

00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:09.452
machine which took lots and lots of photographs at high power, then stitched them all together

00:04:09.452 --> 00:04:13.214
as one massive image. So that allows you to zoom in and look around.

00:04:13.214 --> 00:04:16.511
S: To let me get my own bearings, this polyp...

00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:20.690
Dr: No, this is just regular tissue--a little bit of a fold, not a polyp.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.102
S: So how large is this, about a centimeter?

00:04:25.102 --> 00:04:31.464
Dr: About like that. If I had to guess, about 5-6mm.

00:04:31.464 --> 00:04:43.167
So, now to drive around, these are the controls for zooming in and out.

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:55.288
So I can look at something more closely, and this is the mucosa.

00:04:55.288 --> 00:04:57.935
S: Mucosa. Sounds very similar to mucus.

00:04:57.935 --> 00:05:03.369
Dr: Right. The mucosa is the lining that makes the mucus, it's the slimy part.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:07.270
S: This white stuff up here?

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:16.418
Dr: This suff is the slimy mucus. So, it keeps the insides from drying out--

00:05:16.418 --> 00:05:21.666
because it's a very hydrated gel. It also means that things can glide along without

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:25.613
abrading the surface. When you look at it, it has architecture in which

00:05:25.613 --> 00:05:36.016
these glands, they're like test-tubes sticking down, and the purpose is to increase the surface area.

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:42.285
S: And the term gland, is any structure containing fluid and releases the fluid?

00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:49.066
Dr: A gland is an epithelial structure, so it's made of cells that are packed tightly,

00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:54.220
and the cells have a top and a bottom, and they're formed into some sort of enfolding

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.285
or structure, so that there is a middle and an outside.

00:05:57.285 --> 00:06:04.112
S: When we say something is epithelial, it's the stuff facing the outside world?

00:06:04.112 --> 00:06:09.824
Dr: Yes. The epithelium is a special class of cells in which they are facing the outside world,

00:06:09.824 --> 00:06:13.168
again, tightly packed, and there's a top and a bottom.

00:06:13.168 --> 00:06:19.437
S: And even though to a layperson this area right here does not seem like the outside world,

00:06:19.437 --> 00:06:21.806
it seems like it's inside of you, we're kind of like big donuts.

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:27.239
Dr: That's right. And the colonoscopist proves that it's connected to the outside world.

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:29.793
S: MUAHAHA!! I guess they do prove that! XD

00:06:29.793 --> 00:06:40.428
Dr: So that's still the outside world. This is the architecture where you have enfoldings to increase

00:06:40.428 --> 00:06:42.843
the surface area. And it's creating this mucus.

00:06:42.843 --> 00:06:50.831
Let me look at the highest power. Look at these cells! When we look at these cells,

00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:56.914
there are two main types of cells. There's this one here, which is the goblet cell.

00:06:56.914 --> 00:07:05.691
S: Goblet cell. It's not just this white part, it goes all the way down there?

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:13.075
Dr: Yeah...let me have that pen! It has a top like that, and you see this wine glass?

00:07:13.075 --> 00:07:20.366
S: It's literally shaped like a goblet! I was circling the wrong handle.

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:23.524
Dr: That nucleus belonged to some other cell.

00:07:23.524 --> 00:07:32.627
What's next to it is these thin cells here, which do not have all the mucus inside of them.

00:07:32.627 --> 00:07:35.367
These guys are the tall ones.

00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:39.685
S: Where you see only the nucleus? The white part is just the mucus inside the cell.

00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:52.781
Dr: Yes. Mucus is the term for either the overall structure or the material that is elaborated up here,

00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:59.608
chemically it is called mucin, and mucin is almost like that goo runners eat,

00:07:59.608 --> 00:08:02.813
it is just a lot of sugar holding a lot of water.

00:08:02.813 --> 00:08:08.014
S: I see. I guess it would be bad branding to call it Mucus-In-A-Bag. MUAHAHA!! &gt;:-}

00:08:08.014 --> 00:08:13.354
Dr: Exactly! So they stick with "goo". But this one has a lot of sugar, takes in lots of water,

00:08:13.354 --> 00:08:16.419
that is released and it forms this surface here.

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:19.159
S: To let stuff flow by.

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:23.246
Dr: What the other cell does is the other main thing in addition to letting things flow through,

00:08:23.246 --> 00:08:29.144
is to absorb water. So the idea is you do not want to release the 2L of fluid you have

00:08:29.144 --> 00:08:32.766
around every one of your meals. You want to get a lot of that back.

00:08:32.766 --> 00:08:35.042
S: That's one of the main functions of the large intestine?

00:08:35.042 --> 00:08:38.618
Dr: It is. It is a consolidation process to the stool. So you're going to absorb a lot of water

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:44.423
and doing it through these cells.

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:54.686
S: The mucin comes out here, and the water absorbed by parts without mucin, so right there.

00:08:54.686 --> 00:09:02.256
Dr: Yupperz. That's right. The two main functions of the colon are right there with those two cells.

00:09:02.256 --> 00:09:13.494
S: To get a perspective of where we are, the whole thing is about .5cm, what's our scale here?

00:09:13.494 --> 00:09:26.776
Dr: Our favorite scale-bar here is to look for blood vessels, for red blood cells,

00:09:26.776 --> 00:09:30.120
One right there, is 7micro- m in diameter.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.296
S: 7micro-m. A micrometer is a millionth of a meter, or 1/1000th of 1mm.

00:09:36.296 --> 00:09:41.219
Dr: That's right. Let's round off to 1/100th of 1mm.

00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:47.024
S: You put 100 of these next to each other you get 1mm. So 1mm would be bigger than our entire screen.

00:09:47.024 --> 00:09:54.826
Dr: Right. You see with these glands, 1mm would be this span, which we're saying is about like that,

00:09:54.826 --> 00:09:57.240
That's why from here to here it might be about 7mm.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:03.928
Dr: RBCs are found in just about every microscopic field, and they're always 7micro-m.

00:10:03.928 --> 00:10:16.513
When looking here, this is very well formed. You can see these tubular glands,

00:10:16.513 --> 00:10:20.646
just a hint over here, because they are like test-tubes, sometimes they're not going straight up and

00:10:20.646 --> 00:10:22.690
down, sometimes they look a little on an angle...

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:28.262
S: They actually are reaching the surface, we just don't see it based on the way it's cut?

00:10:28.262 --> 00:10:34.764
So this one right here, it was cut at an angle, so it looks embedded there in 2D,

00:10:34.764 --> 00:10:37.318
but in 3D we would see a full tube.

00:10:37.318 --> 00:10:43.820
Dr: Just to go back to the microscopy, we're seeing this because it's only 4microns thick,

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.185
and we're sending light through this tissue.

00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:53.293
So that's why you can get a cross-section that doesn't show you 3D. Very much 2D.

00:10:53.293 --> 00:11:03.928
S: Cool! So this is what a healthy margin tissue would look like?

00:11:03.928 --> 00:11:08.340
Dr: Yes, this is a healthy colon, so you would thankfully say on the proximal margin,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:13.727
which is up more towards the mouth, that's clear. You take another section like this from the distal

00:11:13.727 --> 00:11:17.999
margin, more towards the end, and you say that's clear, so that means they removed the cancer.

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:20.786
S: When you say proximal margin is close to the mouth,

00:11:20.786 --> 00:11:27.241
you're saying the mouth of that cut of the tube, not mouth of the person.

00:11:27.241 --> 99:59:59.999
Dr: That's right. So the proximal and distal margins are clear, if they look like this.
