00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:02.170
In this video, I want
to talk a little bit

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.264
about what it means
to be a prime number.

00:00:06.264 --> 00:00:07.680
And what you'll
see in this video,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.650
or you'll hopefully
see in this video,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.840
is it's a pretty
straightforward concept.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.097
But as you progress through
your mathematical careers,

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.680
you'll see that there's actually
fairly sophisticated concepts

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.030
that can be built on top of
the idea of a prime number.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.277
And that includes the
idea of cryptography.

00:00:22.277 --> 00:00:24.610
And maybe some of the encryption
that your computer uses

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.879
right now could be
based on prime numbers.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.545
If you don't know
what encryption means,

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:30.450
you don't have to worry
about it right now.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.410
You just need to know the prime
numbers are pretty important.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.092
So I'll give you a definition.

00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:38.050
And the definition might
be a little confusing,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.600
but when we see
it with examples,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.680
it should hopefully be
pretty straightforward.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.790
So a number is prime if
it is a natural number--

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.740
and a natural number, once
again, just as an example,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.130
these are like the numbers 1, 2,
3, so essentially the counting

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.020
numbers starting
at 1, or you could

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.450
say the positive integers.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:11.740
It is a natural number divisible
by exactly two numbers,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.240
or two other natural numbers.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.698
Actually I shouldn't
say two other,

00:01:14.698 --> 00:01:17.630
I should say two
natural numbers.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.870
So it's not two other
natural numbers--

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.190
divisible by exactly
two natural numbers.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.130
One of those numbers is itself,
and the other one is one.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.380
Those are the two numbers
that it is divisible by.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.740
And that's why I didn't
want to say exactly

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.120
two other natural numbers,
because one of the numbers

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.866
is itself.

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.490
And if this doesn't
make sense for you,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.030
let's just do some
examples here,

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.640
and let's figure out if some
numbers are prime or not.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.200
So let's start with the smallest
natural number-- the number 1.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.430
So you might say, look,
1 is divisible by 1

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.220
and it is divisible by itself.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.860
You might say, hey,
1 is a prime number.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.550
But remember, part
of our definition--

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.620
it needs to be divisible by
exactly two natural numbers.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.640
1 is divisible by only one
natural number-- only by 1.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.259
So 1, although it might be
a little counter intuitive

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.590
is not prime.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.680
Let's move on to 2.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.890
So 2 is divisible by
1 and by 2 and not

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.940
by any other natural numbers.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.150
So it seems to meet
our constraint.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.950
It's divisible by exactly
two natural numbers-- itself,

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.240
that's 2 right there, and 1.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.685
So 2 is prime.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.580
And I'll circle
the prime numbers.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.289
I'll circle them.

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:45.329
Well actually, let me do
it in a different color,

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.320
since I already used
that color for the-- I'll

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.220
just circle them.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.500
I'll circle the
numbers that are prime.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.630
And 2 is interesting
because it is

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.180
the only even number
that is prime.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.060
If you think about it,
any other even number

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.480
is also going to be
divisible by 2, above

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.860
and beyond 1 and itself.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.030
So it won't be prime.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.470
We'll think about that
more in future videos.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.480
Let's try out 3.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.582
Well, 3 is definitely
divisible by 1 and 3.

00:03:10.582 --> 00:03:12.790
And it's really not divisible
by anything in between.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.000
It's not divisible by 2, so
3 is also a prime number.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.700
Let's try 4.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.860
I'll switch to
another color here.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.080
Let's try 4.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.960
Well, 4 is definitely
divisible by 1 and 4.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.030
But it's also divisible by 2.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.200
2 times 2 is 4.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.490
It's also divisible by 2.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.730
So it's divisible by three
natural numbers-- 1, 2, and 4.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.680
So it does not meet our
constraints for being prime.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.720
Let's try out 5.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.270
So 5 is definitely
divisible by 1.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.740
It's not divisible by 2.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.900
It's not divisible by 3.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.149
It's not exactly divisible by 4.

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:58.690
You could divide them into it,
but you would get a remainder.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.860
But it is exactly
divisible by 5, obviously.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.350
So once again, it's divisible
by exactly two natural numbers--

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.280
1 and 5.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.586
So, once again, 5 is prime.

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:12.960
Let's keep going,
just so that we

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.340
see if there's any
kind of a pattern here.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.390
And then maybe I'll
try a really hard one

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.130
that tends to trip people up.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.350
So let's try the number.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.300
6.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.470
It is divisible by 1.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.940
It is divisible by 2.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.270
It is divisible by 3.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.190
Not 4 or 5, but it
is divisible by 6.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.290
So it has four natural
number factors.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.010
I guess you could
say it that way.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.940
And so it does not have
exactly two numbers

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.450
that it is divisible by.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.610
It has four, so it is not prime.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.480
Let's move on to 7.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.330
7 is divisible by 1, not 2,
not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.160
But it's also divisible by 7.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.020
So 7 is prime.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.640
I think you get the
general idea here.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.560
How many natural
numbers-- numbers

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.090
like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the numbers
that you learned when you were

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.490
two years old, not including 0,
not including negative numbers,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.340
not including fractions and
irrational numbers and decimals

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.250
and all the rest, just regular
counting positive numbers.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.270
If you have only two
of them, if you're only

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.140
divisible by yourself and
one, then you are prime.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.640
And the way I think
about it-- if we

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.540
don't think about the
special case of 1,

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.440
prime numbers are kind of these
building blocks of numbers.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.899
You can't break
them down anymore

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:34.190
they're almost like the
atoms-- if you think about what

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.606
an atom is, or
what people thought

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:36.990
atoms were when
they first-- they

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.860
thought it was kind of the
thing that you couldn't divide

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.190
anymore.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.850
We now know that you
could divide atoms

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.308
and, actually, if
you do, you might

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:43.540
create a nuclear explosion.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.790
But it's the same idea
behind prime numbers.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.750
In theory-- and in prime
numbers, it's not theory,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.380
we know you can't
break them down

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.370
into products of
smaller natural numbers.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.320
Things like 6-- you could
say, hey, 6 is 2 times 3.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.280
You can break it down.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.290
And notice we can break it down
as a product of prime numbers.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.740
We've kind of broken
it down into its parts.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.930
7, you can't break
it down anymore.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.346
All you can say is that
7 is equal to 1 times 7,

00:06:13.346 --> 00:06:15.720
and in that case, you really
haven't broken it down much.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.690
You just have the 7 there again.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.440
6 you can actually
break it down.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.302
4 you can actually break
it down as 2 times 2.

00:06:22.302 --> 00:06:24.760
Now with that out of the way,
let's think about some larger

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.910
numbers, and think about whether
those larger numbers are prime.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.870
So let's try 16.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.750
So clearly, any number is
divisible by 1 and itself.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.700
Any number, any natural
number you put up here

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.242
is going to be
divisible by 1 and 16.

00:06:41.242 --> 00:06:42.866
So you're always
going to start with 2.

00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:45.150
So if you can find anything
else that goes into this,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.060
then you know you're not prime.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.620
And 16, you could have 2 times
8, you could have 4 times 4.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.620
So it's got a ton
of factors here

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.720
above and beyond
just the 1 and 16.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.410
So 16 is not prime.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.340
What about 17?

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.500
1 and 17 will
definitely go into 17.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.700
2 doesn't go into 17.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.530
3 doesn't go.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.650
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10, 11--
none of those numbers,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.360
nothing between 1
and 17 goes into 17.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.130
So 17 is prime.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.920
And now I'll give
you a hard one.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.350
This one can trick
a lot of people.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.610
What about 51?

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.555
Is 51 prime?

00:07:33.022 --> 00:07:34.480
And if you're
interested, maybe you

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.390
could pause the
video here and try

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.060
to figure out for yourself
if 51 is a prime number.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.520
If you can find anything
other than 1 or 51

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.740
that is divisible into 51.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.130
It seems like, wow, this is
kind of a strange number.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.430
You might be tempted
to think it's prime.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.720
But I'm now going to give you
the answer-- it is not prime,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.030
because it is also
divisible by 3 and 17.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.420
3 times 17 is 51.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.045
So hopefully that
gives you a good idea

00:08:04.045 --> 00:08:05.590
of what prime numbers
are all about.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.260
And hopefully we can
give you some practice

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.738
on that in future videos or
maybe some of our exercises.
