00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.920
In the last video, we evaluated
this 4 by 4

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.400
determinant and we found out
that it was equal to 7.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.230
And the way we did it is we
went down this first row.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.870
We used the definition I gave
you in the last few where use

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.980
this first row.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.000
I could even write it here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.890
We said this is equal
to 1 times the

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.660
determinant of 0, 2, 0.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.520
1, 2, 3.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.440
3, 0, 0.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.950
Minus 2 times the determinant.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.440
You cross these guys.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.980
Cross that row and column out.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.310
1, 0, 2.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.970
1, 0, 2.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.750
2, 2, 0.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.770
0, 3, 0.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.180
And then we went to the plus
the 3 times its sub matrix.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.240
I don't have to figure
that out.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.150
Just cross out that row
and that column.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.950
And then minus 4-- just keep
switching the sign-- times the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.570
determinant of its sub matrix.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.410
So this one had a bunch of
terms. And this one's going to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.710
have a bunch of terms. Cross
that row and that column out.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.710
You get 1, 0, 2.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.930
0, 1, 2.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.000
2, 3, 0.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.710
I'll just write it here.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.600
1, 0, 2.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.130
0, 1, 2.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.770
2, 3, 0.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.610
And that is a completely
legitimate way to figure out a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.110
determinant.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.600
And that was our definition for
how to find a determinant.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.890
But I want to show you in this
video that there's more than

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.970
one way to solve for
determinant.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.550
What I'm going to show you this
way is the same thing

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.560
that we did down
this first row.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.000
We can actually do down any
row or any column of this

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.610
determinant, or of
this matrix.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.010
And the reason why that's useful
is because we can pick

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.040
rows or columns that
have a unusually

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.490
large number of zeros.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.350
Because that tends to simplify
our computations.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.100
So the first thing that you have
to do before you embark

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.070
on picking an arbitrary row or
a column, let's say, for

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.320
example, we want to pick this.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.390
Let's do one row and one
column in this example.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.580
So let's say we want to go down
that row instead because

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.150
we like the fact that has
a lot of zeros there.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.620
The first thing you have to do
is remember the pattern.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.210
Remember, you switch signs
on the coefficients.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.350
You don't just switch signs
as you go down a row.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.930
You also switch signs as
you go down a column.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.710
So the general pattern for 4
by 4 will look like this.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.450
It'll be plus, minus,
plus, minus, minus,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.380
plus, minus, plus.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.090
And then you get a plus, minus,
minus, plus, plus,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.950
minus, minus, plus.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.870
It's really this checker
board pattern.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.200
If you wanted to figure out
the sign for any ij.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.020
So let's say you wanted
to figure out the sign

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.170
for, this is 2, 2.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.360
So if you want to find
the sign-- let me

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.370
write it this way.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.670
Say we have a function, let
me define a function.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.570
I think the checker board
pattern's pretty clear to you,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.470
but I'll just write it down.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.760
Let's say I wanted to figure
out the sign-- the sign not

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.280
the trig ratio.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.820
I want to figure out the sign of
any entry where you give me

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.440
an i and a j.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.620
What you could do is you
just take negative 1 to

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.070
the i plus j power.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.190
So if you wanted to figure out
the sign for the, let's say,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.720
you are in row 4, column 2.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.040
Row 4, column 2.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.890
So what will it be?

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.550
Do 4 plus 2.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.990
Negative 1 to the sixth
power is equal to 1.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.850
That's going to be
a positive 1.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.840
Let's say you want
to take this guy.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.860
So this is i is equal to 2.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.350
j is equal to 3.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.580
We're in the second
row, third column.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.150
2 plus 3 is 5.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.160
Minus 1 to the fifth
power is minus 1.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.280
And you have a minus there.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.290
So that's another way
to think about it.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.640
But the checker board
pattern's pretty

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.650
straightforward.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.530
So now that you have the checker
board pattern in your

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.860
mind, let's go down this row.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.770
Let's go down this row.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.260
So we start with the 2.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.630
But notice that we have
to multiply by minus.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.090
Because we go plus, minus,
plus, minus.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.610
So you have a minus 2 times the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.480
determinant of its sub matrix.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.350
So you cross out this
row and that column.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.530
And you're left with this
matrix up here.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.490
So it's 2, 3, 4.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.050
0, 2, 0.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.650
1, 2, 3.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.960
This is a minus and then
you have a plus.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.880
So you have a plus 3 times--
get rid of this

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.370
guy's column and row.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.750
And you have 1, 1, 0.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.190
1, 1, 0.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.360
That's that right there.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.970
3, 2, 2.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.850
3, 2, 2.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.940
And you have 4, 0, 3.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.020
4, 0, 3.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.630
And then you would have a
minus a 0 times its sub

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.900
matrix plus a 0.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.560
But we can ignore those
because 0 times

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.910
anything is a 0.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.230
So already we've simplified our
determinant a good bit.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.950
So let's see if we can
evaluate this and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.170
get the same number.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.810
Because only then will it be
reasonably satisfying.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.410
So what's the determinant
of this guy?

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.360
Well we can do the exact
same principle.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.810
We can go down any row or
column that seems to be

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.240
especially simple.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.370
So let's go down that row.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.230
Because that row seems
especially simple.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.470
So this is going
to be minus 2.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.010
That's this minus 2 right
here times the

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.330
determinant of this guy.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.220
So the determinant of this guy,
we just have to go and

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.120
say OK we have a plus,
we have a minus, and

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.720
then we have a plus.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.192
It's going to be minus 0 times
its sub determinant, I guess

00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:13.740
we would call it.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.240
Get rid of that row or that
column and that row.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.910
So it'd be minus 0 times
anything, that's just going to

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.850
be 0 plus 2.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.560
So plus 2 times the
determinant.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.610
Get rid of its row
and its columns.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.140
2, 4, 1, 2.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.280
2, 4, 1, 3.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.830
And then you have a minus
0 times this thing.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.500
But who cares what that is
because you have a 0 times.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.630
So that just simplified
to that which is nice.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.000
Let me write it like that.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.940
And then you have plus 3 times
this thing right here.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.950
We don't want to do
the first row.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.520
We have no non 0 terms here.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.910
Let's at least do this
row right here for a

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.130
little bit of variety.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.300
None of the columns actually
seem that interesting.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.010
They all have, at most, one 0.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.730
So if we do that one right here,
this is a plus, minus,

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.270
plus, minus, plus.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.300
So we'll have a plus
0 times 3, 4, 2, 0.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.420
We can ignore that.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.900
Minus 2 times the determinant.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.410
Get rid of this column,
that row.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.420
I have to be very careful.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.880
I put this minus there, but
there wasn't a minus 1 there.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.240
Let me write it like-- I want to
make sure I don't make any

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.490
careless errors right here.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.970
This is a plus 1.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.070
I just drew a minus 1 there
to show you how

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.530
things switch signs.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.070
So this is going to
be a 3 times.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.060
So we're going to go down--
This is this 3 right here.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.090
I lost my bearings with
that minus there.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.950
We're trying to find the
determinant of this.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.340
So it's 0 times this matrix.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.650
We can ignore that.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.320
Minus 2 times its sub matrix.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.330
Which is that and that.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.320
So it's 1, 1, 4, 0.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.240
And then you have a plus
3 times its sub matrix.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.630
1, 3, 1, 2.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.070
1, 3, 1, 2.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.020
Just like that.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.130
Let's see if we can
simplify this.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.040
2 times 3 is 6 minus
1 times 4.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.220
So, this becomes 6 minus 4.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.350
So that's 2.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.780
So this whole thing simplifies
to 2 times 2 which is 4.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.100
4 times minus 2.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.470
The whole thing simplifies
to minus 8.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:31.230
Now, this guy right here, we
have 1 times 0, which is 0,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.730
minus 1 times 4.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.610
This is minus 4 times minus 2.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.870
This whole thing becomes
a positive 8.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.840
You have 1 times 2, which
is 2, minus 1 times 3.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.260
Which is minus 3.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.140
So you get a minus 1.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.220
So this becomes a minus--
I mean you get 2 minus 3

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.450
minus 1 times 3.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.960
So this becomes a minus 3.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.220
So you have an 8 minus a 3.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.333
So this becomes a minus five.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.050
You have a 3 times a minus
5 right there.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:12.700
So 3 times minus 5 is going
to be equal to minus 15.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.530
Let me make sure I got-- oh
I made a silly mistake.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.730
If you have an 8 minus a 3, this
is 8, this is minus, this

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.340
is going to be 5.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:21.900
Very easy.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.760
Your brain starts to get fried
if you do this long enough.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.510
And the you have a 3 times
a 5 and you get a 15.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.650
You get a 15.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.030
And then you have a 15.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:35.169
This term plus this term is 15
minus 8 which is equal to 7.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:39.500
Which, lucky for us, I barely
evaded making a careless

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.250
mistake there, we got
the right answer.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.190
But this is a much simpler
computation than we did in the

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.140
last video.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.450
And it was much simpler because
we picked the row that

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.880
happened to have a lot
of zeros on it.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.590
So we only had two of these
terms instead of four terms

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.170
like we had in the last video.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.770
And you could do the same, you
could pick columns that have a

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.590
lot of zeros.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.020
You just have to make sure
that you always use this

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.900
checker board pattern.
