00:00:01.056 --> 00:00:07.563
A bug starts at a vertex of an equilateral traingle. On each move, it randomly selects one of the two

00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:14.453
vertices where it is not currently located and crawls along a side of the triangle to that vertex.

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:21.419
Given that the probability that the bug moves to its starting vertex on its tenth move is m/n

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.501
where m and n are relatively prime positive integers,

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:26.652
find m + n

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:30.074
So this lesson right here where m and n are relatively prime positive integers

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:35.670
essentially says we have the positive version of this fraction in its simplified form

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.677
So let's just think about the problem we have an equilateral triangle here

00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:46.545
with three vertices

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:49.413
A B and C

00:00:49.413 --> 00:00:54.376
and our bug is going to start at lets say vertex A

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:57.745
So this is our bug right here

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:01.227
and on each move it will randomly select one fo the two vertices

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:07.260
So on its first move it will either go to vertex B or then vertex C

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.077
and then depending on whether it went there

00:01:09.077 --> 00:01:12.162
If it went to vertex C then on it's next move it wil either go to vertex B or vertex A

00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:18.877
if it went to vertex B on its next move it will either go to vertex A or vertex C

00:01:18.877 --> 00:01:22.118
So let's just think about it.

00:01:22.118 --> 00:01:35.004
We want to figure out the probability of it moving to vertex a on its tenth move

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.324
So let's just think about what happened in each move.

00:01:38.324 --> 00:01:42.469
The probability of moving toward on of the vertices in a given move

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:51.204
So let us say that we have move 1 over here in this column

00:01:51.204 --> 00:01:57.885
so we have vertex A,B and C

00:01:57.885 --> 00:01:59.669
so let's think about move one

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:09.604
On move 1 what's the probablilty of moving to vertex A

00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:14.204
Well you are already on vertex A and it says that the insect in going to go to one of the other 2 vertices

00:02:14.204 --> 00:02:19.787
So the probability on move one of moving to vertex A is 0

00:02:19.787 --> 00:02:21.720
What's the probablilty of moving to vertex B?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.021
Well it is going to be 1/2

00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:27.036
what's the probablilty of moving to vertex C?

00:02:27.036 --> 00:02:29.203
It's going to be 1/2 as well

00:02:29.203 --> 00:02:31.036
half a chance of going there and half a chance fo going there

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:35.704
Well obviously all of the probabilities have to add up to 1 because it's going to do something on that

00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:38.605
move. Now let us think about move 2

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:48.134
So what is the probability of now moving to vertex A?

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:57.682
Well there is a 1/2 chance that we are already at B. If we were already at B there will now be a 1/2

00:02:57.682 --> 00:02:59.983
chance of moving back to A

00:02:59.983 --> 00:03:04.462
So this is 1/2 times 1/2

00:03:04.462 --> 00:03:09.767
that's only the situation if we were already at B. If we were already at C

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:14.937
then there would also be a 1/2 probability of moving to A

00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:24.003
So this is going be the 1/2 chance that we were already at C times the probability that we move to A

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:32.133
So 1/2 times 1/2 = 1/4 + 1/2 times 1/2 = 1/2

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:42.417
So what is the probability of moving to B in the second turn? Now the only place other than B

00:03:42.417 --> 00:03:49.651
that the bug can move to is C in the second turn.

00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:54.402
This is because we know that at the end of the first turn the bug will not be at A

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:56.402
It will either be at B or C

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.668
If the bug is already at B there is no way that it will go back to B

00:03:58.668 --> 00:04:03.829
So the only situation is if the bug is already at C there is a 1/2 chance of that happening

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.317
so that is this number right here.

00:04:05.317 --> 00:04:10.233
So if the bug is already at C and that is the 1/2 probablility then there is going to be a further 1/2

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:12.184
probability that it moves to B

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:17.834
So it is going to be 1/2 times 1/2 = 1/4

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:21.168
Now what is the probability of moving to C? Well it is the same logic.

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:30.034
The bug is not going to be on vertex A after the first move there is a 1/2 probability that it is going

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:37.519
to be at B; and then if it is at B then there is a 1/2 probability that it will go to C

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:43.267
So this is going to be 1/4 as well

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:58.548
In general let's say that in move N the probablility of being at vertex A is

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.281
the probability of A

00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:06.116
The probability of being at vertex B is probability of landing on B at move N

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:12.032
and the probability of C is Probability of moving ot vertex C on move N

00:05:12.032 --> 00:05:16.331
Now let us think of the probability of being at each of these nodes on N+1

00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:29.031
So in order to get to A on move n+1, you either have to be at B or C. You cannot be at A and stay at

00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:29.631
A

00:05:29.631 --> 00:05:39.234
So the probability of moving to A in your n+1th move is going to be the probability of being at B times

00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:44.626
1/2 (right because if you are at B there is a one half chance that you are going to go to A) + the probability

00:05:44.626 --> 00:05:51.926
of being at C at the end of your last move times 1/2

00:05:51.926 --> 00:05:56.835
There is a half chance that if you are at C you will move to A. There is a half chance that if you are

00:05:56.835 --> 00:06:00.127
at C you will move to A.

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:01.759
Now what's the probability of going to B?

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.157
Well there are two ways that will get ot you B.

00:06:03.157 --> 00:06:05.376
You can start at A so you are going to start at A

00:06:05.376 --> 00:06:08.193
So the probablilty of being at A times 1/2

00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:12.775
or you could start at C. So it's plus the probability at C times 1/2

00:06:12.775 --> 00:06:16.309
If you were doing this problem in a situation that had time constraints you would not neccesarily have

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.298
to go through this, but I just want ot make it all clear.

00:06:18.298 --> 00:06:22.724
And finally what is the probability of landing in C at you n+1th term

00:06:22.724 --> 00:06:27.979
It's going to be the probability of being at A times 1/2

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:32.976
+ the probability of being at B times 1/2

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:37.242
So hopefully this makes the pattern of what is happening little bit clearer

00:06:37.242 --> 00:06:39.609
So no matter what A is going to be the average.

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:45.126
A in the next move is essentially going to be the average the probabilities of being at B and C

00:06:45.126 --> 00:06:48.692
And you can see that. The average of 1/2 and 1/2 is 1/2

00:06:48.692 --> 00:06:56.525
The probability of being at B in the n+1th move is going to be the average of the probabilities of being

00:06:56.525 --> 00:07:00.258
at A and C in the last move the average of 0 and 1/2 is 1/4

00:07:00.258 --> 00:07:06.074
and the same logic for C. The average for 0 and 1/2 is 1/4

00:07:06.074 --> 00:07:13.176
Now that will help me simplify things a little bit more for our brains

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:16.525
Let's keep going this way and let me continue the columns

00:07:16.525 --> 00:07:21.275
Rows A,B and C

00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:25.092
and now we are on move 3. I am just continuing it down here

00:07:25.092 --> 00:07:28.926
So what is the probability of the move being A in move 3

00:07:28.926 --> 00:07:32.376
Well we just said it's going to be the average of B and C and B and C is 1/4

00:07:32.376 --> 00:07:35.725
So the average of 1/4 and 1/4 is going to be 1/4

00:07:35.725 --> 00:07:38.491
What is the probability of being at B?

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:47.242
Well the average of A and C in move two is 1/2 and 1/4

00:07:47.242 --> 00:07:51.775
that's the same thing as the average of 4/8ths and 2/8ths

00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:54.126
that's 3/8ths

00:07:54.126 --> 00:07:57.391
and then we are going to get the exact same value for C. I think 3/8ths

00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:00.175
Another pattern here is that B and C are always going to be the same thing

00:08:00.175 --> 00:08:04.558
and since B and C are always going to be the same thing the average is going to be that value

00:08:04.558 --> 00:08:08.497
and it's going to be the probability of being at A in the next turn

00:08:08.497 --> 00:08:10.873
So let us just keep doing this

00:08:10.873 --> 00:08:14.006
and we can go all the way to ten but maybe we will see some type of pattern here

00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:21.222
So on out fourth move what is the probability of being at A? Which is the average of B and C

00:08:21.222 --> 00:08:24.473
So it is going to be 3/8ths

00:08:24.473 --> 00:08:28.806
So we can just take this value here and then what is the probability of being at B?

00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:34.089
Well it is going to be the average of A and C

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:44.566
and so let's see this is 4/16 + 6/16 = 10/16

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:52.773
and then we have to divide it by two which is 5/16

00:08:52.773 --> 00:08:56.155
Did I do that right? Let me just do this on the corner. I don't want to make a careless mistake here.

00:08:56.155 --> 00:09:06.324
1/4 is 4/16 + 6/16 and then we want to divide that by two.

00:09:06.324 --> 00:09:12.755
We are taking the average. So that's 10/16 divided by 2 which is equal to 5/16

00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:17.139
Alright so let me clear theis out so that I do not waste valuable real estate

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:20.606
Alright. So then this is also going to be 5/16

00:09:20.606 --> 00:09:22.790
because it's going to be the average of 3/8 and 1/4 as well

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:29.558
so it's going to be 5/16

00:09:29.558 --> 00:09:32.623
Now we are on move 5

00:09:32.623 --> 00:09:37.174
And we could keep going like this all the way to move ten but hopefully we willl see a pattern here

00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:45.768
So move five the probability of moving to A is going to be 5/16 the average of these two

00:09:45.768 --> 00:09:47.063
5/16

00:09:47.063 --> 00:09:50.318
The probability of moving to B (We can already see a pattern) it seems like we went from having

00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:52.341
2,4,8 in the denominator to 16 in the denominator

00:09:52.618 --> 00:09:56.216
I'm guessing that we are going to have to go to 32 in the denominator

00:09:56.216 --> 00:10:08.083
and so we are going to take the average of 10/32 and 12/32 and that is 11/32

00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:11.649
And this is also going to be 11/32

00:10:11.649 --> 00:10:23.130
Let's go to move 6 for A it's going to be 11/32 (it seems like the pattern is holding) this is going

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:30.345
ot be something over 64 and so this is the average if you multiply this times 4 you get 20

00:10:30.345 --> 00:10:39.948
and then this is 20/64 and this is 22/64 the average is going to be 21

00:10:39.948 --> 00:10:43.864
So let us keep extrapolating this and see if there is a way

00:10:43.864 --> 00:10:48.947
and we could actually just keep doing the math for 7,8,9,10

00:10:48.947 --> 00:10:53.829
Feel free to do that on your own if you are interested and hopefully you will get the right answer.

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:56.804
But let's see is you can spot a pattern here

00:10:56.804 --> 00:11:01.111
This is also going to be 21/64 move 7 for A is easy. That's just going to be the average of these two

00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:02.426
guys, 21/64

00:11:02.426 --> 00:11:04.400
But let's see if there is a pattern forming

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:11.478
So it looks like the (and remember the question is we just want to look at the probability of it moving

00:11:11.478 --> 00:11:14.013
to A on the tenth move.)

00:11:14.013 --> 00:11:20.095
and so if you look at A you start off with a denominator

00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:24.346
So this is 2 to the move minus 1. 1/2 to the move minus 1

00:11:24.346 --> 00:11:28.128
It looks like it's always cuz its 1/2 to the 0. This is 1/2 to the 1

00:11:28.128 --> 00:11:31.479
and you have 1/2 squared that's 1 less than three

00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:32.663
1/2 to the 3rd

00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:39.163
So it looks like if you fast forward to the nth move or even better let us fast forward to the tenth

00:11:39.163 --> 00:11:43.278
move. So 7, 8, 9 and 10

00:11:43.278 --> 00:11:47.329
This is not actually a lot of math to fill in. But let us just figure it out

00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:52.110
So 7,8,9, 10, this is going to be 16, 32, 64

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.206
This is going to be 128 if we go with the pattern

00:11:56.206 --> 00:12:05.646
This is going to be 256 and then this row over here is going to be over 512. So we actually already figured

00:12:05.646 --> 00:12:10.747
out the n part. And lets see is we can figure out a pattern for the numerators here.

00:12:10.747 --> 00:12:13.413
We went from 1 to 3 to 5

00:12:13.413 --> 00:12:18.278
So let us see 5 is 3+2 not 1

00:12:18.278 --> 00:12:26.041
Then we go, let's see you have 5 and it looks like you are taking 2times this and adding it to that to

00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:34.279
get that. 2 times 1 plus 3 is five. 2 times 3 plus 5 is 11. 2 times 5 plus 11 is 21.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:37.897
So let us just go with that

00:12:37.897 --> 00:12:50.915
So 2 times 11 is 22 plus 21 is 43 and then 2 times 21 is 42 plus 43 is 85

00:12:50.915 --> 00:13:02.798
and then this is going to be 86 plus 85 is let's see 85 times two is 170 so its going to be 171

00:13:02.798 --> 00:13:07.031
So if we believe what we just did we get out answer

00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:18.030
m + n = 171 +512

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.408
Which is let's see we are going to have two plus 1 is 3

00:13:22.408 --> 00:13:31.364
1 plus so this becomes ten and then we get 703. Wait I made a bone headed mistake on the addition

00:13:31.364 --> 00:13:34.272
Let me do that again

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:40.021
So 1 plus 7 is 8 not 10. I don't know why my brain was thinking that and then 5 plus 1 is 6. So we get

00:13:40.021 --> 00:13:44.355
683 as our answer

00:13:44.355 --> 00:13:52.356
So that is m + n and the probability of moving to vertex A on the tenth turn is 171/512

00:13:52.356 --> 00:13:54.838
and you can verify this for yourself

00:13:54.838 --> 00:14:03.689
Or we could even prove to ourselves is we are interested that each successive term here is really equal

00:14:03.689 --> 00:14:06.439
to the previous term times two times the term before that

00:14:06.439 --> 00:14:11.322
Actually for fun let us just prove it to ourselves

00:14:11.322 --> 00:14:15.123
So let us just say that this is the nth term

00:14:15.123 --> 00:14:24.972
Our probability of being at A is A/2^n

00:14:24.972 --> 00:14:30.090
and what ends up happening is that the probability of being at b and C let us call that B/

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:37.722
This power is always 1 higher power of 2. 2 ^n plus 1 and this right over here is also going to be the

00:14:37.722 --> 00:14:40.833
same probability 2/n+1

00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:45.623
Then on the nth + 1 term the probability of being at A is just going to be the average of these two guys

00:14:45.623 --> 00:14:49.872
which is going to be B times 2 to the n plus 1

00:14:49.872 --> 00:14:54.138
and the probability of being at, this is B

00:14:54.138 --> 00:14:56.373
this is C, this is A

00:14:56.373 --> 00:15:06.456
The probability of being at B is going ot be the average of 2A/ 2^(n+1) (I just multiplied the numerator

00:15:06.456 --> 00:15:14.671
and the denominator by 2) plus B/2^(n+1)and then all of that over 2

00:15:14.671 --> 00:15:24.488
So we are going to divide the whole thing by 2

00:15:24.488 --> 00:15:29.337
and that's going to be the same value for C. And actaully if we do a little math here this is going

00:15:29.337 --> 00:15:39.988
to be [2A + B]/[2^(n+2)]

00:15:39.988 --> 00:15:46.572
And so on the nth+2 move our value for A is going to be this thing right here

00:15:46.572 --> 00:15:50.339
The average of these two guys which is the exact same thing so it's going to be

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:54.872
[2A+B] / [2^(n+2)]

00:15:54.872 --> 00:15:58.238
So this verifies the pattern that we just thought about

00:15:58.238 --> 00:16:02.289
Our powers of two are increasing and so if we go two terms forward

00:16:02.289 --> 00:16:07.874
This term is = to 2 times 2 terms before plus the terms before. 2A+B

00:16:07.874 --> 99:59:59.999
So that is the pattern that we used and we can feel pretty good about the answer!
