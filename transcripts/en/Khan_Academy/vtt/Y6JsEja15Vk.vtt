00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.390
We have this system
of equations here.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.660
3t plus 4g is equal to 6.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.860
And we have negative 6t plus
g is also equal to 6.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.120
And there's a bunch
of ways you can

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.570
solve systems of equations.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.510
You can graph them.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.510
You can solve by substitution.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.350
Whenever you see the
coefficients on one of the

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.330
terms, in this case the
t term, they're almost

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.890
cancelable.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.780
And when I say cancelable, if
I add 3t to negative 6t, you

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.200
won't be able to cancel
them out.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.560
The t won't disappear.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.950
But if I were to scale the 3 up,
if I were to multiply it

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.070
by 2 and it becomes 6t, and then
I were to add these two

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.310
things, then they would
cancel out.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.420
And I would be left
just with g's.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.690
So let's try to do that.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.460
And now remember, I can't just
multiply this 3t by 2.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.240
In order for this equation to
hold true, anything I do to

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.870
the left-hand side, I have to
do to the right-hand side as

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.550
well, and I have to do it to
the entire left-hand side.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.570
So let me multiply this
equation by 2.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.940
So I'm multiplying it by 2.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.780
So let me just write it here.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.980
So I'm going to multiply
2 times 3t plus 4g is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.870
equal to 2 times 6.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.830
Anything I do to one side, I
have to do to the other side.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.610
The equality still holds true.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.840
So 2 times 3t is 6t plus 2 times
4g is 8g, is equal to 2

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.680
times 6, which is 12.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.340
So I really just rewrote the
same information, the same

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.740
constraint in this
first equation.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.450
I just multiplied
both sides by 2.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.640
Now, let me write the second
equation right below it.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.990
I'll write it in orange.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.450
So the second equation right
here is negative 6t plus g is

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450
equal to 6.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.510
Now, think about what
happens if I were to

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.740
add these two equations.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.840
Remember, I can do that because
I'm essentially adding

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.120
the same thing to both sides
of this top equation.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.720
Or you could say I'm adding the
same thing to both sides

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.120
of this bottom equation because
the other equation is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.010
an equality.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.860
This negative 6t plus
g, it is 6.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.070
So if I'm adding 6 to 12, I'm
really adding the same

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.800
quantity to the left-hand
side.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.180
That's why I can do it.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.640
So let's add the left-hand
sides together.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.870
When we do that, the
6t's cancel out.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.390
That was the whole point behind
multiplying this first

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.480
character by 2, so that the 3t
becomes a 6t, and we're left

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.440
with 8g plus g is 9g, is equal
to 12 plus 6, which is 18.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.040
Divide both sides by 9, and you
are left with g is equal

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.780
to 18/9, or 2.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.590
So we've solved for g.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.310
Now we can substitute back and
solve for t, and we can use

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.440
either of these equations.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.610
Let's use the second equation
right here.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.920
So we have negative 6t plus g--
we just solved for g; g is

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.610
2-- is equal to 6.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.360
And we can subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.190
Subtracting 2, the left-hand
side of the equation, that

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.180
cancels out.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.460
You have negative 6t is equal
to 6 minus 2 is 4.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.920
Now I can divide both sides of
this equation by negative 6.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.300
And we're left with t is equal
to-- what is this?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.550
t is equal to negative 2/3.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.240
And we're done.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.280
We've solved for a t and a g
that satisfy both equations.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.340
We just saw that it satisfies
the bottom one.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.460
If you want to feel good that
it satisfies the top,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.390
substitute them back
into the top.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.970
Let's do that.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.310
3 times the t we got, negative
2/3, plus 4 times the g we

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.890
got, so plus 4 times 2.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.050
Let's see what that is.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.650
3 times negative 2/3,
that's negative 2.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.040
The 3's cancel out.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.150
Plus 4 times 2 is 8.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.310
Negative 2 plus 8
is equal to 6.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.390
And that's exactly what that
first equation got us.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.010
So these two values definitely
satisfy both equations.
