00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.370
So we were doing part c of the
first problem on the Calculus

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.210
BC exam, the free response
part, and so what, I'll re-read

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.420
it, it says the region
r, this is the region r,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.610
is the base of a solid.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.190
I redrew the region r here, but
with a little perspective, so

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.930
we can hopefully visualize
it in three dimensions.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.590
So it says for this solid, each
cross section perpendicular

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.000
to the x-axis, right?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.750
There's two ways you can do a
cross-section, you could do

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.870
them, you could cut this
way, but that would be

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.040
parallel to the x-axis.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.210
We wanted to cut perpendicular
to the x-axis, or parallel

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.420
to the y-axis, right?

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.740
So if we cut it along
the line like that.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.500
So they say, each cross-section
perpendicular to the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.810
x-axis is a square.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.120
So I drew a couple
of squares here.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.250
That's one.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.270
So here, this would be the
base, and since we know the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.290
cross-section is the square,
the height has to be the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.710
same length as the base.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.660
Same thing here.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.790
So here, the height will be
really high, because this is

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.150
kind of maybe our maximum point
in terms of the base width.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.090
But it's still pretty wide,
then it gets narrow again.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.320
So how do we figure out
the volume of this solid?

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.140
Which is kind of
hard to visualize.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.816
And it's in some ways you
easier to visualize it than

00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:12.680
it is to draw, so you have
to give me some credit.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.830
But anyway, what we do is, we
take the area of each of these

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.960
squares, and I drew
one of them here.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.520
You take you each of the area
of each of these squares,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
multiply them by a super small
change in x, and that we know,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.770
from everything we've learned
in calculus hopefully, that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.180
that super small change in x,
I'm trying to draw a little

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.830
perspective, is dx.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.960
So if we multiply dx times the
area of this square, that is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.190
the volume of this kind of
part the entire solid.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.900
And if we were to sum up all of
these infinitely thin solids,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.830
we would get the volume
for the whole thing.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.540
So how do we do that?

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.850
Well let's write our
integral expression.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.350
So what is the area of
each of these squares?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.020
Each of these cross-sections,
what is the area?

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.090
Well the base is going to
be the difference between

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.520
our two functions, right?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.210
This top function right
here, that was sin of pi x.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.560
And this bottom function, right
here, that is y is equal to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.010
x to the third minus 4x.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.040
So the base of the functions,
the base of this distance right

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.560
here is going to be the
difference between the top

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.820
function and the
bottom function.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:42.540
So each base is going to be sin
of pi x, minus this function,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.580
so minus x to the third, plus
4x, right switch the sign.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.590
Minus x to the third, plus 4x.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.110
So far this might look pretty
similar to part a, but

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.280
what's the twist here?

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.980
We want the area.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.350
The area of each of
the squares, not

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.200
just this distance.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.940
So what's the area?

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.260
It's going to be this distance
squared, so we have to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.360
square this entire thing.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.090
So that's the area of each
of these squares, and then

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.740
we have to multiply them
times a little bit of dx.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.950
And that gives us the volume
for each of these, I guess,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.690
parts of the entire solid.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.360
And then what are our
boundaries of integration?

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.340
Well it's the same
thing as in part a.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.240
This is 0, this is 2.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.090
So the boundaries are
pretty straightforward.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.970
So we essentially just have
to evaluate this now.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.730
And just like in part b, I've
first tried to evaluate this

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.620
analytically, and you end up
getting a very, very,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.000
very hairy integral.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.220
Which you can do analytically,
you but you have to know some

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.010
power reduction formulas in
trigonometry, you have to do

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.160
some integration by parts, it
would probably use up all of

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.220
the time on the AP Exam.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.080
So since they said that a
graphing calculator is required

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.700
for some parts of the problem,
I say why not use our

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.110
graphing calculator?

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.360
Because the graphing calculator
is very good at numerically

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.450
evaluating definite
integrals like this.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.100
So let's get out my
TI-85 emulator again.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.950
Here we go.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.210
I want you see the key strokes
so that you, ok turned

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.640
on, exit out of this.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.920
So we're going to use the
calculus function here,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.070
so second, calculus.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.580
And this function right here,
this is definite integral, a

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.490
very useful function to use.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.490
Press F5, definite integral.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.450
And then we just type
in the expression.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.050
So the expression, let me
move it down a little bit.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:50.040
So it's open parentheses
sin of where is pi?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.470
Pi is -- I haven't used one of
these calculators in a long,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.160
long time -- oh there it is.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:13.210
Second pi x sin of pi x minus x
to the third power, plus 4x.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.010
All of that squared.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.180
And then this definite integral
function, you have to tell it

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.750
which is the independent
variable, or kind of, you

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.930
know, what variable are we
integrating across, and

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.360
that's the variable x.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.510
And then you just tell it the
boundaries of integration,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.450
and we're done.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:40.420
So integrate from 0, from x is
equal to 0, to x is equal to 2.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.740
If I haven't made a mistake,
I can hit enter, and let

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.100
the calculator do the
rest of the work.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.780
Let's see what it ends up with.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.460
OK, 9. -- that's the answer,
that is the volume of this

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.110
solid -- it's 9.9783 So you
could write that this

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.130
is equal to 9.9783.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.630
And I'm pretty sure they want
you to use a calculator,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.580
because frankly, computing the
integral, that's kind of just

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.870
chug math, you know, very
mechanical math, although it's

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.220
pretty sophisticated, but
it would take you forever.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.860
But this is kind of, I think,
what they wanted you to do, set

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.810
up the integral, recognize that
each of the squares, the area

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.790
of each of the squares is just
going to be this distance, the

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.060
distance between the
functions squared.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.470
And then you integrate
that from 0 to 2.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.830
Let's see how much
time I have left.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.760
I have a couple of minutes.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.920
So let's do part d.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.620
The region r models, let me,
paste, oh, I didn't want to

00:06:52.620 --> 00:07:02.030
do that, edit, undo, edit,
paste, there you go.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.510
OK, so I wanted to make
this a little smaller.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.610
So what does part d say?

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.760
The region r models the
surface of a small pond,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.420
so that's the surface now.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.880
At all points r at a distance x
from the y-axis, the depth of

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.460
the water is given by h
of x is equal to 3-x.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.710
So essentially 3-x is
the depth, right?

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:33.890
So at this point of this pond,
the depth is just 3, right 3-0.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:39.260
And at this point, the
depth is 3-2 which is 1.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.650
So essentially the pond is
going to get shallower and

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.750
shallower or as we go
further to the right.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.640
You could almost imagine
it, let me see if I

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.900
can draw it again.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:56.980
So this is the sin function
with some perspective.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.700
This is the polynomial
function below it.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.610
This is, it's probably drawn
in, that's the x-axis.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.480
This is the y-axis.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.460
And so here, the depth of the
pond is given by the function

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.580
h of x is equal to 3-x.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:34.826
So over here, the depth is 3,
so if I were to draw, so if I

00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:36.790
were to go straight down the
depth is, you know

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.110
maybe it's 3.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.140
And the pond essentially gets
shallower and shallower

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.070
as we go to the right.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.110
So how do we figure out
the volume of this?

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.880
Over here, what is the depth?

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.100
It's going to be 1, right, 3-2.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.370
This is x is equal to 2.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.580
So here the depth
is going to be 1.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.890
So if we take the cross-section
just along the x-axis, the

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.290
depth is going to look
something like this, but then

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.190
this is the top of it.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.100
I know that's kind of
hard to visualize.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:11.680
But anyway, how do we
figure out what the

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.500
volume of this lake is?

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.840
But actually, I realize I'm
pushing nine minutes, so I

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.750
will continue this
in the next video.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.252
See you soon.
