00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
Well let's review a little
bit everything that

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.740
we've covered so far.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.970
So what was the Maclaurin
Series representation

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.540
of e to the x?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.900
And once again, you'll have to
take my word for it, that the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.930
Maclaurin Series representation
really does equal, when you

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.040
take the infinite series, it
really does equal e to the x.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.700
I mentioned in a previous
video that I was thinking

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.710
about the proof.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.390
And I finally gave up because I
couldn't think of the proof.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.710
And then I looked it up and I
realized why I couldn't think

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.740
of the proof, it's
quite involved.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.540
But I will do it eventually.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.080
Probably after I cover a lot of
other things just because it's

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.680
not something that you really
have to know to succeed well in

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.890
calculus, or appreciate
what we're about to do.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.415
But I will do it.

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:38.540
It'll probably take
five or six minutes.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.410
Anyway back to where we were.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.250
So the Maclaurin Series
repetition of e to the x, and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.510
it actually does equal e to the
x, is 1 plus x, plus x squared

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.040
over 2 factorial, plus x to the
third over 3 factorial.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.870
I'm going to do a bunch of
terms and you'll see why.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.940
And x to the fourth over 4
factorial, plus x to the fifth,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.280
over 5 factorial, plus x to the
sixth, over 6 factorial, plus

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.500
x to the seventh over 7
factorial, plus x to the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.540
eighth over 8 factorial.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.600
And it just keeps going on
and on to infinity, right?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.730
Only when we take the infinite
series does it exactly

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.450
equal e to the x.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.010
Fair enough.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.510
Well what was the Maclaurin
Series representation

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.340
of cosine of x?

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.530
Well that equaled -- and I'm
going to space them out in a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.610
certain way, and I think you'll
see why -- it equalled 1 plus x

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.680
squared over -- oh no, sorry, 1
minus, this is a minus sign,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.850
let me erase that because I
want to make this as

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.790
neat as possible.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.760
Equal to 1 minus x squared over
2 factorial, right, we learned

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.600
that two videos ago, plus x
to the fourth over for 4

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.400
factorial, minus x to the
sixth over 6 factorial.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.770
I think you might already know
know where I'm going with this.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.090
Plus x to the eighth over 8
factorial, and it just kept

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.470
going, the next digit would
be a minus out here.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.890
And it goes to infinity, right?

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.790
For that pattern, you
know the pattern.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.100
And what is sine of x?

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.840
What's the Maclaurin Series
representation for sine of x?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:47.830
Well, sine of x, it equals x
minus x to the third over 3

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:57.550
factorial, plus x to the fifth
over 5 factorial, minus x to

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.960
the seventh over 7 factorial,
and it just keeps going.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.270
You'd have an x to
the ninth out here.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.050
But it goes on for
infinity, right?

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.430
These all go on for infinity,
but you know the pattern.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.280
So let's just pause here
because this is, I think if you

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.510
understand what's going on, one
of the few things in life that

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.880
will truly give you chills.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.630
It'll truly make you believe
that there is a order to the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.410
universe that we as
human beings can only

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.600
catch a glimpse of.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.960
We have limited minds.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.410
But we are on the verge, we're
scraping the surface, but

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.390
there's something amazing here.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.250
Cosine of x and sine of x.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.520
Each of their Maclaurin Series
representations, or if you were

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.980
essentially to write them as
polynomials, each of them looks

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.490
like it's almost like part
of e to the x, right?

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.960
It's almost every other digit.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.000
And they would be the
same except for a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.950
couple of sign changes.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.600
Let me make that clear.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.440
So what if I were to define
the function cosine

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.575
of x plus sine of x?

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.760
What would that equal?

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.740
Or what would it's Maclaurin
Series representation

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.230
of that be?

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.300
Well, and then we know
that it's also equal.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.030
But it's essentially
adding these two rows.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:23.270
So it would be 1 plus x, minus
squared over 2 factorial,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:32.200
minus x to the third over 3
factorial, plus x to the fourth

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.450
over 4 factorial, plus x to the
fifth over 5 factorial, minus x

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.020
to the sixth over 6 factorial,
minus x to the seventh over 7

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.290
factorial, plus x to the
eight over 8 factorial.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.720
And it just keeps going, right?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.890
The next one would be a plus,
it goes on to infinity.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.220
Now I think it should be clear
to you that something, that the

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.940
goose bumps should be
emerging on your arm.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.290
Because look at this,
and look at e to the x.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.160
What's the difference?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.940
Well, just a couple of negative
signs here and there.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.500
Let me do it in a
slightly brighter color.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.750
So the only difference between
this function and this function

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.760
are these negative signs.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.090
And I've seen this before, I've
learned this before, people for

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.740
hundreds of years
have known this.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.980
But I'll tell you something.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.970
No one, even though they can
prove it mathematically, no one

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.780
really understands why this is.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.880
Why we take these trigonometric
functions that appear, you

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.890
know, when we take the ratios
of the sides of a right

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.040
triangle, or the unit circle
definition, and you know it's

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.420
useful for, you know, triangle
measure, that's trigonometry.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.990
That's where we came up with
this cosine and sine functions.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.160
And it's related to the
circle and all the rest.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.110
That when you add these two
fundamental functions together

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.200
from trigonometry, right?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.360
Because tangent is really
just the ratio of

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.070
the sine to cosine.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.950
So these are really what
trigonometry, this is the

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.590
basis of trigonometry.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.350
When you add their polynomial
representations together, it's

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.320
almost exactly, except for
these negative signs, the

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.580
polynomial representation
of e to the x.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.850
And the number e, and first
of all, this is an exponent,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.310
these are no exponents here.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.980
And e is just completely
unrelated, or at least one

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.410
would think from trigonometry.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.760
Right, e is, we got e from
compound interest, you'll

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.800
see that it's related to
exponential growth, exponential

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.440
decay, when you have continuous
exponential growth and decay,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.930
continuous compound interest.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.620
If this number that is in a
completely unrelated field of,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.870
not just mathematics, but
really the universe, right?

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.620
Continuous interest vs.
the ratios of the sides

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.210
of right triangles.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.280
So this should already be
getting you thinking.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.300
But what would be even more
amazing is if we could somehow

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.880
work with these to make them
a little bit more equal.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.170
Well, the only thing that's
different are these

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.750
negative signs, right?

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.920
So do we know anything else
in mathematics, in our

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.400
mathematical tool kit,
that has this pattern?

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.690
Where it goes positive
positive, negative negative,

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.480
positive positive,
negative negative?

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.220
It has this essentially
the cycle of four.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.430
Well you might be thinking, and
this will even give you larger

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.990
goose bumps, or make your
current ones bigger, the number

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.870
i, or the imaginary unit i.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.390
So what are the powers of i?

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.370
This is a little review.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.050
If this is completely
unfamiliar to you, you should

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.460
re-watch the imaginary
numbers video.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.120
So what are the powers of i?

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:53.400
Well i to the zero is 1, i to
the first is i, i squared is

00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:00.550
negative 1, i to the third
power, that's negative 1

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.570
times i, so it's negative i.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.990
i to the fourth power is i
times negative i, so the

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.180
i's become negative 1 and
then you have a negative

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.770
there, so it becomes 1.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.720
And the pattern repeats itself.
i to the fifth is i, i to

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.050
the sixth is negative 1.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.040
We learned this before,
but it's just a review.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.460
i to the seventh is negative
i, i to the eighth

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.840
then becomes 1 again.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.690
So there you have it,
this is amazing.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.796
i has that property where the
second two in the cycle of

00:08:36.796 --> 00:08:37.670
four are negative, right?

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.100
We have a negative number here.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.950
This is not necessarily a
negative number, it's a

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.090
negative imaginary number, but
we have that negative sign, so

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.300
it looks pretty similar, right?

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.430
Then we have two positives,
then we have a negative

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.610
and a negative.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.390
And something else is
interesting going on here.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.040
Wherever we see the imaginary
number, whenever we see an i

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.000
or a negative i, which terms
do they correspond to?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.470
Well they correspond to the
terms of sine of x, right?

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.070
It corresponds to that term,
negative i corresponds

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.800
to that term.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.020
i corresponds to that term,
negative i corresponds

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.950
to that term.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:20.550
So we have something, it
seems a little bit even

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.910
more of a pattern.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.260
But anyway, I just realized I
only have -- I have to say I'm

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.320
normally pretty smooth in these
videos, but when I start

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.820
talking about what I'm talking
about right now, my brain

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.750
starts to go in circles.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.250
Because this is, I've actually
even heard, you know, what

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.300
we're what we're about to touch
on, as proof of the

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.420
existence of God.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.150
And really, that's not that
much of an exaggeration.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.100
It is definitely proof of the
existence of some hidden order

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.770
of the universe that we can
only catch a glimpse of.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.520
And maybe you can
call that God.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.500
But anyway, I don't want to get
metaphysical on you, but I will

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.910
see you in the next video.
