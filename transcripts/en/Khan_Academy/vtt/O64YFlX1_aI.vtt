00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540
 

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.330
Say we have a right triangle.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.890
Let me draw my right triangle
just like that.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.530
This is a right triangle.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.650
This is the 90 degree
angle right here.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.100
And we're told that
this side's length

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.440
right here is 14.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.700
This side's length right
over here is 9.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.890
And we're told that
this side is a.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.030
And we need to find
the length of a.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.860
So as I mentioned already,
this is a right triangle.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.180
And we know that if we have a
right triangle, if we know two

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.110
of the sides, we can always
figure out a third side using

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.290
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.000
And what the Pythagorean theorem
tells us is that the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.400
sum of the squares of the
shorter sides is going to be

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.260
equal to the square of the
longer side, or the square of

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.360
the hypotenuse.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.820
And if you're not sure about
that, you're probably

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.690
thinking, hey Sal, how do I know
that a is shorter than

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.890
this side over here?

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.220
How do I know it's
not 15 or 16?

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.920
And the way to tell is that the
longest side in a right

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.190
triangle, and this only applies
to a right triangle,

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.180
is the side opposite the
90 degree angle.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.450
And in this case, 14 is opposite
the 90 degrees.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.930
This 90 degree angle kind of
opens into this longest side.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.170
The side that we call
the hypotenuse.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.440
So now that we know that that's
the longest side, let

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.150
me color code it.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.010
So this is the longest side.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.180
This is one of the
shorter sides.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.900
And this is the other of
the shorter sides.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.910
The Pythagorean theorem tells us
that the sum of the squares

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.940
of the shorter sides, so a
squared plus 9 squared is

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.420
going to be equal
to 14 squared.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.870
And it's really important that
you realize that it's not 9

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.070
squared plus 14 squared is
going to be equal to a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.480
squared. a squared is one
of the shorter sides.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.920
The sum of the squares of these
two sides are going to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.950
be equal to 14 squared, the
hypotenuse squared.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.060
And from here, we just
have to solve for a.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:05.440
So we get a squared plus 81
is equal to 14 squared.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.200
In case we don't know
what that is, let's

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.060
just multiply it out.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.419
14 times 14.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.910
4 times 4 is 16.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.590
4 times 1 is 4 plus 1 is 5.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.430
Take a 0 there.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.270
1 times 4 is 4.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.390
1 times 1 is 1.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.070
6 plus 0 is 6.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.840
5 plus 4 is 9, bring
down the 1.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.490
It's 196.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.180
So a squared plus 81 is equal
to 14 squared, which is 196.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.780
Then we could subtract 81 from
both sides of this equation.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.990
 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.650
On the left-hand side, we're
going to be left

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.640
with just the a squared.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.120
These two guys cancel out, the
whole point of subtracting 81.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.230
So we're left with a squared
is equal to 196 minus 81.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.480
What is that?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.590
 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.370
If you just subtract
1, it's 195.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.880
If you subtract 80,
it would be 115 if

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.130
I'm doing that right.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.510
 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.420
And then to solve for a, we just
take the square root of

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.860
both sides, the principal square
root, the positive

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.140
square root of both sides
of this equation.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.360
So let's do that.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.960
Because we're dealing with
distances, you can't have a

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.840
negative square root, or a
negative distance here.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:31.140
And we get a is equal to
the square root of 115.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.170
Let's see if we can break
down 115 any further.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.980
So let's see.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.080
It's clearly divisible by 5.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.900
If you factor it out, it's
5, and then 5 goes

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.270
in the 115 23 times.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.920
So both of these are
prime numbers.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.410
So we're done.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.670
So you actually can't
factor this anymore.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.800
So a is just going to be equal
to the square root of 115.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.330
Now if you want to get a sense
of roughly how large the

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.280
square root of 115 is, if you
think about it, the square

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.370
root of 100 is equal to 10.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.020
And the square root of
121 is equal to 11.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.050
So this value right here is
going to be someplace in

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.180
between 10 and 11, which
makes sense if you

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.140
think about it visually.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.640
