00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.980
Let's keep going with our
2008 Calculus BC free

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.780
answer questions.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.250
So we're on problem number 2.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.480
And I cut and pasted the table
that they gave for the problem.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.790
And I'll read the
rest of the problem.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.100
And let's see what we can do.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.250
So it says concert tickets went
on sale at noon, t equals 0,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.630
and were sold out
within 9 hours.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.130
The number of people waiting in
line to purchase tickets at

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.780
time t, is modeled by a
twice differentiable

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.560
function L, L of t.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.350
So this is the number of people
waiting in line at anytime.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.180
And this is noon, 12:00
noon, 1:00 pm, 9:00 pm.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.070
All the tickets are
sold by 9:00 pm.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.710
And they tell us it's
twice differentiable.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.900
So that means that whatever
function we're modeling this,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.020
this L of t, that it's
continuous because

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.960
it's differentiable.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.300
And since it's twice
differentiable, we also know

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.350
that its derivative is
continuous because the second

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.330
derivative exists
at all points.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.140
So it says part a-- let me make
sure I'm not writing too

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.440
thickly-- use the data in the
table to estimate the rate--

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.740
let me actually just copy
and paste this, I've just

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.890
figured out how to do this.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.350
So I figure it doesn't hurt.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.700
There you go.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.350
You probably can't read it.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.690
But it says use the data in the
table to estimate the rate at

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.970
which the number of people
waiting in line was

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.030
changing at 5:30 pm.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.370
So they don't give us
any data on 5:30 pm.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.980
They give us 4:00 pm and
7:00 pm, or t equals 5.5.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.710
Show the computations that
lead to your answer.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.430
Indicate the units of measure.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.280
So what do they want to know?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.520
They want to know an estimate
of the rate at which the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.220
number of people waiting
in line was changing.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.830
So they don't give us a
continuous function definition.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.200
They just give us a bunch
of sample points of

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.620
this function L of t.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.700
So the best estimate I can do,
of the rate at which this L of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.520
t is changing at time 5.5-- and
5.5 is in between these two--

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.840
is to just figure out the
average rate of change

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.770
between time 4 and time 7.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.860
So how do we figure that out?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.760
Well the average rate of
change is just the slope.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.790
So let's write it.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.760
So we could write average
rate of change or delta

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.770
L over delta t at 5.5.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.790
You can write it however you
want, however you think that

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.770
the exam graders would
best like to see it.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.130
We could say at time 5.5.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.835
We could say approximately
equals, or whatever.

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:52.140
But it's just going to be the
slope between these two points.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:00.400
So it's L of 7 minus L of 4,
all of that over 7 over 4.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.210
Rise over run or change in
the value of the function

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.930
divided by change in the
independent variable.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.520
L of 7 is 154.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.250
They give us that.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.930
L of 4 is 126.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.790
And we divide it by 7 minus 4.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:31.880
So that equals 54 minus
126 is 24 plus 26 is 50.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.960
So it's equal to 28.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.910
Right, if this was 2
less, it would be 30.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.660
And 7 minus 4 is 3.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.010
So you could say that
the average rate of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.950
change is 28 over 3.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.550
Or you could write
that as 9 1/3.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.530
And they want us to use
the units of measure.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.450
Indicate units of measure.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.905
So the numerator,
this is people.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.570
And what's the denominator?

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.150
It's hours, people per hour.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.290
So my best estimate, or our
best estimate of the rate at

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.580
which the number of people
waiting in line was changing at

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.410
5:30 pm, which is between these
two points, is the average

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.640
slope between these two points.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.890
Which is 9 1/3 people per hour.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.790
That's it.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.180
Let's do part b.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.055
Let me clear all of this so we
have enough space for part b.

00:04:29.055 --> 00:04:31.370
And I'll copy and don't
know if you can read it.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.770
But maybe you can.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.735
So doesn't hurt to
just copy and paste.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.060
OK part b says, use a
trapezoidal sum with

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.550
three subintervals.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.780
Maybe I can make this
a little bit bigger.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.930
Let me see if I can grow
that a little bit.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.170
I don't want to take up
all the space though.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.850
No that doesn't look good.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.590
OK well I'll read it out loud
in case you can't see it.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.670
Use a trapezoidal sum with
three subintervals to estimate

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.810
the average number of people
waiting in line during the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.420
first 4 hours that the
tickets were on sale.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.550
If you want to do this
really fast, you wouldn't

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.480
have to graph it.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.500
But I'm about to graph it
because I want you to

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.250
understand how to
do this problem.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.770
If you understand it, you
don't have to graph it.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.930
So let's graph some
of these points.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.770
And we really just have
to do the first 4 hours.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.580
Actually let's graph all
of them, just because it

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.710
might be useful in future
parts of the problem.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.023
If you weren't graphing it
while recording a video, it

00:05:40.023 --> 00:05:41.080
probably would be a
little bit faster.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.305
That should be good enough.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.920
What are our data points?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:06:03.800
We have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.930
You don't have do it so neatly.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.690
Well it's good to do it neatly
when you're doing the exam,

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.600
because otherwise you'll
confuse yourself.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.640
And let's see, how high
should my L values?

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.272
This is time right here.

00:06:14.272 --> 00:06:18.250
This is my L of t axis.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.180
It goes up to about, 176
is a high point, at least

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.040
on the data we have.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.270
Let's say this is 200.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.410
So halfway up would be 100.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.320
This would be 150.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.770
This would be 50.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.080
I don't know what
that sound was from.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.370
But let's keep going forward.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.570
Let's plot the points.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.260
At t equals 0 there are
120 people in line.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.910
That's about right there.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.520
At t equals 1, 156.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.630
I'm just approximating.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.280
It's about right there.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.180
At t equals 3-- they skip
2-- at t equals 3 it's

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.730
176 people in line.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.640
So that's going to be
right about there,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.520
just approximating it.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.520
At t equals 4, we have
126 people in line.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.870
It's a little bit more
than at t equals 0.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.242
At t equals 7, we have
150 people in line.

00:07:17.242 --> 00:07:18.840
It's right about there.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.480
At t equals 8 we have 80.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.050
That's about right there.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.500
And t equal 9, the
line is gone.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.000
Everyone has gotten
their tickets, or maybe

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.220
they got sold out.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.660
Let's connect those points.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.681
Connect the dots.

00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:36.850
So from here to there.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.490
And from there to there.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.890
There to there.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.240
There to there, almost done.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.570
OK so we've at least plotted
the sample points and

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.160
connected them with lines.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.830
We know that the real L of t,
whatever we used to approximate

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.590
it, it's not going to have
these sharp edges because

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:57.660
it's differentiable.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.660
It's actually twice
differentiable.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.460
So it's actually going to be
a smoother curve, right?

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.790
Because we can take the
derivative of any point.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.200
If this was the actual
function, you wouldn't be

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.950
able to take a derivative
at this point.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.640
Because there's a positive
slope here and then it

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.190
immediately switches to a
negative slope like the

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.160
absolute value functions.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.220
You actually wouldn't
be able to take the

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.660
derivative at that point.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.090
But anyway back to the problem.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.650
Use a trapezoidal sum with
three subintervals to estimate

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.390
the average number of people
waiting in line during

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.020
the first 4 hours.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.600
So the first 4 hours,
that's right here.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.210
Now this might seem
kind of daunting.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.080
The trapezoidal sum
for the fourth.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.860
Actually I just realized.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.270
For some reason, YouTube used
to let me do longer videos

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.270
because I thought
I was a partner.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.270
But now for some reason it's
been limiting me again.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.380
So I will continue part
b in the next video.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.882
See you soon.
