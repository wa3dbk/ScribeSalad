00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.960
In the last couple of videos,
we've seen that if we have

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.460
some matrix C that is n by n.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.430
It's a square matrix, and is
columns, column form and

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.790
orthonormal set.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.110
Which just means that the
columns each have been

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.670
normalized.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.610
So they each have length
of 1 if you view

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.940
them as column vectors.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.520
And they're all mutually
orthogonal to each other.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.930
So if you dot it with
yourself you get 1.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.480
If you dot it with any of the
other columns, you get 0.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.670
We've seen this multiple
times.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.520
It's orthogonal to
everything else.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.400
If you have a matrix like this--
and I actually forgot

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.270
to tell you the name of
this-- this is called

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.520
an orthogonal matrix.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.950
We've already seen that the
transpose of this matrix is

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.530
the same thing as the inverse
of this matrix.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.320
Which makes it super, duper,
duper useful to deal with.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.600
The transpose of this matrix
is equal to the inverse.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.650
Now, this statement leads to
some other interesting things

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.160
about this.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.400
So, so far we've been dealing
this mainly with

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.510
the change of basis.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.460
I can kind of draw the
diagram that you're

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.580
probably tired of by now.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.290
Let's say that's the
standard basis.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.560
Let's say that I have
x in coordinates

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.760
with another basis.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.280
We've seen I can multiply
this guy times c.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.720
To get that up there I could
multiply that guy by c inverse

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.090
to get this guy right here.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.600
And, in that world, we viewed
c as just a change of basis.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260
Were representing the same
matrix-- we're representing

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.280
the same vector.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.100
We're just changing the
coordinates of how we

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.970
represent it.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.220
But we also know that any matrix
product, any matrix

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.080
vector product, is also a
linear transformation.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.820
So, this change of basis
is really just a linear

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.340
transformation.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.890
What I want to show you in this
video, and you could view

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.930
it either as a change of basis
or as a linear transformation,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.230
is that when you multiply this
orthogonal matrix times some

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.170
vector, it preserves--
let me write this

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:13.880
down-- lengths and angles.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.880
So let's have a little
touchy-feely discussion of

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.390
what that means.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.390
Let's view it as a
transformation.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.070
Let's say I have some set
of vectors in my domain.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.320
Let's say they look like this.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.330
Let's say that it
looks like this.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.210
Well, let me do it like-- I'll
draw that one like that guy,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.365
and this guy like that.

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:36.150
And there's some angle
between them.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.610
Angles are easy to visualize
in r2, r3.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.780
Maybe a little harder once we
get the higher dimensions.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.820
But that's the angle
between them.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.980
Now, if we're saying that we're
preserving the angles

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.830
and the lengths, that means if
I were to multiply these

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.440
vectors times c then we could
view it as a transformation.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.650
Maybe I rotate them or I--
well, you can't really.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.530
Maybe I rotate them or do
something like that.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.490
So maybe that pink vector
will now look like this.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.700
But it's going to have
the same length.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.990
This length is going to be the
same thing as that length.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.575
And even more, when I said it
preserves lengths and angles,

00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:11.840
this yellow vector's going to
look something like this.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.630
Where the angle is going
to be the same.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.980
Where this data is going
to be that data.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.200
That's what I mean by
preserves angles.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.530
If we didn't have this case,
we could imagine a

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.460
transformation that doesn't
preserve angles.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.690
Let me draw one that doesn't.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.250
If this got transformed to, I
don't know, let's say this guy

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.460
got a lot longer, and let's say
this guy also got longer,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.330
and I want to show
that the angle

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.235
also doesn't get preserved.

00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:37.400
Not only did it get
longer, but it got

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.370
distorted a little bit.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.380
So, the angle also changed.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.850
This transformation
right there is

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.760
not preserving angles.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.850
So when you have a change
of basis matrix that's

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.010
orthogonal, when you have a
transformation matrix that's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.220
orthogonal, all it's essentially
doing to your to

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.820
your vectors, is it kind of a
rotates them around, but it's

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.110
not going to really
distort them.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.960
So I'll write that in quotes
because that's not a

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.430
mathematically rigorous term.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.690
So, no distortion of vectors.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.570
So, I've kind of showed
you the intuition

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.220
of what that means.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.745
Let's actually prove
it to ourselves

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:24.980
that this is the case.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.180
So, I'm saying that if this
pink vector here is x, and

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.630
that this pink vector here is
c times x, I'm claiming that

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.400
the length of x is equal to
the length of c times x.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.373
Let's see if that's
actually the case.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:56.830
The length of cx squared is the
same thing as cx dot cx.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.360
And here it's always useful
for me to kind of remind

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.940
myself that if I take
two vectors-- let

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.810
me do it over here.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.810
Let's say I have y dot y.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.593
This is the same thing as y
transpose, if you view them as

00:05:11.593 --> 00:05:15.300
matrices, y transpose times y.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:24.180
y transpose y is just y1, y2,
all the way to yn times y1,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.340
y2, all the way to yn.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.610
And if you were to do this 1
by n times n by 1 matrix

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.340
product, you're going to get a 1
by 1 matrix or just a number

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.770
that's going to be y1 times y1
plus y2 times y2 all the way

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.910
to yn times yn.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.530
So, this is the same
thing as y dot y.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.980
I think I did this about ten or
twenty videos ago, but it's

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.630
always a good refresher.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.170
So let's use this property
right here.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.110
So these two dotted
with each other.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.300
This is the same thing is taking
one of their transpose

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.390
times the other one.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.420
So turn this from a vector,
vector dot product to a

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.580
matrix, matrix product.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.930
So this is the same thing
as CX transpose, CX.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.480
so you can view this as a 1 by n
matrix now, times the 1 by 1

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.110
matrix which is just the
column vector cx.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.760
These are the same thing.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.330
Now, we also know that A times
B transpose is the same thing

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.430
is B transpose, A transpose.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.240
We saw that a long time ago.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.710
So this thing right here is
going to be equal to X

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.890
transpose, C transpose.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.580
Just switch the order and take
the transpose of each.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.710
X transpose times C transpose.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.170
And then you have
that times CX.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.180
And now we know that C transpose
is the same thing is

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.430
as C inverse.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.690
This is where we need the
orthogonality of the matrix C.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.130
This is where we need it to be
a square matrix where all of

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.540
its columns are mutually
orthogonal

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.630
and they're all normal.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.630
And so this thing is just
going to become

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.880
the identity matrix.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.240
I can write the identity matrix
there, but that's just

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.010
going to disappear.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.680
So this is going to be equal
to X transpose X.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.190
X transpose is the same thing
as X dot X which is the same

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.840
thing as the length
of X squared.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.130
So the length of CX squared is
the same thing as the length

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.140
of X squared.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.770
So, that tells us that the
length of X, or the length of

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.700
CX, is the length of x because
both of these are going to be

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.280
positive quantities.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.750
So I've shown you that
orthogonal matrices definitely

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.760
preserve length.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.990
Let's see if they
preserve angles.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.750
So we actually have
to define angles.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.260
Throughout our mathematical
careers, we understood what

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.520
angles mean in kind
of r2 or r3.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.440
But in linear algebra, we
like to be general.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.710
And we defined an angle
using the dot product.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.650
We use the law of cosines and we
took an analogy to kind of

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:58.640
triangle in r2.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:07.760
But we defined an angle or we
said the dot product V dot W

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:14.680
is equal to the lengths, the
products of the lengths of

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.310
those two vectors times
the cosine of the

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.720
angle between them.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.350
Or you could say that the cosine
of the angle between

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.780
two vectors, we defined as the
dot product of those two

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.710
vectors divided by the lengths
of those two vectors.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.289
This was the definition so that
we can extend the idea of

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:37.240
an angle to an arbitrarily
high dimension to r

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.610
google if we had to.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.860
So let's see if it preserves.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.860
Let's see what the angle is if
we multiply these guys by C.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.010
So, if we wanted-- let's
say our new angle.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.370
So, cosine of angle C.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.740
Once we perform our
transformation.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.690
We're going to perform the
transformation on all of these

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.230
characters.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:05.270
It's going to be CV dot CW over
the lengths of CV times

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.370
the lengths of CW.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.490
Now we already know that
lengths are preserved.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.930
We already know that the length
of CW and CV are just

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.920
going to be W and V.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.780
We just proved that.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.600
Let me write that.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:22.950
So the cosine of theta C is
equal to CV dot CW over the

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.450
lengths of V times W.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.670
Because we've already shown
that it preserves lengths.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.040
We'll see what this
top part equals.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.030
So we can just use the
general property.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.330
The dot product is equal to the
transpose of one guy as

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.010
kind of a matrix times
the second guy.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:47.370
So this is equal to CW
transpose times CV.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.220
And all of that over
these lengths.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.060
Like the W.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.150
And this is going to be equal
to-- I'm going to write it

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.760
down here to have some space.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.040
We can switch these guys and
take their transpose.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:06.720
So, it's W transpose times
C transpose times CV.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.440
All of that over their lengths,
the product of their

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.990
lengths V and W.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.860
And this is the identity
matrix.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.930
That's the identity matrix, and
this is going to be equal

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.880
to W transpose times V over the
products of their lengths.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.560
And this is the same
thing as V dot W.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.950
This is V dot W over
their lengths.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.750
Which is cosine of theta.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.170
So, you notice, by our
definition of an angle as the

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.040
dot product divided by the
vector lengths, when you

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.190
perform a transformation or you
can imagine a change of

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:54.750
basis either way, with an
orthogonal matrix C the angle

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.940
between the transformed vectors
does not change.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.640
It is the same as the angle
between the vectors before

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.980
they were transformed.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.340
Which is a really neat
thing to know.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.640
The change of bases or
transformations with

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.970
orthogonal matrices don't
distort the vectors.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.300
They might just kind of rotate
them around or shift them a

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.540
little bit, but it doesn't
change the

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.700
angles between them.
