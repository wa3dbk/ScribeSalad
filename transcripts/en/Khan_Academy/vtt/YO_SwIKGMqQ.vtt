00:00:01.057 --> 00:00:03.730
We're asked to subtract and state the difference

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.319
in simplest form.

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.863
So we're subtracting one rational expression from another.

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:12.046
And just like the case when you are subtracting fractions,

00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:14.729
or adding fractions for that matter,

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.462
you have to make sure that you have a common denomintator.

00:00:17.462 --> 00:00:21.147
And over here it looks like we have kind of the same components,

00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:23.063
but they're not quite the same thing.

00:00:23.063 --> 00:00:29.617
So we need to find the least common multiple of 7m^2n and 3mn^4,

00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:32.495
and then that we can use as a common denominator.

00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:34.296
Let's see if we can do that.

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:36.813
So, let me find a common denominator:

00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:40.147
we have a negative sign out here and a common denominator over here.

00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:42.481
So a common denominator is going to have ...

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:44.258
let's just look at each of the numbers.

00:00:44.258 --> 00:00:47.147
We have a 7 here and a 3 over here.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:51.045
So the common denominator has to be divisible by both 7 and 3.

00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:52.680
Or another way to think about it,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.112
the least common multiple of 7 and 3 is 21.

00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:59.462
So we're going to have to have 21 in our common denominator.

00:00:59.462 --> 00:01:02.529
And I'm getting that by encorporating the 7 and the 3.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.897
That's what gives me the 21.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:07.110
Now let's look at the m's.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.745
This denominator has 2 "m"s if you were to factor it.

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:11.529
It's m times m.

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.129
This only has one m.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:15.446
So as long as we're divisible by m^2

00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:17.481
then we're also going to be divisible by m

00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:19.713
So we just have to put an m^2 over here

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.746
and an m^2 over here.

00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:25.813
Notice this is ... right now this is both divisible by

00:01:25.813 --> 00:01:29.080
7, 3, m and m^2.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.530
So we're cool through the "m"s.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.463
Now let's look at the "n" terms.

00:01:33.463 --> 00:01:35.112
It has to be divisible by n,

00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:37.283
and it also has to be divisible by n^4.

00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:39.318
Well, if we're divisible by n^4,

00:01:39.318 --> 00:01:41.544
we're also divisible by n, since this is one of the factors of n^4

00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:45.880
This to the fourth power is n to the fourth.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.612
Anyway, we have to be divisible by n^4

00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:51.862
If we're divisible by n^4 we are divisible by n

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:53.540
So that's our common denominator.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.000
We're divisible by 7m^2n, definitely divisible by 3mn^4.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.195
So that's our common denominator.

00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:06.148
So to go from 7m^2n, to this right over here,

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:09.597
we have to multiply it by 3 times

00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:12.663
let's see, the m^2, we didn't have to multiply it by anything

00:02:12.663 --> 00:02:16.062
to get from n to n^4, we have to multiply it by n^3

00:02:16.062 --> 00:02:19.086
So we have to multiply this by 3n^3

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:22.731
So we multiply the denominator by 3n^3 to get this over here

00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:26.317
we also have to multiply the numerator by 3n^3

00:02:26.317 --> 00:02:29.547
3n^3 times 6m is 18m,

00:02:29.547 --> 00:02:36.596
one right over there

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:38.753
and then we have an n^3

00:02:38.753 --> 00:02:43.696
now let's do it with the second term right over here

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.797
or the thing we are subtracting from this first rational expression

00:02:46.797 --> 00:02:49.112
so to get from 3m,

00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:51.129
so let's see, to get from that to that

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.993
what did we have to do?

00:02:52.993 --> 00:02:54.212
to get from a 3 to a 21

00:02:54.212 --> 00:02:56.230
you have to multiply it by a 7

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.179
you have to multiply it by 7

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:03.148
and to get from an m to an m^2 you have to multiply it by m

00:03:03.148 --> 00:03:07.229
And to get from n^4 to n^4, you didn't have to multiply by anything

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.528
So to get from this expression in the denominator

00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:11.045
to this expression in the denominator

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:13.148
you have to multiply it by 7m.

00:03:13.148 --> 00:03:15.393
So if you multiply the denominator by 7m

00:03:15.393 --> 00:03:18.346
you also have to ultiply the numerator by 7m

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:21.547
And so you have 5 time 7 is 35

00:03:21.547 --> 00:03:25.600
and you have 1m, right over here,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.647
and then we have n^3

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:29.648
and now we are ready to subtract

00:03:29.648 --> 00:03:31.480
since we have the same denominator

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.730
Let me write the denominator here

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.713
So the denominator is 21m^2n^4

00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:40.962
And in our numerator we have

00:03:40.962 --> 00:03:52.596
18mn^3 minus 35mn^3

00:03:52.596 --> 00:03:54.196
Now this is interesting,

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:56.730
because we have 18 of something

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.379
of mn^3

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.745
and we're going to subtract 35 of that same something

00:04:00.745 --> 00:04:02.063
mn^3

00:04:02.063 --> 00:04:03.564
we have the same power on m,

00:04:03.564 --> 00:04:05.529
same power on n

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.481
So this is 18 of something -35 of that something

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.346
which is going to be equal to what?

00:04:10.346 --> 00:04:12.480
18 minus 35,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.805
this is just practicing subtracting negative numbers

00:04:14.805 --> 00:04:17.111
is -17

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:19.614
Let me do this in a new color

00:04:19.614 --> 00:04:23.613
So this is going to be -17

00:04:23.613 --> 00:04:29.180
-17mn^3

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.211
right, 18-35: 35-18 would be 17

00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:37.711
So if you swap them around you get -17

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:39.120
yup that works

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:49.481
and then all of that over 21m^2n^4.

00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:51.861
Now let's see if we can simplify this further

00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:53.345
both the numerator ...

00:04:53.345 --> 00:04:56.314
17 is prime, so you can't simplify that with 21

00:04:56.314 --> 00:05:00.079
both the numerator and denominator are divisible by m

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:02.261
So let's divide them both by m

00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:06.013
this becomes a 1, this becomes just an m

00:05:06.013 --> 00:05:09.085
both the numerator and denominator are divisible by n^3

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:13.412
so you divide the numerator by n^3, that becomes 1

00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:16.563
you divide the denominator by n^3, this becomes an n

00:05:16.563 --> 00:05:21.344
We are left with, in simplest form,

00:05:21.344 --> 00:05:31.796
-17 over, I'll do it in the same colors, 21mn.

00:05:31.796 --> 99:59:59.999
And we are done.
