00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
 

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.890
We have the function f of
x is equal to x minus

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.230
1 squared minus 2.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.450
And they've constrained the
domain to x being less

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.600
than or equal to 1.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.760
So we have the left half
of a parabola right here.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.410
They've constrained so that
it's not a full U parabola.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.470
And I'll let you think about
why that would make finding

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.320
the inverse difficult.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.150
But let's try to find
the inverse here.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.500
And a good place to start
-- let's just set y

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.830
being equal to f of x.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.200
You could say y is equal to
f of x or we could just

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.430
write that y is equal to x
minus 1 squared minus 2.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.260
We know it's for

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.960
x is less than or equal to 1.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.030
But right now we have y
solved for in terms of x.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.890
Or we've solved for y, to find
the inverse we're going to want

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.980
to solve for x in terms of y.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.140
And we're going to
constrain y similarly.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.280
We could look at the graph and
we could say, well, in this

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.000
graph right here, this is
defined for y being greater

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.040
than or equal to negative 2.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.610
So we can maybe put in
parentheses y being greater

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880
than or equal to negative 2.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.480
Because this is going to be --
right now this is our range.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.580
But when we swap the x's
and y's, this is going

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.350
to be our domain.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.070
So let's just keep that in
parentheses right there.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.150
So let's solve for x.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.030
So that's all you have to
do, to find the inverse.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.230
Solve for x and make sure
you keep track of the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.890
domains and the ranges.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.500
So, let's see.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.520
We could add 2 to both
sides of this equation.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.440
We get y plus 2 is equal
to x minus 1 squared.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.640
Minus 2, plus 2, so
those cancel out.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.020
And then, I'm just going to
switch to the y constraint.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.286
Because now it's not clear
what we're -- whether x is

00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:42.040
the domain or the range.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.790
But we know by the end
of this problem, y is

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.670
going to be the domain.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.130
So let's just swap this here.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.090
So, 4 for y is greater than
or equal to negative 2.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.600
And we could also say, in
parentheses, x is less than 1.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.680
This is -- we haven't solved it
explicitly for either one, so

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.050
we'll keep both of them
around right now.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.780
Now, to solve for x, you might
be tempted to just take the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.000
square root of both sides here.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.410
And you wouldn't be
completely wrong.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.850
But we have to be very,
very, very careful here.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.000
And this might not be something
that you've ever seen before.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.410
So this is an
interesting point here.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.340
We want the right side
to just be x minus 1.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.720
That's our goal here, in taking
the square root of both sides.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.270
We want to just have an
x minus 1 over there.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.090
Now, is x minus 1 a positive
or a negative number?

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.350
Well, we've constrained our
x's to being less than 1.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.320
So we're dealing only in
a situation where x is

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.610
less than or equal to 1.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.760
So if x is less than or equal
to 1, this is negative.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.000
This is negative.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.200
So we want to take the
negative square root.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.390
Let me just be very clear here.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.660
If I take negative 3 -- I take
negative 3 and I were to square

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.780
it, that is equal to 9.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.830
Now, if we take the square root
of 9 -- if we take the square

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.620
root -- let's say we take
the square root of both

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.430
sides of this equation.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.280
And our goal is to get
back to negative 3.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.200
If we take the
positive square root.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.260
If we just take the principle
root of both sides of that, we

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.410
would get 3 is equal to 3.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.740
But that's not our goal.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.660
We want to get back
to negative 3.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.050
So we want to take the negative
square root of our square.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.900
So because this expression is
negative and we want to get

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.360
back to this expression, we
want to get back to this x

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.420
minus 1, we need to take the
negative square root

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.050
of both sides.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.500
You can always -- every
perfect square has a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.250
positive or a negative root.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.090
The principle root
is a positive root.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.870
But here we want to take the
negative root because this

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.340
expression right here is
going to be negative.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.460
And that's what we
want to solve for.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.390
So let's take the negative
root of both sides.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.870
So you get the negative square
root of y plus 2 is equal to

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.340
-- and I'll just write this
extra step here, just so you

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.240
realize what we're doing.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.320
Is equal to the negative square
root, the negative square

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.660
root of x minus 1 squared.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.310
For y is greater than or
equal to negative 2.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.410
And x is less than
or equal to 1.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.650
That's why the whole reason
we're going to take the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.450
negative square there.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.880
And then this expression
right here -- so let me

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.220
just write the left again.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.470
Negative square root of y plus
2 is equal to the negative

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.190
square root of x minus 1
squared is just going

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.350
to be x minus 1.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.525
It's just going to
be x minus one.

00:04:36.525 --> 00:04:39.060
x minus 1 squared is
some positive quantity.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.730
The negative root is the
negative number that you

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.570
have to square to get it.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.960
To get x minus 1 squared.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.470
So that just becomes x minus 1.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.370
Hopefully that doesn't
confuse you too much.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.170
We just want to get rid
of this squared sign.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.080
We want to make sure we
get the negative version.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.515
We don't want the positive
version, which would

00:04:53.515 --> 00:04:54.810
have been 1 minus x.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.020
Don't want to confuse you.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.350
So here, we now just
have to solve for x.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.910
Add 1.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.920
And let me write the 4.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.230
y is greater than or
equal to negative 2.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.020
Add 1 to both sides.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:13.470
You get negative square root of
y plus 2 plus 1 is equal to x

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.320
for y is greater than or
equal to negative 2.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.120
Or, if we want to rewrite it,
we could say that x is equal to

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.231
the negative square root of y
plus 2 plus 1 for y is greater

00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:29.120
than or equal to negative 2.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.840
Or if we want to write it in
terms, as an inverse function

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.140
of y, we could say -- so we
could say that f inverse of y

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:42.270
is equal to this, or f inverse
of y is equal to the negative

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.500
square root of y plus 2 plus
1, for y is greater than

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.830
or equal to negative 2.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.230
And now, if we wanted
this in terms of x.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.300
If we just want to rename
y as x we just replace

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.980
the y's with x's.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.250
So we could write f
inverse of x -- I'm just

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.390
renaming the y here.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:09.570
Is equal to the negative square
root of x plus 2 plus 1 for,

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.580
I'm just renaming the y, for
x is greater than or

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.930
equal to negative 2.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.150
And if we were to graph
this, let's see.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.670
If we started at x is equal
to negative 2, this is 0.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.560
So the point negative 2, 1 is
going to be on our graph.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.910
So negative 2, 1 is going
to be on our graph.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.590
Let's see, if we go to negative
1, negative 1 this will

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.430
become a negative 1.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.650
Negative 1 is 0 on our graph.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.820
Negative 1, 0 is on our graph.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.500
And then, let's see.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.990
If we were to do, if we were
to put x is equal to 2 here.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.020
So x is equal to 2 is 4.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.550
4 square root,
principle root is 2.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.170
It becomes a negative 2 So
it becomes 2, negative 1.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.130
So that's on our
graph right there.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.850
So the graph is going
to look something like

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.110
this, of f inverse.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.340
It's going to look something
like that right there.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.100
As you can see, it is a
reflection of our original

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.030
f of x along the line
y is equal to x.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.070
Along the line y is equal to x.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.560
Because we've essentially just
swapped the x and the y.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.390
This is about as hard of
an inverse problem that

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.540
I expect you to see.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.190
Especially in a precalculus
class because it really is

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.790
tricky to realize that you
have to take the negative

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.580
square root here.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.800
Because the way our domain was
constrained, this value right

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.830
here is going to be negative.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.330
So to solve for it, you want to
have the negative square root.
