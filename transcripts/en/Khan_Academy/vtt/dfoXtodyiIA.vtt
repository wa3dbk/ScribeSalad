00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.470
We need to find the vertex
and the axis of

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.390
symmetry of this graph.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.950
The whole point of doing this
problem is so that you

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.240
understand what the vertex
and axis of symmetry is.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.690
And just as a bit of a
refresher, if a parabola looks

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.280
like this, the vertex is the
lowest point here, so this

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.260
minimum point here, for an
upward opening parabola.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.610
If the parabola opens downward
like this, the vertex is the

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.710
topmost point right like that.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.970
It's the maximum point.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.110
And the axis of symmetry is
the line that you could

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.900
reflect the parabola around,
and it's symmetric.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.610
So that's the axis
of symmetry.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.065
That is a reflection of the
left-hand side along that axis

00:00:37.065 --> 00:00:37.710
of symmetry.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.330
Same thing if it's a
downward-opening parabola.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.370
And the general way of telling
the difference between an

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.960
upward-opening and a
downward-opening parabola is

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.420
that this will have a positive
coefficient on the x squared

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.260
term, and this will have
a negative coefficient.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.910
And we'll see that in a little
bit more detail.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.460
So let's just work on this.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.450
Now, in order to figure out the
vertex, there's a quick

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.600
and dirty formula, but I'm not
going to do the formula here

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.000
because the formula really tells
you nothing about how

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.540
you got it.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.740
But I'll show you how to apply
the formula at the end of this

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.245
video, if you see this on a math
test and just want to do

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:11.110
it really quickly.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.660
But we're going to do it the
slow, intuitive way first.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.940
So let's think about how we can
find either the maximum or

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.710
the minimum point of
this parabola.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.800
So the best way I can think
of doing it is to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.900
complete the square.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.400
And it might seem like a very
foreign concept right now, but

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.490
let's just do it one
step at a time.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.340
So I can rewrite this as y is
equal to-- well, I can factor

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.330
out a negative 2.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.320
It's equal to negative 2 times
x squared minus 4x minus 4.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.065
And I'm going to put the
minus 4 out here.

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:43.990
And this is where I'm going
to complete the square.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.810
Now, what I want to do is
express the stuff in the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.430
parentheses as a sum of a
perfect square and then some

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.610
number over here.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.400
And I have x squared minus 4x.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.970
If I wanted this to be a perfect
square, it would be a

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.550
perfect square if I had a
positive 4 over here.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.870
If I had a positive 4 over
there, then this would be a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.870
perfect square.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.070
It would be x minus 2 squared.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.780
And I got the 4, because I said,
well, I want whatever

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.110
half of this number is,
so half of negative

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.530
4 is negative 2.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.500
Let me square it.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.470
That'll give me a positive
4 right there.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.470
But I can't just add
a 4 willy-nilly to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.680
one side of an equation.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.550
I either have to add it to the
other side or I would have to

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.900
then just subtract it.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.850
So here I haven't changed
equation.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.890
I added 4 and then
I subtracted 4.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.050
I just added zero to this little
expression here, so it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.880
didn't change it.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.270
But what it does allow me to do
is express this part right

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.170
here as a perfect square. x
squared minus 4x plus 4 is x

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.470
minus 2 squared.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.380
It is x minus 2 squared.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.340
And then you have this
negative 2 out front

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.420
multiplying everything, and
then you have a negative 4

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.090
minus negative 4, minus
8, just like that.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.490
So you have y is equal to
negative 2 times this entire

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.200
thing, and now we can multiply
out the negative 2 again.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.810
So we can distribute it.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.050
Y is equal to negative 2 times
x minus 2 squared.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.420
And then negative 2 times
negative 8 is plus 16.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.270
Now, all I did is algebraically

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.110
arrange this equation.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.970
But what this allows us to do
is think about what the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.370
maximum or minimum point
of this equation is.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.250
So let's just explore
this a little bit.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.300
This quantity right here, x
minus 2 squared, if you're

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.360
squaring anything, this
is always going to

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.380
be a positive quantity.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.220
That right there is
always positive.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.300
But it's being multiplied
by a negative number.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.210
So if you look at the larger
context, if you look at the

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.160
always positive multiplied by
the negative 2, that's going

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.450
to be always negative.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.150
And the more positive that this
number becomes when you

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.740
multiply it by a negative, the
more negative this entire

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.990
expression becomes.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.340
 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.560
So if you think about it,
this is going to be a

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.010
downward-opening parabola.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.040
We have a negative coefficient
out here.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.920
And the maximum point on this
downward-opening parabola is

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.640
when this expression right here
is as small as possible.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.290
If this gets any larger, it's
just multiplied by a negative

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.630
number, and then you subtract
it from 16.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.920
So if this expression right here
is 0, then we have our

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.490
maximum y value, which is 16.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.250
So how do we get x is
equal to 0 here?

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.860
Well, the way to get x minus
2 equal to 0-- so

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.040
let's just do it.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.400
x minus 2 is equal to 0,
so that happens when

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.220
x is equal to 2.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.020
So when x is equal to 2,
this expression is 0.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.240
0 times a negative number,
it's all 0, and then y is

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.240
equal to 16.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.320
This is our vertex, this
is our maximum point.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.170
We just reasoned through it,
just looking at the algebra,

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.300
that the highest value this
can take on is 16.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.390
As x moves away from 2 in
the positive or negative

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.420
direction, this quantity right
here, it might be negative or

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.630
positive, but when you square
it, it's going to be positive.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.240
And when you multiply it by
negative 2, it's going to

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.440
become negative and it's going
to subtract from 16.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.010
So our vertex right here
is x is equal to 2.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.170
Actually, let's say each
of these units are 2.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:28.060
So this is 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, 12, 14, 16.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.070
So my vertex is here.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.150
That is the absolute maximum
point for this parabola.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.020
And its axis of symmetry is
going to be along the line x

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.470
is equal to 2, along the
vertical line x is equal to 2.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.300
That is going to be its
axis of symmetry.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.550
And now if we're just curious
for a couple of other points,

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.060
just because we want to plot
this thing, we could say,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.300
well, what happens when
x is equal to 0?

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.990
That's an easy one.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.420
When x is equal to 0,
y is equal to 8.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.930
So when x is equal to 0, we have
1, 2, 3, 4-- oh, well,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:02.530
these are 2.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.050
2, 4, 6, 8.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.090
It's right there.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.250
This is an axis of symmetry.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.760
So when x is equal to 3, y is
also going to be equal to 8.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.390
So this parabola is a really
steep and narrow one that

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.180
looks something like this, where
this right here is the

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.370
maximum point.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.260
Now I told you this is the slow
and intuitive way to do

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.950
the problem.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.350
If you wanted a quick and dirty
way to figure out a

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.300
vertex, there is a formula
that you can derive it

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.330
actually, doing this exact same
process we just did, but

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.130
the formula for the vertex, or
the x-value of the vertex, or

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.500
the axis of symmetry, is x is
equal to negative b over 2a.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.140
So if we just apply this-- but,
you know, this is just

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.660
kind of mindless application
of a formula.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.130
I wanted to show you the
intuition why this formula

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.010
even exists.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.240
But if you just mindlessly
apply this, you'll get--

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.490
what's b here?

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.340
So x is equal to negative--
b here is 8.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.240
8 over 2 times a.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.690
a right here is a negative 2.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.520
2 times negative 2.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.270
So what is that going
to be equal to?

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.230
It is negative 8 over negative
4, which is equal to 2, which

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.390
is the exact same thing we
got by reasoning it out.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.400
And when x is equal to
2, y is equal to 16.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.090
Same exact result there.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.250
That's the point 2 comma 16.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.066
