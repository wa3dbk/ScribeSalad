00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.650
Let's now talk about what is
easily one of the most famous

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.230
theorems in all of
mathematics.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.230
And that's the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.980
And it deals with
right triangles.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.040
So a right triangle is a
triangle that has a 90 degree

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.000
angle in it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.340
So the way I drew it
right here, this is

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.330
our 90 degree angle.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.320
If you've never seen a 90 degree
angle before, the way

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.700
to think about it is, if this
side goes straight left to

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.600
right, this side goes straight
up and down.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.970
These sides are perpendicular,
or the angle between them is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.110
90 degrees, or it is
a right angle.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.990
And the Pythagorean theorem
tells us that if we're dealing

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.180
with a right triangle-- let me
write that down-- if we're

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.340
dealing with a right triangle--
not a wrong

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.640
triangle-- if we're dealing with
a right triangle, which

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.140
is a triangle that has a right
angle, or a 90 degree angle in

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.060
it, then the relationship
between their sides is this.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.670
So this side is a, this side
is b, and this side is c.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.190
And remember, the c that we're
dealing with right here is the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.510
side opposite the
90 degree angle.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.430
It's important to keep track
of which side is which.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.030
The Pythagorean theorem tells us
that if and only if this is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.330
a right triangle, then a squared
plus b squared is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.270
going to be equal
to c squared.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.630
And we can use this
information.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.960
If we know two of these, we
can then use this theorem,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.440
this formula to solve
for the third.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.640
And I'll give you one more piece
of terminology here.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.600
This long side, the side that
is the longest side of our

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.650
right triangle, the side that
is opposite of our right

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.590
angle, this right here-- it's
c in this example-- this is

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.840
called a hypotenuse.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.090
A very fancy word for
a very simple idea.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.050
The longest side of a right
triangle, the side that is

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.770
opposite the 90 degree angle,
is called the hypotentuse.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.440
Now that we know the Pythagorean
theorem, let's

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.620
actually use it.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.070
Because it's one thing to know
something, but it's a lot more

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.250
fun to use it.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.860
So let's say I have the
following right triangle.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.800
Let me draw it a little
bit neater than that.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.770
It's a right triangle.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.080
This side over here
has length 9.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.950
This side over here
has length 7.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.900
And my question is, what
is this side over here?

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.130
Maybe we can call that--
we'll call that c.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.710
Well, c, in this case, once
again, it is the hypotenuse.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.640
It is the longest side.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.840
So we know that the sum of the
squares of the other side is

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.140
going to be equal
to c squared.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.900
So by the Pythagorean theorem,
9 squared plus 7 squared is

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.510
going to be equal
to c squared.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.260
9 squared is 81, plus
7 squared is 49.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.130
80 plus 40 is 120.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.630
Then we're going to have the 1
plus the 9, that's another 10,

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.260
so this is going to
be equal to 130.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.660
So let me write it this way.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.290
The left-hand side is going to
be equal to 130, and that is

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.600
equal to c squared.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.280
So what's c going
to be equal to?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.170
Let me rewrite it over here.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.550
c squared is equal to 130, or
we could say that c is equal

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.330
to the square root of 130.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.610
And notice, I'm only taking
the principal root here,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.210
because c has to be positive.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.580
We're dealing with a distance,
so we can't take the negative

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.120
square root.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.400
So we'll only take
the principal

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.600
square root right here.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.716
And if we want to simplify this
a little bit, we know how

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:09.960
to simplify our radicals.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:18.899
130 is 2 times 65, which
is 5 times 13.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.910
Well, these are all prime
numbers, so that's about as

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.740
simple as I can get.
c is equal to the

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.820
square root of 130.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.130
Let's do another one of these.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.930
Maybe I want to keep this
Pythagorean theorem right

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.830
there, just so we always
remember what

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.400
we're referring to.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.490
So let's say I have a triangle
that looks like this.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.260
Let's see.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.720
Let's say it looks like that.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.720
And this is the right
angle, up here.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.160
Let's say that this side,
I'm going to call it a.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.140
The side, it's going
to have length 21.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.450
And this side right here is
going to be of length 35.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.800
So your instinct to solve for a,
might say, hey, 21 squared

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.710
plus 35 squared is going to
be equal to a squared.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.930
But notice, in this situation,
35 is a hypotenuse.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.390
35 is our c.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.590
It's the longest side of
our right triangle.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.010
So what the Pythagorean theorem
tells us is that a

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.800
squared plus the other
non-longest side-- the other

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.970
non-hypotenuse squared-- so a
squared plus 21 squared is

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.190
going to be equal
to 35 squared.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.540
You always have to remember, the
c squared right here, the

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.500
c that we're talking about, is
always going to be the longest

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.450
side of your right triangle.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.020
The side that is opposite
of our right angle.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.060
This is the side that's opposite
of the right angle.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.610
So a squared plus 21 squared
is equal to 35 squared.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.100
And what do we have here?

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.740
So 21 squared-- I'm tempted to
use a calculator, but I won't.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.530
So 21 times 21: 1 times 21
is 21, 2 times 21 is 42.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.510
It is 441.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.600
35 squared.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.860
Once again, I'm tempted to use
a calculator, but I won't.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.700
35 times 35: 5 times 5 is 25.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.280
Carry the 2.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.400
5 times 3 is 15, plus 2 is 17.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.840
Put a 0 here, get rid
of that thing.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.130
3 times 5 is 15.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.030
3 times 3 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:44.210
So it is 11-- let me do it in
order-- 5 plus 0 is 5, 7 plus

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.070
5 is 12, 1 plus 1 is 2,
bring down the 1.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.670
1225.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:58.540
So this tells us that a squared
plus 441 is going to

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.450
be equal to 35 squared,
which is 1225.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.300
Now, we could subtract
441 from both

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.550
sides of this equation.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.760
The left-hand side just
becomes a squared.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.510
The right-hand side,
what do we get?

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.210
We get 5 minus 1 is 4.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.793
We want to-- let me write this
a little bit neater here.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.810
Minus 441.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.260
So the left-hand side, once
again, they cancel out. a

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.110
squared is equal to-- and then
on the right-hand side, what

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.440
do we have to do?

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.380
That's larger than that, but 2
is not larger than 4, so we're

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.020
going to have to borrow.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.660
So that becomes a 12, or
regrouped, depending on how

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.320
you want to view it.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.710
That becomes a 1.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.780
1 is not greater than
4, so we're going to

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.110
have to borrow again.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.800
Get rid of that.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.170
And then this becomes an 11.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.100
5 minus 1 is 4.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.780
12 minus 4 is 8.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.850
11 minus 4 is 7.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.640
So a squared is equal to 784.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.380
And we could write, then,
that a is equal to the

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.910
square root of 784.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.800
And once again, I'm very tempted
to use a calculator,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.710
but let's, well, let's not.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.630
Let's not use it.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.880
So this is 2 times, what?

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.400
392.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:41.890
And then this-- 390 times
2 is 78, yeah.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.390
And then this is
2 times, what?

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:49.790
This is 2 times 196.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.900
That's right.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.680
190 times 2 is-- yeah,
that's 2 times 196.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.060
196 is 2 times-- I want to
make sure I don't make a

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.760
careless mistake.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:06.200
196 is 2 times 98.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.230
Let's keep going down here.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:16.850
98 is 2 times 49.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.540
And, of course, we know
what that is.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.120
So notice, we have 2 times
2, times 2, times 2.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.000
So this is 2 to the
fourth power.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.680
So it's 16 times 49.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.220
So a is equal to the square
root of 16 times 49.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.990
I picked those numbers because
they're both perfect squares.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.480
So this is equal to the square
root of 16 is 4, times the

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.930
square root of 49 is 7.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.260
It's equal to 28.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.800
So this side right here is going
to be equal to 28, by

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.980
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.650
Let's do one more of these.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.770
Can never get enough practice.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.760
So let's say I have
another triangle.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.680
I'll draw this one big.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.330
There you go.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.380
That's my triangle.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.160
That is the right angle.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.870
This side is 24.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.390
This side is 12.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.000
We'll call this side
right here b.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.900
Now, once again, always identify
the hypotenuse.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.270
That's the longest side,
the side opposite

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.070
the 90 degree angle.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.620
You might say, hey, I don't know
that's the longest side.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.020
I don't know what b is yet.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.980
How do I know this is longest?

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.670
And there, in that situation,
you say, well, it's the side

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.380
opposite the 90 degree angle.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:31.070
So if that's the hypotenuse,
then this squared plus that

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.680
squared is going to be
equal to 24 squared.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.370
So the Pythagorean theorem-- b
squared plus 12 squared is

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.100
equal to 24 squared.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.930
Or we could subtract 12 squared
from both sides.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.350
We say, b squared is equal to
24 squared minus 12 squared,

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:55.200
which we know is 144, and that
b is equal to the square root

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.660
of 24 squared minus
12 squared.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.490
Now I'm tempted to use a
calculator, and I'll give into

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.990
the temptation.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.770
So let's do it.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.550
The last one was so painful,
I'm still recovering.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:20.350
So 24 squared minus 12 squared
is equal to 24.78.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.110
So this actually turns into--
let me do it without a-- well,

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.730
I'll do it halfway.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:30.390
24 squared minus 12 squared
is equal to 432.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:37.000
So b is equal to the
square root of 432.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.080
And let's factor this again.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.680
We saw what the answer is, but
maybe we can write it in kind

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.830
of a simplified radical form.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:47.090
So this is 2 times 216.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.740
216, I believe, is
a-- let me see.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.570
I believe that's a
perfect square.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.460
So let me take the square
root of 216.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.550
Nope, not a perfect square.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.940
So 216, let's just keep going.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.700
216 is 2 times 108.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:10.220
108 is, we could say,
4 times what?

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:18.050
25 plus another 2-- 4 times
27, which is 9 times 3.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.470
So what do we have here?

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:24.550
We have 2 times 2, times 4, so
this right here is a 16.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.430
16 times 9 times 3.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.720
Is that right?

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.260
I'm using a different
calculator.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:35.580
16 times 9 times 3
is equal to 432.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.700
So this is going to be equal
to-- b is equal to the square

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:45.490
root of 16 times 9, times 3,
which is equal to the square

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.450
root of 16, which is 4 times the
square root of 9, which is

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.660
3, times the square root
of 3, which is equal

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.420
to 12 roots of 3.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.540
So b is 12 times the
square root of 3.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.560
Hopefully you found
that useful.
