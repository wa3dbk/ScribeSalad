00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.340
 

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.190
What I want to do in this video
is talk a little bit

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.500
about the kidney-- and this is
a big picture of a kidney--

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.200
and to talk about how it
operates at its-- I guess you

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.500
could call it its smallest
functional level and that's

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.420
the nephron.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.700
So we're going to talk about
the kidney and the nephron.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.780
And I think you might already
know the kidney.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.680
We have two of them.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.270
They're the organ that, I guess,
is most famous for

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.860
producing or allowing
us to excrete waste.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.229
But part of that process, it
also helps us maintain our

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.410
water, the correct level, and
actually the amount of salts

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.010
or electrolytes we have and our
blood pressure, but I'll

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.870
just say maintain water.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.960
And it also produces hormones
and things, and I'm not going

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.190
to go into a lot of detail
on that right now.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.580
I really just want to focus on
these first two to kind of

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.210
just understand the overview
function of the kidney.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.130
And most of us have
two of these.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.480
They're kind of closer to our
back on either sides of our

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.210
spine behind our liver.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.470
And this is a zoomed-in
version of it.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.239
If you're watching this in full
screen, it's not going to

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.150
be as big as this picture is,
but we've sliced it so we can

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.980
see what's going on
inside the kidney.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.130
Just to understand the different
parts here, just

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.660
because it will actually be
significant when we start

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.520
talking about the functional
units or the nephron within

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.930
the kidney, this area right here
from here to here, this

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.910
is called the renal cortex.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.550
Whenever we talk about something
with the kidney, if

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.110
you see a renal anything, that's
actually referring to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.580
the kidney.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.800
So this right here is
a renal cortex, that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.230
outer part right there.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.380
And then this area right here,
this is the renal medulla.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.480
And medulla comes from middle.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.050
So you can almost view it as
the middle of the kidney.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.400
 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.680
Besides just understanding these
words, we're going to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.350
see that they actually play a
very important role in this

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.720
actual filtration or this
excretion of waste and this

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.730
ability to not dump too much
water or excrete too much

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.020
water when we're trying to
filter out our blood.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.720
So I've said before, and you
might have heard it already

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.330
from other lectures or from
other teachers, that the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.490
functional unit of the kidney
is the nephron.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.510
 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.040
And the reason why it's called
a functional unit-- I'll put

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.290
it in quotes-- is because that's
the level at which

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.250
these two things
are happening.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.980
The two major functions of the
kidney: the waste excretion

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.580
and the maintenance
of the water level

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.730
in our blood system.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.730
So just to get an idea of how a
nephron fits in within this

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.840
picture of a kidney-- I got this
picture from Wikipedia.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.420
The artist tried to draw a
couple of nephrons over here.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.630
So a nephron will look something
like this, and it

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.680
dips down into the medulla, and
then it goes back into the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.640
cortex, and then it dumps into
collecting ducts, and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.620
essentially the fluid will end
up in the ureters right here

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.960
and end up in our urinary
bladder that we can later

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.880
excrete when we find
a suitable time.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.770
But that's about-- I guess
you can imagine

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.780
the length of a nephron.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.030
This is where it starts and
then it dips down again.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.840
So multiple nephrons are going
to keep doing that, but

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840
they're super thin.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.140
These tubes or these tubules,
maybe I should

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.800
say, are super thin.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.190
Your average kidney will contain
on the order of one

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.440
million nephrons.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.320
 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.470
You can't really say, my
nephrons are microscopic.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.390
They kind of have a-- at least
their length when they dip

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.880
down, you can say, I can
see that distance.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.510
You can still jam a lot of them
inside of one kidney.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.580
With that said, let's actually
figure out how a nephron

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.880
filters the blood and actually
makes sure that not too much

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.530
water or not too much of the
good stuff in our blood ends

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.330
up the urine.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.070
So let me draw here a nephron.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.200
So I'm going to start
like this.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.850
We'll start with
the blood flow.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.480
So the blood's going to come
in an arteriole -- that's an

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.780
arterial capillary,
you could say.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.589
So it's going to come
in like that.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.820
This is actually called
the afferent arteriole.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.230
You don't have to know
the names, but you

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.480
might see that sometime.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.670
 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.170
Blood is coming in.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.060
Then it goes into this
big windy place.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.810
It really winds around
like that.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.060
This is called the glomerulus.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.490
 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.870
And then it leaves via the
efferent arteriole.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:57.100
 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.610
Efferent just means away
from the center.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.750
Afferent towards, efferent
away from the center.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.340
And I'll talk about it more
in the future, but it's

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.830
interesting that we're
still dealing with an

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.040
artery at this point.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.770
It's still oxygenated blood.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.260
Normally, when we leave a
capillary system like the

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.950
glomerulus right there, we're
normally dealing with the

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.650
venous system, but here we're
still an arterial system.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.280
And it's probably because
arterial systems have higher

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.760
blood pressure, and what we
need to do is we need to

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.730
squeeze fluid and stuff that's
dissolved in the fluid out of

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.970
the blood and in the glomerulus
right here.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.420
So this glomerulus is very
porous and it's surrounded by

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.460
other cells.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.710
This is kind of a
cross-section.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.470
 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.200
It's surrounded like that by
this structure, and these are

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.350
cells here so you can imagine
these are all cells over here.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.980
And, of course, the actual
capillaries have cells that

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.960
line them so there
are cells here.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.140
So when I draw these lines,
these lines are actually made

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.420
up of little cells.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.540
What happens is the
blood comes in

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.900
at really high pressure.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.960
This is very porous.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.410
These cells out here, they're
called podocytes.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.880
They're a little bit more
selective in what gets

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.630
filtered out, and essentially
about a fifth of the fluid

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.640
that's coming in ends up going
into this space right here

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.550
that's called the
Bowman's space.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.690
Well, actually, this whole
thing is called

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.940
the Bowman's capsule.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.270
 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.650
It's a sphere with an opening in
here that the capillary can

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.050
kind of wind around in, and the
space right here, this is

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.890
the Bowman's space.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.270
It's the space inside the
Bowman's capsule, and the

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.150
whole thing has cells.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.200
All these structures are
obviously made-- or maybe not

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.830
so obviously-- they're
made up of cells.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.730
And so we end up having
filtrate in it.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.190
Filtrate is just the stuff
that gets squeezed out.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.380
We can't call it urine just yet
because there's a lot of

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.720
steps that have to occur for
it to earn the name urine.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.400
So it's only filtrate right now,
and essentially what get

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.220
squeezed out, I said it's about
a fifth of the fluid,

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.450
and things that are easily
dissolved in fluid, so small

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:16.430
ions, sodium, maybe some small
molecules like glucose, maybe

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.570
some amino acids.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.086
There are tons of stuff
in here, but this is

00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:22.080
just to give an idea.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.370
The things that do not get
filtered are things like red

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:31.340
blood cells or larger molecules,
larger proteins.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.510
They will not get filtered.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.700
It's mainly the micromolecules
that'll get filtered, that'll

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.910
be part of this filtrate
that shows up here

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.390
in the Bowman space.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.110
Now, the rest of what the
nephron does, the Bowman's

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.960
capsule is kind of the beginning
of the nephron, and

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.280
just to get an idea of our big
picture of our kidney, let's

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.760
say we're near an arteriole.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.980
This is a Bowman's capsule
right here.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.075
It looks something like that,
and the whole nephron is going

00:07:59.075 --> 00:08:00.580
to be convoluted like this.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.150
It's going to dip down into
the medulla, and then come

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.220
back, and then it's going to
eventually dump into a

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.980
collecting duct, and I'll
talk more about that.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.250
So what I've drawn just here,
this is a zoomed-in version of

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.660
that part right there.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.250
Now what I want to do is zoom
out a little bit because I'm

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.550
going to run out of space.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.290
So let me zoom out.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.220
So we had our arteriole go in.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.520
It gets all bunched in the
glomerulus, and then most of

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.160
the blood leaves, but
one-fifth of it gets

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.390
essentially filtered in to
the Bowman's capsule.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.780
That's the Bowman's capsule
right there.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.450
I've just zoomed out
a little bit.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.530
So we have our filtrate here.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.080
Maybe I'll make it a
little bit yellow.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.440
 

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.800
The filtrate that just comes out
at this point, sometimes

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.270
it's called the glomerular
filtrate because it's been

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.170
filtered by the glomerulus, but
it's also been filtered by

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.060
those podocyte cells
on the inside of

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.470
the Bowman's capsule.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.120
But now it's ready to go
to the proximal tubule.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.080
 

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.530
Let me draw something
like this.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.300
And obviously, this is not
exactly what it looks like,

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.580
but it gives you the sense.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:17.470
This right here, this is
the proximal tubule.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.560
And it sounds like a very fancy
word, but proximal just

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.590
means near and tubule, you can
imagine, is just a small tube.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.740
So it's a small tube that's
near the beginning.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.880
That's why it's called
a proximal tubule.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.700
And it has two parts.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.245
The whole thing is
often called a

00:09:31.245 --> 00:09:32.870
proximal convoluted tubule.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.870
 

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.390
That's because it's
all convoluted.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.830
The way I've drawn
it is all curvy.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.750
And I just drew it curvy
in two dimensions.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.170
It's actually curvy in
three dimensions.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.470
But the reality is there's a
curvy part and then there's a

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.220
straight part near the end
of the proximal tubule.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.570
So we'll call this whole thing
the proximal tubule.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.060
This is the convoluted part.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.670
That's the straight
part, but we don't

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.340
have to get too picky.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.040
But the whole point of this part
of the nephron-- and just

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.810
to remember where we are, we're
now at this point of the

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.890
nephron right there-- the
whole point is to start

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.700
reabsorbing some of the stuff
that is in the filtrate that

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.670
we don't want to lose.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.880
We don't want to lose glucose.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.900
That's hard-earned stuff
that we ate that

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.090
was good for energy.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.790
We don't want to lose
necessarily as much sodium.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:24.040
We've seen in multiple videos
that that's a useful ion to

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.480
have around.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.490
We don't want to lose
amino acids.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.490
Those are useful for building up
proteins and other things.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.320
So these are things we don't
want to lose so we start

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.670
absorbing them back.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.840
I'll do a whole video on exactly
how that happens, but

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.480
it's done actively.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.575
Since we're using ATP, and just
as a bit of a summary,

00:10:40.575 --> 00:10:43.900
you're using ATP to actually
pump out the sodium and then

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.660
that actually helps bring
in the other things.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.160
That's just kind of a tidbit
on what's happening.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.190
So we're reabsorbing, so just
imagine what's happening.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.370
You have cells lining the
proximal tubule right now.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.310
And actually, they have little
things that jut out.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.790
I'll do a whole video on that
because it's actually

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.630
interesting.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.910
So you have cells out here.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.660
On the other side of the cells,
you have an arterial

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.110
system, or a capillary system,
I should say, actually.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.080
So let's say you have a
capillary system here that is

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.580
very close to the cells lining
the proximal tubule, and so

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.140
this stuff actually gets
actively pumped, especially

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.000
the sodium, but all of it, using
energy, gets pumped back

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.890
into the blood selectively,
and maybe a

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:25.870
little bit of our water.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:32.480
So we're pumping back some
sodium, some glucose, and

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.710
we'll start pumping a little
bit of the water back in

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.540
because we don't want to
lose all of that water.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.620
If all of the water that was
originally in the filtrate we

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.560
were just leaving in our urine,
we'd be excreting

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.240
gallons and gallons of water
every day, which we do not

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.310
want to do.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.500
So that's the whole point.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.130
We're starting the absorption
process.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.400
And then we'll enter the loop
of Henle, and actually, this

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.610
is, in my mind, the most

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.370
interesting part of the nephron.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.930
So we're entering the loop of
Henle, and it dips down, and

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.680
then comes back up.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.740
And so most of the length
of the nephron

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.900
is the loop of Henle.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.916
And if I go back to this diagram
right here, if I'm

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:13.270
talking about the loop of Henle,
I'm talking about this

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.440
whole thing right there.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.450
And you can see something
interesting here.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.050
It crosses the border between
the cortex, this light brown

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.820
part, and the renal medulla,
this kind of reddish or orange

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.170
part right there, and it does
that for a very good reason.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.000
I'm going to draw it here.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.710
So let's say this is the
dividing line right here.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.460
This right here was
the cortex.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.550
This right here is
the medulla.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.060
So the whole point-- well,
there's two points

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.590
of the loop of Henle.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.570
 

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:57.830
One point is to make the renal
medulla salty, and it does

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.502
this by actively pumping
out salts.

00:13:00.502 --> 00:13:03.090
So it actively pumps out salts,
and it does that in the

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.140
ascending part of the
loop of Henle.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:12.390
So it actively pumps out salts:
sodium, potassium,

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.440
chloride, or chlorine,
I should say.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.500
Chlorine ions.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.990
It actively pumps out these
salts right here to make the

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:27.670
entire medulla salty, or if we
think about it in terms of

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.990
kind of osmosis, make
it hypertonic.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.320
You have more solute out here
than you have in the filtrate

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.010
that's going through
the tubules.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.240
And it uses ATP to do this.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.910
All of this stuff requires ATP
to actively pump against a

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.570
concentration gradient.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:46.110
So this is salty and it's
salty for a reason.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.820
It's not just to take back these
salts from the filtrate,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.230
although that's part of the
reason, but by making this

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.620
salty, the ascending part is
only permeable to these salts

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.270
and these ions.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.830
It's not permeable to water.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:06.110
 

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.050
The descending part of the
loop of Henle is only

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.300
permeable to water.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.390
 

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.380
So what's going to happen?

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.430
If this is all salty because the
ascending part is actively

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.260
pumping out salt, what's going
to happen to water as it goes

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.110
down the descending loop?

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.870
Well, it's hypertonic
out here.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.830
Water will naturally want to go
and kind of try to make the

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.540
concentrations balance out.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.510
I've done a whole
video on that.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.680
It doesn't happen by magic.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.710
And so the water will-- because
this is hypertonic,

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.620
it's more salty, and this is
only permeable to water, the

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.930
water will leave the membrane on
the descending part of the

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.560
loop of Henle right now.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.710
And this is a major part
of water reabsorption.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.870
I've thought a lot about why
don't we use ATP somehow to

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.360
actively pump water?

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.850
And the answer there
is, there's no

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.650
easy way to do that.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:01.130
Biological systems are good at
using ATP to pump out ions,

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.360
but it can't actively
pump out water.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.360
Water's kind of a hard thing
for proteins to operate on.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.580
So the solution is to make it
salty out here by pumping out

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.540
ions and then water, if you
make this porous only to

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.750
water, water will naturally
flow out.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.170
So this is a major mechanism of
gaining back a lot of the

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.820
water that gets filtered
out up here.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.390
And the reason why this is so
long is to give time for this

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.560
water to secrete out, and that's
why it dips nice and

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.490
pretty far down into
this salty portion.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.710
So then we'll leave the loop of
Henle and then we're almost

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.110
done with the nephron.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.790
Then we're in another convoluted
tubule, and you

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.710
might even guess the name of
this convoluted tubule.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.860
If this was the proximal one,
this is the distal one.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.070
And actually, just to make my
drawing correct, it actually

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:51.560
passes very close to the
Bowman's capsule, so let me do

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.810
it in a different color.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:57.230
 

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.920
The distal convoluted tubule
actually goes pretty close to

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.970
the Bowman's capsule.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.000
And once again, I've made
it all convoluted in two

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.740
dimensions, but it's actually
convoluted in three.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.840
And it's not that long, but I
just had to get over here and

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.830
I wanted to get over that
point right there.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:12.830
It's called distal.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.510
Distal is further away.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.750
It's convoluted and
it's a tubule.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:24.450
So this right here is the distal
convoluted tubule, and

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.690
here we have more reabsorption:
calcium, more

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:28.820
sodium reabsorption.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.250
We're just reabsorbing more
things that we didn't want to

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.600
lose in the first place.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.180
There's a lot of things we
could talk about what get

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.330
reabsorbed, but this is
just the overview.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.870
And we're also reabsorbing a
little bit of more water.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.420
But then at the end
right here, our

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.800
filtrate has been processed.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.290
A lot of the water's
been taken out.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.760
It's a lot more concentrated.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.700
We've reabsorbed a
lot of the salts,

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.290
electrolytes that we want.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.100
We've reabsorbed the glucose and
a lot of the amino acids.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.770
Everything that we want,
we've taken back.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.630
We've reabsorbed.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.710
And so this is mainly waste
products and water that we

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.670
don't need anymore and then
this gets dumped into

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:02.920
collecting ducts.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.140
 

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.230
And you can kind of view this
as the trash chute of the

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.384
kidney, where multiple
nephrons are going

00:17:12.384 --> 00:17:13.740
to dump into this.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.960
So that might be the distal
tubule of another nephron

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:22.010
right here and this is a
collecting duct, which is just

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.569
a tube that's collecting
all the

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:27.040
byproducts of the nephrons.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.620
And the interesting thing is
that the collecting duct

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.040
further goes into the
medulla again.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.210
It goes into the medulla again
to the salty part again.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.090
So if we're talking about the
collecting duct, maybe the

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:40.400
collecting duct's coming back
into the medulla, collecting

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.070
all of the filtrate from
the different nephrons.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.860
And because it goes back through
that super salty spot

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.240
in the medulla, we actually
have four hormones called

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.540
anti-diarrhetic hormone that
can dictate how porous this

00:17:54.540 --> 00:18:00.910
collecting tube is, and if it
makes it very porous, it

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.430
allows more water to leave as we
go to the medulla, because

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.110
this is very salty,
so the water will

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.690
leave if this is porous.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.740
And when we do that, what that
does is it makes the

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.100
filtrate-- and we can maybe
start calling it urine now--

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.170
even more concentrated so we
lose even less water, and it

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.490
keeps collecting, collecting,
collecting until we end up

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.650
here, and it leaves the kidney
and goes via our ureters to

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.030
the urinary bladder.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.200
So hopefully, you found
that helpful.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.650
I think the neatest thing here
is just how we actively

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.150
reabsorb the water and how we--
well, actually, in my

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.770
mind, that is the neatest part
in the loop of Henle.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.270
