00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.360
Arguably, one of the most
important molecules in all of

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.150
biology is ATP.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.620
ATP, which stands for adenosine
triphosphate.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.340
Which sounds very fancy.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.270
But all you need to remember,
or any time you see ATP

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.180
hanging around in some type
of biochemical reaction,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.940
something in your brain should
say, hey, we're dealing with

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.360
biological energy.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.690
Or another way to think of ATP
is the currency-- I'll put

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.645
that in quotes-- of
biological energy.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.000
So how is it a currency
of energy?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.820
Well ATP stores energy
in its bonds.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.040
And I'll explain what that
means in a second.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.220
And before we learn what
an adenosine group or a

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.870
3-phosphate group looks like,
you can just take a bit of a

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.010
leap of faith, that you could
imagine ATP as being made up

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.160
of something called-- let me
do it in a nice color-- an

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.950
adenosine group right there.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.020
And then attached to it you'll
have three phosphates.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.320
Not might, you will.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.150
You'll have three phosphates
attached to it just like that.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.970
And this is ATP.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.450
Adenosine triphosphate.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.850
Tri- meaning three
phosphate groups.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.235
Now if you take adenosine
triphosphate and you hydrolyze

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.460
this bond, which means
if you take this in

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.610
the presence of water.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.250
So let me just throw
some water in here.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.610
Let's say I have H2O.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.450
Then one of these phosphate
groups will break off.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.100
Essentially part of this water
joins to this phosphate group,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.900
and then part of it
joins to this

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.900
phosphate group right there.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.590
And I'll show you that in a
little bit more detail.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.960
But I want to give you the
big picture first.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.430
What you're left with is an
adenosine group that now has

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.680
two phosphates on it.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.520
And this is called adenosine
diphosphate or ADP.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.860
Before we had triphosphate,
which means three phosphates.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.330
Now we have diphosphate,
adenosine triphosphate, so

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.650
instead of a tri here
we just write a di.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.590
Which means you have two
phosphate groups.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.760
And so the ATP has been
hydrolyzed, or you have broken

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.790
off one of these phosphate
groups.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.550
And so now you're left with
ADP and then an extra

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.550
phosphate group right here.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.370
And-- and this is the whole key
to everything that we talk

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.660
about when we're dealing
with ATP-- and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.910
you have some energy.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.590
And so when I talk about ATP
being the currency of

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.500
biological energy,
this is why.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.220
Is that if you have ATP, and if
you were to-- through some

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.960
chemical reaction-- you pop off
this phosphate right here.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.470
It's going to generate energy.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.960
That energy can be used
for just general heat.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.810
Or you could couple this
reaction with other reactions

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.830
that require energy.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.960
And then those reactions will
be able to move forward.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.490
So, I draw these circles.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.040
Adenosine and phosphates.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.010
And really, this is all
you need to know.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.780
Already, what I've shown you
right here is really all you

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.660
need to know to operationally
think of how ATP operates in

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.390
most biological systems.
And if you want to

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.740
go the other way.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.020
If you have energy and you
want to generate ATP, the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.050
reaction will just
go this way.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.430
Energy plus a phosphate group
plus some ADP, you

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.610
can go back to ATP.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.940
And so this is stored energy.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.520
So this side of the equation
is stored energy.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.220
And this side of the equation
is used energy.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.810
And this is really all you--
well this is 95% of what you

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.430
need to know to really
understand the function of ATP

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.450
in biological systems. It's just
a store of energy when

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.150
you-- ATP has energy.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.070
When you break a phosphate
off, it generates energy.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.700
And then if you want to go from
ADP and a phosphate back

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.580
to ATP, you have to use
energy up again.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.040
So if you have ATP, that's
a source of energy.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.580
If you have ADP and you want
ATP, you need to use energy.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.500
And so far I've just drawn a
circle with an A around it and

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.460
said that's an adenosine.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.840
But sometimes I think it's
satisfying to see what the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.180
molecule actually looks like.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.010
So I cut and pasted this
from Wikipedia.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.310
And the reason why I didn't show
this to you initially is

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.829
because this looks
very complicated.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.780
While the conceptual reason
why ATP is the currency of

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.710
energy, I think is fairly
straightforward.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.200
When it has three phosphates,
one phosphate can break off.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.310
And then that'll result
with some energy being

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.640
put into the system.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.560
Or if you want to attach
that phosphate you

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.560
have to use up energy.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.910
That's just the basic
principle of ATP.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.010
But this is its actual
structure.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.220
But even here we can break it
down and see that it's really

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.740
not too bad.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.790
We said adenosine.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.490
Let me draw the adenosine
group.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.660
We have adenosine.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.220
This right here is adenosine.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.070
This part of the molecule
right there.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.470
That is adenosine.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.340
And for those of you that have
really paid attention to some

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.560
of the other videos, you might
recognize that this part of

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.660
adenosine-- so this is called
adenosine, but this part right

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.820
here-- is adenine.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.110
Which is the same adenine that
makes up the nucleotides that

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.460
are the backbone of DNA.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.870
So some of these molecules in
biological systems have more

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.580
than one use.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.910
This is the same adenine
where we talk

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.170
about adenine and guanine.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.100
This is a purine.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.370
And there's also the
pyrimidines, but I won't go

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.920
into that much.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.180
But that's the same molecule.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.380
So that's just an interesting
thing.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.950
The same thing that makes up DNA
is also part of what makes

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.940
up these energy currency
molecules.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.700
So the adenine makes part of
the adenosine part of ATP.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.210
And then the other part
right here is ribose.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.970
Which you might also recognize
from RNA, ribonucleic acid.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.040
That's because you have
ribose dealing

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.150
in the whole situation.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.190
But I won't go into that much.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.970
But ribose is just
a 5-carbon sugar.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.340
When they don't draw the
molecule, it's implied that

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.950
it's a carbon.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.160
So this is one carbon right
there, two carbons, three

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.650
carbons, four carbons,
five carbons.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.720
And that's just nice to know.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.840
It's nice to know that they
share parts of their

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.700
molecules with DNA.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.380
And these are familiar building
blocks that we see

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.260
over and over again.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.920
But I want to emphasize that
knowing this, or memorizing

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.270
this, in no way will help you
understand the simpler

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.360
understanding of ATP
just being what

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.520
drives biological reactions.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.520
And then here I drew 3-phosphate
groups, and this

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.350
is their actual molecular
structure.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.490
Their Lewis structures
right here.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.170
That's one phosphate group.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.530
This is the second
phosphate group.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.320
And this is a third
phosphate group.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.970
Just like that.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.830
When I first learned this, my
first question was, OK I can

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.080
take this as a leap of faith
that if you take one of these

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.590
phosphate groups off or if this
bond is hydrolyzed, that

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.020
somehow that releases energy.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.880
And then I kind of went on and
answered all the questions

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.570
that I had to answer.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.950
But why does it release
energy?

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.920
What is it about this bond
that releases energy?

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.690
Remember all bonds are are
electrons being shared with

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.830
different atoms.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.190
So the best way you could think
about it is right here.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.900
These electrons that are being
shared right across this bond,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.620
or this electron that's being
shared right across this bond,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.470
and it's coming from
the phosphate.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.680
I won't draw the periodic
table right now.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.490
But you know the phosphate has
five electrons to share.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.370
It's less electronegative than
oxygen, so oxygen will kind of

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.460
hog the electron.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.310
But this electron is
very uncomfortable.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.930
There's a couple of reasons
why it is uncomfortable.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.700
It's in a high energy state.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.250
One reason why is, you
have all these

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.720
negative oxygens here.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.590
So they kind of want to push
away from each other.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.960
So these electrons in this bond
really can't kind of get

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.220
close to the nucleus.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.670
They'll go into kind of
a low energy state.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.000
All of this is more of an
analogy than the reality.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.210
We all know that electrons
can get quite complex.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.430
And there's a whole quantum
mechanical world.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.380
But that's a good way
to think of it.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.840
That these molecules want to
be away from each other.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.330
But you have these bonds, so
this electron, it's kind of in

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.395
a high energy state.

00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:17.250
It's further from the nucleuses
of these two atoms

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.580
than it might want to be.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.220
And when you pop this phosphate
group off, all of a

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.870
sudden these electrons
can enter into a

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.110
lower energy state.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.080
And that generates energy.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.030
So this energy right here is
always-- in fact in any

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.409
chemical reaction where they say
energy is generated, it's

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.200
always from electrons going
to a lower energy state.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.570
That's what it's all about.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.610
And later in future videos
when we do cellular

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.480
respiration and glycolysis and
all that, whenever we show

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.330
energy, it's really from
electrons going from

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.900
uncomfortable states to more
comfortable states.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.640
And in the process they
generate energy.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.620
If I'm in a plane or I'm jumping
out of a plane, I have

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.180
a lot of potential energy
right when I

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.050
jump out of the plane.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.280
And you can view that as
an uncomfortable state.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.350
And then when I'm sitting on my
couch watching football, I

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.690
have a lot less potential
energy, so that's a very

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.500
comfortable state.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.790
And I could have generated
a lot of energy

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.480
falling to my couch.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.590
But I don't knows.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.540
My analogies always break
down at some point.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.230
Now, the last thing I want to go
over for you is exactly how

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.530
this reaction happens.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.410
So far you could turn off this
video and you could already

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.680
deal with ATP as it is used
in 95% of biology,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.790
especially AP Bio.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.630
But I want you to understand
how this

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.320
reaction actually happens.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.110
So to do that, what I'm going
to do is copy and

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.150
paste parts of these.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.170
So I already told you that this
guy right here is going

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:51.280
to break off of the ATP.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.030
So that's the phosphate
group that breaks off.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.360
And then you have
the rest of it.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.310
You have the ADP that's
left over.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.530
So this is the ADP.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.340
I don't even have to copy and
paste all of this stuff.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.000
You can just accept that that's
the adenosine group.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.500
Just like that.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.240
So we've already said that this
thing gets hydrolyzed

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.930
off, or gets cut off and
that generates energy.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:25.770
But what I want to
do is actually

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.300
show you the mechanism.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.260
A little bit of hand-wavy
mechanism of how

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.630
this actually happens.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.825
So I said this reaction occurs
in the presence of water.

00:10:34.825 --> 00:10:37.210
So let me draw some
water here.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.040
So I have an oxygen
and a hydrogen.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.100
And then I have another
hydrogen.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.710
That's water right there.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.360
So hydrolysis is just a reaction
where you say, hey,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.420
this guy here, he wants to
bond with something or he

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.920
wants to share someone
else's electrons.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.500
So maybe this hydrogen right
here goes down here and shares

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.250
its electron with this
oxygen right here.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.320
And then this phosphorus, it has
an extra electron that it

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:06.820
needs to share.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.190
Remember it has five valence
electrons; it wants to share

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.360
them with oxygen.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.040
It has one, two, three, four
being shared right now.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.670
Well, if this hydrogen goes to
this guy, then you're left

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.980
with this blue OH right here.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.460
And this guy can share
one of the

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.810
phosphorus' extra electrons.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.190
So you get the OH
just like that.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.230
So that's the actual process
that happens.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.350
And it could go the
other way as well.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.040
I could've cleaved it here.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.740
I could have cleaved the
whole thing here.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.270
And so this guy would have
kept the oxygen and the

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.890
hydrogen would have
gone to him.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.820
And then this guy would
have taken the OH.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.540
It could happen in
either order.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.765
And so either order
would be fine.

00:11:44.765 --> 00:11:47.010
And there's one other point
I want to make.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.435
And this is a little
bit more complex.

00:11:48.435 --> 00:11:50.930
And I was even wondering whether
I wanted to make it.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.310
My whole reason why you're
kind of in a lower energy

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.510
state is, once you break apart--
actually let me go

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:00.370
down here-- is because I said,
hey, this electron is happier

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.090
when it's-- so let's say this
electron that was part of this

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.760
phosphorus is happier now.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.540
It's in a lower energy
state because

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.950
it's not being stretched.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.350
It's not having to spend time
between that guy and that guy

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.050
because this molecule and this
molecule want to spread apart

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.560
because they have negative
charges.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.910
That's part of the reason.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.410
The other reason why, and we'll
talk about this in a lot

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.540
more detail when we learn more
about organic chemistry, is

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.940
that this has more resonance.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.770
More resonance structures or
resonance configurations.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.360
And all that means is that these
electrons, these extra

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.240
electrons here, they can kind
of move about between the

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.170
different atoms. And that makes
it even more stable.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.910
So if you imagine that this
oxygen right here has an extra

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.700
electron with it.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.840
So that extra electron right
there, it could come down here

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.180
and then form a double bond
with the phosphorus.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.810
And then this electron right
here can then jump back up to

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:55.870
that oxygen.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.400
And then that could happen on
this side and on that side.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.990
And I won't go into the details,
but that's another

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.800
reason why it makes
it more stable.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.590
If you've already taken organic
chemistry, you can

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.080
kind of appreciate that more.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.570
But I don't want to get
all into the weeds.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.120
The most important thing to
remember about ATP is that

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.460
when you cleave off a phosphate
group it generates

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.950
energy that can drive all sorts
of biological functions,

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.570
like growth and movement,
muscle movement, muscle

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.900
contraction, electrical
impulses in

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.290
nerves and the brain.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.310
So this is the main battery
or currency of energy in

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.540
biological systems. That's the
main thing that you really

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.790
just need to remember
about ATP.
