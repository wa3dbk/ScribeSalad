00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.580
Welcome back.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.930
I will now introduce you to
the concept of momentum.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.800
And the letter for momentum is,
in physics, or at least in

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.230
mechanics, it's the letter P.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.890
P for momentum.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.010
And I assume that's because the
letter M has already been

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.200
used for mass, which
is I guess an even

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.400
more fundamental idea.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.280
So P for momentum.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.180
So what is momentum?

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.030
Well, you probably have
a general idea of it.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.740
If you see a big guy running
really fast, they'll say, he

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.990
has a lot of momentum.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.440
And if there's a big guy running
really fast and a

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.940
small guy running really fast,
most people would say, well,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.530
the big guy has more momentum.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.980
Maybe they don't have a
quantitative sense of why

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040
they're saying that, but
they just feel that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.910
that must be true.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.070
And if we look at the definition
of momentum, it'll

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.730
make sense.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.450
The definition of momentum is
equal to mass times velocity.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.060
So something with, say, a
medium mass and a huge

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.400
velocity is going to have
a big momentum.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.340
Or something with maybe a medium
mass, but-- the other

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.770
way around.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.860
I forgot what I just said.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.230
So medium mass and big velocity,
huge momentum, or

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.940
the other way around.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.280
Huge mass, medium velocity
would have maybe the same

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.230
momentum, but it would still
have a big momentum.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.910
Or another way of doing momentum
is how little you

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.050
would like to be in the way of
that object as it passes by.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.610
How unpleasant would it be
to be hit by that object?

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.060
That's a good way of thinking
about momentum.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.603
So momentum is mass
times velocity.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.480
So how does it relate
to everything we've

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.420
been learning so far?

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.270
So we know that force is equal
to mass times acceleration.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.030
And what's acceleration?

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.420
Well acceleration is just
change in velocity.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.580
So we also know that force is
equal to mass times change in

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.850
velocity per unit
of time, right?

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.890
Per change in time.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.720
T for time.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.550
So force is also equal
to-- well, mass

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.290
times change in velocity.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.039
Mass, let's assume that
mass doesn't change.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.000
So that could also be viewed
as the change in mass times

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.300
velocity in the unit
amount of time.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.130
And this is a little tricky
here, I said, you know, the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.960
mass times the change in
velocity, that's the same

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.230
thing as the change in the
mass times the velocity,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.160
assuming the mass
doesn't change.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.960
And here we have mass times
velocity, which is momentum.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.310
So force can also be
viewed as change in

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.026
momentum per unit of time.

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:40.420
And I'll introduce
you to another

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.810
concept called impulse.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.990
And impulse kind of means
that you think it means.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.640
An impulse is defined
as force times time.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.980
And I just want to introduce
this to you just in case you

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.760
see it on the exam or whatever,
show you it's not a

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.010
difficult concept.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.120
So force times change in time,
or time, if you assume time

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.670
starts at time 0.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.805
But force times change in time
is equal to impulse.

00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:04.430
I actually don't know-- I should
look up what letters

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.720
they use for impulse.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.490
But another way of viewing
impulse is force

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.360
times change in time.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.960
Well that's the same thing as
change in momentum over change

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.840
in time times change in time.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.110
Right?

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.160
Because this is just the
same thing as force.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.210
And that's just change
in momentum, so

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.460
that's impulse as well.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.940
And the unit of impulse
is the joule.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.450
And we'll go more into
the joule when we do

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.200
work in all of that.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.500
And if this confuses you, don't
worry about it too much.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.050
The main thing about momentum is
that you realize it's mass

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.100
times velocity.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.700
And since force is change in
momentum per unit of time, if

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.220
you don't have any external
forces on a system or, on say,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.960
on a set of objects, their
combined, or their net

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.070
momentum won't change.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.550
And that comes from
Newton's Laws.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.260
The only way you can get a
combined change in momentum is

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.150
if you have some type of net
force acting on the system.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.770
So with that in mind,
let's do some

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.340
momentum problems. Whoops.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.330
Invert colors.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.450
OK.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.470
So let's say we have a car.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.029
Say it's a car.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.860
Let me do some more interesting
colors.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.340
A car with a magenta bottom.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.390
And it is, let's see, what
does this problem say?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.100
It's 1,000 kilograms. So
a little over a ton.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.410
And it's moving at 9 meters
per second east. So its

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.550
velocity is equal to 9 meters
per second east, or to the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.290
right in this example.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.460
And it strikes a stationary
2, 000 kilogram truck.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.710
So here's my truck.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.450
Here's my truck and this is
a 2,000 kilogram truck.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.580
And it's stationary, so
the velocity is 0.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.330
And when the car hits the truck,
let's just say that it

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.600
somehow gets stuck in the truck
and they just both keep

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.740
moving together.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.340
So they get stuck together.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.640
The question is, what is the
resulting speed of the

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.050
combination truck and car
after the collision?

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.190
Well, all we have to do is
think about what is the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.120
combined momentum before
the collision?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.610
Well let's see.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.800
The momentum of the car is going
to be the mass times the

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.850
car-- mass of the car.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.530
Well the total momentum is going
to the mass of the car

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:43.180
times the velocity of the car
plus the mass of the truck

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.250
times the velocity
of the truck.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.220
And this is before they
hit each other.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.370
So what's the mass of the car?

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.660
That's 1,000.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.760
What's the velocity
of the car?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.370
It's 9 meters per second.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.110
So as you can imagine, a unit of
momentum would be kilogram

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.130
meters per second.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.990
So it's 1,000 times 9 kilogram
meters per second, but I won't

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.950
write that right now just to
keep things simple, or so I

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:06.960
save space.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.575
And then the mass of
the truck is 2,000.

00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:10.735
And what's its velocity?

00:06:10.735 --> 00:06:11.540
Well, it's 0.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.480
It's stationary initially.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.380
So the initial momentum of the
system-- this is 2,000 times

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:24.080
0-- is 9,000 plus 0, which
equals 9,000 kilogram meters

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.090
per second.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.440
That's the momentum before
the car hits

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.970
the back of the truck.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.170
Now what happens after the car
hits the back of the truck?

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.520
So let's go to that situation.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.230
So we have the truck.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.860
I'll draw it a little
less neatly.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.050
And then you have the car and
it's probably a little bit--

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.040
well, I won't go into whether
it's banged up and whether it

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.360
released heat and all of that.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.060
Let's assume that there was
nothing-- if this is a simple

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.830
problem that we can do.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.700
So if we assume that,
there would be

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.990
no change in momentum.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.410
Because we're saying that
there's no net forces acting

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.010
on the system.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.910
And when I say system, I
mean the combination of

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.410
the car and the truck.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.580
So what we're saying is, is
this combination, this new

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.100
vehicle called a car truck, its
momentum will have to be

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.070
the same as the car and the
truck's momentum when they

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.600
were separate.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.780
So what do we know about
this car truck object?

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.330
Well we know its new mass.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.050
The car truck object,
it will be the

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.290
combined mass of the two.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.550
So it's 1,000 kilograms plus
2,000 kilograms. So it's 3,000

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.690
kilograms. And now we can use
that information to figure out

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.510
its velocity.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.190
How?

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.300
Well, its momentum-- this
3,000 kilogram object's

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.440
momentum-- has to be the same
as the momentum of the two

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.510
objects before the collision.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.230
So it still has to be 9,000
kilogram meters per second.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.300
So once again, mass
times velocity.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.120
So mass is 3,000 times
the new velocity.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.580
So we could call that, I don't
know, new velocity, v sub n.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.200
That will equal 9,000.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.870
Because momentum is conserved.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.390
That's what you always
have to remember.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.630
Momentum doesn't change unless
there's a net force acting on

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.030
the system.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:13.110
Because we saw a force is change
in momentum per time.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.670
So if you have no force
in it, you have

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.626
no change in momentum.

00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:17.870
So let's just solve.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.990
Divide both sides of this by
3,000 and you get the new

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:28.460
velocity is 3 meters
per second.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.490
And that kind of makes sense.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.840
You have a relatively light
car moving at 9 meters per

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.080
second and a stationary truck.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.299
Then it smacks the truck
and they move together.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:41.690
The combined object-- and it's
going to be to the east. And

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.970
we'll do more later, but we
assume that a positive

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.310
velocity is east. If somehow we
ended up with a negative,

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.040
it would have been west. But it
makes sense because we have

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.590
a light object and a stationery,
heavy object.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.590
And when the light object hits
the stationery, heavy object,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.510
the combined objects still keeps
moving to the right, but

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:03.010
it moves at a relatively
slower speed.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.660
So hopefully that gives you a
little bit of intuition for

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.350
momentum, and that was not too
confusing of a problem.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.170
And in the next couple of
videos, I'll do more momentum

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.430
problems and then I'll introduce
you to momentum

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.350
problems in two dimensions.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.450
I will see you soon.
