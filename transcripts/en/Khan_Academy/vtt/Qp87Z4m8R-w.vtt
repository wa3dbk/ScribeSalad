00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.670
All of the phase changes we've
been doing so far have been

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.980
under constant pressure
conditions, and, in

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.940
particular, with the problems
that I've been doing with

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.480
water phase changes in the last
couple of videos, it was

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.330
at atmospheric pressure, at
least at sea level atmospheric

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.860
pressure, or at 1 atmosphere.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.290
So it was done-- well,
I'll explain this

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.450
diagram in a second.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.140
But we all know that in the
universe, pressure isn't

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.190
always constant and it
definitely isn't always

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.460
constant at 1 atmosphere.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.060
1 atmosphere was defined
as the pressure at

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.080
sea level on Earth.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.320
Obviously, pressure will vary
wildly if you go to smaller

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.460
planets or larger planets, or
have thicker atmospheres, or

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.640
if we're just doing different
types of applications dealing

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.660
with gases and liquids
and solids.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.460
So what I've drawn here
is a phase diagram.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.710
Let me write that down.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.930
And there are many forms of
phase diagrams. This is the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.480
most common form that you might
see in your chemistry

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.200
class or on some standardized
test, but what it captures is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.240
the different states of matter
and when they transition

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.590
according to temperature
and pressure.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.010
This is the phase diagram
for water.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.870
So just to understand what's
going on here, is that on this

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.485
axis, I have pressure.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.630
On the x-axis, I have
temperature, and at any given

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.650
point, this diagram will tell
you whether you're dealing

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.690
with a solid, so solid will
be here, a liquid will

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.160
be here, or a gas.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:42.160
For example, if I told you that
I was at 0 degrees, let's

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.340
say 0 degrees is right there,
if I'm at 0 degrees Celsius

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.820
and 1 atmosphere, where am I?

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.400
So 0 degrees, 1 atmosphere,
I'm right at

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.710
that point right there.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.000
So I'm at a boundary point
between solids and liquids at

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.770
1 atmosphere of pressure,
right?

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.550
This is when we're at 1
atmosphere of pressure.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.350
So this coincides with our
traditional notion of when ice

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.979
freezes or when it melts
at 0 degrees.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.290
If we made the pressure
higher, what happens?

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.340
Well, then ice starts melting at
a lower temperature, right?

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.990
So this is pressure going up,
so pressure going up, let's

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.400
say-- I don't know
what this is.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.290
This is maybe 10 atmospheres,
ten times Earth's atmospheric

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.550
pressure at sea level, then
all of a sudden, the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.670
temperature at which solid
turns into liquid-- this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.750
transition is solid to liquid
--the temperature at which

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.790
that happens will go down.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.480
Likewise, if we lower the
pressure, if we go to Denver

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.820
and it's a mile high, pressure
is lower because we have less

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.080
of the atmosphere above us,
then all of a sudden, the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.990
freezing point increases, so
the freezing point will be

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.020
something above 1 degree.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.520
This isn't drawn completely to
scale, but the idea is your

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.610
ice would actually freeze a
little bit faster and would

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.740
freeze at a higher temperature
in Denver than it would at the

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.840
bottom of the Dead Sea or in
Death Valley at some below sea

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.210
level point on the planet.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.550
Now, this transition is
the transition between

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.230
anything and gas.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.820
And we're very familiar,
this is 1 atmosphere.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.790
And remember, this is water
we're dealing with.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.520
This is the diagram for water,
so at 1 atmosphere, this is

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.530
kind of the stuff that
we're used to seeing.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.910
Let me draw a line here.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.430
So at 1 atmosphere, 0 degrees is
where solid, or ice, turns

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.780
into liquid water.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.670
And then we go up here, so we
keep going at a higher,

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.680
higher, higher temperature, and
then here, this would be,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.550
since we're at 1 atmosphere,
this is 100 degrees Celsius

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.480
right there.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.500
And that's the point at 1
atmosphere of pressure where

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.850
liquid turns into gas,
or water vaporizes,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.030
or the liquid boils.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.020
All of those are acceptable
ways to think about that.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.760
But what happens when we
go to low pressure?

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.680
Once again, let's take our
little trip to Denver.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.740
So that's Denver right there.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.970
It's not that drastic.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.500
I'm just doing that for
education purposes.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.030
Or even better, let's say Mount
Everest. Mount Everest,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.400
very low pressure there.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.120
Then our freezing point, we
already said that goes up when

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.840
you lower the pressure, and your
boiling point goes down,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.040
so it's much easier to boil
something on the top of Mount

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.870
Everest than it is to boil it at
the bottom or at the lowest

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.740
point in Death Valley
or the Dead Sea.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.750
The intuition behind that is if
I have a liquid, a bunch of

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.770
molecules in liquid form, and
they're touching each other,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.320
but they have enough kinetic
energy to move past each

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.660
other, so they're flowing past
each other, they're kind of

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.170
rubbing up against each other,
one of the reasons why they

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.620
don't just evaporate, why this
guy doesn't just jump up

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.910
there, is that there's
air above him.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.500
There's air pressure.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.570
And air pressure, we've
learned about this

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.980
when we did PV nRT.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.430
That's a bunch of gas molecules,
and the pressure

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.130
they're creating is essentially
caused by their

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.660
temperature and their
kinetic energy.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.290
And they sit there, and they
bounce, and they essentially

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.570
keep these heavier molecules
from going up.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.260
They keep them from essentially
separating from

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.610
each other and turning
into a gas.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.380
So the more pressure you have,
the harder it is for these

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.250
guys to escape.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.280
On the other hand, if we're in
a vacuum, if we're doing this

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.120
on the surface of the moon and
there's none of these guys

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.890
there, then just a little
slight bump.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.710
Even though this guy's still a
little bit attracted to over

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.750
here, they're still attracted
to each other.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.980
But just a little bit of bump,
since there's no pressure up

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.260
here on the surface of the moon,
might allow this guy to

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.840
escape and go straight
to a gas.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.670
So when you lower the pressure,
it's just that much

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.190
easier to go from liquid to gas
or even from solid to gas.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.670
And you might say, Sal,
that's a bizarre

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.960
concept, solid to gas.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.260
It turns out, if you get to low
enough pressures here, I

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.650
mean, let's say this is--
Actually, there's probably not

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.020
stuff here.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.980
This is probably close to
a vacuum right here.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.000
You could go from ice-- So if
you took ice and you were on

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.120
the moon and you were at the
right temperature-- this is

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.800
maybe some negative degrees
Celsius temperature; I don't

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.210
know what the exact temperature
is --your ice on

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.280
the moon would go directly
from ice to a gas.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.850
Because there's this huge
vacuum here, so these

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.520
molecules would say, hey,
there's all this space to fill

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.290
and if they just get bumped a
little bit, they're just going

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.230
to escape and turn into a gas.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.880
You might say, oh, Sal, that's
a strange phenomenon.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.380
It only exists on the moon.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.450
And to rebut that comment, I've
drawn the phase diagram

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.700
for carbon dioxide.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.150
It's all around you.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.590
You're exhaling it
as we speak.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.950
Your plants in the room are
hopefully inhaling it, but

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.900
carbon dioxide at 1 atmosphere
has a very different behavior

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.930
than water.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.600
This is carbon dioxide
at 1 atmosphere.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.050
Just so you know, this
scale is definitely

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.020
not drawn to scale.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.230
The difference between 1
atmosphere and 5 atmospheres

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.170
is not the same as between
5 atmospheres and 73.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.530
Likewise, this is not
drawn to scale here.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.680
This is a much larger
distance than this.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.650
If I had to really draw it to
scale, I'd have to stretch

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.180
this chart out or do a

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.100
logarithmic chart or something.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.030
But anyway, I was talking
about carbon dioxide.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.340
So this is carbon dioxide solid,
and this is gas, and

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.880
this is liquid carbon dioxide.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:46.120
So at 1 atmosphere, let's say
you live at sea level, like

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.605
you're in New Orleans, I guess
that's a little bit below sea

00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:51.390
level-- that's where I grew up
--if you were able to get your

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.560
fridge down to minus 80 degrees
Celsius, the carbon

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.530
dioxide would actually freeze.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.820
And you're actually not too
unfamiliar with that, or at

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.320
least you haven't been if you've
gone to some-- I don't

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.870
know if they still use it for
smoke machines or for visual

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.730
effects on stage, but
this is dry ice.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.820
It's frozen carbon dioxide.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.180
If you're at sea level
atmospheric pressure, as soon

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.890
as you get above this minus 78
and 1/2 degrees Celsius, it

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.990
sublimates to gas.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.560
So that process, where you go
straight from a solid to a

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.810
gas, is sublimation.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.929
And that's why dry ice, when
you see it, you don't see

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.000
liquid dry ice or you don't see
it at standard pressures.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.110
I've never seen liquid
carbon dioxide.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.590
In fact, to get liquid carbon
dioxide, you have to get above

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.030
5 atmospheres so you have to get
above five times the sea

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.900
level pressure on Earth, and
you're really not going to see

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.670
that in natural conditions
on Earth.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.740
You might see that on Jupiter
or Saturn where you have

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.330
tremendous pressures because of
the gravity and all of the

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.710
atmosphere above you.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.680
Liquid carbon dioxide, you might
see-- I don't know if

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.630
Jupiter actually has carbon, but
you'll probably see it on

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.960
other huge massive planets
that are gas giants.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.380
But on Earth, this process is
just called sublimation.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.250
It's just a neat word.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.740
Or it's sublimating.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.460
It's going straight from solid
to gas and it's something

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.920
you've seen with dry ice.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.820
Now, there's a couple other
interesting points here and

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.920
you're probably already
noticing them.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.000
This right here is called the
triple point, because right

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.480
here at this-- Well, in the case
of carbon dioxide, at 5

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.130
atmospheres and minus 56 degrees
Celsius, the carbon

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.960
dioxide is in a state of
equilibrium between the ice,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.540
the liquid and the gas.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.330
It's a little bit of
all of the three.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.030
And if you just nudge it in one
direction or another by

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.550
nudging the pressure
or the temperature,

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.450
it'll go in that direction.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.600
Similarly, water's triple
point is right here.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.380
It's at a much lower
pressure than we're

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.270
used to dealing with.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:10:01.040
This is 0.611 kilopascals, or
just 611 pascals, which is

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.500
5/1000 of an atmosphere.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.430
So if you go down to 5/1000 of
an atmosphere and you go a

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:10.750
little bit above 0 degrees
Celsius, you're at the triple

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:11.700
point of water.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.210
where water can take on any of
these states if you just nudge

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.790
it in one direction
or another.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.730
Now, the other interesting
point on these

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.680
charts is up here.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.710
This is the critical point.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.390
Sounds very important.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.440
Critical point.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.730
And that's the point at which
if you increase the

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.190
temperature beyond that or the
pressure beyond that, you're

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.140
dealing with a supercritical
fluid.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.030
It sounds very exciting.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:41.600
So above here, you have
a supercritical fluid.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.600
So very high temperature,
very high pressure.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.290
It's so high temperature that
it wants to be a gas, but

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.930
you're putting so much pressure
on it that it wants

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.060
to be a fluid, so it's
a little bit of both.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.270
And actually, in the case of
water, supercritical water is

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.930
actually used as a solvent.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.800
Because you can imagine, it's
kind of like liquid water in

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.210
that things can dissolve
in it, but it's so high

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.300
temperature and it can diffuse
into solids that it's really

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.440
good at just getting whatever
you want out of whatever

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:15.490
you're trying to clean or
somehow get into or get salt

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.850
put into the water.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.450
So this is supercritical
fluid and it's a fun

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.190
thing to think about.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.150
But anyway, I just wanted to
expose you to these phase

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.230
diagrams. Everything I've done
so far was at a constant

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.140
pressure and I changed the
temperature, but you can also

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.320
read them the other way.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.530
If I'm at 100 degrees, and I go
from-- Well, let's say I'm

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:40.730
at 110 degrees, where at sea
level is comfortably in the

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.590
gaseous phase for-- So this
is 110 degrees for water.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.650
It's water vapor.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.890
But if I were to increase the
pressure and I keep increasing

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.730
the pressure and maybe I dig a
hole or something or I go into

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:58.120
the ocean, then it's going to
condense into water or it's

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.260
going to condense
into a liquid.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:06.550
If I did that experiment here,
when I increase the pressure,

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.500
I'm going to reverse
sublimate.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.710
And I think I wrote down a
word for what that is.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.980
Let me see if I wrote
it down someplace.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.840
Oh, no, I didn't.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.980
I didn't write it down.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.210
But essentially it's something
like condense, but the word is

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.480
escaping me at the second.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.770
It's something on the word of

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.520
condensing or falling together.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.290
Anyway, I forget the word, but
it'll go straight from a gas

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.270
to a solid.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.110
So these are pretty neat
diagrams. They actually tell a

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.830
lot about different substances
and then tell you what happens

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.450
when the pressure or the
temperature changes.
