00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.670
Let's learn a little bit about
the gradient, and we'll use the

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.200
same function we've been using
since we're pretty familiar

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.960
with it's graph and it's
partial derivatives.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:18.120
So let's say that f of x y is
equal to x squared plus x

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.840
times y plus y squared.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.730
Now we're going to take the
gradient of this, and then I'll

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.960
give you a little bit of
intuition on what

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.800
a gradient is.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.310
We're going to take the
gradient in two-dimensional

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.790
space, and you'll see what
that means in a second.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.350
You can extend this
to any dimension.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.810
So the gradient that we use
this vector differential

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.820
operator-- this upside down
triangle-- the gradient of f is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.670
equal to the partial of f in
the x direction times the unit

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.180
vector i-- which is the unit
vector in the x direction so it

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.960
gives the magnitude of the
slope and the x direction, and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.720
then it points the vector in
that direction-- plus the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.000
partial with respect to
y in the j direction.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.860
And obviously if there's a
function of more variables you

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.480
could keep going and you'd
multiply the magnitude of the

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.630
derivative in each of those
dimension's directions times

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.780
the unit vector in
that dimension.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.690
Well what does this mean?

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.280
And another way to view it, you
could have also written this as

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.910
the gradient of f is equal to
the partial with respect to x

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.830
of f of x y and then all of
that in the i direction.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.320
This is just
different notation.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.740
Plus the partial with respect
to y times f of x y.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.550
Not times, operated
on f of x y.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.870
So the partial of f of x y
with respect to y times

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.180
the j unit vector.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.960
And because of this notation, a
lot of people view this delta

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.430
operator-- and actually it's
pretty consistent when we learn

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.080
about the divergence and the
curl-- a lot of people view

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.210
this delta operator, they
actually define it.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.300
They say that is equal to the
partial with respect to x in

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.120
the i direction plus the
partial with respect to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.940
y in the j direction.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.200
And then if you wanted to do it
into three space-- that's not

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.190
going to apply to our problem
because we only care about

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.080
two dimensions right now.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.700
And you'll see what I mean.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.740
Because even though we're
applying it to a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.210
three-dimensional surface, but
then you can do the partial

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.240
with respect to z
times the k vector.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.030
And then you could extend it to
n dimensions, but it becomes

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.970
very hard to visualize.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.920
Actually it becomes hard
to visualize beyond what

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.920
we're doing right now.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.250
So what does this mean?

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.150
Well before I go into what it
means, let's actually calculate

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.170
it for this and then I'll
show you what it means.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.620
Let's actually calculate
the gradient of f.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.790
So the gradient of our
particular function, it's a

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.020
partial with respect to x.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.850
So we figure that out.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.050
That's 2x plus y, and then
that doesn't matter anymore.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.160
So it's 2x plus y.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.100
That's the partial of this
function with respect to x.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.195
And we multiply that in
the i direction, or

00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:23.750
in the x direction.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.705
Plus the partial with respect
to y, and this is 2y plus x.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.450
And we calculated this in
the two videos on the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.540
partial derivatives.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.090
And we multiply that
in the j direction.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.460
So what does that look like?

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.030
Well what are each of the
components of this vector?

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.110
What is 2x plus y in
the i direction?

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.170
What does that
vector look like?

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.240
What is 2y plus x in the
j direction look like?

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.645
And this I have graphed.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.180
So this is the same surface
we've been working with, but

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.330
now I've plotted these
points right here.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.300
These are just points that the
software has picked to actually

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.740
display these vectors.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.880
And if you look at it,
this is the x-axis.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.630
And I can rotate this.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.130
I can pull it down
a little bit.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.620
And then I can spin it around.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.870
I think that's pretty neat.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.030
But anyway.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.200
This parallel to this
line is the vector in

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.640
the x-axis, right?

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.690
So at this point I've actually
calculated the gradient.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.750
This vector says, what is the
magnitude of this vector is the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.140
partial derivative of the
function, or the partial

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.070
derivative of the surface,
or the partial derivative

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.540
of z with respect to x.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.790
And it's direction, it just
goes in the x direction,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.950
because it's that times
the i unit vector.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.775
So this vector is the partial
derivative of z with respect

00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:54.550
to x times the i unit
vector at that point.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.110
So we just calculated
the partial derivative

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.970
at that point.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.800
It gave this length.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.480
And then the direction is just
the i unit vector, or in the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.060
direction of increasing x.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.490
Similarly, this vector right
here-- I hope you can see it.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.950
Let me see if I can actually
zoom in a little bit.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.100
That might be useful.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.590
Zoom in, there you go.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.390
And I wanted to see the axes,
which you can't see now that

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.650
I'm zoomed in, but you took my
word this was the x direction.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.040
Now this is the y direction,
or the same direction

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.580
as the j unit vector.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.870
The j unit vector goes in
the same direction as y.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.390
And the magnitude is determined
by the partial derivative of z

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.420
with respect to y
at that point.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.280
And that's the magnitude.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.130
And we saw there was some
symmetry, so the magnitude of

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.590
this vector is the same as the
magnitude of this vector.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.660
And then when you add the
two vectors together,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.280
you get this vector.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.580
And notice that none of these
vectors have any dimensions

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.120
in the z dimension.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.540
They're all kind of giving you
directions in the x y plane.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.930
And why is that interesting?

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.160
Well the gradient-- and this is
the intuition-- the gradient

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.400
tells you the direction in the
x y plane you should travel

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.330
in order to get the maximum
slope in the z dimension.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.750
Or another way to view it.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.990
Remember the partial derivative
with respect to x said what is

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.520
the slope in the x direction.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.675
The partial derivative with
respect to y said what is the

00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:26.710
slope in the y direction.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.000
But you could take the partial
derivative with respect to any

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.420
direction, and the gradient
gives you the direction in

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.000
which the slope is the largest.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.940
So let me zoom out a little bit
because I want you to see the

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:50.970
actual axes There's the axes So
all this says if I were to

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.800
go in this direction, I
get the maximum slope.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.620
So if I go in this direction,
my z goes up like that.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.060
Let me see if I can rotate
this a little bit.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.570
I don't want to
scale it anymore.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.495
Let me do the rotated.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.430
See if I can show that to you.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:17.440
So if I go in that direction in
the x y plane, I get maximum z.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.670
If I go in that direction I
get a maximum upward slope.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.740
That's what the gradient tells
you, how do you get the

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.700
maximum upward slope.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.920
And if you were to take any
closed line where the z is

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.410
constant-- well actually I
don't want to get into that too

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.085
much, but this gradient will
actually be normal to any, or

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:43.870
it'll be perpendicular to any
curve where z is constant.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.820
I don't want to get too
involved with that right

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.750
now, so let's go back here.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.880
Maybe it's more clear if we
look from below the graph.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.020
So if you go to this point
right here, this is the

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.160
magnitude of this vector,
shows what is the slope

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.000
in the x direction.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.740
The magnitude of this vector
is what is the slope

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.770
in the y direction.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.760
And then when you add them
together, you get the gradient.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.220
And the gradient says, well, if
I travel in this direction in

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:11.150
the x y plane-- notice that
none of these have any z's.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.270
The plane defined by all
of these vectors is all

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.950
flat in the z dimension.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.960
But if I would have traveled
this direction in the x y

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.780
plane, then I will get the
maximum increase in z

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.950
per unit that I travel.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.980
And let's actually show
you what it looks like

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.700
in the x y plane.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.200
So if I just go head on-- so
I'm above the graph looking

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.580
straight down at the graph, and
then the colors just show kind

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:40.120
of you know where we are-- if I
travel in this direction in

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.750
the x y plane, I get my
maximum increase in z.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:51.160
If I'm here-- notice here the x
component of the gradient is

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.415
much larger than
the y component.

00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:54.970
So I need to travel a little
bit more in the x direction,

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.470
and I'll get the maximum change
in z if I travel there.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.320
Another way to think about it.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:07.010
If I'm on a hill, the gradient
of that surface will tell you

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:12.300
at any point what direction you
need to travel in to go

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.450
up the hill fastest.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.600
Or the direction which
the steepness of the

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.980
hill is maximum.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.210
This is more of a bowl as
opposed to a hill, but anyway.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.280
I'll just rotate it around.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.780
Hopefully that
makes some sense.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.320
And I want you to think
about it a little bit more.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.840
And we'll do a few more
problems where we just

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.210
calculate gradients, just
because I think it's useful

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.280
to get the mechanics.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.530
But in my opinion at least the
intuition is a little bit

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.765
harder to get your head around
than the actual mechanics,

00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:41.130
but once you get it, it
makes a lot of sense.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.950
I will see you in
the next video.
