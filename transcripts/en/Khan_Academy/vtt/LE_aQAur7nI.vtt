00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.010
I've got some matrix A.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.810
We learned several videos ago
that it's row space is the

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.960
same thing as the column space
of it's transpose.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:19.720
So that right there is
the row space of A.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.990
That this thing's orthogonal
complement, so the set of all

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.820
of the vectors that are
orthogonal to this, so its

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.230
orthogonal complement is equal
to the nullspace of A.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.760
And, essentially, the same
result if you switch A and A

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.750
transpose, we also learned that
the orthogonal complement

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.450
of the column space of A
is equal to the left

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.680
nullspace of A.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.450
Which is the same thing as the
nullspace of A transposed.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.410
We could write this, just to
understand the terminology,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.550
that's the left nullspace, which
is the same thing as the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.410
nullspace of A transposed.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.890
Now, what is the orthogonal
complement of the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.140
nullspace of A?

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.910
Well, you might guess that it's
the row space of A, but

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.740
we didn't have the tools
until the last video

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.500
to figure that out.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.120
In the last video, we saw that
if we take the orthogonal

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.400
complement -- let me write it
this way -- if we were to take

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.110
the orthogonal complement of the
orthogonal complement, it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.620
equals the original sub space.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.030
So now, what are we doing?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.200
We're taking the orthogonal
complement of the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.510
nullspace of A.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.120
Well, the nullspace of A is just
this thing right here.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.520
So this is equal to taking the
orthogonal complement of the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.490
nullspace of A.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.630
But the nullspace of
A is this thing.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.790
It's the row space's orthogonal
complement.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.590
Now, we're essentially the
orthogonal complement of the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.020
orthogonal complement.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.760
We can use this property, which
we just proved in the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.160
last video, to say that this
is equal to just the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.270
row space of A.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.730
Which is the same thing as the
column space of A transposed.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.090
So the orthogonal complement
of the row space is the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.580
nullspace and the orthogonal
complement of the nullspace is

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.550
the row space.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.920
We can apply that
same property on

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.030
this side right here.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.840
What is the orthogonal
complement of the left

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.750
nullspace of A?

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.890
What is this?

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.920
Well, this is going to be
equal to the orthogonal

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.170
complement of this thing.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.740
Because that's what the left
nullspace of A is equal to.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.390
So it's equal to the orthogonal
complement of the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.090
orthogonal complement
of the column space.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.190
And we just learned in the last
video, if you take the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.180
orthogonal complement of the
orthogonal complement it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.070
equals the original subspace.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.680
So this is just equal to
the column space of A.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.460
So we now see some
nice symmetry.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.060
The nullspace is the orthogonal
complement of the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.580
row space, and then we see
that the row space is the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.000
orthogonal complement
of the nullspace.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.235
Similarly, the left nullspace
is the orthogonal complement

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:14.310
of the column space.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.310
And the column space is the
orthogonal complement of the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.610
left nullspace.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.850
So we have some nice symmetry
that we're able to essentially

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.500
prove given what we saw
in the last video.
