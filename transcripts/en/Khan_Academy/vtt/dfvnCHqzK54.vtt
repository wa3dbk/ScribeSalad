00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:02.370
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.504
So I have here the graph
of a two-variable function

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:07.385
and I'd like to talk about
how you can interpret

00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:09.428
the partial derivative of that function.

00:00:09.428 --> 00:00:11.253
So specifically, the function

00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:14.170
that you're looking at is f of x, y

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:18.786
is equal to x squared times y

00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:20.036
plus sine of y.

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:23.732
And the question is, if I
take the partial derivative

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:26.263
of this function, so maybe I'm looking at

00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:30.024
the partial derivative
of f with respect to x,

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:32.927
and let's say I want to do
this at negative one, one

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:34.599
so I'll be looking at
the partial derivative

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:35.899
at a specific point.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.425
How do you interpret
that on this whole graph?

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:41.495
First, let's consider where
the point negative one, one is.

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:42.702
If we're looking above,

00:00:42.702 --> 00:00:45.234
this is our x-axis, this is our y-axis

00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:46.557
the point negative one, one

00:00:46.557 --> 00:00:47.579
is sitting right there.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.367
So negative one, move up one

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.037
and it's the point that's
sitting on the graph.

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:53.580
And the first thing you might do

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.636
is you say well, when we're
taking the partial derivative

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:57.552
with respect to x, we're going to pretend

00:00:57.552 --> 00:00:59.096
that y is a constant

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:02.207
so let's actually just go
ahead and evaluate that.

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:04.761
When you're doing this,

00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:06.898
x squared looks like a variable,

00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:08.267
y looks like a constant,

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.856
sine of y also looks like a constant.

00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:12.470
So this is going to be...

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.560
We differentiate x squared

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.927
and that's two times x times
y which is like a constant,

00:01:17.927 --> 00:01:20.551
and then the derivative of
a constant there is zero

00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:22.966
and we're evaluating this whole thing

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:27.133
at x is equal to negative
one and y is equal to one.

00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:30.153
So when we actually plug that in,

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:34.320
it would be two times negative
one multiplied by one,

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:39.150
which is two... Negative two, excuse me.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.218
But what does that mean, right?

00:01:40.218 --> 00:01:42.517
We evaluate this, and
maybe you're thinking

00:01:42.517 --> 00:01:44.375
this is kind of slight
nudge in the x direction,

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:45.930
this is the resulting nudge of f.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.370
What does that mean for the graph?

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.553
Well first of all,
treating y as a constant

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:52.084
is basically like slicing the whole graph

00:01:52.084 --> 00:01:54.800
with a plane that represents
a constant y value.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.124
So this is the y-axis,

00:01:56.124 --> 00:01:58.190
and the plane that cuts it perpendicularly

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.559
that represents a constant y value.

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:02.835
This one represents the
constant y value one

00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:06.875
but you could imagine sliding
the plane back and forth

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:10.237
and that would represent
various different y values.

00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:12.378
So for the general partial derivative,

00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:14.479
you can imagine whichever one you want

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.465
but this one is y equals one

00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:19.344
and I'll go ahead and slice
the actual graph at that point

00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:21.011
and draw a red line.

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:23.241
And this red line is basically

00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:26.941
all the points on the graph
where y is equal to one.

00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:31.820
So I'll emphasize that...
where y is equal to one.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.987
This is y is equal to one.

00:02:35.808 --> 00:02:37.371
So, when we're looking at that

00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:40.102
we can actually interpret the
partial derivative as a slope

00:02:40.102 --> 00:02:42.703
because we're looking at the point here,

00:02:42.703 --> 00:02:44.267
we're asking how the function changes

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:46.279
as we move in the x direction.

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.353
From single variable calculus,
you might be familiar

00:02:48.353 --> 00:02:50.621
with thinking of that
as the slope of a line

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:52.734
and to be a little more
concrete about this,

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:54.411
I could say you're starting here,

00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.075
you consider some nudge over
there, just some tiny step.

00:02:58.075 --> 00:02:59.538
I'm drawing it as a sizable one

00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:02.835
but you imagine it as a
really small step, as your dx,

00:03:02.835 --> 00:03:05.250
and then the distance
to your function here

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.850
the change in the value
of your function...

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.332
I said dx, but I should say
partial x or del x... Partial f.

00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:14.765
And as that tiny nudge
gets smaller and smaller,

00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:16.720
this change here is going to correspond

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.544
with what the tangent
line does, and that's why

00:03:19.544 --> 00:03:22.665
you have this rise over
run feeling for the slope.

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:24.831
And you look at that
value, and the line itself

00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:26.937
looks like it has a slope
of about negative two

00:03:26.937 --> 00:03:28.728
so it should actually
make sense that we get

00:03:28.728 --> 00:03:32.742
negative two over here
given what we're looking at.

00:03:32.742 --> 00:03:33.883
But let's do this

00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:35.933
with the partial derivative
with respect to y.

00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:39.266
Let's erase what we've got going on here

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.795
and I'll go ahead and move
the graph back to what it was,

00:03:43.795 --> 00:03:45.931
get rid of these guys,

00:03:45.931 --> 00:03:48.439
so now we're no longer
slicing with respect to y,

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.606
but instead let's say we slice
it with a constant x value.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.778
So this here is the x-axis;
this plane represents

00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:58.795
the constant value x equals negative one

00:03:58.795 --> 00:04:01.581
and we can slice the graph there.

00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:03.787
Kind of slice it, I'll
draw the red line again

00:04:03.787 --> 00:04:05.529
that represents the curve

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.245
and this time, that curve represents

00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:11.245
that value x equals negative one.

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:13.702
It's all the points on the graph

00:04:13.702 --> 00:04:15.583
where x equals negative one.

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:17.464
And now when we take
the partial derivative,

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:19.391
we're going to interpret it as a slice...

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.474
As the slope of this resulting curve.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.148
So that slope ends up looking like this,

00:04:26.148 --> 00:04:28.097
that's our blue line, and
let's go ahead and evaluate

00:04:28.097 --> 00:04:31.442
the partial derivative
of f with respect to y.

00:04:31.442 --> 00:04:34.692
So I'll go over here,
use a different color

00:04:34.692 --> 00:04:38.859
so the partial derivative of f
with respect to y, partial y.

00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:42.732
So we go up here, and it says,
okay. So x squared times y.

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:45.305
It's considering x squared
to be a constant now.

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:47.162
So it looks at that and
says x, you're a constant,

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.600
y, you're the variable,
constant times a variable,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.083
the derivative is just
equal to that constant.

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:54.833
So that x squared.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.029
And over here, sine of y,

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:00.003
the derivative of that with respect to y

00:05:00.003 --> 00:05:01.003
is cosine y.

00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:02.944
Cosine y.

00:05:05.065 --> 00:05:06.388
And if we actually want to evaluate this

00:05:06.388 --> 00:05:08.037
at our point negative one, one

00:05:08.037 --> 00:05:11.120
what we'd get is negative one squared

00:05:12.053 --> 00:05:13.636
plus cosine of one.

00:05:15.676 --> 00:05:17.789
And I'm not sure what the cosine of one is

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.461
but it's something a little bit positive,

00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:21.551
and the ultimate result that we see here

00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:24.105
is going to be one plus something,

00:05:24.105 --> 00:05:26.566
I don't know what it is,
but it's something positive,

00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:28.019
and that should make sense
'cause we look at the slope here

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:29.604
and it's a little bit more than one.

00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:31.829
I'm not sure exactly, but it's
a little bit more than one.

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:33.068
So you often hear about people

00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:34.693
talking about the partial derivative

00:05:34.693 --> 00:05:37.456
as being the slope of
the slice of a graph.

00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:38.647
Which is great,

00:05:38.647 --> 00:05:40.064
if you're looking at a function that has

00:05:40.064 --> 00:05:42.395
a two-variable input and
a one-variable output,

00:05:42.395 --> 00:05:44.399
so that we can think about its graph.

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:47.116
And in other contexts,
that might not be the case.

00:05:47.116 --> 00:05:49.926
Maybe it's something that has
a multidimensional output,

00:05:49.926 --> 00:05:50.947
we'll talk about that later,

00:05:50.947 --> 00:05:52.341
when you have a vector-valued function,

00:05:52.341 --> 00:05:54.245
what its partial derivative looks like,

00:05:54.245 --> 00:05:57.449
but maybe it's also something
that has a hundred inputs

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.539
and you certainly can't
visualize the graph

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.187
but the general idea of saying,

00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:03.403
"Well, if you take a tiny
step in a direction"--

00:06:03.403 --> 00:06:04.438
here, I'll actually walk through it

00:06:04.438 --> 00:06:06.272
in this graph's context again.

00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:08.571
You're looking at your point here

00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:10.173
and you say we're going
to take a tiny step

00:06:10.173 --> 00:06:11.903
in the y direction.

00:06:11.903 --> 00:06:14.167
And I'll call that partial y.

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:15.375
And you say that makes
some kind of change,

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.836
it causes a change in the function

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.856
which you'll call partial f.

00:06:19.856 --> 00:06:21.876
And as you imagine this
getting really really small,

00:06:21.876 --> 00:06:24.531
and the resulting change
also getting really small

00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:26.431
the rise over run of
that is going to give you

00:06:26.431 --> 00:06:28.355
the slope of the tangent line.

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:30.375
So this is just one way of
interpreting that ratio,

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:31.606
the change in the output

00:06:31.606 --> 00:06:33.974
that corresponds to a
little nudge in the input.

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:35.282
But later on we'll talk
about different ways

00:06:35.282 --> 00:06:36.575
that you can do that.

00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:38.920
So I think graphs are
very useful (laughs)...

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.936
When I move that, the text doesn't move.

00:06:41.936 --> 00:06:43.273
I think graphs are very
useful for thinking

00:06:43.273 --> 00:06:45.445
about these things, but
they're not the only way

00:06:45.445 --> 00:06:47.534
and I don't want you to
get too attached to graphs

00:06:47.534 --> 00:06:49.088
even though they can be handy

00:06:49.088 --> 00:06:53.036
in the context of two-variable
input, one-variable output.

00:06:53.036 --> 00:06:53.869
See you next video!
