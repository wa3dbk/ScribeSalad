00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
 

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's say I have a linear
transformation T that's a

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.490
mapping between Rn and Rm.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.640
We know that we can represent
this linear transformation as

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.870
a matrix product.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.920
So we can say that T of x, so
the transformation T-- let me

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.360
write it a little higher to save
space-- so we can write

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.500
that the transformation T
applied to some vector x is

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.440
equal to some matrix times x.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.640
And this matrix, since it's a
mapping from Rn to Rm, this is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.470
going to be a m by n matrix.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.270
Because each of these entries
are going have n components,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.790
they're going to be members of
Rn, so this guy has to have n

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.870
columns in order to be able
to have this matrix vector

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.910
product well defined.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.260
So we can go back to what we've
been talking about now.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.130
In the last couple of videos,
we've have been talking about

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.130
invertibility of functions,
and we can just as easily

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.850
apply it to this transformation,
because

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.190
transformations are
just functions.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.060
We just use the word
transformations when we start

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.120
talking about maps between the
vector spaces or between sets

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.220
of vectors, but they are
essentially the same thing.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.630
Everything we've done
the last two videos

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.530
have been very general.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.660
I never told you what the set
of our domain and the set of

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.540
our co-domains were
made up of.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.240
Now we're dealing with vectors,
so we can apply the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.640
same ideas.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.220
So T is a mapping right
here from Rn to Rm.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.830
 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.470
So if you take some vector here,
x, T will map it to some

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.870
other vector in Rm.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.940
Call that Ax.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.550
If we take this matrix vector
product right there and this

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.450
is the mapping T right there.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.840
So let's ask the same questions
about T that we've

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.000
been asking in general
about functions.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.250
Is T invertible?

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:03.830
 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.390
And we learned in the last
video that there's two

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.320
conditions for invertibility.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.430
T has to be onto, or the other
way, the other word was

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.680
surjective.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.710
 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.720
That's one condition
for invertibility.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.950
And then T also has
to be 1 to 1.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.340
 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.390
And the fancy word for that was
injective, right there.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.850
So in this video, I'm going to
just focus on this first one.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.400
So I'm not going to prove to you
whether T is invertibile.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.820
We will at least be able to try
to figure out whether T is

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.480
onto, or whether it's
surjective.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.590
So just as a reminder, what does
onto or surjective mean?

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.840
It means that you take any
element in Rm, you take any

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.420
element in your co-domain, so
you give me any element in

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.870
your co-domain-- let's call that
element b; it's going to

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.930
be a vector-- the fact, if T is
surjective or if T is onto,

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.710
that means that any b that you
pick in our co-domain, there's

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.510
always going to be some vector,
at least one vector,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.570
in our domain.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.410
That if you apply the
transformation to it you're

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.700
going to get b.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.070
Or another way to think about
it is the image of our

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.610
transformation is all of Rm.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.040
All of these guys
can be reached.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.230
So let's think about
what that means.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.820
So we know that the
transformation is Ax.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.820
It's some matrix A.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.410
So the transformation of x--
I'll just rewrite it-- is

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.970
equal to some matrix A-- that's
an m by n matrix--

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.660
times the vector x.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:59.530
Now, if T has to be onto, that
means that Ax, this matrix

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.680
vector product, has to be equal
to any member of our

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.140
co-domain can be reached by
multiplying our matrix A by

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.270
some member of our domain.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.760
So what's another way of
thinking about it?

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.920
Another way of thinking about
it is for any b, so onto,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.930
implies that for any vector b
that is a member of Rm-- so

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:40.372
any b here-- there exists at
least one solution to a times

00:04:40.372 --> 00:04:43.490
x is equal to b.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:52.600
Where, of course, x is, the
vector x is, a member of Rn.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.820
It's just another way of saying
exactly what I've been

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.540
saying in the first part
of this video.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.160
You give me any b in this set,
and then there has to be, if

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.130
we assume that T is onto, or for
T to be onto, there has to

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.570
be at least one solution
to Ax is equal to b.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.430
There has to be at least one x
out here, that if I multiply

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.720
it by A, I get to my b.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.290
And this has to be true for
every, maybe I should write,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.300
for every instead of any.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.170
But they are the same idea.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.290
But, for every b in Rm, we have
to be able to find at

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.900
least one x that makes
this true.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.890
So what does that mean?

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:37.680
That means that A times x has
to be equal to-- you can

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:45.670
construct any member of Rm by
taking a product of A and x,

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.640
where x is a member of Rn,
where x is a member here.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.520
Now what is this?

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.310
If x is an arbitrary member of
Rn, Let me write like this.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.190
We know that matrix A would
look like this.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.970
It'll be a bunch of
column vectors.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.300
a1, a2 and it has n columns,
so it looks like that.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.950
That's what our matrix
A looks like.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.000
So we're saying if you take this
product, you have to be

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.360
able to reach any guy,
any member of Rm.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.710
Well, what does this product
look like if where taking this

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.280
product instead of writing
an x there, I could

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.070
write x like this.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.480
x1, x2, all the way to xn.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.770
So this product is going to be
x1 times the first column

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:38.710
vector of A, plus x2 times the
second column vector of A, all

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.340
the way to plus xn times the
nth column vector of A.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.900
That's what this product is.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.320
And in order for T to be onto,
this combination has to be

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.040
equal to any vector in Rm.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.130
Well, what does this mean?

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.430
These are just linear
combinations of the column

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.680
vectors of A.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.200
 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.730
So another way to say that is
for T to be onto, So for T to

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:16.410
be surjective or onto, the
column vectors of A have to

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:22.120
span Rm, have to span
our co-domain.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.940
They have to span
this right here.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.550
You have to be able to get any
vector here with a linear

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.800
combination of these guys.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.420
Right?

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.780
And the linear combination is
set up because the weights are

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.230
just arbitrary members
of the real numbers.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.070
This vector is just a bunch
of arbitrary real numbers.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:53.390
So for T to be onto, the span of
a1, a2, all the way to an,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:59.270
has to be equal to Rm, has to
be equal to your co-domain.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.100
That just means that you can
achieve any vector in your

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.190
co-domain with the linear
combinations of the column

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.270
vectors of this.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.590
What's the span of a matrices'
column vectors?

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.450
By definition that is the
matrices' column space.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.910
So we could say, that means that
the span of these guys

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.725
have to be Rn, or another way
is that the column space of

00:08:18.725 --> 00:08:24.950
A-- let me switch colors-- the
column space of A has to be

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:30.330
equal to Rm.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.220
So how do we know if
a vector's column

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.059
space is equal to Rm?

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:42.340
So here, maybe it might be
instructive to think about,

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.090
when can we not find solutions
to the equation

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.960
Ax is equal to b?

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.710
So whenever you're faced
with this type of an

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.270
equation, what do we do?

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.680
We can set up an augmented
matrix that looks like this,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.340
where you put A on this side,
and then you put the vector b

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.770
on the right-hand side.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.340
And then you, essentially,
perform a bunch of row

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:05.870
operations.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.780
You have to perform the entire
rows in both cases, on both

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.800
sides, and we've done
this multiple times.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.610
Your goal is to get the
left-hand side into reduced

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.850
row echelon form.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.330
So what you want to do is,
eventually, get your augmented

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.240
matrix to look like this.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.190
Where the left-handed side is--
let me define R, capital

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.460
R, to be the reduced row
echelon form of A.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.820
And we've done many
videos on that.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.160
That's just, you have a matrix
where you have your pivots and

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.680
the pivot will be the only
non-zero entry in its column.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.310
But not every column has
to have a pivot in it.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.140
Maybe, you have a free column
or non-pivot column and then

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.570
they could have a
bunch of 0's.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.650
And maybe this has a pivot.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.000
This would have to be 0 if
there is a pivot there.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
These would have to be 0,
and so on and so forth.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.910
And maybe the next pivot
is right there.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.440
These would have to be 0,
and you get the idea.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.230
You could have some columns
the don't have pivots, but

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.880
whenever you do have a pivot,
they have to be the only

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.600
non-zero entry in
their column.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.776
This is reduced row
echelon form.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:12.630
 

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.900
So, what we do with any matrix
is we keep performing those

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.100
row operations so that we
eventually get it into a

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.160
reduced row echelon form.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.090
And as we do that we are
performing those same

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.680
operations on the
right-hand side.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.415
We're performing on
the entire row of

00:10:26.415 --> 00:10:28.340
these augmented matrices.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.020
So this vector b right here, I
guess I could write it as a

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.910
vector, it's eventually going
to be some other vector c

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.680
right here.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.030
You know, if this is 1, 2, 3,
maybe I will perform a bunch

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.260
of operations and this
will be 3, 2, 1, or

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.630
something of that nature.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:52.316
Now, when does this not
have a solution?

00:10:52.316 --> 00:10:55.840
 

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.290
We reviewed this early on.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.070
The only time where you don't
have a solution, remember,

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:05.950
there are three cases, where
you have many solutions.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.040
 

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.160
and that's the situation where
you have free variables.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.990
We've talked about
that before.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:20.030
You have the case where you have
only one unique solution,

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.770
that's the other case.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.000
And then you have
the final case

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.250
where you have no solutions.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.660
 

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.680
And when do you have
no solutions?

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.360
What has to happen to
have no solution?

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.010
To have no solutions, when you
perform these row operations,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.220
you have to eventually get to
a point where your matrix

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.680
looks something like this.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.360
I don't know what all this stuff
looks like maybe there's

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.670
a 1 here, a bunch of stuff.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.390
There is a 1 here and a 0.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.610
But if you have a whole row, at
least one whole row of 0's,

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.130
you just have a bunch
of 0's like that.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.080
And over here you have something
that is non-zero.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:58.590
 

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.860
This is the only time that
you have no solution.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.810
So let's remember what
we're even talking

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.700
about this stuff for.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.880
We are saying that our
transformation is onto, if its

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.750
column vectors or if its column
space is Rm, if its

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.160
column vectors span Rm.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.110
And what I'm trying to figure
out is how do I know

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.080
that it spans Rm?

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.270
So, essentially, for it to span
Rm, you can give me any b

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.850
here, any b that's a member of
Rm, and I should be able to

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.970
get a solution.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.820
So we asked ourselves the
question, when do

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.070
we not get a solution?

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.070
 

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.690
Well, we definitely don't get a
solution if we have a bunch

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.980
of 0's in a row.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.560
And then we have something
non-zero here.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.300
That's definitely not going
to be a solution.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:51.300
Now there's the other case where
we have a bunch of 0's.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.200
So there's the other case
where we do have some

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.920
solutions, where it's only
valid for certain b's.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.140
So that's the case-- let
me draw it like this.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.250
Let me start it like this.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:10.010
So let's say I have my matrix
A, and I have my b1, b2, let

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.620
me write it all the way,
and then you have bm.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.960
Remember, this is
a member of Rm.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.050
And we do our reduced row
echelon form with this

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.460
augmented matrix, and
A goes to its

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.850
reduced row echelon form.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.950
Let's say it's reduced row
echelon form has a row of 0's

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.600
at the end of it.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.530
So it just has a row
of 0's right there.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.420
Everything else looks
like your standard

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.050
stuff, 1's and 0's.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.885
But the last row, let's say
it's a bunch of 0's.

00:13:36.885 --> 00:13:40.000
And when we perform the row
operations here on this

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.600
generalized member of Rm, this
last row has some function.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:53.010
Maybe it just looks like 2b1
plus 3b2-- I'm just writing a

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.770
particular case, it won't always
be this-- minus b3.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.090
And it will essentially
be some function

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.660
of all of the b's.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.180
So let me write it this way.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.150
I'm writing a particular case
in here, maybe I shouldn't

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.050
have written a particular
case.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:14.500
This will be some function of
b1, b2, all the way to bm.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.090
Now, clearly if this
is non-zero, we

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.630
don't have a solution.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.170
And so if we don't have a
solution for some cases of b,

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.410
then we are definitely
not spanning Rm.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:27.810
So, let me write that down.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:45.110
If we don't have a solution for
some cases of b, then we

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:52.180
don't span Rm.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.840
I don't know if I'm overstating
something that is

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.600
maybe obvious to you, but I
really want to make sure you

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.950
understand this.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.680
Anytime you just want to solve
the equation Ax is equal to

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.350
b-- and remember, we want to
make sure that this can be

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.440
true for any b we chose-- what
we could do is we just set up

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.510
this augmented matrix like this,
and we perform a bunch

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.120
of row operations until we get
A, we get this matrix A to

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.770
reduced row echelon form.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.460
As we do this, the right-hand
side is going to be a bunch of

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.380
functions of b.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.310
So maybe the first
row is b1 minus

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.600
b2, plus b4, or something.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.850
And then the next row will
be something like that.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.770
We've seen examples of this in
the past. And if you end up by

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.670
doing the reduced row echelon
form with a row of 0's here,

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.640
the only way that you're going
to have a solution is if your

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.080
vector b, if its entries satisfy
this function here on

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.800
the right, so that this
thing equals 0.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.160
So it's only going to be
true for certain b's.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.680
And if this only has a solution
for the certain b's

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.280
that make this equal to 0, then
we definitely are not

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.010
spanning all of Rm.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.660
Let me do it visually.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:06.030
So if that is Rm, and if we
put-- if this is only 0 for a

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:10.870
couple of b's, for, let's say
for some handful of b's, then

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.250
these are the only guys that we
can reach by multiplying A

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.030
times some vector in Rm.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.840
And we definitely won't
be spanning all of Rm.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.650
In order to span all of Rm, when
we put this in a reduced

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.550
row echelon form, we have to
always find a solution.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.180
And the only way we are always
going be finding a solution is

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.430
if we don't run into this
condition where we

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.780
have a row of 0's.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.460
Because when you have a row 0's,
then you have to put the

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.190
constraint that this right-hand
side has to be 0.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.070
So what's the only reduced row
echelon form where you don't

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.020
have a row of 0's at the end?

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.560
Well, any row in reduced row
echelon form either has to

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.590
have all 0's or it has to have
a pivot entry in every row.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:58.450
So the only way that you span--
so T is onto, if and

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:06.170
only if, it's the column space
of its transformation vector

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.800
is equal to Rm.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.859
Its column vectors
span all of Rm.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.930
And the only way that that's
happening is if the reduced

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:33.970
row echelon form of A has a
pivot entry in every row.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.330
And how many rows
does it have?

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:36.830
This is an m by n matrix.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.730
It has m rows and n columns.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.710
So it has a pivot entry
in every row.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:52.500
That means that it has to have
m pivot entries, right there.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.640
Now, what's another way of
thinking about that?

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.240
Remember, earlier on, several
videos ago, we thought about

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.270
how do you figure out-- and this
might confuse things a

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:07.020
little bit-- how do you
figure out the basis

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.480
for your column space?

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:18.550
So the basis for the column
space of a matrix, and this is

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.330
a bit of review.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:23.450
What we did is we say, look, you
take your matrix, and you

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:30.980
put it in reduced row echelon
form of your matrix, and then,

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.390
essentially-- let me draw it a
little bit different heree--

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.160
well, you put it in reduced
row echelon form.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.360
So let's say that's just reduced
row echelon form.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.100
And you look at which columns
have pivot entries.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.360
And the corresponding columns in
your original matrices, in

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.620
your original matrix,
forms the basis

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.560
for your column space.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.640
So let me draw that out.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.400
So, I'll do a particular
instance.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.240
So, let's say that it has its
column vectors a1, a2,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.020
all the way to an.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.480
That's what A looks like.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.510
And when you put it in reduced
row echelon form, let's say

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.370
that this column right here
has a pivot entry.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.370
That column has a pivot entry.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.420
Let's say that this
one doesn't.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.110
Let's say this is a 2 there.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.030
I'm just picking particular
numbers.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:19.880
 

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.300
Let's say there's a 3.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.990
Let's say all of these are
non-pivot entries, and then

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.800
our last entry n is
a pivot entry.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.180
So it just has a bunch of 0's,
and then a 1 like that.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.590
How do you determine what are
the basis vectors for the

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.800
column space?

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.000
Well, obviously, the column
space is everything that's

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.290
spanned by all these guys.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.840
But, what's the minimum
set you need to

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.280
have that same span?

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.610
Well, you look at which one
has a corresponding pivot

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.230
entries or pivot columns.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.430
And you say, I have a pivot
column here, and I have a

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.890
pivot column there.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.700
So the basis for my column space
must be this column in

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.240
my original matrix, and that
column in my original matrix.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:01.380
And then we said, well, how do
you define the dimension of

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.220
it's column space?

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.510
And you just essentially count
the number of vectors you need

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:10.340
for your basis, and we call
that the rank of A.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.180
This is all review.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:17.510
The rank of A was equal to the
dimension of the column space

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:27.400
of A, which is equal to number
of basis vectors for the

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.140
column space.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.330
And this is how you
determine it.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.340
You essentially figure out how
many pivot columns you have,

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.290
the number of pivot columns
you have is the number of

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.510
basis vectors you have,
and so that's going to

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.840
be the rank of A.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.870
Now, the whole reason why I
talked about this is we just

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:49.070
said that our transformation T
is onto, if and only if, its

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.850
column space is Rm, which is
the case if it has a pivot

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.690
entry in every row in its
reduced row echelon form.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:01.490
Or, since it has m rows, it has
to have m pivot entries.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.100
So for every row, you have a
pivot entry, but every pivot

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.050
entry corresponds to
a pivot column.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.030
 

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.360
So if you have m pivot entries,
you also have m pivot

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.960
columns, which means that if you
were to do this exercise

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.240
right here, you would have m
basis vectors for your column

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.540
space, or that you would
have a rank of m.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.820
 

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.780
So this whole video was
just a big long way of

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.150
saying that T is onto.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.976
 

00:21:39.976 --> 00:21:45.940
And another way of saying that
is that if you have your

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.030
domain here, which was Rm, and
you have your co-domain here,

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:56.930
that is Rm, that every member
of Rm can be reached by T by

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.720
some member of Rn.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.650
Any guy here, there's always at
least one guy here, that if

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.400
you apply T to it, you
get right there.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.800
There might be more than one.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.560
We're not even talking
about 1 to 1 yet.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:20.840
So we say that T is onto, if and
only if, the rank of its

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:26.620
transformation matrix,
A, is equal to m.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.140
So that was the big takeaway
of this video.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.080
Let's just actually do an
example, because sometimes

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.070
when you do things really
abstract it seems a little bit

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.180
confusing, when you see
something particular.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.960
Let me define some
transformation S.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:48.870
Let's say the transformation S
is a mapping from R2 to R3.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.620
And let's say that S applied to
some vector x is equal to

00:22:52.620 --> 00:23:00.020
the matrix 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, times the vector x.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.100
So this is clearly
a 3 by 2 matrix.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:10.290
Let's see if S is onto.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.970
Well, based on what we just did,
we just have to go and

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.870
put this guy in reduced
row echelon form.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.660
So let's do that.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.150
So if you put this guy into
reduced row echelon form, so

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:25.760
let's keep 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.640
Now, let's keep the first row
the same, that's 1, 2.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.470
Let's replace the second row
with the second row minus 3

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:34.540
times the first row.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.400
Actually, let's replace it with
3 times the first row

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.350
minus the second row.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.800
So, 3 times 1 minus 3 is 0.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.900
3 times 2 minus 4, that's
6 minus 4, is 2.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.780
Now let's replace the third
row with 5 times the first

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.780
row, minus the third row.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.610
So 5 times 1 minus 5 is 0.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:56.850
5 times 2 is 10, minus 6 is 4.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:02.080
Now, let's see if we can
get a 1 right here.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.650
So I'm going to keep my
middle row the same.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:09.730
Or, actually, let's just divide
the middle row by 2, or

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.923
multiply it by 1/2 So, you
get 0, 1 and then you

00:24:11.923 --> 00:24:14.910
have a 0, 4, 1, 2.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.170
And now let's try to make these
0, get it into reduced

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.020
row echelon form.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.660
So I'm going to keep my middle
row the same, 0, 1.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.460
And let's replace the top row
with the top row minus 2 times

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.250
the second row.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.490
So 1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.170
2 minus 2, times 1 is 0.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.470
Now, let's replace this last row
with the last row minus 4

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.500
times this row.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.080
So we get 0 minus 4,
times that, is 0.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:44.560
4 minus 4, times 1, is 0.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:49.840
So notice, we have a
row with 0's here.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:58.940
We have two pivot entries or two
rows with pivot entries,

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:04.460
and we also have two pivot
columns right there.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:14.390
So the rank of this guy right
here, of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.290
The rank of that is equal
to 2, which is not

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.090
equal to our co-domain.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.875
It is not equal to R3.

00:25:21.875 --> 00:25:33.180
It's not equal to R3, so S is
not onto, or not surjective.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.250
It's one of the two conditions
for invertibility.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:43.400
So, we definitely know that
S is not invertible.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.400
Hopefully that's helpful.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.420
Now, in the next video we're
going to focus on the second

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.830
condition for invertibility,
and that's being 1 to 1.
