00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:13.470
We have the equation 3/4x plus
2 is equal to 3/8x minus 4.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.129
Now, we could just, right from
the get go, solve this the way

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.070
we solved everything else, group
the x terms, maybe on

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.440
the left-hand side, group the
constant terms on the

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.470
right-hand side.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.980
But adding and subtracting
fractions are messy.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.110
So what I'm going to do, right
from the start of this video,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.470
is to multiply both sides of
this equation by some number

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.300
so I can get rid of
the fractions.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.880
And the best number to do it
by-- what number is the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.050
smallest number that if I
multiply both of these

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.320
fractions by it, they won't be
fractions anymore, they'll be

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.530
whole numbers?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.350
That smallest number
is going to be 8.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.080
I'm going to multiply 8 times
both sides of this equation.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.920
You say, hey, Sal, how
did you get 8?

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.300
And I got 8 because I said,
well, what's the least common

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.650
multiple of 4 and 8?

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.600
Well, the smallest number that
is divisible by 4 and 8 is 8.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.580
So when you multiply
by 8, it's going to

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.720
get rid of the fractions.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.300
And so let's see what happens.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.600
So 8 times 3/4, that's
the same thing as 8

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.350
times 3 over 4.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.600
Let me do it on the
side over here.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.320
That's the same thing as 8 times
3 over 4, which is equal

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.440
to 8 divided by 4 is just 2.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.160
So it's 2 times 3, which is 6.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.800
So the left-hand side becomes
8 times 3/4x is 6x.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.610
And then 8 times 2 is 16.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.800
You have to remember, when you
multiply both sides, or a

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.070
side, of an equation by a
number, you multiply every

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.040
term by that number.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920
So you have to distribute
the 8.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.040
So the left-hand side is 6x plus
16 is going to be equal

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.240
to-- 8 times 3/8, that's pretty
easy, the 8's cancel

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.580
out and you're just
left with 3x.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.430
And then 8 times negative
4 is negative 32.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.130
And now we've cleaned up the
equation a good bit.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.690
Now the next thing, let's try to
get all the x terms on the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.890
left-hand side, and all the
constant terms on the right.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.220
So let's get rid of this
3x from the right.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.740
Let's subtract 3x from
both sides to do it.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.250
That's the best way I can think
of of getting rid of the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.320
3x from the right.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.180
The left-hand side of this
equation, 6x minus 3x is 3x.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.890
6 minus 3 is 3.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.380
And then you have a plus 16 is
equal to-- 3x minus 3x, that's

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.530
the whole point of subtracting
3x, is so they cancel out.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.870
So those guys cancel out, and
we're just left with a

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.220
negative 32.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.860
Now, let's get rid of the 16
from the left-hand side.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.550
So to get rid of it, we're going
to subtract 16 from both

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.950
sides of this equation.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.200
Subtract 16 from both sides.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.600
The left-hand side of the
equation just becomes-- you

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.650
have this 3x here; these 16's
cancel out, you don't have to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.420
write anything-- is equal to
negative 32 minus 16 is

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.910
negative 48.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.325
So we have 3x is equal
to negative 48.

00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:05.820
To isolate the x, we can just
divide both sides of this

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.350
equation by 3.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.940
So let's divide both sides
of that equation by 3.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.510
The left-hand side of the
equation, 3x divided by

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.310
3 is just an x.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.750
That was the whole point
behind dividing

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.480
both sides by 3.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.830
And the right-hand side,
negative 48 divided by 3 is

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.710
negative 16.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.036
And we are done.

00:03:27.036 --> 00:03:30.910
x equals negative 16
is our solution.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.300
So let's make sure that this
actually works by substituting

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.920
to the original equation
up here.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.030
And the original equation
didn't have

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.260
those 8's out front.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.270
So let's substitute in the
original equation.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:50.710
We get 3/4-- 3 over 4-- times
negative 16 plus 2 needs to be

00:03:50.710 --> 00:04:02.010
equal to 3/8 times negative
16 minus 4.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.390
So 3/4 of 16 is 12.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.680
And you can think
of it this way.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.550
What's 16 divided by 4?

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.670
It is 4.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.040
And then multiply that
by 3, it's 12,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.450
just multiplying fractions.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.390
So this is going to
be a negative 12.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.920
So we get negative 12 plus
2 on the left-hand side,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.800
negative 12 plus 2
is negative 10.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.650
So the left-hand side
is a negative 10.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.120
Let's see what the right-hand
side is.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.360
You have 3/8 times
negative 16.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.940
If you divide negative 16 by 8,
you get negative 2, times 3

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.970
is a negative 6.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.710
So it's a negative 6 minus 4.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.060
Negative 6 minus 4
is negative 10.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.030
So when x is equal to negative
16, it does satisfy the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.730
original equation.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.560
Both sides of the equation
become negative 10.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.330
And we are done.
