00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.280
Let's do one more Gram-Schmidt
example.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.880
So let's say I have the subspace
V that is spanned by

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.190
the vectors-- let's say we're
dealing in R4, so the first

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.480
vector is 0, 0, 1, 1.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.450
The second vector
is 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.120
And then a third vector-- so
it's a three-dimensional

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.940
subspace of R4-- it's 1, 1,
0, 0, just like that,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.260
three-dimensional
subspace of R4.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.780
And what we want to do, we want
to find an orthonormal

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.030
basis for V.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.070
So we want to substitute these
guys with three other vectors

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.560
that are orthogonal with
respect to each other

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.960
and have length 1.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.700
So we do the same drill
we've done before.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.975
We can say-- let's call this
guy v1, this guy is v2, and

00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:59.100
let's call this guy v3.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.040
So the first thing we want to
do is replace v1-- and I'm

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.030
just picking this guy at random
because he was the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.720
first guy on the
left-hand side.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.110
I want to replace v1 with an
orthogonal version of v1.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.900
So let me call u1 is equal to--
well, let me just find

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.750
out the length the v1.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.440
I don't think I have to explain
too much of the theory

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.960
at this point.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.900
I just want to show
another example.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.650
So the length of v1 is equal
to the square root of 0

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.300
squared plus 0 squared plus 1
squared plus 1 squared, which

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.450
equals the square root of 2.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.200
So let me define my new vector
u1 to be equal to 1 over the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.010
length of v1, 1 over the square
root of 2, times v1,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:53.080
times 0, 0, 1, 1.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.950
And just like that, the span
of v1, v2, v3, is the same

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.040
thing is the span of
u1, v2, and v3.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.480
So this is my first thing
that I've normalized.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.729
So I can say that V is now
equal to the span of the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.490
vectors u1, v2, and v3.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.900
Because I can replace v1 with
this guy, because this guy is

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.940
just a scaled-up version
of this guy.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.000
So I can definitely represent
him with him, so I can

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.950
represent any linear combination
of these guys with

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.580
any linear combination of
those guys right there.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.820
Now, we just did our
first vector.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.620
We just normalized this one.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.930
But we need to replace these
other vectors with vectors

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.760
that are orthogonal to
this guy right here.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.850
So let's do v2 first. So let's
replace-- let's call it y2 is

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:51.670
equal to v2 minus the projection
of v2 onto the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.530
space spanned by u1 or onto--
you know, I could call it c

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.020
times u1, or in the past
videos, we called that

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.820
subspace V1, but the space
spanned by u1.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.400
And that's just going to be
equal to y2 is equal to v2,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:18.210
which is 0, 1, 1, 0, minus-- v2
projected onto that space

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:26.620
is just a dot product of v2, 0,
1, 1, 0, with the spanning

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.030
vector of that space.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.020
And there's only one of them,
so we're only going to have

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.240
one term like this with u1, so
dotted with 1 over the square

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:44.940
root of 2 times 0, 0, 1, 1, and
then all of that times u1.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.340
So 1 over the square root of 2
times the vector 0, 0, 1, 1.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.330
And so this is going
to be equal to v2,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.750
which is 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.890
The square root of 2, let's
factor them out.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.440
So then you just get-- or kind
of reassociate them out.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.603
So then you get this is 1 over
the square root of 2 times 1

00:04:06.603 --> 00:04:09.890
over the square root
of 2 is minus 1/2.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.640
You times-- what's the dot
product of these two guys?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.690
You get 0 times 0 plus 1 times
0, which is still 0, plus 1

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.160
times 1 plus 0 times 0.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.930
So you're just going to have
times 1 times this out here:

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.170
0, 0, 1, 1.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.735
I'll write that a little
bit neater.

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:29.450
I'm getting careless.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.560
1, 1.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.750
So this is just going to be
equal to 0, 1, 1, 0 minus--

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.380
1/2 times 0 is 0.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.640
1/2 times 0 is 0.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.730
Then I have two halves here.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:57.740
So y2 is equal to-- let's see,
0 minus 0 is 0, 1 minus 0 is

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:08.940
1, 1 minus 1/2 is 1/2, and then
0 minus 1/2 is minus 1/2.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:19.460
So V, we can now write as the
span of u1, y2, and v3.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.520
And this is progress.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.350
u1 is orthogonal, y2-- sorry,
u1 is normalized.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.500
It has length 1.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.700
Y2 is orthogonal to it or
they're orthogonal with

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.570
respect to each other, but y2
still has not been normalized.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.410
So let me replace y2 with a
normalized version of it.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:44.680
The length of y2 is equal to
the square root of 0 plus 1

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.990
squared, which is 1, plus 1/2
squared, which is 1/4, plus

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.360
minus 1/2 squared, which is
also 1/4, so plus 1/4.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.650
So this is 1 and 1/2.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.340
So it's equal to the
square root of 3/2.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.610
So let me define another
vector here.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.070
u2, which is equal to 1 over the
square root of 3/2, or we

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.170
could say is the square root of
2/3, I'm just inverting it.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.540
It's 1 over the length of y2.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.620
So I'll just find the
reciprocal, so it's the square

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:25.190
root 2 over 3 times y2, times
this guy right here, times 0,

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.930
1, 1/2, and minus 1/2.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.200
And so this span is going to be
the same thing as the span

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.660
of u1, u2, and v3.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.410
And there's our second
basis vector.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.400
And we're making a
lot of progress.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.870
These guys are orthogonal with
respect to each other.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.990
They both have length 1.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.750
We just have to do something
about v3.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.470
And we do it the same way.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.780
Let's find a vector that is
orthogonal to these guys, and

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.370
if I sum that vector to some
linear combination of these

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.650
guys, I'm going to get
v3, and I'm going to

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.650
call that vector y3.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:13.230
y3 is equal to v3 minus the
projection of v3 onto the

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.880
subspace spanned by u1 and u2.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.600
So I could call that
subspace-- let me

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.150
just write it here.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:25.240
The span of u1 and u2, just
for notation, I'm going to

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.670
call it v2.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.860
So it's v3, and actually,
I don't even have

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.380
to write that .

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.180
Minus the projection
of v3 onto that.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.620
And what's that going to be?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:43.150
That's going to be v3 dot u1
times u1, times the vector u1.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:49.080
And actually let me just--
plus v3 dot u2

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.180
times the vector u2.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.420
Since this is an orthonormal
basis, the projection onto it,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.160
you just take the dot product
of v2 with each of their

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.780
orthonormal basis vectors and
multiply them times the

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.840
orthonormal basis vectors.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.180
We saw that several
videos ago.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.280
That's one of the neat things
about orthonormal bases.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.170
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.560
A little bit more computation
here.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.190
y3 is equal to v3, which
was up here.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.120
That's v3.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.520
v3 looks like this.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:24.820
It's 1, 1, 0, 0 minus
v3 dot u1.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:32.780
So this is minus v3,
1, 1, 0, 0, dot u1.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:43.309
So it's dot 1 over the square
root of 2 times 0, 0, 1, 1.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:48.230
That's u1-- so that's this part
right here-- times u1, so

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:54.240
times 1 over the square root
of 2 times 0, 0, 1, 1.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.050
This piece right there is
this piece right there.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.230
And then we can distribute this
minus sign, so it's going

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.160
to be plus.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.010
You know, we have a plus, but
there's this minus over here

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.685
so we put a minus v3.

00:09:04.685 --> 00:09:06.540
Let me switch colors .

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:15.680
Minus v3 , which is 1, 1 0, 0
dotted with u2, dotted with

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:27.450
the square root of 2/3 times 0,
1, 1/2, minus 1/2 times u2,

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.580
times the vector u2, times the
square root of 2/3, times the

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.270
vector 0, 1, 1/2, minus 1/2.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.480
And what do we get?

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.270
Let's calculate this.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:45.570
So we could take the-- so this
is going to be equal to the

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:52.040
vector 1, 1, 0, 0, minus-- so
the 1 over the square root of

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.390
2 and the 1 over the square
root of 2, multiply them.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.930
You're going to get a 1/2.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.140
And then when you take the dot
product of these two, 1 times

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.650
0-- let's see, this is actually
all going to be, if

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.430
you take the dot product of all
of these, then it actually

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.920
gets 0, right?

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.150
So this guy, v3, was actually
already orthogonal to u1.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.350
This will just go straight
to 0, which is nice.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.030
We don't have to have
a term right there.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.580
I took the dot product 1 times
0 plus 1 times 0 plus 0 times

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.550
1 plus 0 times 1,
all gets zeroed.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.850
So this whole term drops out.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.120
We can ignore it, which makes
our computation simpler.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.790
And then over here we have minus
the square root of 2/3

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.480
times the square root of 2/3
is just 2/3 times the dot

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.860
product of these two guys.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.730
So that's 1 times 0, which is 0,
plus 1 times 1, which is 1,

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.980
plus 0 times 1/2, which is 0,
plus 0 times minus 1/2, which

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:54.630
is 0, so we just get a 1 there,
times the vector 0, 1,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.140
1/2, minus 1/2.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.730
And then what do we get?

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:10.820
We get-- this is the home
stretch-- 1, 1, 0, 0 minus 2/3

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.230
times all of these guys.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.940
So 2/3 time 0 is 0.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.340
2/3 times 1 is 2/3.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:23.870
2/3 times 1/2 is 1/3.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:29.120
And then 2/3 times minus
1/2 is minus 1/3.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.470
So then this is going to be
equal to 1 minus 0 is 1, 1

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:40.290
minus 2/3 is 1/3, 0 minus 1/3 is
minus 1/3, and then 0 minus

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.600
minus 1/3 is positive 1/3.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.790
So this vector y3 is orthogonal
to these two other

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.800
vectors, which is nice, but it
still hasn't been normalized.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.770
So we finally have to normalize
this guy, and then

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:53.210
we're done.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.450
Then we have an orthonormal
basis.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.690
We'll have u1, u2, and
now we'll find u3.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:05.020
So the length of my vector y--
actually, let's do something

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.440
even better.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.360
It'll simplify things
a little bit.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.440
Instead of a writing
y this way, I

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.650
could scale up y, right?

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.150
All I want is a vector that's
orthogonal to the other two

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.870
that still spans
the same space.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.650
So I can scale this guy up.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.740
So I could say, I don't know,
let me call it y3-- let me

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.400
call it y3 prime.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.900
And I'm just doing this to
ease the computation.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.250
I could just scale this guy
up, multiply him by 3.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.910
So what do I get?

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.220
I probably should have done
it some of the other ones.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.870
3, 1, minus 1, and 1.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.370
And so I can replace y3 with
this guy, and then I can just

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.440
normalize this guy.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.960
It'll be a little bit easier.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.540
So the length of y3 prime that I
just defined is equal to the

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:55.750
square root of 3 squared, which
is 9, plus 1 squared

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.350
plus minus 1 squared plus 1
squared, which is equal to the

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.500
square root of 12,
which is what?

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.360
That's two square roots of 3.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.360
That is equal to 2 square
roots of 3, right?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.260
Square root of 4 times the
square root of 3, which is two

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.450
square roots of 3.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:16.630
So now I can to find u3 as equal
to y3 times 1 over the

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.790
length of y3, so it's equal to
1 over two square roots of 3

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.720
times the vector 3,
1, minus 1, and 1.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.970
And then we're done.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.020
If we have a basis, an
orthonormal basis would be

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.520
this guy-- let me take the other
ones down here-- and

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.590
these guys.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:41.470
All of these form-- let me bring
it all the way down.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.960
If I have a collection of these
three vectors, I now

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:51.180
have an orthonormal basis for
V, these three right there.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.390
That set is an orthonormal basis
for my original subspace

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.010
V that I started off with.
