00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.650
Luis receives a gift card
worth $25 to an online

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.970
retailer that sells digital
music and games.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.490
Each song costs $0.89 and
each game costs $1.99.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.560
He wants to buy at least 15
items with this card.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.040
Set up a system of inequalities
that represents

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.020
this scenario and identify the
range of possible purchases

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.440
using a graph.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.320
And that's why we have some
graph paper over here.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.940
So let's define some
variables.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.490
Let's let s equal the number
of songs he buys.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.370
And then let's let g equal the
number of games that he buys.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.950
Now if we look at this
constraint right here, he

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.190
wants to buy at least 15
items with this card.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.340
So the total number of items are
going to be the number of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.420
songs plus the number
of games.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.180
And that has to be
at least 15.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.600
So it has to be greater
than or equal to 15.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.390
So that's what that constraint
tells us right there.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.790
And then the other constraint is
the gift card is worth $25.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.310
So the amount that he spends on
songs plus the amount that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.810
he spends on games has to be
less than or equal to 25.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.010
So the amount that he spends on
songs are going to be the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.460
number of songs he buys times
the cost per song.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.870
Times $0.89 times-- so I will
say 0.89-- times s.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.660
That's how much he spends on
songs plus the cost per game,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.680
which is $1.99 times the
number of games.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.540
This is going to be the total
amount that he spends.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.940
And that has to be less
than or equal to 25.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.950
Now if we want to graph these,
we first have to define the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.180
axes, so let me do
that right here.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.420
And we only care about the first
quadrant because we only

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.910
care about positive values for
the number of songs and the

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.550
number of games.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.240
We don't talk about scenarios
where he buys a negative

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.580
number of songs or games.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.610
So just the positive quadrant
right here.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.110
Let me draw the axes.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.210
So let's make the vertical axis
that I'm drawing right

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.220
here, let's make that the
vertical axis and let's call

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.140
that the song axis.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.980
So that's the number
of songs he buys.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.870
Let me make sure you
can see that.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.930
That is the song axis.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.070
And then let's make this, this
horizontal, that's going to be

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.905
the number of games he buys.

00:02:29.905 --> 00:02:31.155
Let's bold it in.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.720
And just to make sure that we
can fit on this page-- because

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.580
I have a feeling we're going
to get to reasonably large

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.470
numbers-- let's make each of
these boxes equal to 2.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.710
So this would be 4, 8, 12, 16,
20, so on and so forth.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.960
And this would be 4-- this
obviously would be 0-- 4, 8,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.860
12, 16, 20, and so on.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.930
So let's see if we can graph
these two constraints.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.010
Well, this first constraint, s
plus g is going to be greater

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.560
than or equal to 15.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.470
The easiest way to think about
this-- or the easiest way to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.860
graph this is to really think
about the intercepts.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.160
If g is 0, what is s?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.340
Well, s plus 0 has to be greater
than or equal to 15.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.290
So if g is 0, s is going to be
greater than or equal to 15.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.370
Let me put it this way.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.700
So if I'm going to graph
this one right here.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.710
If g is 0, s is greater
than or equal to 15.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.390
So g is 0, s, 15, let's see,
this is 12, 14, 15 is right

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.380
over there.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.090
And s is going to be all of the
values equivalent to that

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.170
or greater than for
g equal to 0.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.460
If s is equal to 0, g is greater
than or equal to 15.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.700
So if s is equal to 0, g is
greater than or equal to 15.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.810
So g is greater than
or equal to 15.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.740
So the boundary line, s plus g
is equal to 15, we would just

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.900
have to connect these
two dots.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.649
Let me try my best to
connect these dots.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.720
So it would look something
like this.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.330
This is always the
hardest part.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.000
Let me see how well I can
connect these two dots.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.540
Nope.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.480
Let me see.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.960
I should get a line
tool for this.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.400
So that's pretty good.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.050
So that's the line s plus
g is equal to 15.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.160
And we talk about the values
greater than 15, we're going

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.920
to go above the line.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.280
And you saw that when g is equal
to 0, s is greater than

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.010
or equal to 15.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.070
It's all of these
values up here.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.330
And when s was 0, g was greater
than or equal to 15.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.650
So this constraint right
here is all of this.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.440
All of this area
satisfies this.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.310
All of this area-- if you pick
any coordinate here, it

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.560
represents-- and really you
should think about the integer

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.230
coordinates, because we're not
going to buy parts of games.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.690
But if you think about all of
the integer coordinates here,

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.710
they represent combinations of
s and g, where you're buying

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.270
at least 15 games.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.610
For example here, you're buying
8 games and 16 songs.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.320
That's 24.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.730
So you're definitely meeting
the first constraint.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.570
Now the second constraint.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.120
0.89s plus 1.99g is less
than or equal to 25.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.570
This is a starting point.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:38.270
Let's just draw the line 0.89s
plus 1.99 is equal to 25.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.660
And then we could think about
what region the less than

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.000
would represent.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.890
Oh, 1.99g.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.790
And the easiest way to do this,
once again, we could do

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.900
slope y-intercept all
that type of thing.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.370
But the easiest way is to
just find the s- and the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.610
g-intercepts.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:06:04.880
So if s is equal to 0 then we
have 1.99g is equal to 25 or g

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.470
is equal to-- let's get a
calculator out for this.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:17.900
So if we take 25 divided
by 1.99, it is 12.56.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:26.210
g is equal to 12.56.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.970
So when s is 0, let
me plot this.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.370
When s is 0, g is 12.56.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.440
This is 12, this is 14.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.450
12.56 is going to be right
there, a little

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.950
bit more than 12.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.370
That's that value there.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.500
And then let's do the same
thing if g is 0.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.700
So if g is equal to 0, then we
have-- so this term goes

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.770
away-- we have 0.89s.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.640
If we use just the equality
here, the equation-- is equal

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.220
to 25 or s is equal to-- get
the calculator out again.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.410
So if we take 25 divided
by 0.89, we get--

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.110
it's equal to 28.08.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.180
Just a little over 28.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.670
So 28.08.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.160
So that is, g is 0, s is 28.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.890
So that is 2, 4, 24, 6, 8.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.800
A little over 28.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.600
So it's right over there.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.180
So this line, 0.89s plus 1.99g
is equal to 25 is going to go

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.810
from this coordinate,
which is 0, 28.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.630
So that point right there.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.320
All the way down to
the point 12.56,0.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.420
So let me see if I
can draw that.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.130
It's going to go-- I'll draw
up one more attempt.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.560
Maybe if I start from the
bottom it'll be easier.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.220
That was a better attempt.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.100
Let me bold that in a little
bit, so you can make sure you

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.510
can see it.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.390
So that line represents
this right over here.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.710
Now if we're talking about the
less than area, what would

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.700
that imply?

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:13.920
So if we think about it, when
g is equal to 0, 0.89s

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.550
is less than 25.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.610
So when g is equal to 0, if we
really wanted the less than

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.500
there, we could think
of it this way.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.380
It's less than instead of just
doing less than or equal to.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.630
So s is less than 28.08.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.400
So it'll be the region below.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.610
When s is 0, g-- so if we think
s is 0, if we use this

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.820
original equation, 1.99g will
be less than or equal to.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.350
I use this just to plot the
graph, but if we actually care

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:46.670
about the actual inequality, we
get 1.99g is less than 25.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.620
g would be less than
or equal to 12.56.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.390
So when s is equal to 0,
g is less than 12.56.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:59.950
So the area that satisfies
this second constraint is

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.800
everything below this graph.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.750
Now we want the region that
satisfies both constraints.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.060
So it's going to be the overlap
of the regions that

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.930
satisfy one of the two.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.060
So the overlap is going to be
this region right here.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.920
Below the orange graph and
above the blue graph,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.520
including both of them.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.220
So if you pick any combination--
so if he buys 4

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.300
games and 14 songs,
that would work.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.090
Or if he bought 2 games and
16 songs, that would work.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.170
So you can kind of
get the idea.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.300
Anything in that region-- and
he can only buy integer

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.780
values-- would satisfy
