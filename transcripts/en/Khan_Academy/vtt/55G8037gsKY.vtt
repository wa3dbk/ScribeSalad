00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.190
In this video, I'm going to do
several examples of quadratic

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.820
equations that are really of a
special form, and it's really

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.150
a bit of warm-up for the next
video that we're going to do

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.670
on completing the square.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.910
So let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.960
So let's say I have 4x
plus 1 squared, minus

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.330
8 is equal to 0.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.740
Now, based on everything we've
done so far, you might be

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.980
tempted to multiply this out,
then subtract 8 from the

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.380
constant you get out here, and
then try to factor it.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.600
And then you're going to have
x minus something, times x

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.220
minus something else
is equal to 0.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.300
And you're going to say, oh, one
of these must be equal to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.990
0, so x could be that or that.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.760
We're not going to do that this
time, because you might

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.810
see something interesting
here.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.090
We can solve this without
factoring it.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.050
And how do we do that?

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.950
Well, what happens if
we add 8 to both

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.070
sides of this equation?

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.480
Then the left-hand side of the
equation becomes 4x plus 1

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.240
squared, and these
8's cancel out.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.130
The right-hand becomes
just a positive 8.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.780
Now, what can we do to both
sides of this equation?

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.090
And this is just kind
of straight, vanilla

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.170
equation-solving.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.930
This isn't any kind of
fancy factoring.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.700
We can take the square root of
both sides of this equation.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.600
We could take the square root.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.410
So 4x plus 1-- I'm just taking
the square root of both sides.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.840
You take the square root of both
sides, and, of course,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.740
you want to take the positive
and the negative square root,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.390
because 4x plus 1 could be the
positive square root of 8, or

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.400
it could be the negative
square root of 8.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.100
So 4x plus 1 is equal to the
positive or negative

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.860
square root of 8.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.450
Instead of 8, let me write
8 as 4 times 2.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.350
We all know that's what 8 is,
and obviously the square root

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.820
of 4x plus 1 squared
is 4x plus 1.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.500
So we get 4x plus 1 is equal
to-- we can factor out the 4,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.840
or the square root of 4, which
is 2-- is equal to the plus or

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.250
minus times 2 times the square
root of 2, right?

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.460
Square root of 4 times square
root of 2 is the same thing as

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.290
square root of 4 times the
square root of 2, plus or

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.850
minus the square root of 4
is that 2 right there.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.970
Now, it might look like a really
bizarro equation, with

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.340
this plus or minus 2 times
the square of 2,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.020
but it really isn't.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.010
These are actually two numbers
here, and we're actually

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.210
simultaneously solving
two equations.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.980
We could write this as 4x plus
1 is equal to the positive 2,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.360
square root of 2, or 4x plus 1
is equal to negative 2 times

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.510
the square root of 2.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.110
This one statement is equivalent
to this right here,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.230
because we have this plus or
minus here, this or statement.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.710
Let me solve all of these
simultaneously.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.360
So if I subtract 1 from
both sides of this

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.030
equation, what do I have?

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.330
On the left-hand side, I'm
just left with 4x.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
On the right-hand side, I
have-- you can't really

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.260
mathematically, I mean, you
could do them if you had a

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.210
calculator, but I'll just leave
it as negative 1 plus or

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.570
minus the square root, or 2
times the square root of 2.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.200
That's what 4x is equal to.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.560
If we did it here, as two
separate equations, same idea.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.715
Subtract 1 from both sides of
this equation, you get 4x is

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:36.310
equal to negative 1 plus 2,
times the square root of 2.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.150
This equation, subtract
1 from both sides.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.090
4x is equal to negative
1 minus 2, times the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.560
square root of 2.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.970
This statement right here is
completely equivalent to these

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.880
two statements.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.590
Now, last step, we just have to
divide both sides by 4, so

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.770
you divide both sides by 4,
and you get x is equal to

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.620
negative 1 plus or minus
2, times the square

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.570
root of 2, over 4.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.670
Now, this statement is
completely equivalent to

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.550
dividing each of these by 4,
and you get x is equal to

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.470
negative 1 plus 2, times the
square root 2, over 4.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.890
This is one solution.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.270
And then the other solution is x
is equal to negative 1 minus

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.370
2 roots of 2, all
of that over 4.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.340
That statement and these two
statements are equivalent.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.230
And if you want, I encourage you
to-- let's substitute one

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.280
of these back in, just so you
feel confident that something

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.960
as bizarro as one of these
expressions can be a solution

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.970
to a nice, vanilla-looking
equation like this.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.870
So let's substitute
it back in.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:58.290
4 times x, or 4 times negative
1, plus 2 root 2, over 4, plus

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.450
1 squared, minus 8
is equal to 0.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.350
Now, these 4's cancel out, so
you're left with negative 1

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.260
plus 2 roots 2, plus
1, squared, minus

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.410
8 is equal to 0.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.410
This negative 1 and this
positive 1 cancel out, so

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.690
you're left with 2 roots
of 2 squared, minus

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.840
8 is equal to 0.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.680
And then what are you
going to have here?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.460
So when you square this, you
get 4 times 2, minus 8 is

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.060
equal to 0, which is true.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.300
8 minus 8 is equal to 0.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.740
And if you try this one out,
you're going to get the exact

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.180
same answer.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.220
Let's do another
one like this.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.960
And remember, these are special
forms where we have

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.470
squares of binomials
in our expression.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.620
And we're going to see that the
entire quadratic formula

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.870
is actually derived from a
notion like this, because you

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.250
can actually turn any, you can
turn any, quadratic equation

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.050
into a perfect square equalling
something else.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.525
We'll see that two
videos from now.

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:08.260
But let's get a little
warmed up just seeing

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.410
this type of thing.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:16.650
So let's say you have x squared
minus 10x, plus 25 is

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.680
equal to 9.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.920
Now, once again your
temptation-- and it's not a

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.960
bad temptation-- would be to
subtract 9 from both sides, so

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.320
you get a 0 on the right-hand
side, but before you do that,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.050
just inspect this really fast.
And say, hey, is this just

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.140
maybe a perfect square
of a binomial?

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.150
And you see-- well, what two
numbers when I multiply them I

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.760
get positive 25, and when I add
them I get negative 10?

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.380
And hopefully negative
5 jumps out at you.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:52.060
So this expression right here is
x minus 5, times x minus 5.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.495
So this left-hand side can be
written as x minus 5 squared,

00:06:56.495 --> 00:06:59.910
and the right-hand
side is still 9.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.540
And I want to really
emphasize.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.860
I don't want this to ruin all of
the training you've gotten

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.280
on factoring so far.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.260
We can only do this when this
is a perfect square.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.210
If you got, like, x minus 3,
times x plus 4, and that would

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.120
be equal to 9, that would
be a dead end.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.580
You wouldn't be able to
really do anything

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.490
constructive with that.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.080
Only because this is a perfect
square, can we now say x minus

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.640
5 squared is equal to 9, and
now we can take the square

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.060
root of both sides.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.280
So we could say that x minus 5
is equal to plus or minus 3.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.050
Add 5 to both sides of this
equation, you get x is equal

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:43.050
to 5 plus or minus 3, or x is
equal to-- what's 5 plus 3?

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:49.780
Well, x could be 8 or x could be
equal to 5 minus 3, or x is

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.340
equal to 2.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.890
Now, we could have done this
equation, this quadratic

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.070
equation, the traditional
way, the way you were

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.160
tempted to do it.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.600
What happens if you subtract
9 from both

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.230
sides of this equation?

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.650
You'll get x squared
minus 10x.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.820
And what's 25 minus 9?

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:16.040
25 minus 9 is 16, and that
would be equal to 0.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.970
And here, this would be just a
traditional factoring problem,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.400
the type that we've seen
in the last few videos.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.710
What two numbers, when you take
their product, you get

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:29.020
positive 16, and when you sum
them you get negative 10?

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.800
And maybe negative
8 and negative 2

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.390
jump into your brain.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:38.954
So we get x minus 8, times
x minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:08:38.954 --> 00:08:43.710
And so x could be equal to 8
or x could be equal to 2.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.450
That's the fun thing about
algebra: you can do things in

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.670
two completely different ways,
but as long as you do them in

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.210
algebraically-valid ways,
you're not going to get

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.170
different answers.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.330
And on some level, if you
recognize this, this is easier

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.950
because you didn't have to do
that little game in your head,

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.130
in terms of, oh, what two
numbers, when you multiply

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.840
them you get 16, and when you
add them you get negative 10?

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.340
Here, you just said, OK, this is
x minus 5-- oh, I guess you

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.020
did have to do it.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.020
You had to say, oh, 5 times 5
is 25, and negative 10 is

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.160
negative 5 plus negative 5.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.050
So I take that back, you still
have to do that little

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.490
game in your head.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.700
So let's do another one.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.880
Let's do one more of these, just
to really get ourselves

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.230
nice and warmed up here.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:38.140
So, let's say we have x squared
plus 18x, plus 81 is

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.470
equal to 1.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.940
So once again, we can
do it in two ways.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.580
We could subtract 1 from both
sides, or we could recognize

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:53.140
that this is x plus
9, times x plus 9.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:58.010
This right here, 9 times 9
is 81, 9 plus 9 is 18.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.210
So we can write our equation
as x plus 9

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.760
squared is equal to 1.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.940
Take the square root of both
sides, you get x plus 9 is

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.240
equal to plus or minus
the square root of 1,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.910
which is just 1.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.140
So x is equal to-- subtract 9
from both sides-- negative 9

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.866
plus or minus 1.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:21.060
And that means that x could be
equal to-- negative 9 plus 1

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.620
is negative 8, or x could be
equal to-- negative 9 minus 1,

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.930
which is negative 10.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.560
And once again, you could have
done this the traditional way.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.730
You could have subtracted 1 from
both sides and you would

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:41.240
have gotten x squared plus 18x,
plus 80 is equal to 0.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.370
And you'd say, hey, gee, 8 times
10 is 80, 8 plus 10 is

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:50.850
18, so you get x plus 8, times
x plus 10 is equal to 0.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.640
And then you'd get x could be
equal to negative 8, or x

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.360
could be equal to negative 10.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.710
That was good warm up.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.250
Now, I think we're ready to
tackle completing the square.
