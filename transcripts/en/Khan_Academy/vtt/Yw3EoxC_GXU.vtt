00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.410
Rewrite 5 plus 5 plus 5 plus
5 plus 5 plus 5 plus 5 as a

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.440
multiplication expression.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.120
And then they want us to write
the expression three times

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.260
using different ways to
write multiplication.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.610
So let's do the first part.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.390
Let's write it as a
multiplication expression.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.945
So how many times have
we added 5 here?

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:23.660
Well, we've got it at
one, two, three,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.670
four, five, six, seven.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.110
So one way to think of it, if
I just said what is here?

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.240
How many 5's are there?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.330
You'd say, well, I added 5 to
itself seven times, right?

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.360
You could literally say
this is 7 times 5.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.350
We could literally write, this
is 7 times 5, or you could

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.230
view it as 5 seven times.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.990
I'm not even writing it
mathematically yet.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.470
I'm just saying, look, if I saw
seven of something, you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.010
would literally say, if these
were apples, you would say

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.030
apples seven times, or you'd
say seven times the apple,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.040
whatever it is.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.810
Now, in this case, we're
actually adding the number to

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.180
each other, and we could figure
out what that is, and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.160
why don't we?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.680
But the way we would write this
mathematically, we would

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.090
say this is 7 times 5.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.610
We could also write
it like this.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.190
We could write it 7 dot 5.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.580
This and this mean the
exact same thing.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.440
It means we're multiplying
7 times 5 or 5 times 7.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.110
You can actually switch the
order, and you get the exact

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.250
same value.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.890
You could actually write
it 5 times 7.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.160
So you could interpret this as 7
five times or 5 seven times,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.840
however you like to do
it, or 5 seven times.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.610
I don't want to confuse you.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.350
I just want to show you that
these are all equivalent.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.250
This is also equivalent.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.150
5 times 7.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.080
Same thing.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.050
You could write them
in parentheses.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.560
You could write it like this.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.300
This all means the same thing.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.040
That's 7 times 5,
and so is this.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.220
These all evaluate to the
same thing: 5 times 7.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.030
So these are all equivalent, and
since we've worked with it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.720
so much, let's just figure
out the answer.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.880
So if we add up 5 to itself
seven times, what do we get?

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.740
Well, 5 plus 5 is 10.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.210
10 plus 5 is 15, plus 5 is 20,
plus 5 is 25, plus 5 is 30,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.789
plus 5 is 35.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:22.150
So all of these evaluate to
35, just so you see that

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.550
they're the same thing.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.790
These are all equivalent
to 35.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.850
And just something to think
about, this is also the exact

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.350
same thing, depending on how you
want to interpret this, as

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.695
7 five times.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.510
They didn't ask us to do it, but
I thought I would point it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.380
out to you.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.080
7 five times would look like
this: 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.410
plus 7, right?

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.950
I have 7 five times.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.370
I added it to itself five
different times.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.820
There's five 7's here
added to each other.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.050
And when you add these up,
you'll also get 35.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.560
And that's why 5 times 7 and 7
times 5 is the same thing.
