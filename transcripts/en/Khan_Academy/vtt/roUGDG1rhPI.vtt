00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
We've already touched on ethers
in several videos.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.080
They've been our useful aprotic
solvent in several of

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.800
our reactions.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.130
But I thought it was about time
that we actually devoted

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.460
a video or two to ethers.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.820
And like all things that we've
done in organic chemistry, a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.950
good way to familiarize
ourselves with the molecules

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.210
and how they look, is to
actually name them.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.130
So let's do a couple.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.280
And the first few you've
seen already.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.210
So let's say we have this
molecule right here.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.640
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to teach you two

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.430
ways to name it.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.740
The common name, and that's
probably the more important

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.270
one, especially with ethers.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.860
Because, as you could imagine,
that is the more common name.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.050
That is what people say.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.940
And then I'll also show
you how to name it

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.350
using the IUPAC name.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.140
So let me write this down.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.950
IUPAC name, which is the
International Union of Pure

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.490
and Applied Chemistry.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.420
And they've come up with kind
of the official naming

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.410
protocols for all of these
organic molecules.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.070
This is actually the convention
that we used

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.260
earlier when we did the alkanes
and the alkenes.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.420
But in the case of ethers, the
common name is more common.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.280
So the common name for this
molecule right here.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.350
You look at the two carbon
groups here.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.770
So let's see.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.630
You have this one right here.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.900
That is an ethyl group.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.190
That's an ethyl group
right there.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.010
You have one, two carbons.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.910
And then you look at the other
carbon group right over there.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.280
That's also an ethyl group.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.340
You have one, two carbons.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.250
So you call this-- let me just
write this down-- that is also

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.000
an ethyl group.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.075
So the common name for this
is just diethyl ether.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.610
And the ether tells you, this
part tells you, that you have

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.600
an oxygen in between your
two ethyl groups.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.085
This is the common name.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.710
Now the International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.290
official name for it.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.870
You kind of do something similar
to how we named other

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.450
things before.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.260
You look for the
longest chain.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.940
Let me redraw it.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.280
So maybe on the left hand side
I'll do the common names.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.669
On the right hand side I'll
do the IUPAC names.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.630
So let me redraw what
the common name

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.010
of the diethyl ether.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.520
You look for the
longest chain.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.580
In this case, there's
two longest chains.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.980
There's this one that has
one, two carbons.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.260
And then you have this one,
that has one, two carbons.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.590
So you can pick either one.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.450
I'll just pick this one as the
main chain right over there.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.180
It has two carbons,
no double bonds.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.430
It is an ethane.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.870
And then you say, OK, I have
this alkoxy group.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.820
We put the oxy at the end of it
because it has this oxygen

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.530
right here.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.330
But it's the alk part of it
has two carbons, one, two.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.360
So we call this right here,
we call this ethoxy.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.190
So one other way to name this,
we have this ethoxy group

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.390
attached to the one carbon.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.490
We're just going to start
numbering on this side of the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.910
ethane, just because that's
where the group is, attached

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.070
to the one carbon.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.390
So we call this 1-ethoxyethane.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.120
You'll almost never see it
actually named this way, even

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.860
though this is the
official name.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.840
You're much more likely to see
this as diethyl ether.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.140
And at least in my brain, this
resonates a lot more.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.920
You just say what are
the two groups.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.080
And you throw the
ether at end.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.130
You know that there's an
oxygen in between.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.870
Let's do a couple
more of these.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.990
So let's say I have this
molecule right here.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.810
I have this molecule
right over here.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.490
The common way is you look at
the two groups on either side

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.010
of the oxygen.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.260
So this right here-- let me do
this in a different color--

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.810
this group on the left
right here, we have

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.830
one, two, three carbons.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.610
It's a propyl group,
but we're attached

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.580
to that middle carbon.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.190
So this is an isopropyl group.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.170
And on the right hand
side right here, we

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.560
just have one carbon.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.780
So this is right here-- I keep
using that blue-- this right

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.820
here, this is a methyl group.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.470
So the common way of naming
it, you just list both of

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.880
these groups and then
you write ether.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.730
And you list them in
alphabetical order.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.560
I comes before m.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:32.703
So this is, the common name
is isopropyl methyl ether.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.140
Now if we were to do the IUPAC
naming, we look for the

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.310
longest carbon chain.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.110
Let me redraw the
molecule itself.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.380
So let me redraw the same
thing right there.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.880
So what's the longest
carbon chain here?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.660
Well we have one, two, three
carbons right there.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.300
We only have one carbon
right there.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.020
So this thing right here is
our longest carbon chain.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.950
It has three carbons on it, and
it had no double bonds.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.610
So eth, meth, prop, propyl,
or it's actually propane.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.120
So this is our longest. So we
write propane right there,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.130
because we're using the IUPAC
naming mechanism.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.110
And then we look at this methoxy
group right here.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.740
And I call this a methoxy group,
because I have the o.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.860
That gives us the oxy.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.200
And I just have a methyl
group right here.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.450
So this is methoxy.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.090
You remember that meth is the
prefix for just having only

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.920
one carbon.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.950
We add the oxy because
that oxygen is there.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.010
And it's attached to the two
carbons on the propane chain,

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.190
no matter what direction you
start naming from, or

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.870
numbering from.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.390
One, two, three.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.640
So this is 2-methoxypropane.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.120
Let's do another one.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.940
Let's do one more.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.620
And I think you'll get the
gist of at least the

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.070
reasonably simple
ethers to name.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:05.090
So let's put a ring
over there.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.620
And then that's attached
to an oxygen.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.640
And then we have another carbon
chain right here.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.610
And then we have another carbon
chain right there.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.360
Let me just copy and paste
that so that I don't

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.110
have to redraw it.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.080
So let me copy and paste.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.090
All right.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.050
So let's do the common name
first. That always tends to be

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.220
a little bit more fun.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.780
So on this side, we have one,
two, three, four, five, six

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.850
carbons in a cycle.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.620
This right here on the
left hand side is

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.190
a cyclohexyl group.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.910
This on the right hand side,
we have one, two, three.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.380
This is just a straight-up
propyl group.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.970
And so when you name the ether,
you just put these two

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.050
groups in alphabetical
order, and you add an

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.990
ether at the end.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.470
So it's cyclohexyl.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.570
C comes before p.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.670
So it's cyclohexyl propyl.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.860
Let me get that shade
of yellow right.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.750
Cyclohexyl propyl ether.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.670
Now let's do the IUPAC
way to name it.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.870
So you look for the longest
carbon chain here.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.090
In this case, it's going to be
the cyclohexane right here.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.540
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six carbons there.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.310
We only have one, two,
three there.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.020
So this is kind of
our backbone.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.370
So we write down cyclohexane.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.080
No double bonds, so
it's a hexane.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.410
So that's the cyclohexane
right there.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.920
If you just had these three
carbons, it would be a propyl.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.170
But this is not just
three carbons.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.020
It's three carbons and
then an oxygen.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.200
So we would call it a propoxy.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.920
So this is propoxy group.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.710
And you don't have to number
it because it can just be

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.080
attached to any of
these carbons.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.670
It would essentially be
the same molecule.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.930
So you can just call this
propoxy cyclohexane.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.160
Let me make it a little bit
closer to the cyclohexane.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.750
Propoxy cyclohexane.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.020
But once again the common
name is what you're

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.980
more likely to see.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.990
Now that we've named a few of
them, let's think a little bit

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.660
about their properties.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.680
What we've seen already is
that-- and we've used it

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.180
several times, especially in our
Sn2 reactions and things

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.960
like that-- places where
we didn't want

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.120
protons floating around.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.559
We used actually
diethyl ether.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.760
And in general ethers do
make for good solvents.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.409
They tend to be fairly
unreactive.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:46.140
So good solvents.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.160
Especially when you're looking
for an aprotic solvent.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.060
Remember, aprotic means you
don't have hydrogens that can

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.710
kind of lose their electron to
maybe an electronegative atom

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:57.640
like an oxygen.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.395
And then the proton just floats
around, and then can go

00:09:00.395 --> 00:09:02.450
and react with other things.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.865
This does not have any hydrogens
directly bonded to

00:09:04.865 --> 00:09:06.980
an oxygen in any
of these cases.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.500
So it is an aprotic solvent.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.930
And because it doesn't have any
hydrogens bonded to the

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.670
oxygen, you also have
no hydrogen bonding.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.970
And just as a bit of a review,
you know that in water you

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.740
have the situation-- let me draw
some water molecules-- in

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.400
water you have the situation
where the

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.610
oxygen hogs the electrons.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.630
So it has a partial
negative charge.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:33.830
Hydrogen gets its electrons
hogged or taken away, or it

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:34.860
spends less time with them.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.550
So it has a partial
positive charge.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.130
So this oxygen will have a
partial negative charge.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.520
And so the hydrogens with the
partial positive charge are

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.260
attracted to the oxygens with
the partial negative charge.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.000
And you have this hydrogen
bonding.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.220
And this hydrogen bonding
makes water.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.710
It pulls the molecules
together.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.080
So you need to put more energy
into it for it to either melt,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.015
or for it to actually boil.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.260
And for the molecules to
kind of get ripped

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.440
away from each other.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.120
And that's also true
with alcohols.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.990
Alcohols only have one hydrogen
to each oxygen, but

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.640
they still have the hydrogen
bonding going on.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.390
In the case of ethers, there
is no hydrogen bonding.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.060
I'll represent each of
the carbon chains

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.740
with an R and an R.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.820
I'll write R prime right here
to show that it could be a

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.680
different carbon chain
than this right here.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.400
And the R stands for radical.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.410
Not to be confused with
free radical.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.090
Completely different things.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.470
This R just means really
a carbon chain

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:32.535
attached to this oxygen.

00:10:32.535 --> 00:10:37.890
But here there's no hydrogen
getting its electrons hogged

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.730
by oxygens with partial
positive and

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.060
partial negative charges.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.570
So you're not going to have that
type of hydrogen bonding.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.380
And because of that, ethers have
much lower melting and

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.170
boiling points.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:50.960
It's much easier.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.430
You have to put less heat into
the system for these molecules

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.260
to break away from each other,
because they aren't attracted

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.510
to each other as much.
