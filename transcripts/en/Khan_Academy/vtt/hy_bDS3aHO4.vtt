00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.080
Leo has $4,522.08 in
his bank account.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.890
He deposits another
$875.50 and then

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.380
withdraws $300 in cash.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.300
How much is left
in his account?

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.280
So he's starting
with $4,522.08.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.830
Let's write that down.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.560
$4,522.08.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.680
And then he deposits, or he
adds, another $875.50.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.810
So he's going to add $875.50.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.500
When you deposit into an
account, you're putting

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.090
something into the account, or
you're adding to the account.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.270
So after he adds that $875.50,
what does he have?

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.030
We go back to the penny spot,
or we could view that as the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.760
hundredths.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.790
A penny is one hundredth
of a dollar.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.830
Let me switch colors.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.210
We have 8 plus 0 is 8.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.120
0 plus 5 is 5.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.150
We have the decimal
right there.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.630
2 plus 5 is 7.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.920
2 plus 7 is 9.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.240
5 plus 8 is 13.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.930
Put the 3 down here and regroup
the 1, or carry the 1.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.710
1 plus 4 is 5.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:26.030
So after the $875.50 deposit,
he has $5,397.58.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.670
Then he withdraws $300 in cash,
or he takes out $300, so

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.340
we'll have to subtract that.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.320
So then he withdraws $300 and
I just added some trailing

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.310
zeroes after the decimal.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.210
$300 is the same thing as
$300.00 and zero cents.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.475
And then we subtract.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.120
8 minus 0 is 8.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.370
5 minus 0 is 5.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.000
We have our decimal
right there.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.460
7 minus 0 is 7.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.640
9 minus 0 is 9.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.919
3 minus 3 is 0, and then 5
minus nothing here is 5.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.830
So he's the left with, in
his account, $5,097.58.
