00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.480
We're asked to factor 20u
squared v minus 10uv squared.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.630
And when they say factor a
binomial like this, an

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.470
expression that has two terms
like this, they really mean

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.450
break it up into the product of
one or more terms. So let's

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.210
see if we can do that.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.500
And the easiest way we can do
that, is say hey, is there any

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.270
common factor?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.320
In particular, let's find the
greatest common factor of each

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.610
of these terms and then
divide that out.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.800
Or you can almost imagine,
un-distribute it out, and I'll

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.190
show you what I'm talking
about in a second.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.815
And eventually you'll be able
to do this in your head, but

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:33.790
we'll work through it step
by step right now.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.970
So what is 20u squared v
if we factor it out?

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.020
20u squared v, if we do into the
prime factorization, it is

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.000
20 is 2 times 2 times 5.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.360
Right?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.660
That's 2 times 10, that's 20.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.560
u squared is times u times u
and then v is just one v.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.150
So we just rewrote 20u squared
v into kind of a product of

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.310
its smallest components, its
most fundamental components,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.980
prime numbers and just
u's and v's.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.620
Now let's do the same exact
thing for the 10uv squared.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.520
So we'll put that minus sign
there so that we haven't

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.440
fundamentally changed
the expression.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.250
10 is, if we break it down to
its prime factors, 2 times 5.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.890
Then we have one u times
one u times v times v.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.570
That's what v squared
is, times v times v.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.560
Now what's the greatest common
factor of these two terms

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.490
right here?

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.490
Well let's see.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.920
They both have one 2.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.090
They both have one
2 right there.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.880
Maybe I'll circle that one, I
could have circled that one.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.380
They both have one 5--
that's one 5, one 5.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.380
They both have one u, one
u there, one u there.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.600
This one has two, but only this
one has one, and they

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.950
both have at least one v.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.610
So the greatest common factor is
2 times 5 times u times v.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.860
So I could rewrite this
expression, I can kind of

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.520
un-distribute the 2 times
5 times u times v,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.660
and what'll we get?

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.210
If we wrote 2 times 5 times u
times v, and we say that's

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.750
going to be-- this expression
is equal to this times what?

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.250
Well if you factor the 2 times
5 times u times v out, all

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.090
you're going to be left with
in this first term is the 2

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.060
times u, so 2u here.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.030
And in the second term,
all you're going to be

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.650
left with is a v.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.910
Right?

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.460
All this other stuff
gets factored out.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.520
All you're going to be
left with is a v.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.050
Hopefully you see, if I multiply
2 times 5 times u

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.460
times v times 2u, I'm going to
get this first term here.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.220
So if I were to distribute it,
I would get this first term.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.150
And if I multiply 2 times 5
times u times v times this v

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.350
over here, I'm going to
get this second term.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.860
So this expression, and
that expression is

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.400
the exact same thing.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.850
We have factored it
out, now we can

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.180
simplify it a little bit.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.510
2 times 5 times u times
v we rewrite as 10uv.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.530
And then inside the parentheses,
we of course have

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.470
a 2u and then a minus v.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.090
And we're done!

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.970
We have factored
the expression.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.240
Now you won't be doing it to
this granular level, but this

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.850
is the best way to
think about it.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.230
Eventually you're going to
say, hey, wait, look, the

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.360
largest number that divides
both of these is a 10.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.690
Because you could see 10 goes
into the 20, 10 goes into 10.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.120
And, let's see, a u goes into
both of these, and a v goes

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.740
into both of these.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.510
So let me factor out a 10uv,
and then if I divide this

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.390
thing by 10uv, I'm going
to be left with 2u.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.330
And if I divide this by 10uv,
I'm going to just

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.020
be left with a v.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.360
So that's another way
to think about it.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.390
Let me do that right now, so we
could say that this is the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.730
same thing.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.030
Another way of approaching it,
you could have said that this

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.280
is the same thing as-- Well,
the largest number that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.650
divides both of these is 10uv,
and that's going to be times

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:06.370
20u squared v over 10uv
minus this thing.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.300
10uv squared over 10uv.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.910
This expression and this are
obviously the same thing.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.480
If I were to distribute the 10uv
it would cancel out with

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.490
each of these in the denominator
right there.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.110
So they're the same thing,
but we can do is we

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.329
can simplify this.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.740
We could say that 20 divided
by 10 is just 2, u squared

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.570
divided by u is just a u, v
divided by v is just 1, 10

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.280
divided by 10 is 1, u divide by
u is u, v squared divided

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.900
by v is just a v to
the first power.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.620
So you're left with 10uv times
the quantity 2u minus v.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.180
Either way you get
the same answer.
