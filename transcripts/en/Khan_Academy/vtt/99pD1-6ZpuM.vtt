00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
In the last video, we saw that
if we had some curve in the x-y

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.360
plane, and we just parameterize
it in a very general sense like

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.240
this, we could generate another
parameterization that

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.140
essentially is the same
curve, but goes in the

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.920
opposite direction.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.350
It starts here and it goes
here, as t goes from a to b,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.390
as opposed to the first
parameterization, we started

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.710
with t equals a over here,
and it went up like that.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.410
And the question I want to
answer in this video is how a

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.600
line integral of a scalar field
over this curve, so this is my

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.360
scalar field, it's a function
of x and y, how a line integral

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.940
over a scalar field over this
curve relates to, that's a line

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.650
integral of that same scalar
field over the reverse curve,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.130
over the curve going in
the other direction.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.640
So the question is, does it
even matter whether we move in

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.140
this direction or that
direction when we're taking the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.980
line integral of
a scalar field?

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.770
And in the next video, we'll
talk about whether it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.020
matters on a vector field.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.130
And let's see if we can get
a little intuition to our

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.750
answer before we even
prove our answer.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.990
So let me draw a
little diagram, here.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.760
Actually, let me do it a little
bit lower, because I think I'm

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.180
going to need a little
bit more real estate.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.600
So let me draw the y-axis, that
is the x-axis, let me draw

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.140
the vertical axis, just
like that, that is z.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.250
Let me draw a scalar
field, here.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.720
So I'll just draw it as some
surface, I'll draw part of it.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.910
That is my scalar field, that
is f of xy right there.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.890
For any point on the x-y plane
we can associate a height that

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.860
defines this surface,
this scalar field.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.650
And let me put a
curve down there.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.830
So let's say that this is the
curve c, just like that.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.152
And the way we define it first,
we start over here and we

00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:54.910
move in that direction.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.220
That was our curve c.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.630
And we know from several videos
ago that the way to visualize

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.750
what this line integral means,
is we're essentially trying to

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.850
figure out the area of a
curtain that has this curve as

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.000
its base, and its ceiling is
defined by this surface,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.860
by the scalar field.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.160
So we're literally just trying
to find the area of this curvy

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.520
piece of paper, or wall, or
whatever you want to view it.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.440
That's what this thing is.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.840
Now, if we take the same
integral but we take it the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.150
reverse curve, instead of
going in that direction,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.810
we're now going in the
opposite direction.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.950
We're not taking a curve,
we're going from the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.450
top to the bottom.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.290
But the idea is still the same.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.010
You know, I don't know which
one is c, which one is minus c.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.400
I could have defined this path
going from that way as c, and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.260
then the minus c path would
have started here,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.520
and gone back up.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.320
So it seems in either case, no
matter what I'm doing, I'm

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.170
going to try to figure out the
area of this curved

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.220
piece of paper.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.630
So my intuition tells me that
the either these are going to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.260
give me the area of this curved
piece of paper, so maybe they

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.880
should be equal to each other.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.500
I haven't proved anything very
rigorously yet, but it seems

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.960
that they should be equal
to each other, right?

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.420
In this case, let's say
I'm taking a, let me

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.290
just make it very clear.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.120
I'm taking a ds.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.720
a little change in distance,
let me do it in a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.450
different color.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.440
A little change in distance,
and I'm multiplying it by the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.450
height, to find kind of a
differential of the area.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.050
And I'm going to add a
bunch of these together

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.070
to get the whole area.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.300
Here I'm doing the same thing.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.980
I'm taking a little ds, and
remember, the ds is always

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.185
going to be positive, the
way we've parameterized it.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.650
So here, too, we're taking
a ds, and we're going to

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.230
multiply it by the height.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.500
So once again, we
should take the area.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.160
And I want to actually
differentiate that relative to,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:55.030
when you take a normal integral
from a to b of, say, f of x dx,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.760
we know that when we switch the
boundaries of the integration,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.370
that it makes the
integral negative.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.290
That equals the negative
of the integral from

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.570
b to a of f of x dx.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.350
And the reason why this is the
case, is if you imagine this is

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.230
a, this is b, that
is my f of x.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.210
When you do it this way,
your dx's are always

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.280
going to be positive.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.540
When you go in that direction,
your dx's are always going

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.540
to be positive, right?

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.110
Each increment, the right
boundary is going to be higher

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.840
than the left boundary.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.520
So your dx's are positive.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.690
In this situation, your
dx's are negative.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.450
The heights are always going to
be the same, they're always

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.010
going to be f of x, but here
your change in x is a

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.950
negative change in x,
when you go from b to a.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.660
And that's why you get
a negative integral.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.250
In either case here, our path
changes, but our ds's are

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.480
going to be positive.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.310
And the way I've drawn this
surface, it's above the x-y

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.670
plane, the f of xy is also
going to be positive.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.180
So that also kind of gives the
same intuition that this should

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.920
be the exact same area.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.620
But let's prove
it to ourselves.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.770
So let's start off with our
first parameterization, just

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.740
like we did in the last video.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.920
We have x is equal to x of t, y
is equal to y of t, and we're

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.840
dealing with this from,
t goes from a to b.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.615
And we know we're going to need
the derivatives of these, so

00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:22.970
let write that down right now.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:32.240
We can write dx dt is equal to
x prime of t, and dy dt, let me

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:41.550
write that a little bit neater,
dy dt is equal to y prime of t.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.590
This is nothing groundbreaking
I've done so far.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:53.140
But we know the integral
over c of f of xy.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.250
f is a scalar field,
not a vector field.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.720
ds is equal to the integral
from t is equal to a, to t is

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:13.930
equal to b of f of x of t y of
t times the square root of dx

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.500
dt squared, which is the same
thing as x prime of t squared,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.240
plus dy dt squared, the same
thing as y prime of t squared.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.170
All that under the
radical, times dt.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.220
This integral is exactly that,
given this parameterization.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.060
Now let's do the
minus c version.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.810
I'll do that in
this orange color.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.250
Actually, let me do the
minus c version down here.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.250
The minus the c version, we
have x is equal to, you

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.140
remember this, actually,
just from up here, this

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.085
was from the last video.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.990
x is equal to x of
a plus b minus t.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.440
y is equal to y of
a plus b minus t.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:34.430
And then t goes from a to b, t
goes from a to b, and this is

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.610
just exactly what we did in
that last video. x is equal to

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.650
x of a plus b minus t, y is
equal to y of a plus b minus t,

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.310
same curve, just going in a
different direction as

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.250
t increases a to b.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.320
But let's get the derivative.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.860
I'll do it in the
derivative color, maybe.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.640
So dx dt.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.970
For this path, it's going
to be a little different.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.810
We have to do the
chain rule now.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.750
Derivative of the inside
with respect to t.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.690
Well, these are constants.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.800
Derivative of minus t with
respect to t is minus 1.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.830
So it's minus 1 times the
derivative of the outside

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.180
with respect to the inside.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.010
Well, that's just x prime
of a plus b minus t.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.840
Or, we could rewrite this as,
this is just minus x prime

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.160
of a plus b minus t.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.230
dy dt, same logic.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.500
Derivative of the
inside is minus 1 with

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.980
respect to t, right?

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.530
Derivative minus t
is just minus 1.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.560
Times the derivative
of the outside with

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.540
respect to the inside.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:43.060
So y prime of a plus b minus
t, same thing as minus y

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:49.130
prime a plus b minus t.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:55.730
So given all of that, what is
this integral going to be equal

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:03.330
to, the integral of minus c of
the scalar field f of xy ds?

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.910
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.580
Well, it's going to be the
integral from, you could almost

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.880
pattern match it. t is equal
to a to t is equal

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.010
to be of f of x.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.605
But now x is no longer
x of t. x now equals x

00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:19.050
of a plus b minus t.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.950
It's a little bit hairy,
but I don't think anything

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.710
here is groundbreaking.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.190
Hopefully it's not
too confusing.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.770
And once again, y is no
longer y of t. y is y

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.260
of a plus b minus t.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.320
And then times a square root,
I'll just switch colors,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.290
times the square root
of dx dt squared.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.830
What is dx dt squared?

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:49.700
dx dt squared is just
this thing squared, or

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.040
this thing squared.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.800
This thing, if I have minus
anything squared, that's the

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.530
same thing as anything
squared, right?

00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:03.280
This is equal to minus x prime
of a plus b minus t squared,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.690
which is the same thing is
just x prime of a plus b

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.140
minus t squared, right?

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.640
You lose that minus information
when you square it.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:17.340
So that's going to be equal to
x prime of a plus b minus t

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.960
squared, the whole result
function squared,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.130
plus dy dt squared.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.870
By the same logic, that's going
to be, you lose the negative

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.030
when you square it.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:33.472
y prime of a plus b
minus t squared.

00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:35.360
Let me extend the radical.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.550
And then all of that dt.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:48.980
So that's the line integral
over the curve c, this is

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.040
the line integral over
the curve minus c.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.600
They don't look equal just yet.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.070
This looks a lot more
convoluted than that one does.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.140
So let's see if we can
simplify it little bit.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.380
And we can simplify it,
perhaps, by making

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.040
a substitution.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.390
Let's let, let me get a nice
substitution color, let's let

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:10.560
u equal to a plus b minus t.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.360
So first we're going to have to
figure out the boundaries of

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.760
our integral, well actually,
let's just figure

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.520
out, what's du?

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.910
so du dt, the derivative of u
with respect to t is just going

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.200
to be equal to minus 1, or we
could say that du, if we

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.330
multiply both sides by the
differential dt, is

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.690
equal to minus dt.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.460
And let's figure out our
boundaries of integration.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.280
When t is equal to a,
what is u equal to?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.860
u is equal to a plus b minus
a, which is equal to b.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:49.110
And then when t is equal to b,
u is equal to a plus b minus

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.190
b, which is equal to a.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.360
So if we do the substitution on
this crazy, hairy-looking

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.270
interval, let's simplify a
little bit, and it changes

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:02.190
our-- so this integral is going
to be the same thing as the

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:06.940
integral from u, when
t is a, u is b.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.500
When t is b, u is a.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:16.000
And f of, x of, this thing
right here is just u.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.360
x of u.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.000
So it simplified it a good bit.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.730
And y of, this thing
right here, is just u.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.830
y of u.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:30.020
Times the square root-- let
me do it in the same color.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:40.160
Times the square root of x
prime of u squared plus

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.010
y prime of u squared.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.210
Instead of a dt, we have to
write a, or could write, if we

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.490
multiply both sides of this by
minus, we have dt is

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.900
equal to minus du.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.100
So instead of a dt, we have
to put a minus du here.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:03.330
So this is times minus du, or,
just so we don't think this is

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.140
a subtraction, let's just put
that negative sign out here in

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.300
the front, just like that.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.110
So we're going from b to a of
this thing, right, like that.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:17.370
And just to make the boundaries
of integration make a little

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.430
bit more sense, because we know
that a is less than

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.000
b, let's swap them.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.110
And I said at the beginning
of this video, for just a

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.010
standard, regular, run of the
mill integral, if you swap, if

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:34.216
you have something going from b
to a of f of x dx, or du, maybe

00:13:34.216 --> 00:13:35.610
I should write it this way.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.440
f of u du.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.290
This is equal to the minus
of the integral from

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:46.410
a to b of f of u du.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.220
And we did that by the logic
that I had graphed up here.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.030
That here, when you switch the
order, your du's will become

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.830
the negatives of each other,
when you actually visualize it,

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.880
when you're actually finding
the area under the curve.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.670
So let's do that.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.995
Let's swap the boundaries
of integration right here.

00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:03.310
And if we do that, that
will negate this negative,

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.180
or make it a positive.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.920
So this is going to be equal
to the integral from a to b.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.800
I'm dropping the negative
sign, because I swapped

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.410
these two things.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.800
So I'm going to take the
negative of a negative,

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.980
which is a positive.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:28.070
Of f of x of u y of u times the
square root of x prime of u

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:37.770
squared plus y prime
of u squared du.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.230
Now remember, everything we
just did was a substitution.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.130
This was all equal to, just to
remember what we're doing, this

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:47.550
was the integral of the minus
curve of our scalar

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.430
field, f of xy ds.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.020
Now how does this compare to
when we take the regular curve?

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.180
How does this compare to that?

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.150
Let me copy and
paste it to see.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.560
You know, I'm using
the wrong tool.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.490
Let me copy and paste it
to see how they compare.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:08.820
Copy, then let me pick to
down here, edit, paste.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.620
So how do these two
things compare?

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.340
Let's take a close look.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.550
Well, they actually look
pretty similar, right?

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:21.470
Over here, for the minus curve,
we have a bunch of u's.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.630
Over here, for the positive
curve, we have a bunch

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.130
of t's, but they're in
the exact same places.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.610
These integrals are the
exact same integrals.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.510
If you make a u-substitution
here, if you just make the

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.300
substitution u is equal to t,
this thing is going to be

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.610
integral from a to b of,
it's going to be the

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.490
exact same thing.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:48.530
Of f of x of u, y of u times
the square root of of x

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:55.750
prime of u squared plus
y prime of u squared du.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.930
These two things are identical.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.120
So we did all the substitution,
everything, but we got

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.250
the exact same integrals.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.660
So hopefully that satisfies you
that it doesn't matter what

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.630
direction we go on the curve,
as long as the shape of

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.500
the curve is the same.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.580
Doesn't matter if we go forward
or backward on the curve, we're

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.950
going to get the same answer.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.510
And I think that meets our
intuition, because in either

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:21.650
case, we're finding the
area of this curtain.
