00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.940
A local hospital recently
conducted a blood drive where

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.990
they collected a total of 80
pints of blood from donors.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.340
The hospital was hoping to
collect a total of 8 gallons

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.170
of blood from the drive.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.890
Did they meet their goal?

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.490
How much more or less
than their goal did

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.030
the hospital collect?

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.640
So really, they collected
80 pints.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.830
We just need to figure out how
many gallons that is, and then

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.750
say, well, is that going to be
more or less than 8 gallons?

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.000
So we start with 80 pints.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.770
And we can take it
step by step.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.090
You may or may not know how
many pints there are per

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.415
gallon, so let's just go
straight to quarts first, and

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:39.360
then from quarts we
can go to gallons.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.080
But if you know right from the
get go how many pints there

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.620
are per gallon, you
could go there.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.310
So let's convert
this to quarts.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.430
So we have 80 pints, so what
are we going to multiply or

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.120
divide by to get quarts?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.650
Well, one way to think about
it, you're going from a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.150
smaller unit, pints, to a larger
unit, so you're going

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.020
to have less of that
larger unit.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.740
So you're going to divide.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.330
This number's going
to be smaller when

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.640
it goes into quarts.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.610
And it's going to be smaller by
a factor of 2 because you

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.850
have 2 pints per quart.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.260
You're not going to
multiply by 2.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.270
You're not going to
have more quarts.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.780
You're going to divide by 2.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.090
So you could say, times 1/2.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.540
This is the same thing as
dividing by 2, and we'll make

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.560
sure that the units work out.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.190
We have one quart for every 2
pints, or you can view this as

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.150
2 pints per quart or 1/2
of a quart per pint.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.950
Either way, the units work out,
and you're essentially

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.560
taking 80 and dividing by 2, or
multiplying by 1/2, and you

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.690
get 40 quarts.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.700
And I want to make sure that
your brain does it both ways.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.180
Because when you're just doing
it, you don't have paper, you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.640
don't have the units around, you
should just think, hey, 80

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.540
pints, there's 2 pints
per quart.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.190
I'm going to have half
as many quarts.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.710
I'm going to have 40 quarts.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.980
But when problems get a little
bit more complicated, it is

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.750
nice to make sure that the units
cancel out in this way,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.370
so that you know, OK,
1 quart is 2 pints.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.090
Pints in the denominator, pints
in the numerator, cancel

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.080
them out, and I'm just left with
quarts, and 80 times 1/2,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.890
which is 40.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.840
So we have 40 quarts
now, and now we can

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.170
convert this to gallons.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.620
We know that there are 4 quarts
per gallon or that 1

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.120
gallon has 4 quarts.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.310
And once again, we're going to
go from a smaller unit to a

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.920
larger unit, to gallons.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.070
So we know there's a factor
of 4 difference.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.090
Since you're going to a larger
unit, your brain should say,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.460
hey, I'm going to divide by 4.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.710
I'm going to have a factor 4
fewer gallons because it's a

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.820
larger unit.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.540
And to make sure that units work
out, you just remember,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.070
well, we have quarts up here in
the numerator, you're going

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.590
to want quarts down here
in the denominator.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.610
And we care about converting
into gallons, and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.820
1 gallon is 4 quarts.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.850
And this will work out.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.380
The quarts will cancel out.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.600
And notice, you're also
dividing by 4.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.110
40 times 1/4 is the exact same
thing as 40 divided by 4,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.900
which makes sense.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.730
We're going to a larger unit.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.270
So 40 times 1/4 is 10, and the
units left are gallons.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.620
So the 80 pints of blood
that the hospital

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.320
collected is 10 gallons.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.480
Their goal was only 8 gallons.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.390
So did they meet their goal?

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.920
Yes, they met their goal!

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.460
How much more or less
than their goal did

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.460
the hospital collect?

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.220
Well, their goal was 8,
they collected 10.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.080
They collected 2 extra gallons
than their goal.
