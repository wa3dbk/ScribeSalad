00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:06.764
In the last video, we hopefully set up some of the intuition for why - or I should say what - the Maclaurin

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:11.733
series is all about, and I said at the end of the videos that a Maclaurin series is just a special case

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:15.800
of a Taylor series. In the case of a Maclaurin series, we're approximating

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.800
this function around x is equal to 0, and a Taylor series, and we'll talk about that in a future video,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.800
you can pick an arbitrary x value - or f(x) value, we should say, around which to approximate the function.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.133
But with that said, let's just focus on Maclaurin, becuase to some degree it's a little bit simpler,

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:39.800
and that by itself can lead us to some pretty profound conclusions about mathematics,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.733
and that's actually where I'm trying to get to.

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:45.133
So let's take the Maclurin series of some interesting functions

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.359
and I'm gonna do functions where it's pretty easy to take the derivatives, and you can

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.067
/keep/ taking their derivatives over and over and over and over and over again.

00:00:53.067 --> 00:01:01.733
So let's take the Maclaurin series of cosine of x, so if f(x)=cos(x),

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:06.867
then - before I even apply this formula, that we somewhat derived in the last video,

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.800
or at least got the intuitive for in the last video -

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.067
let's take a bunch of derivatives of f(x), just so we have a good sense of it.

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:20.467
So, if we take the first derivative, if we take the first derivative, derivative of cos(x) = -sin(x)

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:25.800
if we take the derivative of that, if we take the derivative of that,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.467
derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and we have the negative there, so it's -cos(x)

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:35.867
so if we take the derivative of that, so this is the third derivative of cos(x),

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:41.067
now it's just going to be positive sine of x, and if we take the derivative of that,

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.733
we get cos(x) again.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:47.800
We get cosine of x again. So if we take the derivative of that,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.200
this is the fourth derivative, I should, I should use this notation

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.867
but you get the idea, we'll get cos(x) again.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:57.733
And if you look at what we talked about in the last video, we want the difference - we want

00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:01.200
the function, and we want it's various derivatives evaluated at 0,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.800
so let's evaluate it at 0. So f(0), cos(0) is 1, cosine of zero is one.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.133
Whether you're talking about zero radians or zero degrees, doesn't matter,

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:28.467
sine of zero is zero, so this is f prime of - f prime of zero, is zero. And then cos(0)

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:32.867
is, once again, one, but we have the negative out there, so it becomes negative one.

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:37.467
So f - the second derivative evaluated at zero is negative one.

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:42.800
Let's take the third derivative, the third derivative evaluated at zero

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.000
well, sine of zero is just zero, and then the fourth derivative evaluated at zero,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.467
cosine of zero is one. So f prime prime prime at zero is now equal to one.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:57.800
So you see an interesting pattern here - one, zero, negative one, zero, one,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.133
then you go to zero, then you go to negative one, zero.

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:05.600
So if we were to apply this to find it's Maclaurin representation, what would we get?

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.133
Let me do my best attempt at this. So we would get, our polynomial would be -

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:19.533
so our polynomial approximation of cosine of x is going to be f(0),

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:28.600
f(0) is one, and then we have one plus f'(0) times x.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.600
But f'(0) is just zero, so we're not going to have this term over there, it's going to be

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.800
zero times x, I won't even take the trouble of writing it down, it would be this zero

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.133
time x, then plus f prime prime or second derivative, which is negative one,

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:49.467
so I'll write negative - negative, this is a negative one right here,

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:53.133
this is a negative one, times x squared, times x squared,

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:59.600
over 2 factorial - over two factorial, which in this case is just going to be two.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.333
But I'll just write it down here as two factorial, to make the pattern a little bit more obvious,

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:09.333
and then we go to the next term, the third derivative evaluated at zero

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:14.200
but the third derivative evaluated at zero is just zero, so this term won't be there as well,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.431
then you go to the fourth derivative, the fourth derivative evaluated at zero is positive one,

00:04:19.431 --> 00:04:23.733
so this coefficient right here is going to be a one, and so you're going to have

00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:30.533
one times x to the fourth over four factorial, so plus x to the fourth over four factorial,

00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:33.000
and I think you start seeing a pattern now.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.600
You have sign switches - and you would see this if we kept going, so

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.133
you can verify it for yourself if you don't believe me -

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:44.200
so you have a positive sign, a negative sign, a positive sign, and then a

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.067
negative sign, so on and so forth, and this is, uh, one times x to the zeroth power,

00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:54.800
then you jump two to x to the squared, jump two to x to the fourth, and

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.267
so if we kept that up, we'd have a positive sign, now we have a negative sign,

00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:03.267
it would be x to the sixth over six factorial, then you have a positive sign,

00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:07.800
x to the eighth over eight factorial, and then you'd have a negative sign,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.867
x to the tenth over ten factorial, and you can just keep going that way.

00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:18.867
And if you kept going with this series, this would be the polynomial representation of

00:05:18.867 --> 00:05:23.533
cosine of x. And it's frankly just kind of cool that if can be represented this way.

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:27.600
It's a pretty simple pattern here for a trigonometric function.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.800
Once again, it kind of tells you that all of this math is connected. And we'll see,

00:05:30.800 --> 99:59:59.999
two or three videos from now, it's connected in far more profound ways then you can possibly imagine.
