00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.790
Let's see if we can tackle a
more complicated partial

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.950
fraction decomposition problem.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:15.386
I have 10x squared plus 12x
plus 20, all of that over

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:18.630
x to the third minus 8.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.050
The first thing to do with any
of these rational expressions

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.920
that you want to decompose is
to just make sure that the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.180
numerator is of a lower degree
than the denominator, and if

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.260
it's not, then you just do the
algebraic long division like

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.350
we did in the first video.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.660
But here, you can do
from [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.290
the highest degree term here is
a second-degree term, here it's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.990
a third-degree term,
so we're cool.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.470
This is a lower degree
than that one.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.570
If it was the same or higher,
we would do a little

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.790
long division.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.500
The next thing to do, if we're
going to decompose this into

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.480
its components, we have to
figure out the factors of the

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.090
denominator right here, so that
we can use those factors as the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.440
denominators in each of the
components, and a third-degree

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.690
polynomial is much, much, much
harder to factor than

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.850
a second-degree
polynomial, normally.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.990
But in this case, there's
something that should hopefully

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.370
pop out at you-- if it doesn't
immediately, hopefully what I'm

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.890
about to say will make it pop
out at you in the future-- is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.880
you should always think about
what number, when you

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.030
substitute into a polynomial,
will make it equal to 0.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.420
And in this case, what to the
third power minus 8 equals 0?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.310
And hopefully 2
pops out at you.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310
And this is something
you can only do really

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.840
through inspection or
through experience.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.450
And you'll immediately see 2 to
the third minus 8 is 0, so 2 is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.890
a 0 of this, or 2 makes this
expression 0, and that tells us

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.680
that x minus 2 is a factor.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.940
So we can rewrite this right
here as 10x squared plus 12x

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.060
plus 20 over x minus 2
times something something

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.810
something something.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.680
We don't know what that
something is yet.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.420
And I just want to hit the
point home of why this

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.990
is true, or what the
intuition vibe has true.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.600
If 2 makes this 0, 2 should
also make the factored

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.700
expression 0.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.260
And we know that 2 would make
this factored expression 0,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.920
because when you put a 2 right
here, this factor become 0, so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.750
it'll make the whole thing 0.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.140
And so that's why, that's the
intuition where, if you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.760
substitute a number here and it
makes this 0, you do x minus

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.490
that number here, and we
know that that will be

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.590
a factor of the thing.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.300
Well, anyway, the next step if
we really want to decompose

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.590
this rational expression is to
figure out what this part of it

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.790
is, and the way to do that is
with algebraic long division.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.770
We essentially just divide x
minus 2 into x to the third

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.620
minus 8 to get this,
so let's do that.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.790
So you get x minus 2 goes into
x to the third-- and actually,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.050
what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to write-- I leave space

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.330
for the second-degree term,
which is 0, the first-degree

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.940
term, and then minus 8 is the
constant term, so minus 8-- I

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.170
like to put all my degree terms
in their appropriate columns.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.570
You don't have to when you
do algebraic long division.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.590
So x minus 2 goes into x to the
third, or x goes into x to

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.370
the third, how many times?

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.330
You just have to look at
the highest degree terms.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.530
Well it goes into it x squared
times-- I'll put it in the x

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.680
squared column-- x squared
times x minus 2, x squared

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.930
times x is x to the third, x
squared times minus 2

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.540
is minus 2x squared.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.680
And now we want to subtract
that from that, so I could

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.000
just-- or I could add the
negative, I always find that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.020
easier-- so these cancel out,
so I'm left with 2x

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.620
squared minus 8.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.400
How many times does x minus 2
go into 2x squared minus 8?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.610
You just look at the highest
degree terms, x goes into 2x

00:03:50.610 --> 00:04:00.980
squared 2x times, so plus 2x,
2x times x is 2x squared, 2x

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.700
times minus 2 is minus 4x.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.000
Subtract that from that, so we
could-- or we could just add

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.560
the negative-- and then we have
4x minus 8, x goes into 4x four

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.560
times, 4 times x minus 2 is
4x minus 8, and there's no

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.830
remainder, and this is further
confirmation that x minus 2

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.720
definitely was a factor of x to
the third minus 8 and the other

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.950
factor is this right here.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.290
x squared plus 2x plus 4 times
x minus 2 is equal to x

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.470
to the third minus 8.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.080
So now we can write
our original problem.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.330
Actually, let me write-- well,
let me write it down here.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.180
What was it, it was 10-- let me
switch to another color-- it

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:06.110
was 10x squared-- I have a bad
memory-- plus 12x plus 20, over

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.610
x minus 2 times-- what was
that-- x squared

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.960
plus 2x plus 4.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:21.180
So all the work we did so far
is just to factor out that x to

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.450
the third minus 8, but now we
can actually do some partial

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.230
fraction expansion, or partial
fraction decomposition.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.020
So this is going to be equal
to-- and this is the

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.630
interesting point-- this is
where we diverge or advance

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.240
a little bit from what we
did in the first video.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.840
This is going to be equal to a
constant over this denominator,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.260
over x minus 2, plus-- and this
is a little different than what

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.785
you were going to see, what you
saw in the last video-- plus an

00:05:49.785 --> 00:05:52.790
x-term, some coefficient times
an x-term, plus c, so

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.340
bx plus c, over this.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.510
x squared plus 2x plus 4.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.550
And you might say, Sal, how
did you know to do that?

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.180
Well, what you do is
you look at the degree

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.990
of the denominator.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.420
This is a first-degree
denominator, and you say, OK.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.930
The degree of the numerator in
this part of the fraction, I

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.960
guess you could call it, is
going to be 1 less than that.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.440
So this first degree-- so this
is going to be a 0-degree or a

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.300
constant term-- Here
the degree is 2.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.640
The degree is 2, so the degree
of its numerators is going to

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.730
be 1, and since its degree is 1
it could still have a constant

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.660
term, which is a 0-degree
term, so you get bx plus c.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.110
And you know, maybe it does end
up just being a constant, in

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.060
which case we can solve for
b and it'll just be 0.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.600
And actually, there's another
thing you might be asking, is

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.470
hey, why don't we factor this
further, and you can try,

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.980
but if you look at it by
inspection, you could kind of

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.030
in your head do the quadratic
formula and you'll see that you

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.720
only get imaginary roots here.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.830
So this actually isn't more--
this isn't factorable

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.070
in the reals anymore.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.140
There no more real 0's to this.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.770
So we have factored this
as much as we can.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.030
So the key now to complete our
partial fraction expansion is

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.500
to just solve for the a, b's,
and c's, and we'll do it

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.660
exactly the same way we
did it in the last video.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.710
So what we want to do
is essentially add

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.090
these two things.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.050
So if we add-- let me write
this on the left hand side-- so

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:21.890
10x squared plus 12x plus 20,
over x minus 2 times x squared

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:27.170
plus 2x plus 4, is equal to--
if we add these two things, we

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.010
want to get a common
denominator, which is x minus 2

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.340
times x squared plus 2x plus 4,
just multiply the two things,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.290
and that'll be, when we add the
common denominator, then it's a

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:51.200
times this, x squared plus 2x
plus 4, plus bx plus c, times

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.080
this, times x minus 2.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.630
Well the denominators are the
same, so the numerators have to

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:05.030
equal each other, so we have--
I'll rewrite it-- 10x squared

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:15.500
plus 12x plus 20 is equal to a
times x squared plus 2x plus 4

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:22.200
plus bx plus c, all of
that times x minus 2.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.170
This might look like a hairy
problem, and if you do it kind

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.775
of the slow way that I do in
the last video, it would take

00:08:27.775 --> 00:08:30.240
you forever, it would be three
equations and three unknowns,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.130
very very hairy, but we can do
as a system pretty much the

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.080
same way we did it
the first one.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.600
Let's pick x values that
simplify this and allow us to

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.910
solve for one of these a, b's,
or c's at a time, and the

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.430
immediate thing is what can I--
what x value can I substitute

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.030
that will cancel out at
least two of the variables,

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.460
two of the a, b, or c,?

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.410
And if I put x is equal to 2,
then this thing becomes 0,

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.260
which will make this whole
expression 0, and I'll just be

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.040
left with an a and the x's,
which I'll know is 2, because

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.930
I'm picking x to be equal
to 2, so let's do that.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:05.220
So if x is equal to 2,
then what do I get?

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:11.270
I get 10x squared, so I get 10
times 4, that's 2 squared, plus

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:18.850
12 times 2, which is 24, plus
20, is equal to a times 2

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:24.020
squared is 4, plus 4, plus 4.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.980
And then all of this just
becomes 0, because I

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.860
picked x is equal to 2.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:34.780
So this is what, 10 times 4 is
40, plus 44, that's 84, is

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:43.230
equal to 12a, divide both sides
by 12, we get a is equal to 7.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.920
We're making progress.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.820
So now let's see.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.530
We know what a is, can we
pick any other x values that

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.570
will make the b disappear?

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.720
Or the c.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.050
Well, we can make the b
disappear if we make x is equal

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.470
to 0, so let's try that out.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:02.910
So if we say-- let me pick a
new, vibrant color, a yellow--

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:08.840
if we make x equal to 0, then
the left hand side of this,

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.780
this is 0,0, we just left
with-- we're just left with 20,

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.640
is equal to a, which is just 7,
times 0 plus 0 plus 4, 7 times

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.160
4, plus-- bx plus c, the bx
just disappears because b times

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:32.970
0 is 0, plus c times 0 minus 2,
c times minus 2-- scroll down a

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:39.700
little bit-- so we get 20 is
equal to 28 minus 2c, subtract

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.930
28 from both sides, minus 8 is
equal to minus 2c,

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.580
c is equal to 4.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.560
We're almost done.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.780
Now let me rewrite our equation
up here, with the a's, and

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.290
let me see if I can do this.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:55.630
All right.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:06.580
So now I have 10x squared plus
12x plus 20 is equal to 7, 7

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:17.340
times x squared plus 2x plus 4
plus bx plus c is 4,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.040
times x minus 2.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.270
Almost ran out of space.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.280
So now we have x's and b's, so
to solve for b, we can really

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.310
just substitute any value of x
that makes our math reasonably

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.080
easy that doesn't make
the b disappear.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.160
So we can't pick x is equal to
0, but a good number is 1, so

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:41.140
if x is equal to 1, we have 10
plus 12 plus 20 is equal to 7

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:48.650
times 1, plus 2 plus 4, that's
7, plus b times 1 is just b,

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:54.300
plus 4, times 1 minus
2, is minus 1.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:12:04.400
So this is 22, 42 is equal to
49 minus b minus 4-- see, you

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.950
can, I don't want to mess up
the math-- so we can say 42 is

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:17.060
equal to 45 minus b, subtract
45 from both sides, you get

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:22.110
minus 3 is equal to minus b,
and we get b is equal to 3,

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.650
divide both sides by minus 1.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:28.940
And so on our original problem
up here, we now know that b is

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:37.150
equal to 3, c was equal to
4, and a is equal to 7.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.510
So the partial fraction
decomposition of this, we're

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:48.200
now done, is 7 over x minus
2 plus 3x plus 4, over x

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.830
squared plus 2x plus 4.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.400
Well, that was a pretty tiring
problem, and you can see, the

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.150
partial fraction decomposition
becomes a lot more complicated

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.090
when you have a higher degree
denominators, but hopefully you

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.180
found that a little bit useful.
