00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:06.877
In the last video I talk about how both Ben's Shoes and Jason' shoes are fundamentally the same business

00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:09.119
but they have different capital structures.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.786
And the way we saw that is that, their everything, their revenue, gross profit

00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:15.726
all the way down to their operating profit was exactly the same.

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:20.126
They are generating the same economics from the operating part of their business.

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:22.123
But because they have different capital structures

00:00:22.123 --> 00:00:24.290
what happens below that line was a little different.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.121
In particular, you saw interest expense on Jason's business and not on Ben's income statement.

00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:31.586
So let's look at what that means.

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:33.788
So if you look at both of these guys' assets

00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:36.193
so this down here, this is kind of their balance sheet.

00:00:36.193 --> 00:00:37.919
You see that they are the same

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:41.120
they both have 20 thousand dollars in cash, and I've drawn it over here

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.392
this is Ben's assets, 20 thousand dollars in cash, 20 thousand dollars in cash.

00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:50.252
They both have one hundred thousand dollars in inventory

00:00:50.252 --> 00:00:54.655
and I've made the height proportional to how many dollars we're talking about

00:00:54.655 --> 00:01:00.211
so they both have a larger amount of inventory, and then they both have 20 thousand dollars

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:02.039
let me do that in that same color

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.798
and they both have 20 thousand dollars of equipment

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:09.539
so their assets are the same

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.131
the things that are actually generating the revenue

00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:14.319
and the profit are the exact same thing

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.879
we're assuming that they are also renting in very similar locations

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:21.797
that's what would have to happen for them to have such similar economics.

00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:25.054
Now what's different about them is what happens on the other side of the balance sheet

00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:28.521
and this is what I meant by them having different capital structures

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.586
so let me draw the liability's side for both of these characters

00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:34.876
so let's do liabilities

00:01:34.876 --> 00:01:36.873
liabilities there

00:01:36.873 --> 00:01:40.126
and liabilities over here

00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:43.252
now, they both have the same amount of accounts payables

00:01:43.252 --> 00:01:43.253
maybe the people they are buying shoes from are able to delay paying those shoes just a little bit

00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:50.789
so by a few months, or a few weeks, or whatever

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.545
so they owe those vendors some money

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:56.589
so they both have 5 thousand dollars in accounts payables

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:59.788
let me do that in pink

00:01:59.788 --> 00:02:02.212
So they both have 5 thousand dollars.

00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:03.919
I will try to do proportional to the size

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:06.251
so that right over there, that is the accounts payable

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.992
the five thousand dollars.

00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:10.524
they both have that on the liability size

00:02:10.524 --> 00:02:12.233
now where they really diverge

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:13.261
so this is the same amount

00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:14.596
5 thousand dollars

00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:18.385
it should be about 1/4 of the size its not exactly how I've drawn it

00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:20.261
but where they really diverge is that Jason

00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:24.455
Jason over here let me do this in an appropriate colour

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:28.053
Jason over here has 100,000 dollars in debt

00:02:28.053 --> 00:02:30.055
and Ben has no debt

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:37.259
so in his liabilities he also has 100,000 dollars in debt

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:41.261
this is the debt right over here, 100,000 dollars

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:45.322
and Ben doesn't have it so the way you can think about capital structures

00:02:45.322 --> 00:02:47.722
they have the same assets, capital structures tells you

00:02:47.722 --> 00:02:49.592
how did they pay for their assets

00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:53.259
did they take it with debt are they deferring payments to some of their vendors

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.055
or do they have equity

00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:56.630
and you can see whatever is left over

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.322
remember owners equity is assets minus liabilities

00:03:00.322 --> 00:03:03.641
so what we have left over here is the owners equity

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:11.473
so they both have 135,000 dollars in assets, you subtract 105,000 dollars in liabilities for Jason

00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:16.922
he has 35,000 dollars in owners equity

00:03:16.922 --> 00:03:18.659
On Ben's side he has much more

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.553
so he kind of pays more of this or more of the capital structure

00:03:22.553 --> 00:03:24.528
equity here, more of it is debt

00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:29.928
140,000 dollars in assets you have 5000 dollar liability

00:03:29.928 --> 00:03:34.475
here he has 135,000 dollars in equity

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:37.993
so when we talk about capital structure we're saying how are we funding the assets

00:03:37.993 --> 00:03:43.928
and not only do we talk about the composition between debt and equity

00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:46.053
we also talking about the equity is composed

00:03:46.053 --> 00:03:50.586
and we can see in both of these their equity is split into 10,000 shares

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:55.788
so each of those shares would be 1/10,000 of just the equity piece

00:03:55.788 --> 00:03:59.788
so you can split that into 10,000 or you can split this right here into 10,000
