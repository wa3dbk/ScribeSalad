00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.110
Two corrections I want to make
to the video on the sodium

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.770
potassium pump.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.420
One very minor one-- and I don't
think it would trip too

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.000
many of you guys up, but near
the end of the video, as we

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.050
learned, we have potassium
getting pumped into the cell

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.740
by the sodium potassium pump.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.640
Let me draw the membrane.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.270
It'll actually be useful
in the more significant

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.410
correction I'd like to make.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.870
So let me draw a cross section
of a cell membrane.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.790
And let me draw the sodium
potassium pump right here.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.750
We saw it pumps out three
sodiums for every two

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.185
potassiums that it pumps in.

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:41.853
It definitely doesn't
look like that, but

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:42.880
it gives the idea.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:50.690
And we're pumping potassium
ions in-- so K plus-- and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.730
we're pumping sodium ions out--
and that's what the

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.460
whole point of that video was.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.000
When this thing changes shape
with ATP, it pumps

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.790
the sodium ions out.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.870
Now the minor correction I want
to make-- and I don't

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.290
think it would have tripped you
up too much-- is near the

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.790
end of that video, I drew the
potassium ions-- and I wrote a

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.420
K plus, but a few times near
the end of the video, I

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.300
referred to them as sodium
ions-- and I don't want that

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.780
to confuse you at all.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.750
It is potassium ions that
are getting pumped in.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.040
Two potassium ions get pumped in
for every three sodium ions

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.710
that get pumped out.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.860
So I don't want-- even thought
I drew a K plus, sometimes I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.330
said sodium by accident.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.930
Don't want that to
confuse you.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.710
That is the minor error.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.120
The more significant error is
that I said that the main

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.540
reason that we had this
potential difference-- why it

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:49.050
is more positive on the outside
than the inside-- so

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.260
this is less positive.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.060
I said that the main reason
was because of this ratio.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.320
We're pumping out three sodium
ions for every two potassium

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.740
ions that we pump in.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.700
And I just got a very nice
letter from a professor of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.020
physiology, Steven Baylor at
University of Pennsylvania,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.120
and he wrote a very interesting
email and it

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.940
corrects me.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.750
And it's a very interesting
thing to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.830
think about in general.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.210
So here's what he wrote
and let's think

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.410
about what he's saying.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.310
He says: Here at Penn Medical
School, we have a nice

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.480
teaching program that stimulates
the ion fluxes

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.630
across a generic cell, --So
the ion flux is just the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.660
movement of the ions across the
membrane-- including that

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.340
due to the sodium potassium
pump and that which arises

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.100
from the resting

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.600
permeabilities of the membrane.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.550
So the resting permeabilities
is how easy it is for these

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.850
ions to go through
the membrane.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.270
And we'll talk more about
that in a second.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.140
And the resting permeabilities
of the membrane to sodium,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.050
potassium, chloride,
et cetera.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.130
One option our program gives
students is to change the pump

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.760
stoichiometry from
three to two.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.160
So when he's talking about pump
stoichiometry from three

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.200
to two, he's just talking
about they're

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.340
changing the ratios.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.400
So they change it
from 3:2 to 2:2.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.850
So what that means is, they have
a simulation program that

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.520
says, well, what if the sodium
potassium pump, instead of

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.030
pumping three sodiums out for
every two potassium it pumps

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.420
in, what if it was even?

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.820
What if it was two sodiums
and two potassiums?

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.310
And based on my explanation of
why we have this potential

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.910
difference, that should not lead
to a potential difference

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.880
if the main reason was the
stoichiometry-- the ratio of

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.870
sodium being pumped to the
potassium being pumped in.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.630
But he goes on to say: They
could change it to 2:2 in the

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.690
simulation.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.500
As a result of this maneuver,
the membrane potential changes

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.070
from its normal value of about
-80 millivolts-- and they

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.030
measure that.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.750
They take the voltage here minus
the voltage there so

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.790
that you get a negative
number.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.950
This is more positive.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.240
It's a larger number.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.300
So it changes from -80
millivolts to about -78

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.850
millivolts.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.510
So what he's saying is, if you
change this from three and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.962
two-- three sodiums for every
two potassiums that get pumped

00:04:07.962 --> 00:04:10.620
in-- if you change that to
2:2, it actually doesn't

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.790
change the potential
that much.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.310
You still have a more positive
environment outside than you

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.630
have inside.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.459
So that leads to the question--
then why do we have

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.030
the potential if the
stoichiometry of this ratio is

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.870
not the main cause?

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.610
So it says, it changes
a little bit.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.980
The potential difference becomes
a little bit less.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.320
The cell swells a few percentage
and then everything

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.340
stabilizes.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.750
So then he goes on to write: So
while it is true that the

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.290
normal stoichiometry of the
pump does have a slight

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.010
negative influence on the
membrane potential-- that's

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.100
just the membrane potential,
the voltage across the

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.750
membrane-- the imbalance in the
pump stoichiometry is not

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.590
the main reason for the large
negative membrane

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.180
potential of the cell.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.120
Rather, the main-- let me
underline this-- the main

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.790
reason is the concentration
gradients established by the

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.350
pump in combination with the
fact that the resting cell

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.360
membrane is highly permeable to
potassium and only slightly

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.610
permeable to sodium.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.380
So we said in the last video--
or the first video on the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.650
sodium potassium pump-- we said
there were channels that

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.420
the sodium could go through and
there's also channels that

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.780
the potassium could
go through.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.490
And now what he's saying is
that the main cause of the

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.900
potential difference isn't this
ratio, it's the fact that

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.560
the membrane is highly permeable
to potassium.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.580
So this is very permeable.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.640
Potassium can get out if it
wants to, much easier than it

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.160
is for sodium to get in.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.760
So what that happens-- even if
this was a 2:2 ratio-- it's

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.550
actually a 3:2, but even if
this was a 2:2 ratio, even

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.040
though this environment is more
positive, you're just

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.460
more likely to have to potassium
ions down here bump

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.200
in just the right way to get
across and get to the other

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.940
side, go against its chemical
gradient, right, because you

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.130
have a higher concentration of
potassium here than over here.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.420
So you're more likely to have
a potassium bump in just the

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.980
right way to get through this
channel and get out-- than you

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.420
are to have a sodium be able to
go the opposite direction.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.500
And that's what makes
this environment.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.700
So you have more potassium
coming outside because of this

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.590
permeability than sodium coming
inside-- and that's the

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.380
main cause of the potential
difference between the outside

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.700
and the inside.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.930
And so thank you, Steven Baylor,
for that correction.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.410
Very interesting.
