00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:00.710
OK.

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.870
I've got some matrix A.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.980
It's an n by k matrix.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.320
Let's say it's not just
any n by k matrix.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.650
This matrix A has a bunch of
columns that are all linearly

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.400
independent.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.320
So, a1.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.440
a2, all the way through ak
are linearly independent.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.590
They are linearly independent
columns.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.250
Let me write that down.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.620
a1, a2, all the column
vectors of A.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.430
All the way through ak are
linearly independent.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.460
Now, what does that mean?

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.250
That means that the only
solution to x1 times a1 plus

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.820
x2 times a2, plus all the
way to xk times ak.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.320
The only solution to this is all
of these x's have to be 0.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.210
So, all xi's must
be equal to 0.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.740
That's what linear independence
implies.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.060
Or another way to write it is
all the solutions to this

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:12.350
equation x1, x2, all
the way down to xk

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.090
equaling the zero vector.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.410
That all the solutions to this
are all of these entries have

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.260
to be equal to 0.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.730
This is just another way of
writing this right there.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.970
We've seen it multiple times.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.260
That's the zero vector
right there.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.850
So if all of these have to be 0,
that's like saying that the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:40.310
only solution to ax is equal
to 0, is x is equal to the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.320
zero vector.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.420
Or another way to say it-- this
is all coming out of the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.090
fact that this guy's columns
are linearly independent.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.430
So linear independence
of columns.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.870
Based on that, we can say, since
the only solution to ax

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.630
is equal to 0 is x is equal to
the zero vector, we know that

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.220
the null space of a must be
equal to the zero vector.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.900
Or it's a set with the just
the zero vector in it.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.280
And that is all a
bit of review.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280
Now, n by k.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.350
We don't know its dimensions.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.600
It may or may not be
a square matrix.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.970
So we don't know, necessarily,
whether it's invertible and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.010
all of that.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.410
But maybe we can construct an
invertible matrix with it.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.530
So, let's study a transpose
times a.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.716
a transpose times a.

00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:30.610
A is an n by k matrix.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.030
A transpose will be
a k by n matrix.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.710
So, A transpose a is going
to be a k by k matrix.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.090
So it's a square matrix.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.260
So that's a nice place
to start for

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.280
an invertible matrix.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.410
So let's see if it is
actually invertible.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.590
We don't know anything
about A.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.380
All we know is its columns
are linearly independent.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.760
Let's see if A transpose
a is invertible.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.980
Essentially, to show that it's
invertible, if we can show

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.110
that all of its columns are
linearly independent, then

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.220
we'll know it's invertible.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.020
If we have any-- and I'll
get back to this at

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.710
the end of the video.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:20.400
But if you have a square
matrix with linearly

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.670
independent columns-- remember,
the linearly

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.030
independent columns all are
associated with pivot columns

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.740
when you put them in reduced
row echelon form.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.660
So if you have a square matrix,
then you're going to

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.070
have exactly-- so if it's a k by
k matrix, that means you're

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.960
going to have k-- that means
that the reduced row echelon

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:56.590
form of a matrix will have k
pivot columns and be k by k.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.740
And be a square k by k matrix.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.540
And there's only one k by k
matrix with k pivot columns.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.985
And that's the identity
matrix.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.240
The k by k identity matrix.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.460
And if when you do something
to reduce row echelon form,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.260
and it you got the identity
matrix, that means that your

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.510
matrix is invertible.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.810
I could have probably left that
to the end of the video,

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.420
but I just want to show you.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.610
If we can show that-- we already
know that this guy's

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.670
square, that a transpose
A is a square matrix.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.780
If we can show that, given
that a has linearly

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.110
independent columns, that a
transpose times A also has

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.170
linearly independent columns,
and given the columns are

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.330
linearly independent, and it's a
square matrix, that tells us

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.390
that when we put it into reduced
row echelon form,

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.920
we'll get the identity matrix.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.580
And that tells us that this
thing would be invertible.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.150
Let's see if we can prove that
all of this guy's columns are

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.950
linearly independent.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.910
So let's say I have
some vector V.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:06.050
Let's say my vector V is a
member of the null space of a

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.850
transpose A.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.230
That means that if I take a
transpose A times my vector v,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.060
I'm going to get the
zero vector.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.040
Fair enough?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.770
Now, what happens if I multiply
both sides of the

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.220
equation times the transpose
of this guy?

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.870
So I'll get a v transpose--
actually let me just do it

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.990
right here.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.560
I multiply v transpose
on this side, and v

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.250
transpose on this side.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.290
You could view this as a
matrix vector product.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.810
Right?

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.990
Or, in general, if you take a
row vector times a column

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.380
vector, it's essentially
their dot product.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.610
So this right-hand side of the
equation, you dot anything

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.860
with the zero vector.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.000
That is just going to
be the zero vector.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.870
Now what is the left-hand side
of this going to be?

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.960
We've seen this before.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.330
If you have the transpose of--
we can view this as, even

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.180
though it's a transpose of a
vector, you can view it as a--

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.520
it is a row factor,
but you could also

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.730
view it as a matrix.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.220
Right?

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.650
Let's say v is a
k by 1 matrix.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.450
v transpose will be
a 1 by k matrix.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.510
We've seen this before.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.120
That that is equal to the
reverse product, the transpose

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.250
of the reverse product.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.340
Or if we take the product of two
things and transpose it,

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.240
that's the same thing as taking
the reverse product of

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.160
the transposes of either
of those two matrices.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.530
So given that, we can replace
this right here with a times a

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:55.140
vector v transpose-- and we're
multiplying this vector times

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.290
av times this vector
right here.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.070
And that is going to be equal
to the zero vector.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.160
Now, what is this?

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.370
If I'm taking some vector's
transpose, and let's say this

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.020
is a vector.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.760
Remember, even though I have a
matrix vector product right

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.750
here, when I multiply a matrix
times this vector, it will

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.260
result in another vector.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.840
So this is a vector, and this
is a vector right here.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.090
And if I take some vector and I
multiply its transpose times

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.120
that vector-- we've
seen this before.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.970
That is the same thing
as y dot y.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.070
These two statements
are identical.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:41.770
So this thing right here is the
same thing as av dot av.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.050
And so what does the right-hand
side equal?

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.920
The right-hand side is going
to be equal to 0.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.950
Actually let me just make
a correction up here.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.550
When I take v transpose times
the zero vector, v transpose

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.300
is going to have k elements.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.730
And then the zero vector is also
going to have k elements.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.370
And when I take this product
that's like dotting it.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.540
You're taking the dot
product of v and 0.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.990
So this is a dot product of v
with the zero vector which is

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.340
equal to zero, the
scalar zero.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.170
So this right here's
the scalar zero.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.690
I want to make sure
I clarify that.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.470
It wouldn't make sense
otherwise.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.340
So the right-hand side, when I
multiply the zero vector times

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.710
the transpose of v, gets
just the number zero.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.620
No vector zero there.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.230
So this av dot av is going
to be equal to 0.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:38.490
Or we could say that the
magnitude, or the length, of

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.450
av squared is equal to 0.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.400
Or that tells us that av
has to be equal to 0.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.740
The only vector whose length
is 0, is the zero vector.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.660
So av-- let me switch colors.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.240
Using that a little
bit too much.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.640
So we know that av
must be equal to

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.080
0, to the zero vector.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.590
This must be equal to the zero
vector since its length is 0.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.310
Now, we started off with saying
v is a member of the

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.340
null space of a transpose A.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:18.050
v can be any member of the null
space of a transpose A.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.650
But then from that assumption,
it turns out that V also has

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.760
to be a member of the
null space of A.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.140
That av is equal to 0.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.270
Let's write that down.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:39.220
If v is a member of the null
space of a transpose A, then v

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.420
is a member of the
null space of a.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.230
Now, our null space of A,
because A's columns are

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.590
linearly independent, it only
contains one vector.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.300
It only contains the
zero vector.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.110
So, if this guy's a member of
the null space of A transpose

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.750
A, and he has to be a member
of the null space of A,

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.940
there's only one thing
he can be.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.730
There's only one entry there.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:06.670
So then v has to be equal
to the zero vector.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.760
Or another way to say that is,
any v that's in our null space

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.820
of a transpose A has to
be the zero vector.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.150
Or the null space of a transpose
A is equal to the

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.850
null space of a which is equal
to just the zero factor

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.760
sitting there.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.910
Now, what does that do for us?

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:35.530
That tells us that the only
solution to a transpose A

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.640
times some vector x equal to
zero, this says that the only

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:52.400
solution is the zero vector is
equal to the zero vector.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:52.700
Right?

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.650
Because the null space of a
transpose A is the same as the

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.560
null space of a.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.160
And that just has the
zero vector in it.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.920
The null space is just
the solution to this.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.190
So if the only solution to the
null space is this, that means

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:14.570
that the columns of a transpose
A are linearly

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.600
independent.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.350
You could, essentially, write
all of the linear combinations

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.810
of the columns by the weights
of the entries of x.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.830
We actually did that
at the beginning.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.400
It's the same argument
we used up here.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.270
So if all of their columns are
linearly independent, and I

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.530
said it over here, a transpose
A has linearly independent

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:39.700
columns, and it's a square
matrix, that was from the

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.160
definition of it.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.400
So we now know that A transpose
A if I were to put

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.600
it-- let me do this way.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.640
That tells me that the reduced
row echelon form of a

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:57.370
transpose A is going to be equal
to the k by k identity

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.930
matrix which tells me that a
transpose A is invertible.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.900
Which is a pretty neat result.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.490
I started with the
matrix that has

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.910
linearly independent columns.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.240
So it wasn't just any matrix.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.390
It wasn't just any run
of the mill matrix.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.680
It did have linearly independent
columns, but it

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.870
might have weird dimensions.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.510
It's not necessarily
a square matrix.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.420
But I could construct
a square matrix.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.320
a transpose A with it.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.550
And we now know that
it also has

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.890
linearly independent columns.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.410
It's a square matrix.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.700
And therefore it is invertible.
