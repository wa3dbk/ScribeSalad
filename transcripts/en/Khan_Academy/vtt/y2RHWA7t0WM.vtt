00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.300
We're asked to sort the
following units of measurement

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.860
into two categories:
U.S. customary

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.260
units and metric units.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.430
So these are just two different
systems. You'll get

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.840
more and more familiar
with them.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.110
Then indicate whether each unit
measures length, weight,

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.390
mass, or volume.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.970
Let's do the first. Let's see
which of these are U.S.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.590
customary unit versus
metric units.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.900
So the liter is a metric unit.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.020
You would use it in
the metric system.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.390
A gallon is a U.S.
customary unit.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.700
We've been dealing with that.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.090
If you fill your gasoline in
Europe, you're going to be

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.410
filling it in terms of liters.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.730
In the U.S., you're going
to be filling

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.570
it in terms of gallons.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.190
And we're going to talk about
whether they're units of

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.970
volume and whatnot
in a little bit.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.985
Decigram, that is
metric system.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.750
In general, whenever you see
these prefixes, deci, centi,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.000
kilo, you're dealing with
the metric system.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.840
No one ever talks about
a kilopound.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.010
I guess you could, but no one
really talks about it.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.379
Same thing, millimeter.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.519
This is metric system.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.190
A gram is metric system.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.700
Meter is metric system.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.700
The foot is a U.S.
customary unit.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.750
We'll talk about whether it's
distance or any of that in a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.450
little bit.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.900
Kilogram, once again,
it is metric units.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.750
In case you haven't gotten what
I'm doing here, blue for

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.540
metric, red for U.S. customary
units, or I guess magenta.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.720
Centiliter, that is metric.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.180
Centimeter, meters are metric.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.880
And notice we have the
prefix in both cases.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.110
Centi means 1/100.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.840
Cup, that is U.S.
customary units.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.800
I have to do that
in the magenta.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.140
Cup, U.S. customary units.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.830
Meter, that is the
metric system.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.530
Pound, U.S. customary units.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.220
It's getting a little tedious.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.250
Inch, same thing, that's what
we use in the U.S. Ounce, we

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.600
use that in the U.S. And then
the yard, we also use that in

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.110
the U.S.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.190
Now we've divided them up.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.120
All the magenta ones are used
in the U.S. All of the blue

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.230
ones are used really in the
rest of the world, and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.790
actually some places in
the U.S. as well.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.260
I think a lot of the world is
frustrated that the U.S., that

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.450
we're not all converted to this
because the metric system

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.760
is actually a little
bit more logical.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.870
It's easy to just figure out
what it's saying, and we'll

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.970
deal with that in more
detail in the future.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.090
Now the next thing we to
figure out is whether

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.290
something is a measure of
length, weight/mass-- and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.640
they're not exactly
the same thing.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.580
Mass is how much of a substance
you have. Weight is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.060
how much force with
which gravity is

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.590
pulling on that mass.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.690
And it would change depending
on what planet you're on.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.870
But on Earth, they tend to be
used interchangeably, so we'll

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.930
use it roughly interchangeably
here.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.680
And then you have volume,
or how much space

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.820
something takes up.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.380
So this is distance.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.000
This is moving in
one dimension.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.790
Mass is how much
stuff there is.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.540
Weight is how much the force
that stuff is pulled on, on a

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.470
planet, by gravity, or I
guess a star anywhere.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.030
And volume is how much space
does that stuff take up.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.000
Now let's think about it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.580
Liter is volume.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.380
This right here is volume.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.390
How much space do you take up.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.860
Gallon is also volume.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.390
That's in the U.S. And in
Europe, or in the metric

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.830
system, it would be a liter.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.420
That's a gram.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.745
Gram is a unit of mass.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.110
So decigram just means
1/10 of a gram.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.810
Millimeter.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.610
Meter is a unit.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.890
Meter right here, that is the
unit of distance or of length.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.500
Millimeter, milli means
1/1,000 of a meter.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.570
Foot, that is also
a unit of length.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.250
Kilogram, that just
means 1,000 grams.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.320
Kilo means a thousand.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.800
Gram, we already said,
is a unit of mass.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.900
Centiliter, that means
1/100 of a liter.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.640
Liter, we already figured out,
is a unit of volume.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.330
Centimeter, we already
figured out.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.700
Meter is a unit of length.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.650
Centimeter means 1/100
of a meter.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.630
So this is a unit of length.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.370
Cup, we've seen multiple
times already.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.110
It is a unit of volume,
how much space does

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.240
something take up.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.390
Meter, that is length.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.210
We've seen it multiple
times already.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.820
Pound, that is actually
a unit of weight.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.490
An inch is a unit of length.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.950
We're all familiar with it.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.020
An ounce-- you have to be
careful here-- if someone just

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.830
has an ounce, that is
1/16 of a pound.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.330
It as a unit of weight.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.460
If it was written fluid ounce,
then we'd be talking about

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.790
1/16 of a pint, and then it
would be a unit of volume.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.300
But since it's just ounce,
it's a unit of

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.380
weight, 1/16 of a pound.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.690
And then finally, a yard
is a unit of length.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.460
And we are done.
