00:00:01.244 --> 00:00:03.625
- [Voiceover] When we last
left off in the riveting saga

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:06.811
of quadratic approximations
of multi variable functions,

00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:10.298
we were approximating a two
variable function, f of xy,

00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:13.708
and we ended up with this
pretty monstrous expression,

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:16.140
and because it's written its
full abstract form, I almost

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.651
feel like it looks more
monstrous than it needs to,

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.435
so I'm going to go ahead
and go through a specific

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:23.150
example here, and just to
remind you of kind of what

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.860
all these terms are, how
there's actually kind of a

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.614
pattern to what's going
on, this here represents,

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:30.318
you can think of it as the
constant term, where you know

00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:32.687
this is just going to evaluate
to some kind of number.

00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:37.043
These two terms are what you
might call the linear term,

00:00:37.043 --> 00:00:40.288
linear, because if you
actually look, the only places

00:00:40.288 --> 00:00:43.339
where the variable x
and y comes up is here,

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.033
where it's just being
multiplied by a constant,

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.288
and here, where it's just
being multiplied by a constant,

00:00:47.288 --> 00:00:49.638
so it's just variables
times constant in there.

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:51.714
And then all of this stuff
at the end, which is kind of

00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:54.116
the whole essence of a
quadratic approximation,

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.716
where you start to have things
like you get an x squared,

00:00:56.716 --> 00:00:59.415
and you get x gets to be multiplied by y,

00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:01.958
all of this stuff is the
quadratic term, and though

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.879
it seems like a lot now,
you'll see in the context

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.712
of an actual example, it's
not necessarily as bad

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:07.799
as it seems.

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.966
So let's say we're looking
at the function f of xy

00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:16.122
and let's say it's going to be

00:01:16.122 --> 00:01:18.534
e to the x divided by two,

00:01:18.534 --> 00:01:20.540
multiplied by sin of y.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.044
This is our multi variable function.

00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:24.844
And let's say we want to
approximate this near some

00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:26.965
kind of point, and I'm going
to choose a point that's

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:30.011
something that we can
actually evaluate these at,

00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:33.067
so like x, it would be
convenient if that was zero,

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:36.468
and then y, I'll go with
pi halves, because that's

00:01:36.468 --> 00:01:38.719
something where I'll
know how to evaluate sin,

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.127
and where I'll know how to
evaluate its derivatives,

00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:42.074
things like that.

00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:44.417
So we're trying to
approximate this function near

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:45.861
this point.

00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:47.015
Now first things first.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.116
We're just going to need
to get all of the different

00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:51.057
partial derivatives and
second partial derivatives.

00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:52.933
We know we're going to need
them, so let's just kind

00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:55.246
of start working it through,
and figuring out what

00:01:55.246 --> 00:01:56.579
all of them are.

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:01.895
Let's start with the partial
derivative with respect to x.

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:05.428
So this is also a function of xy,

00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:07.194
and we look up at the original function,

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:09.663
the only place where x shows
up is in this e to the x

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:12.538
over two, the derivative
of that is one half,

00:02:12.538 --> 00:02:14.122
we bring down that one half,

00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:15.801
times e to the x over two,

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:17.713
and this is being multiplied
by something that looks

00:02:17.713 --> 00:02:20.338
like a constant, as far as x is concerned,

00:02:20.338 --> 00:02:21.171
sin of y.

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:26.615
Now when we do the partial
derivative with respect to y,

00:02:26.615 --> 00:02:27.615
what we get,

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:30.368
this first part just looks
like a constant, so we kind

00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:33.500
of keep that constant there,
as far as y is concerned,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.498
and the derivative of sin is cosin.

00:02:36.498 --> 00:02:38.936
Cosin of y.

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:40.632
And then now we

00:02:40.632 --> 00:02:42.546
let's start taking second
partial derivatives,

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:44.071
so I'll start by doing the one where

00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:48.167
we take the partial derivative
with respect to x twice.

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:51.032
Now here I'll actually do
this in a different color.

00:02:51.032 --> 00:02:52.759
Let's do yellow.

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:53.857
Just to make clear which
ones are the second

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:55.838
partial derivatives.

00:02:55.838 --> 00:02:57.879
So partial with respect to x twice,

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.237
also, function of xy,
like all of these guys.

00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:03.513
So let's look up at the
original partial derivative with

00:03:03.513 --> 00:03:05.661
respect to x, and we're
now going to take its

00:03:05.661 --> 00:03:07.682
derivative, again with respect to x.

00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:09.301
This is the only place where x shows up,

00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:11.481
that one half kind of comes down again,

00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:13.709
so now it's going to be one fourth times

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.716
e to the x over two,

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:17.214
and we just keep that sin of y,

00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:18.860
because it looks like
we're just multiplying

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.860
by a constant, sin of y.

00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:25.393
Next we'll do the mixed partial
derivative, where you do

00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:27.877
first with respect to x,
then with respect to y,

00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:29.379
or you could do it the other
way, because with almost

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:30.835
all functions, it kind
of doesn't matter which

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.367
order you take the two.

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:33.491
So I'll go ahead and
just look at the one that

00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:35.673
was with respect to x,
and now let's think of its

00:03:35.673 --> 00:03:37.598
derivative with respect to y.

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:39.604
This whole one half e to the x halves

00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:41.776
looks like a constant,
derivative of sin of y

00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:43.109
is cosin y.

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.251
So we take that constant,
the one half e to the

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:48.418
x halves,

00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:53.190
and then we multiply it by
the derivative of sin of y,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.857
which is cosin of y.

00:03:56.971 --> 00:03:59.561
And then finally we take
the second derivative,

00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:01.040
second partial derivative

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.873
with respect to y, twice in a row.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.954
So f with respect to y,

00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:09.204
twice in a row.

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:12.458
And for this one, let's
take a look at the partial

00:04:12.458 --> 00:04:14.084
derivative with respect to y.

00:04:14.084 --> 00:04:16.384
This part is the only
part where y shows up,

00:04:16.384 --> 00:04:18.579
derivative of cosin is negative sin,

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.330
and then e to the x halves just
still looks like a constant,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.675
so we'll bring that negative out front,

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:25.721
that constant e to the x halves,

00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:27.721
and it was negative sin,

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.353
so that negative went out front,

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:31.896
sin of y.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.468
So that's all of the partial
differential information

00:04:34.468 --> 00:04:36.211
that we're going to need.

00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:38.388
And now we know we're
going to need to evaluate

00:04:38.388 --> 00:04:41.503
all of these guys, all of
these partial derivatives

00:04:41.503 --> 00:04:43.675
at the specific point,
because if we go up and

00:04:43.675 --> 00:04:46.445
look at the original
function that we have,

00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:48.428
we're going to need to
evaluate f at this point,

00:04:48.428 --> 00:04:50.431
both of the partial
derivatives at this point,

00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:53.414
the second partial derivatives.

00:04:53.414 --> 00:04:54.969
Oh, I'm realizing, actually,
that I made a little

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.079
bit of a mistake here.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:58.206
This should be a one half

00:04:58.206 --> 00:04:59.820
out in front of each of these guys.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.303
That should be plus
one half of this second

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.042
partial derivative, and
one half of this second

00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:07.221
partial derivative.

00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:08.727
The mixed partial
derivative it's still one,

00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:10.010
but these guys should have a one half.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.311
That was a mistake on my part.

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.075
In any case, though, we're
going to need to evaluate

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:16.575
all of these guys, so if we go back down,

00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:19.132
let's just start plugging
in the point zero and

00:05:19.132 --> 00:05:21.146
pi halves to each one of these.

00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:23.324
So the function itself,
when we plug in zero,

00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:26.459
e to the zero is one,
and sin of pi halves,

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.339
sin of pi halves is also one,

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:31.452
so this entire thing just comes to one.

00:05:31.452 --> 00:05:33.562
If we do this for the next one, again

00:05:33.562 --> 00:05:36.481
e to the zero is going to be one,

00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:37.978
sin of y is also going to be one,

00:05:37.978 --> 00:05:40.045
but now we have that
one half sitting there,

00:05:40.045 --> 00:05:42.293
so that'll end up as one half.

00:05:42.293 --> 00:05:44.014
If we look at the partial
derivative with respect

00:05:44.014 --> 00:05:46.764
to y, cosin of pi halves is zero,

00:05:47.686 --> 00:05:51.169
so this entire thing is going to be zero.

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.640
Moving right along, let's
take a look at this second

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.024
partial derivative with respect to x.

00:05:56.024 --> 00:05:58.359
Again, e to the zero will be one,

00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:00.700
and sin of pi halves will be one,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.832
so this ends up just
being that one fourth,

00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:07.108
the mixed partial derivative here,

00:06:07.108 --> 00:06:10.788
if we have one half by the
pattern's starting to continue,

00:06:10.788 --> 00:06:12.987
you've got the one, this
one's actually zero,

00:06:12.987 --> 00:06:15.640
so cosin of pi halves is zero,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.317
so the whole thing will be zero.

00:06:17.317 --> 00:06:20.098
And then the last one it'll be negative

00:06:20.098 --> 00:06:22.259
one times that one again,

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.654
for sin of pi halves is one,

00:06:24.654 --> 00:06:28.573
so all of that just comes
out to be negative one.

00:06:28.573 --> 00:06:30.999
So this, I mean I kind of
chose a convenient example,

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:33.006
where all the derivatives
look very similar to the

00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:35.503
thing itself, which is
actually pretty common,

00:06:35.503 --> 00:06:37.912
so we get to leverage
a lot of the work that

00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:39.222
we did earlier.

00:06:39.222 --> 00:06:41.270
So now we have these
six different constants,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.320
can't keep them all on the
screen at the same time.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.781
But we've got these six
different constants,

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.683
so now we just plug each
one of them in to the

00:06:48.683 --> 00:06:51.094
quadratic approximation.

00:06:51.094 --> 00:06:55.495
So if we make our quadratic
approximation of our function,

00:06:55.495 --> 00:06:57.295
the first term is that constant term,

00:06:57.295 --> 00:07:00.412
so we take a look up and
we say where does f of xy

00:07:00.412 --> 00:07:03.942
go at this point, and it'll just be one.

00:07:03.942 --> 00:07:05.077
We're going to have to do
a lot of scrolling back

00:07:05.077 --> 00:07:06.016
and forth here.

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:08.065
There's a lot of text to deal with.

00:07:08.065 --> 00:07:09.830
The next thing is going to be something

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.405
times x minus zero, the
kind of x coordinate

00:07:14.405 --> 00:07:15.892
of our specified point,

00:07:15.892 --> 00:07:17.785
and that something is
the first derivative with

00:07:17.785 --> 00:07:20.713
respect to x, so that's
going to be one half.

00:07:20.713 --> 00:07:22.530
So come back down here.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.518
That one half.

00:07:24.518 --> 00:07:26.111
And then similarly, we're
going to have something

00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:28.988
multiplied by y minus the y coordinate

00:07:28.988 --> 00:07:32.380
of the point about which
we are approximating,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.790
and for that we take a look
at the partial derivative

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.589
with respect to y, which was just zero,

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.210
so that's pretty convenient.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.524
That's just going to end up being zero.

00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:42.538
And then for the second
partial derivative terms,

00:07:42.538 --> 00:07:43.953
maybe I'll actually be able to keep it on

00:07:43.953 --> 00:07:45.631
the same screen here.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:48.635
We're going to have
something multiplied by x

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.786
minus its coordinate squared,

00:07:51.786 --> 00:07:54.053
and that something is whatever
the partial derivative

00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:56.018
with respect to x twice
is, which is one fourth,

00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:59.185
so we go ahead and plug in one fourth,

00:08:00.203 --> 00:08:01.841
and then for the mixed partial derivative,

00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:03.082
I'll put it down here,

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:07.565
it'll be something multiplied
by x, minus its constant,

00:08:07.565 --> 00:08:08.898
and then y minus

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:11.709
that pi halves,

00:08:12.748 --> 00:08:14.937
and that something is the
mixed partial derivative,

00:08:14.937 --> 00:08:16.803
which in this case is zero.

00:08:16.803 --> 00:08:18.482
Oh and I'm realizing I made
the same mistake again.

00:08:18.482 --> 00:08:21.399
It's not one fourth, it's one half.

00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:24.690
For the same reason that I
made a mistake up here earlier,

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.456
where it's actually one
half multiplied by this

00:08:26.456 --> 00:08:28.956
second partial derivative,
and one half by the second

00:08:28.956 --> 00:08:32.189
partial derivative there, I
guess I keep forgetting that.

00:08:32.189 --> 00:08:35.434
Good lesson, I suppose, that
that's an easy thing to forget,

00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:37.673
if you find yourself
computing one of these,

00:08:37.673 --> 00:08:39.714
where I'll put it in here,

00:08:39.714 --> 00:08:41.677
multiply that guy by one half.

00:08:41.677 --> 00:08:44.226
It's similar to a Taylor
expansion in single variable

00:08:44.226 --> 00:08:45.750
calculus, where you kind
of have to remember what's

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.323
what that squared term
would be, has a one half

00:08:48.323 --> 00:08:50.563
associated with it.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:52.284
So for that same reason,
now we're going to have,

00:08:52.284 --> 00:08:54.773
and this time I won't forget it,

00:08:54.773 --> 00:08:57.683
will be one half multiplied by something,

00:08:57.683 --> 00:09:00.683
multiplied by the y minus pi halves,

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:04.648
minus that y coordinate of
the point we're approximating

00:09:04.648 --> 00:09:06.490
there, and this time that something

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.573
is negative one.

00:09:09.955 --> 00:09:13.764
So we can kind of plug
in here negative one.

00:09:13.764 --> 00:09:16.783
And now this is something
we can simplify quite a bit,

00:09:16.783 --> 00:09:19.200
because that one stays there,

00:09:20.141 --> 00:09:21.759
one half of x minus zero,

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:23.853
that's just x halves,

00:09:23.853 --> 00:09:25.324
this whole part cancels out to zero,

00:09:25.324 --> 00:09:26.692
so there's nothing there.

00:09:26.692 --> 00:09:29.103
Over here we have half
times a fourth, one eighth

00:09:29.103 --> 00:09:31.507
times x squared, so that's

00:09:31.507 --> 00:09:33.757
x squared divided by eight.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.812
This mixed partial
derivative term is zero,

00:09:36.812 --> 00:09:38.118
so that's pretty nice.

00:09:38.118 --> 00:09:40.865
And then this last term here is just

00:09:40.865 --> 00:09:42.957
negative one half,

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:46.684
so let's see, I'll write
it down as negative

00:09:46.684 --> 00:09:50.581
one half by y minus pi halves squared,

00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:53.831
by y minus pi halves squared.

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:58.764
So that is the quadratic approximation,

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:00.563
and you can see this actually feels like a

00:10:00.563 --> 00:10:01.562
quadratic function.

00:10:01.562 --> 00:10:05.230
We've got up to x squared,
and up to y squared,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.700
and there's a sense in which this is a

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.907
simpler function.

00:10:08.907 --> 00:10:10.612
I mean, it looks like it's
got more terms than the

00:10:10.612 --> 00:10:13.788
original one, which was e
to the x halved sin of y,

00:10:13.788 --> 00:10:16.138
but if it's a computer
that needs to compute these

00:10:16.138 --> 00:10:18.885
things, for example, it's
much easier to deal with

00:10:18.885 --> 00:10:21.339
polynomials, that's a faster thing to do.

00:10:21.339 --> 00:10:25.131
Also for theoretical
purposes, it can be nice to

00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:27.099
deal with just a quadratic
polynomial to make

00:10:27.099 --> 00:10:28.639
conclusions about things.

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:30.209
We'll see that in the context
of something called the

00:10:30.209 --> 00:10:32.222
second partial derivative test.

00:10:32.222 --> 00:10:34.796
But just to get a feel for
what this means, let's pull

00:10:34.796 --> 00:10:38.046
up the graph of the relevant functions.

00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:41.555
So this here is the graph
of the original function,

00:10:41.555 --> 00:10:43.958
e to the x halves times sin of y,

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.394
and the point that
we're approximating near

00:10:46.394 --> 00:10:48.356
was where x equals zero,

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.147
so let's see how we get oriented.

00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:52.652
X is equal to zero, and then
y is equal to pi halves.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.772
So this is the point
we're approximating near.

00:10:54.772 --> 00:10:56.786
And the quadratic approximation,
when you plug everything

00:10:56.786 --> 00:11:00.178
in, has a graph that looks
like this white surface here.

00:11:00.178 --> 00:11:02.522
So if I get rid of that
original graph, this is how

00:11:02.522 --> 00:11:04.991
we're approximating the
function near that point.

00:11:04.991 --> 00:11:06.630
And that does a pretty good job, right?

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.778
Because even as you step
pretty far away from that

00:11:08.778 --> 00:11:11.909
point, it's pretty closely
hugging the original surface.

00:11:11.909 --> 00:11:13.927
If you go very far away,
it certainly doesn't get

00:11:13.927 --> 00:11:16.364
the oscillating nature
of that sin component,

00:11:16.364 --> 00:11:18.767
and the exponential
component grows faster than

00:11:18.767 --> 00:11:20.807
the quadratic one, but nearby,

00:11:20.807 --> 00:11:23.553
nearby this actually
gives a very good feel for

00:11:23.553 --> 00:11:25.432
the shape of the graph.

00:11:25.432 --> 00:11:26.938
And again, later on we'll
see how this is a pretty

00:11:26.938 --> 00:11:29.805
useful theoretical tool for
drawing conclusions about

00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:31.836
qualitative features of
the shape of the graph,

00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:34.213
the fact that this looks
kind of like a saddle,

00:11:34.213 --> 00:11:35.765
is going to end up being kind of important

00:11:35.765 --> 00:11:37.295
in certain contexts.

00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:39.328
But before we get to any
of that, in the next couple

00:11:39.328 --> 00:11:41.982
videos I'm going to talk about a simpler,

00:11:41.982 --> 00:11:44.398
or rather a more generalizable form,

00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:46.404
of writing down this
quadratic approximation

00:11:46.404 --> 00:11:48.118
using vector notation.

00:11:48.118 --> 00:11:49.720
Because right now we're just limited to

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.070
two variables, and you can
imagine how monstrous this

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.127
might look if you were
dealing even just with a

00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:55.334
three variable function,

00:11:55.334 --> 00:11:57.235
where think of all the
different possible second

00:11:57.235 --> 00:11:59.442
partial derivatives of a
three variable function,

00:11:59.442 --> 00:12:01.471
or a four variable function.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:03.572
It would quickly get out
of hand, but there is kind

00:12:03.572 --> 00:12:06.819
of a nice general way
to write all of these.

00:12:06.819 --> 00:12:08.638
So with that, I will see you next video.
