00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.640
In this video, I want to
introduce you to the idea of

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:11.070
an exponential function and
really just show you how fast

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.660
these things can grow.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.340
So let's just write an example
exponential function here.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.500
So let's say we have y is equal
to 3 to the x power.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.575
Notice, this isn't x to
the third power, this

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:26.260
is 3 to the x power.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.240
Our independent variable x
is the actual exponent.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.660
So let's make a table here to
see how quickly this thing

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.740
grows, and maybe we'll
graph it as well.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.540
So let's take some
x values here.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.590
Let's start with x is
equal to negative 4.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.350
Then we'll go to negative 3,
negative 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.370
And let's figure out what our
y-values are going to be for

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.540
each of these x-values.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.110
Now, here, y is going to be 3 to
the negative 4 power, which

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.460
is equal to 1 over 3 to
the fourth power.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.420
3 to the third is 27 times
3 again is 81.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.670
So this is equal to 1/81.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.620
When x is equal to negative
3, y is 3.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.850
We'll do this in a
different color.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.250
This color is hard to read.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.530
y is 3 to the negative
3 power.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.840
Well, that's 1 over 3
to the third power,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.500
which is equal to 1/27.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.050
So we're going from a
super-small number to a less

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.300
super-small number.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.460
And then 3 to the negative
2 power is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.470
going to be 1/9, right?

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.970
1 over 3 squared, and then we
have 3 to the 0 power, which

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.880
is just equal to 1.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.110
So we're getting a little bit
larger, a little bit larger,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.580
but you'll see that we
are about to explode.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.750
Now, we have 3 to
the first power.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.370
That's equal to 3.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.825
So we have 3 to the second
power, right? y is equal to 3

00:01:52.825 --> 00:01:53.830
to the second power.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.200
That's 9.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.050
3 to the third power, 27.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.820
3 to the fourth power, 81.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.970
If we were to put the
fifth power, 243.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.690
Let's graph this, just
to get an idea of how

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.950
quickly we're exploding.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.495
Let me draw my axes here.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.270
So that's my x-axis and
that is my y-axis.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.400
And let me just do it in
increments of 5, because I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.500
really want to get the general
shape of the graph here.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.690
So let me just draw as straight
a line as I can.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.600
Let's say this is 5, 10, 15.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.240
Actually, I won't get
to 81 that way.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.250
I want to get to 81.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.480
Well, that's good enough.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390
Let me draw it a little
bit differently

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.030
than I've drawn it.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.960
So let me draw it down here
because all of these values,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.450
you might notice, are positive
values because I have a

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.130
positive base.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.105
So let me draw it like this.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.330
Good enough.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.750
And then let's say I have 10,
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.320
That is 80 right there.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.500
That's 10.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.790
That's 30.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.860
That'll be good for
approximation.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.150
And then let's say that
this is negative 5.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.700
This is positive 5 right here.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.842
And actually, let me stretch
it out a little bit more.

00:03:22.842 --> 00:03:28.990
Let's say this is negative 1,
negative 2, negative 3,

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.140
negative 4.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.830
Then we have 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.980
So when x is equal to 0, we're
equal to 1, right?

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.840
When x is equal to 0, y is equal
to 1, which is right

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.860
around there.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.460
When x is equal to 1, y is equal
to 3, which is right

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.700
around there.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.770
When x is equal to 2, y is equal
to 9, which is right

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.960
around there.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.440
When x equal to 3, y is
equal to 27, which is

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.500
right around there.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.790
When x is equal to 4,
y is equal to 81.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.820
You see very quickly this
is just exploding.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.170
If I did 5, we'd go to
243, which wouldn't

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.500
even fit on my screen.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.070
When you go to negative 1, we
get smaller and smaller.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.910
So at negative 1,
we're at 1/9.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.430
Eventually, you're not even
going to see this.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.760
It's going to get closer
and closer to zero.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.660
As this approaches larger and
larger negative numbers, or I

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.220
guess I should say smaller
negative numbers, so 3 to the

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.140
negative thousand, 3 to the
negative million, we're

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.590
getting numbers closer and
closer to zero without

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.490
actually ever approaching
zero.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.380
So as we go from negative
infinity, x is equal to

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.060
negative infinity, we're getting
very close to zero,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.350
we're slowly getting our
way ourselves away from

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.810
zero, but then bam!

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.050
Once we start getting
into the positive

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.440
numbers, we just explode.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.040
We just explode, and we
keep exploding at an

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.660
ever-increasing rate.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.230
So the idea here is just to
show you that exponential

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.850
functions are really,
really dramatic.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.240
Well, you can always construct
a faster expanding function.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.880
For example, you could say y is
equal to x to the x, even

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.690
faster expanding, but out of the
ones that we deal with in

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.970
everyday life, this is one of
the fastest. So given that,

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.220
let's do some word problems
that just give us an

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.250
appreciation for exponential
functions.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.970
So let's say that someone
sends out a chain

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.162
letter in week 1.

00:05:22.162 --> 00:05:29.170
In week 1, someone sent a chain
letter to 10 people.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.130
And the chain letter says you
have to now send this chain

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.775
letter to 10 more new people,
and if you don't, you're going

00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:40.140
to have bad luck, and your hair
is going to fall out, and

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.350
you'll marry a frog,
or whatever else.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.730
So all of these people agree and
they go and each send it

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.410
to 10 people the next week.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.610
So in week 2, they go
out and each send

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.250
it to 10 more people.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.330
So each of those original 10
people are each sending out 10

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.710
more of the letters.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.860
So now 100 people have
the letters, right?

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.500
Each of those 10 sent
out 10, so that 100

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.800
letters were sent out.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.050
10 were sent.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.510
Here, 100 were sent.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.570
In week 3, what's
going to happen?

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.260
Each of those 100 people who
got this one, they're each

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.730
going to send out 10, assuming
that everyone is really into

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.110
chain letters.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.330
So 1,000 people are
going to get it.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.840
And so the general pattern
here is, the people who

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.250
receive it, so in week n where
n is the week we're talking

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.920
about, how many people
received the letter?

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.960
In week n, we have 10 to the nth
people receive-- i before

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.080
e except after c-- the letter.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.920
So if I were to ask you, how
many people are getting the

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.700
letter on the sixth week?

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.230
How many people are actually
going to receive that letter?

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.140
Well, what's 10 to
the sixth power?

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.150
10 to the sixth is equal to 1
with six zeroes, which is 1

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.870
million people are going to
receive that letter in just 6

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.250
weeks, just sending out
10 letters each.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.420
And obviously, in the real
world, most people chuck these

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.170
in the basket, so you don't have
this good of a hit rate.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.290
But if you did, if every 10
people you sent it to also

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.760
sent it to 10 people and so on
and so forth, by the sixth

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.420
week, you would have
a million people.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.000
And by the ninth week, you would
have a billion people.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.610
And frankly, the week
after that, you

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.100
would run out of people.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.250
I'll see you in the
next video.
