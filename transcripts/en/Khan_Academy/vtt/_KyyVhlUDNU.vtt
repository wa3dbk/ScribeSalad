00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.390
Now that we have a little bit
of a review of oxidation and

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.840
reduction under our belts, let's
see if we can apply what

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.330
we now, maybe, re-understand
to cellular respiration.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.650
So cellular respiration, for
every mole of a glucose,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.960
C6H12O6, we combine that--
and maybe that's

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.040
in an aqueous state.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.560
It's dissolved in water.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.110
We combine that with six moles
of molecular oxygen.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.990
And then our cells perform
cellular respiration in a

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.150
whole series of steps.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.550
And I'll do more
videos on that.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.780
I'll just abbreviate it.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.520
And then we end up with six
moles of carbon dioxide.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.720
We have to breathe this oxygen
in order to perform cellular

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.650
respiration and we have to
breathe this carbon dioxide

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.710
out because it's just a
byproduct of cellular

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.630
respiration.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.900
Six moles of carbon dioxide,
six moles of water.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.450
And the whole point of cellular
respiration is, plus

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.400
some energy is generated
by this reaction.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.630
And our bodies store
this energy.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.890
Well, some of it is just
turned into heat.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.150
But the whole point of cellular
respiration is to

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.650
store it as 38 ATPs, which we've
learned already is the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.160
energy currency of biological
systems.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.080
And then our bodies, or
biological systems in general,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.350
can use these ATPs to contract
muscles or generate nerve

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.500
impulses or grow cells or divide
cells or whatever else

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.300
that a biological system
has to do.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.790
In the last video we learned a
little bit about oxidation and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.060
reduction, so let's apply
those ideas here.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.510
Now we saw in the last video
that a chemist would say-- let

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.810
me write it this way-- a
chemist would say that

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.510
oxidation means losing
electrons, or not being able

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.760
to hog them.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.160
While a chemist will
tell you that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.310
reduction is gaining electrons.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.460
And if you have trouble
remembering, oxidation is

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.680
losing, that's kind of OIL,
that's the mnemonic.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.240
Oxygen is losing electrons.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.490
Reduction is gaining.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.060
Or, RIG.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.060
So OIL RIG.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.760
This is what you learned
in chemistry class.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.900
Now biologists or biochemists
will say, oh, well, you know I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.220
like to define it a little
bit differently.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.540
A biologist will say that
oxidation is losing hydrogen

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:52.660
atoms. And they'll say reduction
is gaining hydrogen

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.730
atoms. And we saw in the last
video that this definition is

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.940
actually hard when you're
applying it to hydrogen

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.150
because it's not like a hydrogen
atom can lose itself

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.670
or gain itself.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.870
And the reason why we said
that these two ideas are

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.200
consistent is because if I'm
talking about a carbon and a

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.530
carbon is losing a hydrogen.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.900
So let's say I have some
compound that looks like this.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.540
Maybe it's connected to a
bunch of other things

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.530
someplace else.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.800
And then later on the carbon--
let's say I have a carbon that

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.910
looks like that and I have an
oxygen that's maybe bound to

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.710
another oxygen.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.020
I'm doing a very kind of
hand-wavy explanation here.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.180
And maybe that oxygen is bonded
to something else.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.730
This is what I start off with.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.130
And on the other side of this
equation I end up with

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.910
something that looks
like this.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.760
Where a carbon is bonded
to an oxygen.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.600
And maybe that other oxygen is
bonded to this hydrogen.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.890
The biologist will say, oh, this
carbon has been oxidized

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.590
because it lost its hydrogen.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.590
The hydrogen went from here--
I'll do it in a different

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.120
color-- went from this carbon
to this oxygen.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.870
And the biologist would
also say that this

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.540
oxygen has been reduced.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.510
It's been reduced because
it gained hydrogens.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.650
But the reality, or maybe the
chemists' definition, which I

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.820
like a little bit more is, over
here because carbon is

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.360
more electronegative, we
see carbon is much more

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.440
electronegative than hydrogen.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.829
And oxygen is even more
electronegative than carbon.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.070
When any of these guys bond with
hydrogen they're going to

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.860
hog the electron.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.170
So here, carbon got to
hog the electron.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.740
So here, carbon hogs
electrons.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.200
While here, carbon gets its
electrons hogged by oxygen.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.610
So here, oxygen hogs.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.850
So by losing the hydrogen, the
carbon actually lost its

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.570
opportunity to hog electrons.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.930
And since it ended up bonding
with an oxygen, it not only

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.610
can't hog hydrogen's electrons
but then it gets its electrons

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.860
hogged by an even more
electronegative atom.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.920
So that's why these two
definitions are consistent.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.150
Same thing with the oxygen.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.695
Here it's bonding with another
oxygen, not hogging anything.

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:04.130
But when it gains the hydrogen
it's able to

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.020
hog hydrogen's electrons.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.290
Because it's so much more
electronegative.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.840
Or you could say that it's
gaining electrons.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.860
So that's why these two
definitions are somewhat

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.370
consistent.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.270
Although sometimes they fall
apart if we're not dealing

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.910
with hydrogen.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.080
The chemistry definition applies
more consistently to

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.660
everything.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.190
But sometimes the biologists'
definition is easier to kind

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.850
of glance at.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.210
Or you'll actually see it
written in textbooks.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.650
So let's go back to cellular
respiration and try to figure

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.890
out what's being oxidized
and reduced.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.000
So if we look over here.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.160
Over here we have our glucose.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.610
And actually I copied and
pasted from Wikipedia a

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.305
glucose molecule.

00:05:41.305 --> 00:05:42.405
And actually there's
one error here.

00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:44.060
And maybe I should edit
it on Wikipedia.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.830
There should be another hydrogen
bonded to that carbon

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.720
right there.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.120
But as you see, all of the
hydrogens, they're either

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.870
bonded to an oxygen or
a carbon over here.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.430
On the left-hand side, they're
either bonded to

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.030
an oxygen or a carbon.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.760
If we were to write its
oxidation state, in every case

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.580
it's bonded to something that's
more electronegative.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.060
So it's going to be giving
up its electrons.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.710
So it will have a plus
one oxidation state.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.880
And oxygen, in every case,
is either bonded to

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.800
a carbon or a hydrogen.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.870
And so, oxygen, if it's bonded
to a carbon or a hydrogen, is

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.520
going to hog an electron from
either one of those guys.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.010
So in every situation in
glucose, oxygen has a two

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.940
minus or a minus two
oxidation state.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.090
And carbon, since this whole
thing is neutral, one would

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.080
think that carbon would have
a neutral oxidation state.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.030
And if you go through this, you
actually find that most of

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.140
these carbons do have neutral
oxidation states.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.080
Let me circle a few.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.710
So for example, this carbon
right here, it's hogging an

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.500
electron from this hydrogen.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.210
But then it gets an electron
hogged by this oxygen.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.760
And then of course it does
nothing with the carbon.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.850
So that's neutral.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.710
This is neutral for
the same reason.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.810
This is neutral for
the same reason.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.330
This one is also neutral
for the same reason.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.130
It's bonded with two carbons.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.930
It has an electron
hogged by oxygen.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.360
But then it hogs an electron
from hydrogen.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.420
So it's neutral.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.370
So four of these carbons
are neutral.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.100
This carbon right here has two
electrons hogged by oxygens.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.910
And then it gets to take one
back from the hydrogen.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.760
So it has a plus one
oxidation state.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.410
This one is the opposite.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.520
It has two hydrogens
that it hogs from.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.940
Then it has to give one
away to the oxygen.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.340
So this has a minus one.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.870
So these two cancel out.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.120
On average, you can say that the
carbons in glucose have a

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.910
neutral oxidation state.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.580
And I'm dealing with the
chemist definition.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.750
And I'm going to show you
that they're essentially

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.920
equivalent.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.210
Here all of the oxygens have
no oxidation state.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.940
Because they're just bonded.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.420
Let me do it in a
better color.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.500
No oxidation state or neutral
oxidation state because

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.690
they're double bonded
with oxygen.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.850
No one's hogging from anyone.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.800
They're obviously equally
electronegative.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.020
If we look at the
products, carbon

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.340
dioxide looks like this.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:02.050
So, in either of these cases,
oxygen is hogging two

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.810
electrons from this carbon.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.990
So it has a minus two
oxygen state.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.445
This oxygen is hogging two
electrons from carbon.

00:08:08.445 --> 00:08:10.600
So it has a minus two
oxidation state.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.480
And this carbon is getting all
of its valence electrons, all

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.960
four, hogged by the oxygen.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.060
So it has a plus four
oxidation state.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.380
It's lost four electrons,
you can imagine.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.580
Because it's getting hogged.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.300
So that's carbon.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.950
So we could write this as four
plus for the carbon.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.160
And then each oxygen
has a two minus.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.190
And we can do the math later
on to figure out

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.360
what the total is.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.669
And then, if we look at the
water-- we've looked at this

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:36.239
before-- the oxygen is hogging
two electrons,

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:39.020
one from each hydrogen.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.789
So two minus.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.990
And then each of the hydrogens
have a plus

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.010
one oxidation state.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.800
So if you want to do a half
reaction for cellular

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.710
respiration, and in the
chemists' sense of things,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.140
just dealing with electrons,
you can immediately say, I

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.190
start with 12 hydrogens
on this side.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.760
Let me just write it this way.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.030
So H12 on this side.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.090
They all have a plus one
oxidation state.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.360
And then cellular respiration
occurs.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.890
And now I have 12 hydrogens.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.440
I could write the 12 a little
bit differently here.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.100
But they still have
a plus one.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.770
Each of them still has a plus
one oxidation state.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.870
So nothing from an oxidation
reduction point of view

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.680
happens to the hydrogen.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.150
Now if we do the carbon.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.650
On the left-hand side of the
equation, we have six carbons.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.810
They have a neutral
oxidation state.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.220
But then on the right-hand
side of the

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.900
equation, what happens?

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.300
I now have six carbons.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.660
Written a little bit
differently.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.165
But I have six carbons.

00:09:37.165 --> 00:09:41.210
And they each have a plus
four oxidation state.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.350
Which means that they have
lost four electrons.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.880
Or their hypothetical charge,
by losing those four

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.740
electrons, has gone
up by four.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:53.320
Because they're losing
negatively charged electrons.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.800
So the six carbons, after
cellular respiration, end up

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.630
with six oxidized carbons,
with plus

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.360
four oxidation states.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.390
Plus-- so each of these
lost four electrons.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.600
We have six of them.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.500
4 times 6 is 24 electrons.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.190
These are the electrons that the
carbon lost. So we see in

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.730
cellular respiration that
the carbon is oxidized.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.490
Oxidation is losing electrons.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.620
We see in cellular respiration,
we draw the half

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.490
reaction, carbon is losing, the
six carbons are losing a

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.640
collective 24 electrons.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.320
And then finally, if I were to
do the oxygen on this side.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.890
I've lost my equation up here.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.670
So over here I have
two oxygens.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.300
And I'm going to draw them
a little bit separate.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.540
So I have these six oxygens
here that have a minus two

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.290
oxidation state.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.050
On the left-hand side.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.040
So I'll draw it like this.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.580
They have a minus two
oxidation state.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.200
And then I have these
12 oxygens that

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.450
are completely neutral.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.410
So I won't even write an
oxidation state or oxidation

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.430
number there.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.930
And then after we
perform cellular

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.540
respiration, what happens?

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:21.400
Well now I have, in the carbon
dioxide, I have 12 carbons

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.280
that have a minus two
oxidation state.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.030
Six times O2.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.350
So let me write that down
from the carbon dioxide.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.940
So I have six O2s that
all have a to

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.210
minus oxidation state.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.990
And then I have another six
oxygens that have a minus two

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.900
oxidation state.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:45.980
So plus six oxygens that have
a minus two oxidation state.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.820
So if you think about it, over
here I had a collective

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.770
oxidation state on all
of the oxygens.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:51.380
These were neutral.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.730
I have 6 times minus 2,
that's a minus 12.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.870
You can kind of view it
as collective charge

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:57.680
of all six of them.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.840
6 times minus 2.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.490
Here I have 6 times minus
2, which is minus 12.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.270
And then I have 6 times 2
oxygens per molecule.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.500
So that's 12 times minus 2.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.280
That's minus 24.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.060
So to go from a minus 12 to a
total oxidation or kind of

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.850
hypothetical charge of
minus 36, I must

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.790
have gained 24 electrons.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.690
And those 24 electrons that
I gained, that the oxygens

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.070
gained, are the same 24
electrons that the carbons

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.600
lost. So from the chemistry
point of

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.210
view, it's very clear.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.750
Carbon was oxidized.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:41.120
And oxygen, which gained
electrons-- RIG.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.760
Reduction is gaining.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.160
Oxygen is reduced.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.240
And this is all a
bit of review.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.740
But it's nice to see it in
the context of cellular

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.580
respiration.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.120
And this actually kind of
answers one of the questions

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.060
of where does this
energy come from?

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.860
In any of these chemical
reactions, when you see energy

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.340
being produced, it's because
electrons are going from a

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.120
higher energy state to
a lower energy state.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.620
If I have an electron that's up
here in a high energy state

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.710
and it is able to go to a more
comfortable state, lower

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.850
orbital or lower
energy orbital.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.840
So low energy or more
stable energy state.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.250
It'll generate energy in the
form of heat, or maybe this

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.770
can do some work in some way,
help make ATP molecules.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.200
And so when you see these half
reactions, you see these 24

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.550
electrons, that are being
lost by carbon,

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.540
carbon is being oxidized.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.690
And they're going to oxygen.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.590
They're going in a whole
series of steps.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.880
It's not just happening
in one huge explosion.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.070
It's happening over a huge
series of steps.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.550
And as it does that, it's
entering lower and lower

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.620
energy states.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.000
And as these electrons enter
the lower energy states,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.700
essentially by going from the
carbons and being pushed to

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.730
the oxygens, that's where the
energy is coming from.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.060
That's where the energy
to make the 38

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.590
ATPs is coming from.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.550
So, so far we talked a little
bit about how a

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.890
chemist views oxidation.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.620
I touched at the beginning of
the video of how a biologist

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.610
views oxidation.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.990
And then we saw that cellular
respiration from a chemist's

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.810
point of view is clearly showing
that the carbon is

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.240
being oxidized.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.730
It's losing electrons.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.610
And that the oxygen
is being reduced.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.190
It's gaining electrons.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.530
It's being reduced.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.760
That electrons are going from
this carbon and they're going,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.100
essentially, to these
oxygens right here.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.020
Now how does the biology
definition of our

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.770
position hold up?

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.580
Well here it holds
up pretty well.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.920
Because you can imagine, over
here, all of the hydrogens in

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.490
the equation are associated
with glucose.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.300
And so they're either bonded,
if you look at the structure

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:43.810
of glucose.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.650
The hydrogens are either bonded
to carbons or oxygens.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.350
So these are bonded to
carbons and oxygens.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.620
And when you go on the
right-hand side of the

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.650
equation, all of the hydrogens
are only bonding with oxygen.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.570
So net-net, carbon definitely
lost hydrogens.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.130
And hydrogens and oxygen
definitely gained hydrogens.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.560
Let me write that down.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.740
We see in respiration, carbon
lost hydrogens.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.463
And oxygen gained hydrogens.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.020
And that's consistent.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.030
Because we see that by losing
hydrogens we are being

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.970
oxidized from a biologist
point of view.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.800
And by gaining hydrogens,
oxygen is being reduced.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.120
And just so you can kind of
makes sense of this when you

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.280
see this-- and when I start
drawing out the mechanisms,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.980
which I will hopefully not make
too hairy-- this process

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.790
of transferring these hydrogens
is facilitated by

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.480
molecules like NAD
plus and FAD.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.180
And we'll see that.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.600
But really, if we just want to
reconcile the two notions, as

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.520
the hydrogens are being
transferred from one

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.490
electronegative atom to another
electronegative atom,

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.480
what's really being transferred
is the opportunity

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.270
to hog electrons.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.320
If carbon has the hydrogen, it
gets to hog the electrons.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.670
But if that hydrogen goes from
the carbon-- and the whole

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.070
atom; not just the nucleus, but
the whole atom goes to the

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.110
oxygen-- now the oxygen
has gained that

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.530
electron that it can hog.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.400
And carbon has lost
the electron.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.220
So carbon has oxidized and
oxygen has been reduced.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.760
And I mentioned this
in previous videos.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.380
But probably the most confusing
thing about

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.840
oxidation is that you always
want to say, all right, that

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.200
must have something
to do with oxygen.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.680
And it does.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.120
The word really comes
from, what would

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.040
oxygen do to something?

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.680
So oxygen, when it bonds with
things, it loses, it takes

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.080
away their electrons.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.520
Or, in a reaction, it'll often
take away the hydrogens.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.920
It took away the hydrogens
from the

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.780
carbon in this situation.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.510
So that's where the term
oxidation comes from.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.130
But you don't have to have
oxygen anywhere in your

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.420
reaction for oxidation or
reduction to occur.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.580
Anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably useful.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.960
This was actually a huge pain
point for me when I learned, I

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.970
got comfortable with the
chemistry definition of

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.230
oxidation reduction.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.970
And then all of a sudden you
open up your biology book and

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.970
they start talking about losing
and gaining hydrogens,

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.750
as opposed to electrons, and it
took me a while to really

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.470
reconcile these two notions.
