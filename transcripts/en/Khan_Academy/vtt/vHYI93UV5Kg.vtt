00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.020
In this presentation we're
going to learn how to graph

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.160
trig functions without
having to kind of

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.970
graph point by point.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.410
And hopefully after this
presentation you can also look

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.120
at a trig function and be able
to figure out the actual

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.740
analytic definition of
the function as well.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.440
So let's start.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.720
Let's say f of x.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.550
Let me make sure I'm using
all the right tools.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:45.200
So let's say that f of x is
equal to 2 sine of 1/2 x.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.890
So when we look at this, a
couple interesting things here.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.980
How is this different than just
the regular sine function?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.170
Well, here we're multiplying
the whole function by 2,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.780
and also the coefficient
on the x-term is 1/2.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.650
And if you've seen some of the
videos I've made, you'll know

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.010
that this term affects the
amplitude and this term affects

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.070
the period, or the inverse of
the period, which

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.730
is the frequency.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.130
Either way.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.440
It depends whether you're
talking about one or the

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.750
inverse of the other one.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.710
So let's start with
the amplitude.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.670
This 2 tells us that the
amplitude of this function

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.890
is going to be 2.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.320
Because if it was just a 1
there the amplitude would be 1.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.000
So it's going to
be 2 times that.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.500
So let's draw a little dotted
line up here at y equals 2.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.230
And then another dotted line
at y equals negative 2.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.740
So we know this is
the amplitude.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.650
We know that the function is
going to somehow oscillate

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.710
between these two points, but
we have to figure out how fast

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.570
is it going to oscillate
between the two points,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.800
or what's its period.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.330
And I'll give you a
little formula here.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.390
The function is equal to the
amplitude times, let's say,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.890
sine, but it would also
work with cosine.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.030
The amplitude of the function
times sine of 2pi divided

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.800
by the period of the
function, times x.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.850
This right here is a "p."

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.340
So it might not be completely
obvious where this comes from.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.260
But what I want you to do is
maybe after this video or

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.950
maybe in future videos we'll
experiment when we see what

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.770
happens when we change this
coefficient on the x-term.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.520
And I think it'll start
to make sense to you why

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.910
this equation holds.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.190
But let's just take this as
kind of an act of faith right

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.140
now, that 2pi divided by the
period is the coefficient on x.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.670
So if we say that 2pi divided
by the period is equal to the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.100
coefficient, which is 1/2.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.440
I know this is extremely messy.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.040
And this is separate from this.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.760
So 2pi divided by the
period is equal to 1/2.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.150
Or we could say 1/2 the
period is equal to 2pi.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.700
Or, the period is equal to 4pi.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.110
So we know the amplitude
is equal to 2 and the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.750
period is equal to 4pi.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.610
And once again, how did
we figure out that the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.050
period is equal to 4pi?

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.670
We used this formula: 2pi
divided by the period is the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.590
coefficient on the x-term.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.020
So we set 2pi divided by the
period equal to 1/2, and then

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.620
we solved that the
period is 4pi.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.650
So where do we start?

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.580
Well, what is f of 0?

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.330
Well, when x is equal to
0 this whole term is 0.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.210
So what's sine of 0?

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.650
Sine of 0 is 0,
if you remember.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.870
I guess you could use a
calculator, but that's

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.320
something you should remember.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.900
Or you could re-look at the
unit circle to remind yourself.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.990
Sine of 0 is 0.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.140
And then 0 times 2 is 0.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.640
So f of 0 is 0.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.920
Right?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.510
We'll draw it right there.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.290
And we know that it
has a period of 4pi.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.300
That means that the function
is going to repeat after 4pi.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.166
So if we go out it should
repeat back out here, at 4pi.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.930
And now we can just kind
of draw the function.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.594
And this will take a little bit
of practice, but-- actually I'm

00:04:24.594 --> 00:04:25.780
going to draw it, and then we
can explore it a little

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.490
bit more as well.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.515
So the function's going
to look like this.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.750
Oh, boy.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.280
This is more difficult
than I thought.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.350
And it'll keep going in
this direction as well.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:51.980
And notice, the period here you
could do it from here to here.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.170
This distance is 4pi.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.490
That's how long it takes for
the function to repeat, or

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.800
to go through one cycle.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.840
Or you could also, if you
want, you could measure this

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.560
distance to this distance.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.230
This would also be 4pi.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.860
And that's the period
of the function.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.270
And then, of course, the
amplitude of the function,

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.590
which is this right here, is 2.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.140
Here's the amplitude.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.590
And then the period of 4pi we
figured out from this equation.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.100
Another way we could have
thought about it, let's say

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.710
that-- let me erase some of the
stuff-- let's say I didn't

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.940
have this stuff right here.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.950
Let's say I didn't know
what the function was.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.090
Let me get rid of
all of this stuff.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.360
And all I saw was this
graph, and I asked you

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.990
to go the other way.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.440
Using this graph, try to figure
out what the function is.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.910
Then we would just see,
how long does it take for

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:52.750
the function to repeat?

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.140
Well, it takes 4pi radians for
the function to repeat, so

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.960
you'd be able to just visually
realize that the period

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.620
of this function is 4pi.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.980
And then you would say,
well what's the amplitude?

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.180
The amplitude is easy.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.320
You would just see how
high it goes up or down.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.170
And it goes up 2, right?

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.030
When you're doing the amplitude
you don't do the whole swing,

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.120
you just do how much it
swings in the positive

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.120
or negative direction.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.840
So the amplitude is 2.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.680
I'm using the wrong color.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.350
The period is 4pi.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.430
And then your question
would be, well this is

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.600
an oscillating, this is
a periodic function.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.080
Is it a sine or is it
a cosine function?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.610
Well, cosine function, assuming
we're not doing any shifting--

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.070
and in a future module I will
shift along the x-axis-- but

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.320
assuming we're not doing any
shifting, cosine of 0 is 1.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.500
Right?

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.270
And sine of 0 is 0.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.900
And what's this function at 0?

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.970
Well, it's 0.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:51.370
Right?

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.670
So this is going to
be a sine function.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.290
So we would use
this formula here.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.120
f of x is equal to the
amplitude times the sine of 2pi

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.190
divided by the period times x.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.780
So we would know that the
function is f of x is equal to

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:19.690
the amplitude times sine of 2pi
over the period-- 4pi-- x.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.135
And, of course,
these cancel out.

00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:26.900
And then this cancels out and
becomes 2 sine of 1/2 x.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.070
I know this is a little
difficult to read.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.020
My apologies.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.960
And I'll ask a question.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.720
What would this
function look like?

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:45.170
f of x equals 2
cosine of 1/2 x.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.530
Well, it's going to look the
same but we're going to

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.930
start at a different point.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.430
What's cosine of 0?

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.430
When x is equal to 0 this
whole term is equal to 0.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.550
Cosine of 0, we
learned before, is 1.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.500
So f of 0 is equal to 2.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.470
Let me write that. f
of 0 is equal to 2.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.600
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.530
Let me draw the cosine function
in a different color.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.560
We would start here.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.270
f of 0 is equal to 2, but
everything else is the same.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.670
The amplitude is the same
and the period is the same.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.110
So now it's going
to look like this.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.600
I hope I don't mess this up.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.190
This is difficult.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.986
So now the function is
going to look like this.

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:30.090
And you're going to go down
here, and you're going

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.030
to rise up again here.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.580
And on this side you're
going to do the same thing.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.210
And keep going.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.510
So notice, the cosine
and the sine functions

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.120
look awfully similar.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.780
And the way to differentiate
them is what they do-- well,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.570
what they do in general.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:54.020
But the easiest way is, what
happens when you input

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.420
a 0 into the function?

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.260
What happens at the y-axis, or
when x is equal to 0, or when

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.040
the angle that you input
into it is equal 0?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.270
Unless we're doing shifting--
and don't worry about shifting

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.610
for now, I'll do that in future
modules-- sine of 0 is 0

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.910
while cosine of 0 would be 1.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.920
And since we're multiplying it
times this factor right here,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.120
times this number right
here, the 1 becomes a 2.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.900
And so this is the
graph of cosine of x.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.750
This is this graph
of sine of x.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.600
And this is a little bit of
a preview for shifting.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.760
Notice that the pink graph,
or cosine of x, is very

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.210
similar to the green graph.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:33.590
And it's just shifted this
way by-- well, in this

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.120
case it's shifted by pi.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.870
Right?

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.790
And this actually has something
to do with the period

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.770
of the coefficient.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.450
In general, cosine of x is
actually sine of x shifted

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.810
to the left by pi/2.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.050
