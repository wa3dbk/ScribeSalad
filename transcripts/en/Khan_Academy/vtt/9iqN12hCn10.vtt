00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.250
All right, let's keep
converting Cartesian functions

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.940
to polar coordinates.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.120
The next one I have here is
3y minus 7x is equal to 10.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.620
I cut and pasted our tool
kit here, and let's

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.110
see what we can do.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.160
We want to convert this to
a function of r and theta.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.350
So the simplest thing,
we have a y and an x,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.320
we just substitute.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.930
We know that y is equal to r
sine of theta and x is equal

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.110
to r cosine of theta, so
let's just substitute.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.180
So 3 times y, well, y is the
same thing as r sine of

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.740
theta minus 7 times x.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.550
Well, that's 7 times r cosine
theta is equal to-- now,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.860
remember, these just came from
SOHCAHTOA, nothing

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.080
fancier than that.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.320
Let's see if we can simplify
this or write it explicitly

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.590
in terms of theta.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.460
So we could factor out an r, so
you get r times 3 sine theta

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.865
minus 7 cosine theta, right?

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:04.230
We just factored out an r,
and that's equal to 10.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.960
And now divide both sides by
this big expression, and you're

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.860
left with r is equal to 10, 3
sine of theta-- 10 divided by 3

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.370
sine of theta minus
7 cosine of theta.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.870
And we could also write this,
you know, we could say, well,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.400
this r is a function of theta.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.800
We could write r of
theta, right? r is a

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.840
function of theta.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.480
I just felt like doing that so
that you could show that the

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.130
function notation even works
in polar coordinates.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980
Let's do another one.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.080
Let me cut and paste
our tool kit.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.740
Look at that.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.480
All right, next one.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.760
So it says y is equal
to 2x minus 3.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.880
Well, we can do the same thing.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.390
We know what y and x are in
terms of r and theta. y is

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.780
equal to r sine of theta,
so let's write that.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.130
r sine of theta is
equal to 2 times x.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.420
Well, x is r cosine
of theta minus 3.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.440
Let's see if we can separate
the r's and thetas, so let's

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.170
subtract this from both sides.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:17.490
So we get r sine of theta
minus 2r cosine of theta

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.560
is equal to minus 3.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.050
Just like the last problem, we
can factor an r out, so we get

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.010
r times sine of theta minus 2
cosine of theta is

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.990
equal to minus 3.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.190
Now, divide both sides by this
expression, so you're left with

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.930
r is equal to minus 3 divided
by sine of theta minus

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.450
2 cosine of theta.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.240
There you go.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.680
Now they want us to
do some problems.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.110
Let me clear everything.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.220
I want to do some problems.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.130
We're going to convert
the other way.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.890
Let's write our tool kit down.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.380
It's proved to be useful.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.170
All right, now they want to
convert from polar to Cartesian

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.560
coordinates, and so they give
us the polar function r is

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.800
equal to 4 sine of theta.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.290
So how do we convert this
into a function of x and y?

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.950
So let's see here.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.190
There's no obvious-- let's
think about it a little bit.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.240
So we know we have this
equation y is equal

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.510
to r sine of that.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.290
So can we write sine of theta?

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.190
Well, let me do a
little side here.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.690
So y is equal to
r sine of theta.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.900
If we divide both sides
by r, what do we get?

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.500
We get y/r is equal to
sine of theta, right?

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.460
Well, that seems to be helpful.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.350
We have a sine of theta there,
and then we have something that

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.550
at least it gets sort of the
theta out of the equation.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.460
We're still left with an
r, but it makes it a

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.610
lot easier to look at.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.250
So let's do that.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.970
Sine of theta is equal to y/r,
so let's substitute that there.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.470
So we get r is equal to
4 times sine of theta,

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.055
which is y/r, so 4y/r.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.140
We can multiply both sides of
the equation by r, and you're

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.930
left with r squared
is equal to 4y.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.570
And we know what r
squared is equal to.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.260
It tells us right there.
r squared is equal to x

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.250
squared plus y squared.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.820
So you get x squared plus
y squared is equal to 4y.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.490
And there we have it.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.950
We have it at least
in an implicit form.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.410
We don't have an explicit
equation, but I think that's

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.100
good enough for now.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.300
So you see, it's really just a
lot of algebra and I guess a

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.190
little bit of trigonometry, but
really a lot of algebra and

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.880
just kind of figuring out
how to use this tool kit.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.610
Let's do a couple more.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.780
So let's say-- let me
paste the tool kit.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.020
Let's say that we have the
polar coordinates r is equal

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.360
to sine of theta plus
cosine of theta.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.320
And just so you don't lose the
big picture of what we're

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.280
doing, we could graph this.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.950
You could put your graphing
calculator on the polar

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.030
coordinates, and I'll do future
videos where we do graph it,

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.310
and it'll produce some graph.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.200
As theta changes, as we go
around the circle, the radius

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.480
will change, and it'll
produce something.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.810
I don't know what it might
look like, like flower

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.580
petals or something.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.650
I don't know I'll have to-- I
don't have the intuition of

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.940
exactly what this'll look like,
but what we're saying is when

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.100
we convert to x and y, if you
actually graphed in the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.210
Cartesian coordinates, it would
look the exact same way.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.100
That's all we're doing.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.210
How do you express the
same relationship in

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.010
terms of x and y's?

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.955
So how do we do this?

00:05:15.955 --> 00:05:20.820
Well, in the last one, we can--
these two, we can rewrite.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.540
We can divide both sides
of these equations by r.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.770
This is the same thing
as sine of theta is

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.590
equal to y/r, right?

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.320
I just divide both sides by r.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.120
And this is the same
thing as cosine of

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.140
theta is equal to x/r.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.060
Just divided both sides
of this equation by

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.500
r, and you get this.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.480
So now we can use this to
substitute back here, so r

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.740
is equal to sine of theta.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.860
Well, we know that's equal to
y/r plus cosine of theta.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.480
Well, cosine of theta
is equal to x/r.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.762
And now we can multiply both
sides of this equation by r,

00:06:00.762 --> 00:06:06.120
and we're left with r squared
is equal to y plus x.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.980
And we know what r
squared is now.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.160
That should be second
nature, hopefully.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.240
So it's x squared plus
y squared, right?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.760
That's r squared is
equal to x-- sorry,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.990
is equal to y plus x.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.570
There you go.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.920
Let's do one more.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.270
Let's do it without our
tool kit, and I'll do it

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.360
in a different color.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.830
Let's say we had r is equal
to a squared, so they're

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.030
leaving it abstract.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.990
But a is some constant, so we
hopefully know our intuition

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.410
from a couple of videos ago
that this should be

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.390
a circle, right?

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.630
If a was 3, then we'd say,
oh, r is equal to 9, right?

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.310
3 squared, and then there'd
just be a circle with a

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.400
constant radius of 9.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.560
So how would you write this
in Cartesian coordinates?

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.940
Well, we know that x
squared plus y squared

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.490
is equal to r squared.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.870
So one thing we could do,
maybe just square both

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:59.750
sides of this equation.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.610
So you get r squared is equal
to-- what's a squared squared?

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.540
Well, it's a to the
fourth, right?

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.260
It's a to the 2 times
2, so a to the fourth.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.220
And we know what r squared is.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.750
It's x squared plus y squared,
so you get x squared plus y

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.920
squared is equal to
a to the fourth.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.580
Not too bad.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.050
Not too bad.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.660
And that's really-- I mean,
that'll get you pretty far in

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.100
converting between Cartesian
and polar coordinates.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.600
In the next video, we'll maybe
explore a couple of these

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.080
graphs to hopefully give you a
little intuition of really how

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.120
the relationships between
r and theta really works.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.100
See you in the next video.
