00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.580
In the price to earnings
conundrum video we encountered

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.340
a situation where two different
entrepreneurs bought

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.130
an identical asset, in this case
it was a pizza parlor or

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.050
a pizzeria, but they
each financed it

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.950
in a different way.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.830
This guy was a little bit
more conservative.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650
He paid for it outright.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.230
The entire asset
was his equity.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.210
He had no debt.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.630
While this guy, he borrowed
some money and he even had

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.240
some non-operating assets.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.590
So he levered up.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.170
For every $1 he put in he
borrowed $10 from the bank in

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.610
order to buy more assets
that he actually

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.680
brought to the table.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.620
And we saw when you did their
financial statements-- their

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.280
revenue, cost of goods--
everything up to the operating

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.940
profit line was the same.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.810
And that makes sense because,
if you remember the first

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.080
introduction to income statement
video, operating

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.100
profit is really indicative of
what the operating assets are

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.100
generating.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.880
So in this case it's what this
purple area right here is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.940
generating.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.740
You could also consider
that the enterprise.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.110
What the enterprise
is generating.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.840
And everything below the
operating line, everything

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.880
below the operating profit line,
is either coming from

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.540
non-operating assets, that
would the case of

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.210
non-operating income.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.370
And the entrepreneur on the
right had some of that.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.330
He had some of this
non-operating income, $2,000

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.230
per year in that case.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.510
While this guy didn't
have any.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.490
And then you have expenses
associated

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.930
with interest. Right?

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.250
In this case this entrepreneur
had 5% of

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.910
$100,000, so $5,000 a year.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.250
And then when you have these
differences in capital

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.090
structure it changes what
your net income is.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.030
And they have slightly different
net income numbers.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.600
But what we saw is when we
applied the same price to

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.310
earnings ratio, and they had
the same share counts-- I

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.490
didn't change too many variables
here I just really

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.860
changed how they paid
for the asset.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.680
But when you apply the same
price to earnings ratio to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.700
both earning streams, to both
companies, you got something

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.280
that was reasonably
unintuitive.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.940
And there's no trick
here really.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.530
Because it's not crazy to
assign the same price to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.320
earnings ratio.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.760
And if you try it out, if you
grow this guy's revenue a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.260
little bit, if you actually grow
both of their revenues by

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.770
the same amount or both of their
gross profits by the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.360
same amount or if you grow
both of their operating

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.610
profits by the same amount,
you're actually going to see

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.170
that this guy's earnings per
share is growing faster.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.040
So given that someone might
say, oh, because of the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.300
leverage maybe I'm willing to
pay even a higher multiple.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.230
So it's not crazy to pay the
same multiple for both of

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.070
these guys.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.630
But we saw at the end of the
last video, when you apply,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.270
let's say, a 10 multiple, or
really any multiple to both of

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.000
these earning streams, you get
a situation that at first

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.780
doesn't look crazy.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.210
OK, the market cap of this guy
is $210,000 if you apply a 10

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.140
multiple to their earnings
stream, while the market cap

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.310
of this guy is $189,000 if you
apply a 10 multiple to their

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.730
earning stream.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.980
Right?

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.400
10 times 18.9 thousand
is 189,000.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.480
10 times 21 thousand
is 210,000.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.390
But what was the conundrum, what
really got us thinking,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.150
was how can this whole equity
stream right here, or this

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.940
equity, or this earnings stream
be, worth 210 and this

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.770
one be worth 189 when this guy
only put $10,000 in initially

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.790
and this guy put $100,000?

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.440
He put in 10 times as much.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.940
And so when you're paying
$210,000 for this asset, for

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.600
this equity, you are essentially
saying that this

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.680
asset is worth $210,000.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.230
But if you're saying that this
equity is worth $189,000,

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.620
right, that's what the
market cap is.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.030
It's the value of the equity.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.690
Then you're implicitly saying
that this asset, that all of

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.500
these assets are worth the
value of this market

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.330
capitalization plus
this debt, right?

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.230
So that's $289,000.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.670
And then if you wanted the value
of this operating asset

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.080
you would subtract out this
much right here, the cash.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.205
So you got something
like $279,000.

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:56.190
So when you apply the same price
to earnings to to these

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.160
similar businesses you've
actually got a situation where

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.110
you're overpaying for this asset
relative to this one,

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.370
even though they're identical.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.530
So that left us with a question:
what do we do?

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.030
What can we use other than a
price to earnings ratio?

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.670
And that's what this
video is for.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.730
So the short answer is,
one, you do have to

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.630
use something different.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.950
Price to earnings ratio is a
good a quick way of comparing

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.180
two companies relative
to their growth or

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.490
relative to an industry.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.040
But it does lose a lot of
information relative to how

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.420
the companies are capitalized.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.140
You saw in the last video that
how you're capitalized, and

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.770
when I say capitalized
I mean how do you

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.230
pay for your assets.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.090
If you have a lot of debt versus
a lot of equity, what

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.750
actually happens on
the earnings line

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.160
is very, very different.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.130
And so you lose all of
that information.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.830
And so if you want to capture
that information, when you

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.720
look at the price of a stock
you have to figure out what

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.730
you're actually paying for the
enterprise of the company, the

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.340
enterprise value
of the company.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.000
So when I talk about the
enterprise, or the enterprise

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.025
value, I'm talking about
the operating assets.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.450
It gets a little bit more
complicated if you're talking

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.180
about a financial company
like a bank or

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.990
an insurance company.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.790
But if we're talking about a
widget factory, the enterprise

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.620
is essentially the assets.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.050
The enterprise value is the
asset value of the assets that

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.410
allow the company
to do business.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.840
So whatever factories-- well, in
this case it's a pizzeria,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.030
so the ovens, the building,
the places, where people

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.940
actually eat their food, and
even the cash that's necessary

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.000
to operate the business.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.500
The enterprise value shouldn't
incorporate the cash that's

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.650
surplus, that's not necessary
to operate the business.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.080
So that begs the question,
how do you calculate the

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.100
enterprise value?

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.110
So you could go backwards and
you say, OK, for a given price

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.980
how much am I paying for
an enterprise value?

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:54.190
So let's say that this stock--
let's say that Company A or

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:03.510
this one, let's say the stock
right now is trading at $20.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.180
So this is the current price
that you could buy it at.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.530
So it's the asking price in
the market is at $20.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.610
While this one is at, let's
say it's at $10.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.700
It's at $10.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.040
So at first glance you might
just do a quick price to

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.930
earnings ratio.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.840
And you'll say, OK, for $20 I'm
getting $2.10 earnings per

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.660
year, assuming it's not
growing or something.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.170
So my price to earnings is
approximately, I don't know

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.070
have my calculator in front of
me, but $20 divided by $2.10

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.870
is going to be 9 point
something, something.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.940
Right?

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.700
While this guy, for $10,
I am getting $1.89 of

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.010
earnings per year.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.440
So what's 100 divided by 18?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.230
It's 5 or 6 times.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.270
It's going to be 5
point something.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.360
6 times 18 is 60 plus -- Yeah
it's going to be 5 point

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.980
something, something.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.900
So when you superficially just
look at this you're going to

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.930
say, wow, this is a cheaper
price to earnings ratio, maybe

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.250
I should buy that.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.290
But what we saw in the last
video is that price to

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.780
earnings isn't a good relative
valuation metric when two

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.120
different companies are
capitalized very differently.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.640
So what you want to do is
instead back out what these

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.660
prices imply about the
enterprise value.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.280
So what does $20 imply about the
enterprise value and what

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.760
does $10 imply.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.670
And how do you do that?

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.270
Well first you say what
is the market cap?

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.300
Market cap.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.450
So you take the price times
the number of shares.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.980
If you remember, we
had 10,000 shares.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.710
So in this case $20 times
10,000 shares implies a

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.090
$200,000 market cap.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.310
In this case we have $10 times
10,000 shares so it implies a

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.900
$100,000 market cap.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.790
Now remember, the market cap
is just what's left over.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.410
So let me redraw those two
diagrams because I feel like

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.420
I'm--

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.490
So for this entrepreneur
you have the assets

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.530
and there's no debt.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.140
So the assets are kind
of completely

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.280
represented by the equity.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.170
So if the market cap is $200,000
you're essentially

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.210
saying that these assets, these
operating assets, are

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.150
worth $200,000.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:20.860
So in this case, at a price
of $20, we know that the

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.910
enterprise value, the market
enterprise value, so what the

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.290
market is saying the enterprise
is worth, the

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.670
operating assets are
worth, is $200,000.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.080
Now, in this case, remember the
market is saying that the

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.010
equity is worth $100,000.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.230
Let me draw that.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:42.260
The market is saying that the
equity is worth $100,000.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.620
But of course this company
has a lot of debt.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.200
It has another $100,000
of debt.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.230
Actually let me draw this
a little bit different.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.380
All right.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.160
So in this situation the market
is saying that its

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.070
market cap is $100,000.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.440
So just to be proportional
let me draw it like that.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.430
Not really use that one.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.480
So $100,000, this is the
equity or the market

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.320
capitalization or the market
value of the equity.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.520
That's what the market cap is.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.230
So that's just the price times
the number of shares.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.700
And then it has debt.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:34.280
If I remember correctly it
has $100,000 in debt.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:49.983
We take $100,000 in debt.

00:09:49.983 --> 00:09:52.410
$100,000.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.520
And so what is it saying
about the assets?

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.150
So the equity plus
the debt, or the

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.860
liabilities, is $200,000.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:07.850
So it's saying all of the assets
are worth $200,000.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.760
This is all of the
assets, $200,000.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.420
But what we need to do, we want
to figure out the value

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.840
of the enterprise.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.900
Not just all of the assets.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.170
So if we remember there was some
of the assets that were

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.260
actually operational and some
were non-operational.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.460
So we had $10,000 of
cash right there.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:31.110
So we have $10,000 of cash.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.990
So when this stock is trading
at $10 it implies a market

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.250
capitalization of $100,000.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.250
It implies that the liabilities

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.550
plus equity is $200,000.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.100
So all of the assets
are $200,000.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.110
But if we were to subtract out
the cash or the non-operating

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.810
assets, what's not necessary
to operate the business, we

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:55.160
get $190,000 of enterprise
value.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.520
So in this case we're
saying that the

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.790
enterprise value is $190,000.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.570
So in this case, when you look
at the price to earnings

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.660
you're like, wow, this is half
as expensive as that.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.270
This is great deal,
let me buy it.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.590
And I just happened to make up
the numbers so even when I did

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.560
the enterprise value it's
only 5% cheaper.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.430
Here it looks 50% cheaper.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.540
Here it looks 5% cheaper.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.960
And so it might be a
little unintuitive.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.730
To figure out the enterprise
value you take, and this will

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.830
be the formula you see
in a lot of books.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.880
Enterprise value is equal
to market cap

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.660
plus debt minus cash.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.930
And you might be like, when I'm
trying to value something

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.620
why should I add debt back?

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.450
Debt is a negative thing.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.590
Shouldn't debt make my
enterprise worth less?

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.480
And why am I subtracting cash?

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.390
Because cash is a positive
thing, shouldn't that make my

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.170
enterprise value more?

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.230
And the reason why, first, you
subtract cash is, and it

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.540
really should be just cash that
is not associated with

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.220
the enterprise.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.280
And you'll see a lot of people
do it in different ways.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.850
Some people subtract out all
cash with the argument that

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.030
the company doesn't need
to use any of it.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:06.110
But the real idea behind it is
to kind of capture the assets

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.120
that are actually generating the
profits of the enterprise.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.930
And the profits of the
enterprise are

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.860
the operating profits.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.430
And the reason why you
add debt is, think

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.350
about it this way.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.100
If you wanted to buy
out this company.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.360
Let's say from this company you
wanted to buy his assets

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.210
at the market price.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.880
How would you do it?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.800
You would have to pay, what?

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.040
You would have to maybe
get $200,000.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.210
If you got $200,000 you could
buy these guys off.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.740
You could pay them $100,000
and own that.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.830
And then you could
buy the bank out

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.030
and pay them $100,000.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.740
So if you paid $200,000, you
would own all of this.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:46.970
Right?

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.670
This would all be your equity.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.780
And then you would get $10,000
back if you know if you wanted

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.060
to take this cash, right?

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.310
So you would have essentially
paid $200,000 which is the

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.040
market cap plus the debt.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.840
That's what you would have to
do to buy out both of those

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.330
stakeholders in the company.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.050
And then you would get
back the cash.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:11.120
So you would have to pay net
$190,000 to own this

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.060
enterprise.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.030
And hopefully that makes a
little bit more sense as why

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:19.020
the enterprise value is actually
described this way.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.390
Now the one thing you might say,
OK, Sal, you figured out

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.620
how to calculate enterprise
value from a share price.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.140
But what if I want to go
the other way around.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.270
How do I figure out what a
company's enterprise value

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.750
should be and then figure
out what its share

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.440
price should be?

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.350
Well one metric, and there's
two metrics.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.630
The most common metric that's
used is EBITDA.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.950
EBITDA.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.620
I won't cover that now because
it's a new term for you, but

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.230
it means earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation,

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.340
and amortization.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.840
And people look at something
called an enterprise value to

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.060
EBITDA ratio.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.710
And I'll do that in
the next video.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.820
But what I like to do is just
think about, OK, what are the

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.130
real earnings from
the enterprise?

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.500
Well, that's the operating
profit.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.700
That's the operating
profit, right?

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.700
And then you could apply a
multiple to that based on what

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.120
other companies are trading at
or how fast it's growing.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.850
Let's say in this case we're
saying they're both generating

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.760
$30,000 in operating
profit per year.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:19.660
Let's say that I want to
apply a 5 multiple to

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.520
its operating profits.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:29.530
So let's say I want to say that
EV to operating profit,

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.730
which I frankly think is a
better metric than EV to

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.970
EBITDA-- and I'll cover EBITDA
in a future video-- let's say

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.130
that I think for this industry
it should be 5.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.660
Let me say it should be 6.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.530
6 times is a good multiple.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:49.840
So in both those cases the
operating profit was $30,000.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.990
So that means that EV should be
$30,000 times 6, which is

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.410
equal to $180,000.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.250
Now for the first guy if the EV
is $180,000, if I'm saying

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.440
that this thing right here, the
market value, should be

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.380
$180,000, then I'm implying
that the equity should be

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.970
worth $180,000.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:17.490
And there are 10,000 shares.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.300
So essentially I would take that
EV and I would say, well,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.540
all of that's equity, there's
no cash there, there's no

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.350
debt, so all of this
is equity.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.200
So I would divide that
by the shares.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.870
I would say that the market cap
for the first guy should

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.830
be $180,000.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.520
So the per-share price,
the price I'd be

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.000
willing to pay, is $18.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.580
Because it had 10,000 shares.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.920
$18.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.690
Now let's take the second
guy's situation.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.340
We both agree in both situations
their enterprise

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:54.150
value should be $180,000.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:59.190
But in this guy's case,
what are the assets?

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:04.270
The assets are the enterprise,
$180,000 plus $10,000.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.880
Plus $10,000, right?

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.290
This whole left-hand
side is $190,000.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.570
And then if you wanted to
subtract out, figure out the

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.570
market cap, you would take
this whole thing and then

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.630
subtract out the debt to
get the market cap.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:17.870
Right?

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.850
And then you would be left with
this piece right here.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:22.890
That right there, right?

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.990
You were just figuring out
this whole distance,

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.540
subtracting out this distance.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.760
So essentially you would say
that the market cap is equal

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.260
to the enterprise value plus
the cash minus the debt.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.870
And it's good to draw those
balance sheets if

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.930
you ever get confused.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.800
Minus the debt.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.920
So the market cap is equal to
$190,000 minus $100,000 is

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.050
equal to $90,000.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.920
And so if you divide that by
10,000 shares you'd say that

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.960
I'm willing to pay
$9 per share.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.710
So if you believe that the
enterprise value of these

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.100
pizzerias are identical and
that they're both worth

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.520
$180,000, you should
be willing to pay

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.700
$18 for Company A.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.450
And if you're completely
equivalent to it, you should

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.369
pay $9 for Company B.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:11.420
And now if you're a little bit
more aggressive you might like

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.550
the leverage, you might
like how Company B

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.440
is growing, et cetera.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.170
Maybe you would like to pay a
premium for that leverage or

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.250
maybe you wouldn't, because it
also increases your risk.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.599
Because you get leverage on the
upside or on the downside.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.369
But anyways I wanted to
introduce you to value.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.690
On the next video I'll introduce
you to EBITDA.
