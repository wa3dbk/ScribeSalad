00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.590
All right, we're
on problem 44.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.740
And they said, which is the
factored form of 3a squared

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.130
minus 24ab plus 48b squared?

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.085
And if this confuses you with
a's and b's instead of an x

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:21.750
there, I just like to think of
in this case, this looks like

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.560
an x squared.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.130
So I like to think of it the
same way I would think of it

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.730
in terms of if this was an x
squared minus some number

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.740
times x plus some
other number.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.280
So let's put that in the
back of your head.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.250
If that's confuses you,
don't worry about it.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.230
But the first thing I like to
do is try to get rid of the

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.810
coefficient on the, in this
case, the a squared term.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.730
Let's see if we can factor
out a number.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.250
Well, sure.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.730
All of these are
divisible by 3.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.590
3 is divisible by 3, 24 is
divisible by 3 and 48 is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.230
divisible by 3.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.810
So we should be able to factor
out a 3, so let's do that.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.485
So that is equal to 3 times
a squared minus 8ab.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.900
24 divided by 3 is
8 and there's a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.170
minus in front of it.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.800
Plus 48 divided by-- 3.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.110
My brain was getting
ahead of me.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.590
48 divided by 3 is
16b squared.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.930
Now to factor this we have to
think about it as, are there

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.850
two numbers-- well,
think of it.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.210
Let me rewrite this
a little bit.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.180
If we view a as kind of the
independent variable-- you

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.350
wouldn't have to do it, but I
just wanted you to visualize

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.370
it properly.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:32.960
3a squared minus 8b times
a plus 16b squared.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.240
So if we viewed a squared as
kind of the independent

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.560
variable or the x term, so now
this kind of has the shape of

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.900
polynomials that hopefully
you're used to factoring a

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.490
little bit.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.170
We just have to think, OK, are
there two numbers that add up

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.590
to minus 8b, and that when I
multiply the two numbers, I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.150
get 16b squared?

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.330
So first all, the number
is going to be

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.470
in terms of b, obviously.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.590
Because if I'm adding them and
I get a b and-- I get b's.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.300
And if I square them
I get a b squared.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.600
And it also makes me lead to
it's the same number, just

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.300
used twice.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.729
Otherwise, it would be weird
to get a squared here.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.680
So the number that should pop
out, you say, OK, what two

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.730
numbers add up to minus 8
and that when I square

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.890
it is equal to 16?

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.870
Minus 4, right?

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.250
Minus 4, minus 4 is minus 8.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.430
Minus 4 squared is 16.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.110
So the number we're talking
about is minus 4b, right?

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.910
Minus 4b.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.090
b, that's a b.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.040
Plus minus 4b is equal
to minus 8b.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.130
And minus 4b squared is
equal to 16b squared.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.310
So we can factor this out to be
3-- let me switch colors.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.390
3 times.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.920
We said minus 4b
is the number.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.610
When you add it twice
you get minus 8b.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.610
And you square it,
you get that.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:00.900
So it's a minus 4b
times a minus 4b.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.230
And that is choice C.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.340
Next problem, 40--
did I skip 45?

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.800
I did.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.990
Let me copy and paste
45 in here.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.290
Can't

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.320
skip problems. 45.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.150
Copy and paste it in.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.100
OK.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.740
Maybe over do on top
of this one.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.170
Let me see if I can
erase this.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.280
Look at that.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.080
All right, now I can paste
45 and we're ready to go.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.670
Which is a factor of x squared
minus 11x plus 24?

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.710
So there's two ways to do it.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.610
You could just factor this.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.500
Well, that's the easiest way.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.690
Or you could test for 0's.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.560
But we'll just factor.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.750
So if we wanted to say-- well,
let me just-- x squared minus

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.340
11x plus 24.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.570
So just like the last problem
you have to say, what two

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.470
numbers when I add them equal
to minus 11, and when I

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.540
multiply them, is equal
to positive 24?

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.920
So first of all, if I'm
multiplying them and I get a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.890
positive 24, they're either
both positive or

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.420
they're both negative.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.250
Since this is a negative number
it tells me that they

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.010
both have-- I mean they both
can't be positive.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.820
You can't add two positive
numbers and

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.890
end up with a negative.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.019
So we're going to deal with
two negative numbers.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.170
So essentially, what two
negative numbers when I add

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.470
them equals minus 11 and when I
multiplying them equals 24?

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.330
And hopefully, 8 and
3 pop out at you.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.750
Because minus 8 plus minus
3 is equal to minus 11.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.600
That's that.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.300
And then minus 8 times minus
3 is positive 24.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.980
So this can be factored as x
minus 8 times x minus 3.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.570
And if we look at their
choices, they

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.910
had x minus 3 there.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.590
And of course, don't
get this confused.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.850
If they said, solve this
equation, right?

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.900
This is just an expression.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.420
Now it becomes an equation
if we put an equal sign.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.620
Then we would have this equaling
0 and then you could

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.597
say the roots of this polynomial
or the solutions to

00:05:00.597 --> 00:05:02.530
the equation are what
makes this true.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.750
And then the solutions
wouldn't be

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.580
minus 8 and minus 3.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.340
The solutions would be
what makes this 0.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.270
So it's be x is equal to 8 would
make this 0, or x is

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.540
equal to 3 would make that 0.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.620
But anyway, I'm going off on a
tangent and that's not what

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.555
they asked you.

00:05:15.555 --> 00:05:18.390
But I think that confuses
people sometimes.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.950
OK, 46.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.610
Which of the following shows
9t squared plus 12t plus 4

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.620
factored completely?

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.410
OK, now this is an interesting
one because immediately, when

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.980
I look at the numbers, there's
not one number that I can just

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.340
factor out of everything.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.350
9, 12, and 4, they don't have
any common factors, so I can't

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.470
just do that simplification.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.880
So we're going to do a little
bit more complexity.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.870
But the best way to think about
is whatever's on the t

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:59.110
squared, this is probably kind
of-- this whole expression, if

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.800
we're trying to factor it into
two binomials or into one

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.870
binomial, this is going to
be the first term of that

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.310
binomial squared.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.590
So we're going to be dealing
with something like 3t.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.880
I'm just taking the square
root of 9t squared.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.380
3t plus some number.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.870
Let's say plus a.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.150
Times 3t plus b.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.200
And now we can actually
just multiply this out

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.520
and see what happens.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.850
Well first of all, they gave
us a multiple choice.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.030
We could just multiply these
out and see what happens.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.280
But let's pretend like that they
didn't give us choices

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.810
and we had to do this
in a vacuum.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.170
If we did this in a vacuum,
we would have

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.990
to factor it ourselves.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.340
We wouldn't just be able
to test their choices.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.350
Let's do that.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.200
So if we multiply this
out, we have 3t

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.790
times 3t is 9t squared.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.700
Then you 3t times b,
so it's plus 3bt.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.650
Plus 3at plus ab.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.630
So this simplifies to
9t squared plus.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.400
Now what are we adding?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.730
Let's see.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.970
It says 3 times, a plus b, t.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:16.380
So it'd be 3 times,
a plus b, t.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.470
I just added these two terms and
I factored out the t and

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.410
the 3 plus ab.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.270
Well now we can do a little
pattern matching, right?

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:34.840
We could say a plus b times
3 is equal to 12.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.950
So a plus b is equal to what?
a plus b is equal to 12.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.610
This whole coefficient right
here is a 12 up here.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.880
So a plus b, it must
be equal to 4.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.160
Because 4 times 3 is equal to
12. a plus b is equal to 4 and

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.095
we have a times b is
also equal to 4.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.980
So the only number that I can
think of when I add them I get

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.650
4, when I multiply them
I get 4 is 2 and 2.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.920
Both of these are 2.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.950
So if I were to factor this
completely I get 3t plus 2

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.920
squared, essentially.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.750
Because both of these terms
are the same thing, and

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.490
that's choice A.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.840
A faster way frankly, to do this
might have just been to

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.380
multiply this out and say,
that's the same thing.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.210
Anyway, next problem.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.620
What is the complete
factorization

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.400
of 32 minus 8z squared?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.100
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.520
So the first thing that I like
to do once again is to try to

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.630
factor out any numbers that are
just common to all of the

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.280
terms. So let me do that.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.470
So 32 minus 8z squared.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.980
8 goes into both of
these, right?

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.090
So let's factor out an 8.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.650
And actually, let's factor out
a negative 8, and I'll show

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.230
you why did that.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.640
Because I like to put the
z squared, I like

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.970
that one to be positive.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.710
So let's factor out
a negative 8.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.130
And so you get a minus 8.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.920
And you didn't have
to do that.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.150
You could have just
factored an 8.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.870
What's 32 divided by minus 8?

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.110
That's minus 4.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.730
And then minus 8z squared
divided by minus 8 is just

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.330
plus z squared.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.010
And so we can rearrange this, so
this becomes minus 8, times

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.690
z squared minus 4.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.320
And now I'll review this because
this is an Algebra 1

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.360
test, so maybe this isn't
obvious to you.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.870
But in general, if you see
something like this, a plus b

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.640
times a minus b-- and this might
be a good exercise for

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.990
you to multiply this out.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.420
But this is equal to a squared
minus b squared, because the

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.640
middle terms cancel out.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.730
And that's a good exercise
for you to do.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.740
So this has that
same property.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.930
This is a squared
minus b squared.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.450
This is a perfect square.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.720
So then this up here can be
factored as minus 8 times--

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.350
this is a squared
minus b squared.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:01.860
So if we could say a
is z and b is 2.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.940
Because then when we would
have z squared minus 2

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.520
squared, which is 4.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:15.180
So if a is z, so it's z plus
2 times z minus 2.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.250
This is probably the most common
thing you'll see in a

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.720
lot of factoring examples.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.620
You'll see something that has
this pattern, a squared minus

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.410
b squared, and you should
easily be able

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.120
to recognize it.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.660
You should be able to prove it
to yourself as well that this

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.850
is the same thing as a plus
b times a minus b.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.250
Or in this case, z plus
2 times z minus 2.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.630
And that is z minus 2.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.040
So this is interesting.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.900
So I don't see exactly
what we wrote.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.830
I have a minus 8, but we want
a z plus 2 and z minus 2.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.140
But they don't have that.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.400
But what they do have is this--
let me rewrite it.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.750
They don't have any of it, but
maybe they have-- they want

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.830
the minus to be multiplied by
one of these other terms. So

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.460
what we could do is we could
multiply the minus because

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.820
multiplication is associative.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.270
It doesn't matter what
order you do it in.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:08.270
So we could rewrite this as 8
times z plus 2 times minus 1

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.640
times z minus 2.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.480
And then this becomes
8 times z plus 2.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.960
This isn't minus 1, this
is times minus 1.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.840
Times what?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.820
Minus z plus 2.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.900
And now I think that
choice is there.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.350
Right.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.790
So we can rewrite this as 8
times 2 plus z-- I'm just

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.980
rearranging it-- times
2 minus z.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.410
And then that is choice B.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.980
And so really, given the choices
they gave us, it

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.820
probably would have been faster
to just factor out an 8

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.600
from the beginning and
not a positive 8.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.800
And you would have immediately
gotten to 2 plus z

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.140
times 2 minus z.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.010
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
