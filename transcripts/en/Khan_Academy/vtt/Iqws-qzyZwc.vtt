00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.430
In this video I'm going to do
a bunch of example slope

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.450
problems. Just as a bit of
review, slope is just a way of

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.920
measuring the inclination
of a line.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.870
And the definition-- we're going
to hopefully get a good

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.800
working knowledge of it in this
video-- the definition of

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
it is a change in y divided
by change in x.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.960
This may or may not make some
sense to you right now, but as

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.830
we do more and more examples,
I think it'll make a good

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.730
amount of sense.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.900
Let's do this first
line right here.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.660
Line a.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.460
Let's figure out its slope.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.490
They've actually drawn two
points here that we can use as

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.130
the reference points.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.140
So first of all, let's
look at the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.770
coordinates of those points.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.140
So you have this point
right here.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.040
What's its coordinates?

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.480
Its x-coordinate is 3.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.070
Its y-coordinate is 6.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.940
And then down here, this
point's x-coordinate is

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.780
negative 1 and its y-coordinate
is negative 6.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.920
So there's a couple of ways
we can think about slope.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.330
One is, we could look at it
straight up using the formula.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.030
We could say change in y-- so
slope is change in y over

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.370
change in x.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.850
We can figure it out
numerically.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.200
I'll in a second draw
it graphically.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.040
So what's our change in y?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.330
Our change in y is literally
how much did our y values

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.760
change going from this
point to that point?

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.400
So how much did our
y values change?

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.570
Our y went from here, y is at
negative 6 and it went all the

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.060
way up to positive 6.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.150
So what's this distance
right here?

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.930
It's going to be your
end point y value.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.040
It's going to be 6 minus your
starting point y value.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.140
Minus negative 6 or 6 plus
6, which is equal to 12.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.960
You could just count this.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.000
You say one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.840
ten, eleven, twelve.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.680
So when we changed our y value
by 12, we had to change our x

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.460
value by-- what was our
change it x over the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.800
same change in y?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.570
Well we went from x is equal
to negative 1 to

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.190
x is equal to 3.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.930
Right? x went from
negative 1 to 3.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.110
So we do the end point, which is
3 minus the starting point,

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.540
which is negative 1, which
is equal to 4.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.270
So our change in y over change
in x is equal to 12/4 or if we

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.660
want to write this in simplest
form, this is the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.030
same thing as 3.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.690
Now the interpretation of this
means that for every 1 we move

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.520
over-- we could view this,
let me write it this way.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.190
Change in y over change in x
is equal to-- we could say

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.960
it's 3 or we could
say it's 3/1.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.590
Which tells us that for every
1 we move in the positive

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.650
x-direction, we're going to move
up 3 because this is a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.540
positive 3 in the y-direction.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.480
You can see that.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.320
When we moved 1 in the x,
we moved up 3 in the y.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.880
When we moved 1 in the x,
we moved up 3 in the y.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.500
If you move 2 in the
x-direction, you're going to

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.250
move 6 in the y.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.210
6/2 is the same thing as 3.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.280
So this 3 tells us how quickly
do we go up as we increase x.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.780
Let's do the same thing for the
second line on this graph.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.470
Graph b.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.060
Same idea.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.300
I'm going to use the points
that they gave us.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.730
But really you could use any
points on that line.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.020
So let's see, we have one
point here, which is

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.550
the point 0, 1.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.540
You have 0, 1.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.780
And then the starting point-- we
could call this the finish

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.460
point-- the starting point right
here, we could view it

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.830
as x is negative 6 and
y is negative 2.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.990
So same idea.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.230
What is the change in y given
some change in x?

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.440
So let's do the change in
x first. So what is

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.060
our change in x?

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.930
So in this situation, what is
our change in x? delta x.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.850
We could even count it.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.910
It's one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.110
It's going to be 6.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.760
But if you didn't have a graph
to count from, you could

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.370
literally take your finishing
x-position, so it's 0, and

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.029
subtract from that your
starting x-position.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.390
0 minus negative 6.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.360
So when your change in x is
equal to-- so this will be 6--

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.180
what is our change in y?

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.890
Remember we're taking this as
our finishing position.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.520
This is our starting position.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.670
So we took 0 minus negative 6.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.635
So then on the y, we have to
do 1 minus negative 2.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.180
What's 1 minus negative 2?

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.260
That's the same thing
as 1 plus 2.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.410
That is equal to 3.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.450
So it is 3/6 or 1/2.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.080
So notice, when we moved in the
x-direction by 6, we moved

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.340
in the y-direction
by positive 3.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.170
So our change in y was 3 when
our change in x was 6.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.430
Now, one of the things that
confuses a lot of people is

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.110
how do I know what order to--
how did I know to do the 0

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.930
first and the negative 6 second
and then the 1 first

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:19.920
and then the negative
2 second.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.210
And the answer is you could've
done it in either order as

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.540
long as you keep
them straight.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.300
So you could have also
have done change in y

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.830
over change in x.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.280
We could have said, it's equal
to negative 2 minus 1.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.690
So we're using this coordinate
first. Negative 2 minus 1 for

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.490
the y over negative 6 minus 0.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.960
Notice this is a negative
of that.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.650
That is the negative of that.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.545
But since we have a negative
over negative, they're going

00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:50.260
to cancel out.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.810
So this is going to be equal to
negative 3 over negative 6.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.020
The negatives cancel out.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.250
This is also equal to 1/2.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:05.250
So the important thing is if
you use this y-coordinate

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.280
first, then you have
to use this

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.350
x-coordinate first as well.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.640
If you use this y-coordinate
first, as we did here, then

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.160
you have to use this
x-coordinate

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.130
first, as you did there.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.850
You just have to make sure
that your change in x and

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.750
change in y are-- you're
using the same final

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.950
and starting points.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:30.190
Just to interpret this, this is
saying that for every minus

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.820
6 we go in x.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.480
So if we go minus 6 in x, so
that's going backwards, we're

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.210
going to go minus 3 in y.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.960
But they're essentially
saying the same thing.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.170
The slope of this line is 1/2.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:50.150
Which tells us for every 2 we
travel in x, we go up 1 in y.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.990
Or if we go back 2 in x,
we go down 1 in y.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.070
That's what 1/2 slope
tells us.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.560
Notice, the line with the 1/2
slope, it is less steep than

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.840
the line with a slope of 3.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.490
Let's do a couple
more of these.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.200
Let's do line c right here.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.670
I'll do it in pink.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.250
Let's say that the starting
point-- I'm just picking this

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.120
arbitrarily.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.840
Well, I'm using these points
that they've drawn here.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.010
The starting point is at the
coordinate negative 1, 6 and

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:29.050
that my finishing point is at
the point 5, negative 6.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.980
Our slope is going to be-- let
me write this-- slope is going

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.480
to be equal to change in
x-- sorry, change in y.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.460
I'll never forget that.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.500
Change in y over change in x.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.170
Sometimes it's said
rise over run.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.610
Run is how much you're moving
in the horizontal direction.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.360
Rise is how much you're moving
in the vertical direction.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.840
Then we could say our change in
y is our finishing y-point

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.560
minus our starting y-point.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.990
This is our finishing y-point.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.990
That's our starting y-point,
over our finishing x-point

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.800
minus our starting x-point.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.440
If that confuses you, all I'm
saying is, it's going to be

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.570
equal to our finishing y-point
is negative 6 minus our

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:21.990
starting y-point, which is 6,
over our finishing x-point,

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:27.380
which is 5, minus our starting
x-point, which is negative 1.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.780
So this is equal to negative
6 minus 6 is negative 12.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.280
5 minus negative 1.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.080
That is 6.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.840
So negative 12/6.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.240
That's the same thing
as negative 2.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.230
Notice we have a negative
slope here.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.670
That's because every time we
increase x by 1, we go down in

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.740
the y-direction.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.730
So this is a downward
sloping line.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.170
It's going from the top left
to the bottom right.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.610
As x increases, the
y decreases.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.130
And that's why we got
a negative slope.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.010
This line over here should
have a positive slope.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.860
Let's verify it.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.360
So I'll use the same
points that they

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.400
use right over there.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.760
So this is line d.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.760
Slope is equal to
rise over run.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.140
How much do we rise when we go
from that point to that point?

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:21.570
Let's see.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.270
We could do it this way.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.500
We are rising-- I could
just count it out.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.110
We are rising one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.460
We are rising 6.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.780
How much are we running?

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.150
We are running-- I'll do it
in a different color.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.580
We're running one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.640
We're running 6.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.300
So our slope is 6/6,
which is 1.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.510
Which tells us that every time
we move 1 in the x-direction--

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.390
positive 1 in the x-direction--
we go positive 1

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.390
in the y-direction.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.340
For every x, if we go negative
2 in the x-direction, we're

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.340
going to go negative 2
in the y-direction.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.820
So whatever we do in x, we're
going to do the same thing in

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.710
y in this slope.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.740
Notice, that was pretty easy.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.200
If we wanted to do it
mathematically, we could

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.260
figure out this coordinate
right there.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.570
That we could view as our
starting position.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.630
Our starting position is
negative 2, negative 4.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:26.210
Our finishing position
is 4, 2.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.850
So our slope, change in
y over change in x.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:42.000
I'll take this point 2 minus
negative 4 over 4 minus

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.250
negative 2.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.970
2 minus negative 4 is 6.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.000
Remember that was just this
distance right there.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.140
Then 4 minus negative
2, that's also 6.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.300
That's that distance
right there.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.600
We get a slope of 1.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.380
Let's do another one.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.210
Let's do another couple.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.940
These are interesting.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.200
Let's do the line
e right here.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.800
Change in y over change in x.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.420
So our change in y, when we
go from this point to this

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.160
point-- I'll just
count it out.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.210
It's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.530
It's 8.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.510
Or you could even take this
y-coordinate 2 minus negative

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.460
6 will give you that
distance, 8.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.020
What's the change in y?

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.640
Well the y-value here is-- oh
sorry what's the change in x?

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.260
The x-value here is 4.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.390
The x-value there is 4.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.630
X does not change.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.280
So it's 8/0.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.660
Well, we don't know.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.320
8/0 is undefined.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.630
So in this situation the
slope is undefined.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.830
When you have a vertical
line, you say

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.235
your slope is undefined.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.190
Because you're dividing by 0.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.530
But that tells you that you're
dealing probably with a

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.320
vertical line.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.720
Now finally let's just
do this one.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.670
This seems like a pretty
straight up vanilla slope

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.320
problem right there.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.050
You have that point right
there, which is

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.090
the point 3, 1.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.090
So this is line f.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.210
You have the point 3, 1.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.750
Then over here you have the
point negative 6, negative 2.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.440
So our slope would be equal
to change in y.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.960
I'll take this as our ending
point, just so you can go in

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.130
different directions.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.770
So our change in y-- now
we're going to go

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.820
down in that direction.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.540
So it's negative 2 minus 1.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.810
That's what this distance
is right here.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.240
Negative 2 minus 1, which
is equal to negative 3.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.340
Notice we went down 3.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.340
And then what is going to
be our change in x?

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.480
Well, we're going to go
back that amount.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.880
What is that amount?

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.200
Well, that is going to be
negative 6, that's our end

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.920
point, minus 3.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.700
That gives us that distance,
which is negative 9.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.140
For every time we go back 9,
we're going to go down 3.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.065
Which is the same thing as if
we go forward 9, we're going

00:13:16.065 --> 00:13:17.370
to go up 3.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.390
All equivalent.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.830
And we see these cancel out and
you get a slope of 1/3.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:22.810
Positive 1/3.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.970
It's an upward sloping line.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:33.110
Every time we run
3, we rise 1.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.810
Anyway, hopefully that was a
good review of slope for you.
