00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.770
The distance a person can see on
a clear day is estimated by

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.930
the formula v is equal to 1,225
times the square root of

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.760
a, all of that over 1,000,
where v is visibility.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.540
So that right there is
visibility in miles, and a is

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.460
equal to altitude.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.750
Fair enough.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.770
Now, they say if Jerome can see
for 150 miles-- so that's

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.960
how far he could see; so that is
the visibility, that is v--

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.680
about how far above
the ground is he?

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.250
So they want to know what
the altitude is.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.250
About how far off the
ground is he?

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.130
This is a.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.540
And this is what
we don't know.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.040
We know that his visibility
is 150 miles.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.800
We want to know what a is.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.680
So we could look at this formula
for visibility as a

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.310
function of altitude here.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.770
We know what the
visibility is.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.580
It is 150 miles.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.830
v is 150 miles.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:08.560
So we can say that v, or 150
miles, is equal to 1,225 times

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.790
the square root of a-- a is how
far above the ground he

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:21.860
is-- times the square root of
a, all of that over 1,000.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.420
Now we can multiply both
sides of this equation.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.700
We want to isolate this radical
here, so that we can

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.680
solve for it.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.910
What we can do is we can
multiply both sides of this

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:39.140
equation times 1,000
over 1,225.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.200
Let me scroll to the
left a little bit.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.130
1,000 over 1,225.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.170
And the whole point of that is
so that we can isolate the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.120
square root of a.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.760
This 1,000 cancels
with that 1,000.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.280
That 1,225 cancels
with that 1,225.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.080
And we get-- and I always like
to have the variable I'm

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.220
solving for on the left-hand
side, so let's put it there.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.150
So let me just switch
sides as well.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.540
So we get the square root of
a is equal to all of this

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:17.270
business over here, is equal to
1,000 times this 150, all

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.050
of that over 1,225.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.400
And it looks like there's
some simplification

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.610
that we can do here.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.010
Both of these numbers seem
divisible by 25.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.850
This number up here, 150,
that's 25 times 6.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.880
So let me write this.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.280
This is 25 times 6.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.030
And this number right
here, what is this?

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:51.740
This is 25 times-- let's
see, 12 times 4 is 48.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.190
And you're going to
have one more.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.740
25 times 49, if I'm doing
my math right.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.130
Let me double check that.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.130
49 times 25.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.300
9 times 5 is 45.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.280
4 times 5 is 20, plus 4 is 24.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.340
Get rid of that, put a 0 here.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.710
2 times 9 is 18.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.805
2 times 4 is 8, plus 1 is 9.

00:03:15.805 --> 00:03:17.280
We get a 5.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.140
Get a 12.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.640
Yep, it's 1,225.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.820
So this is 25 times 49.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.450
This is 25 times 6.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.770
Let me cancel this.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.350
Cross that out.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.350
This 25 cancels with that 25.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.540
And so, does it look-- you
know, 49 is 7 times 7.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.380
So that looks about as simple
as we can get it.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.210
So this is equal to-- we could
write it as 6,000 over 49 is

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.870
equal to the square root of a.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.810
So if we want to solve for a,
we can square both sides of

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.870
this equation.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.260
So let's do that.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.090
Let me rewrite this.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.300
So you have the square root of
a is equal to 6,000 over 49.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.890
We want to square both sides
of this equation.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.770
So we square both sides of this
equation and we will get

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.960
a, the altitude, that how far
above the ground Jerome is, is

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.970
going to be equal to-- well,
6,000 squared over 49 squared.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.542
Or you could view it as 6,000
divided by 49 squared.

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:27.530
So let's figure out what
that number is just to

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.540
get a sense of things.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.862
And let me get a calculator
out for this one.

00:04:30.862 --> 00:04:34.890
I'll just get a calculator
out.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.450
Let me clear it out.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:46.570
All right, so we want to do
6,000 squared divided by 49

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:54.000
squared, which is equal to
1,400-- or, we'll round up,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.350
14,994 feet.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:07.070
This is equal to 14,993 feet.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.190
I'm assuming that this equation
is taking our feet,

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.550
our altitude in feet.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.380
They didn't mention it here, but
I'm assuming that in feet,

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.490
because that makes sense.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.510
If you can see for about 150
miles, it makes sense that

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.220
you're about 15,000
feet in the air.
