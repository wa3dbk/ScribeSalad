00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850
 

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.650
Let's say we have an ellipse
formula, x squared over a

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.950
squared plus y squared over
b squared is equal to 1.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.210
And for the sake of our
discussion, we'll assume

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.030
that a is greater than b.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.420
And all that does for us is, it
lets us so this is going to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.110
be kind of a short
and fat ellipse.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.600
Or that the semi-major axis,
or, the major axis, is going

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.730
to be along the horizontal.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.580
And the minor axis is
along the vertical.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.960
And let's draw that.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.330
Draw this ellipse.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.070
I want to draw a
thicker ellipse.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.120
Let's say, that's my ellipse,
and then let me draw my axes.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.490
OK, this is the
horizontal right there.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.120
And there we have the vertical.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.830
And we've studied an ellipse
in pretty good detail so far.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.160
We know how to figure out
semi-minor radius, which in

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.970
this case we know is b.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.320
That's the same b right there.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.510
And that's only the
semi-minor radius.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.670
Because b is smaller than a.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.480
If b was greater, it would
be the major radius.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.170
And then, of course,
the major radius is a.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.350
And that distance is
this right here.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.540
Now, another super-interesting,
and perhaps the most

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.750
interesting property of an
ellipse, is that if you take

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.730
any point on the an ellipse,
and measure the distance from

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.490
that point to two special
points which we, for the sake

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.500
of this discussion, and not
just for the sake of this

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.170
discussion, for pretty much
forever, we will call the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.120
focuses, or the foci,
of this ellipse.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.380
And these two points,
they always sit along

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.280
the major axis.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.180
So, in this case, it's
the horizontal axis.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.090
And they're symmetric around
the center of the ellipse.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.230
So let's just call
these points, let me

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.700
call this one f1.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.960
And this is f2.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.710
And it's for focus.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.920
Focuses.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.810
f2.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.220
So the super-interesting,
fascinating property

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.100
of an ellipse.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.900
And it's often used as the
definition of an ellipse is, if

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.490
you take any point on this
ellipse, and measure its

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.360
distance to each of
these two points.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.160
So, let's say that I have
this distance right here.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.980
Let's call this distance d1.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.200
And then I have this distance
over here, so I'm taking any

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.400
point on that ellipse, or this
particular point, and I'm

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.980
measuring the distance to
each of these two foci.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.060
And this is d2.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.200
We'll do it in a
different color.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.950
 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.730
So this is d2.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.030
This whole line right here.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.680
That's d2.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.180
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.100
So when you find these two
distances, you sum of them up.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.280
So this d2 plus d1, this
is going to be a constant

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.980
that it actually turns
out is equal to 2a.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.000
But it turns out that it's true
anywhere you go on the ellipse.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.600
Let me make that point clear.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.620
And I'm actually going to prove
to you that this constant

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.460
distance is actually 2a, where
this a is the same is

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.280
that a right there.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.830
So, just to make sure you
understand what I'm saying.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.530
So let me take another
arbitrary point

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.240
on this ellipse.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.690
Let's take it right there.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.570
And if I were to measure the
distance from this point to

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:27.660
this focus, let's call that
point d3, and then measure the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.760
distance from this point to
that focus -- let's

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.830
call that point d4.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.680
 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.630
d4.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.490
If I were to sum up these two
points, it's still going

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.030
to be equal to 2a.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.110
Let me write that down.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.260
d3 plus d4 is still going
to be equal to 2a.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.280
That's just neat.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.550
And, actually, this is often
used as the definition for an

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.180
ellipse, where they say that
the ellipse is the set of all

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.330
points, or sometimes they'll
use the word locus, which is

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.090
kind of the graphical
representation of the set of

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.630
all points, that where the sum
of the distances to each

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.540
of these focuses is
equal to a constant.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.900
And we'll play with that a
little bit, and we'll figure

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.930
out, how do you figure out
the focuses of an ellipse.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.110
But the first thing to do is
just to feel satisfied that the

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.900
distance, if this is true,
that it is equal to 2a.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.060
And the easiest way to figure
that out is to pick these, I

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.560
guess you could call them, the
extreme points along the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.570
x-axis here and here.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.630
We're already making the claim
that the distance from here to

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.190
here, let me draw that
in another color.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.390
That this distance plus this
distance over here, is going

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.450
to be equal to some
constant number.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.240
And using this extreme point,
I'm going to show you that that

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.110
constant number is equal to 2a,
So let's figure out

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.860
how to do that.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.150
So one thing to realize is that
these two focus points are

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.270
symmetric around the origin.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.240
So, whatever distance this is,
right here, it's going to be

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.510
the same as this distance.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.250
Right there.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.030
Because these two points are
symmetric around the origin.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.630
So this, right here, is the
same distance as that.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.920
And, of course, we have -- what
we want to do is figure out the

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.891
sum of this distance and this
longer distance right there.

00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:24.740
Well, what's the sum of this
plus this green distance?

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.190
Well, this right here
is the same as that.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.710
So this plus the green --
let me write that down.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.410
So let me write down these, let
me call this distance g, just

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.890
to say, let's call that g,
and let's call this h.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.510
Now, if this is g and this is
h, we also know that this is g

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.760
because everything's symmetric.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.010
So what's g plus h?

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.130
Well, that's the same
thing as g plus h.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.750
Which is the entire major
diameter of this ellipse.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.970
Which is what?

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.960
Well, we know the minor
radius is a, so this length

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.960
right here is also a.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.970
So the distance, or the sum of
the distance from this point on

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.630
the ellipse to this focus, plus
this point on the ellipse to

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.740
that focus, is equal to g plus
h, or this big green part,

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.320
which is the same thing as the
major diameter of this ellipse,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.430
which is the same thing as 2a.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.890
Fair enough.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.520
Hopefully that that is
good enough for you.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.090
Now, the next thing, now that
we've realized that, is how do

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.150
we figure out where
these foci stand.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.770
Or, if we have this equation,
how can we figure out what

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.410
these two points are?

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.710
Let's figure that out.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.990
So, the first thing we realize,
all of a sudden is that no

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.110
matter where we go, it was easy
to do it with these points.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.910
But even if we take this point
right here and we say, OK,

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.040
what's this distance, and then
sum it to that distance, that

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.560
should also be equal to 2a.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.290
And we could use that
information to actually figure

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.210
out where the foci lie.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.905
So, let's say I have --
let me draw another one.

00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:06.050
 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.990
So that's my ellipse.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.590
And then we want
to draw the axes.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.930
For clarity.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.480
Let me write down
the equation again.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.310
Just so we don't lose it.
x squared over a squared

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.030
plus y squared over b
squared is equal to 1.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.120
Let's take this
point right here.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.310
These extreme points are always
useful when you're trying

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.830
to prove something.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.720
Or they can be, I don't
want to say always.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.920
Now, we said that we have these
two foci that are symmetric

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.240
around the center
of the ellipse.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.740
This is f1, this is f2.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.530
And we've already said that an
ellipse is the locus of all

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.230
points, or the set of all
points, that if you take each

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.780
of these points' distance from
each of the focuses, and add

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.230
them up, you get a
constant number.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.120
And we've figured out that
that constant number is 2a.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.100
So we've figured out that if
you take this distance right

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.320
here and add it to this
distance right here,

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.240
it'll be equal to 2a.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:15.370
So we could say that if we
call this d, d1, this is d2.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:21.030
We know that d1 plus
d2 is equal to 2a.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.710
And an interesting thing
here is that this is

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.080
all symmetric, right?

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.020
This length is going to be the
same, d1 is is going to be the

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.340
same, as d2, because everything
we're doing is symmetric.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.760
These two focal lengths
are symmetric.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.160
This distance is the
same distance as this

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.710
distance right there.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.870
So, d1 and d2 have
to be the same.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.920
There's no way that you
could -- this is the exact

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.050
center point the ellipse.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.090
The ellipse is symmetric
around the y-axis.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.990
So if d1 is equal to d2, and
that equals 2a, then we know

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.240
that this has to be equal to a.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.740
And this has to be equal to a.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.690
I think we're making progress.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.760
And the other thing to think
about, and we already did that

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.740
in the previous drawing of
the ellipse is, what

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.880
is this distance?

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.880
This distance is the
semi-minor radius.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.160
Which we already learned is b.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.250
And this of course is the
focal length that we're

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.360
trying to figure out.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.530
This should already pop into
your brain as a Pythagorean

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.830
theorem problem.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.460
So we have the focal length.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.120
And we could do it on this
triangle or this triangle.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.140
I'll do it on this
right one here.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.490
This focal length is f.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.020
Let's call that f.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.450
f squared plus b squared is
going to be equal to the

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.060
hypotenuse squared, which
in this case is d2 or a.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.890
Which is equal to a squared.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.870
And now we have a nice
equation in terms of b and a.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.070
We know what b and a are,
from the equation we were

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.160
given for this ellipse.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.820
So let's solve for
the focal length.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.760
The focal length, f squared,
is equal to a squared

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.360
minus b squared.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.870
So, f, the focal length, is
going to be equal to the

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:02.020
square root of a squared
minus b squared.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.490
Pretty neat and clean, and
a pretty intuitive way to

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.250
think about something.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.520
So you just literally take
the difference of these two

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.520
numbers, whichever is larger,
or whichever is smaller you

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.340
subtract from the other one.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.140
You take the square root, and
that's the focal distance.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.840
Now, let's see if we can use
that to apply it to some some

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.290
real problems where they might
ask you, hey, find

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.930
the focal length.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.930
Or find the coordinates
of the focuses.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:34.820
So let's add the equation x
minus 1 squared over 9 plus

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:42.530
y plus 2 squared over
4 is equal to 1.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.810
So let's just graph
this first of all.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.410
This could be interesting.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.770
So I'll draw the axes.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.320
That's the x-axis.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.790
This is the y-axis.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.890
And we immediately see,
what's the center of this?

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.730
The center is going to be at
the point 1, negative 2.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.230
And if that's confusing, you
might want to review some

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.740
of the previous videos.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.440
Center's at 1, x is equal to 1.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.560
y is equal to minus 2.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.970
That's the center.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:14.330
And then, the major axis is the
x-axis, because this is larger.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.050
And so, b squared is -- or
a squared, is equal to 9.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.870
And the semi-minor radius
is going to be equal to 3.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.230
So, if you go 1, 2, 3.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.750
 

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.270
Go there.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.940
Than you have 1, 2, 3.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.510
No.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.240
1, 2, 3.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.820
1, 2, 3.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.701
I think this -- let's see.

00:11:33.701 --> 00:11:35.530
1, 2, 3.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.130
You go there, roughly.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.010
And then in the y direction,
the semi-minor radius is

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.110
going to be 2, right?

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.430
The square root of that.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.670
So b is equal to 2.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.440
So you go up 2, then
you go down 2.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.110
And this ellipse is going
to look something like

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.050
-- pick a good color.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.750
It's going to look
something like this.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.590
And what we want to do is,
we want to find out the

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.830
coordinates of the
focal points.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.220
So, the focal points
are going to sit along

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.970
the semi-major axis.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.920
And we need to figure out
these focal distances.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.690
And then we can essentially
just add and subtract

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.860
them from the center.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.430
And then we'll have
the coordinates.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.260
What we just showed you, or
hopefully I showed you, that

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.420
the the focal length or this
distance, f, the focal length

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.670
is just equal to the square
root of the difference between

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.750
these two numbers, right?

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.660
It's just the square
root of 9 minus 4.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.660
So the focal length is equal
to the square root of 5.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.540
So, if this point right here is
the point, and we already

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.920
showed that, this is the point
-- the center of the ellipse

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.930
is the point 1, minus 2.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.470
The coordinate of this focus
right there is going to be 1

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.970
plus the square root
of 5, minus 2.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.440
And the coordinate of this
focus right there is going

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.630
to be 1 minus the square
root of 5, minus 2.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.650
And all I did is, I took the
focal length and I subtracted

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.510
-- since we're along the major
axes, or the x axis, I just add

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.420
and subtract this from the x
coordinate to get these two

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.670
coordinates right there.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.840
So, anyway, this is the really
neat thing about conic

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.240
sections, is they have these
interesting properties in

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.230
relation to these foci or in
relation to these focus points.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:26.140
And in future videos I'll show
you the foci of a hyperbola or

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.820
the the foci of a -- well, it
only has one focus

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.440
of a parabola.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.340
But this is really starting
to get into what makes

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.350
conic sections neat.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.740
Everything we've done up to
this point has been much more

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.230
about the mechanics of graphing
and plotting and figuring out

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.350
the centers of conic sections.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.700
But now we're getting into
a little bit of the the

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.340
mathematical interesting
parts of conic sections.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:46.900
Anyway.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.770
See you in the next video.
