I'm here with Jesse Ro, whose a math teacher at Summit San Jose

00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:05.160
and a Khan Academy teaching fellow

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.403
and you had some interesting ideas or questions.

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:11.599
Yeah, one question that students ask a lot when they start Algebra

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.106
is why do we need letters, why can't we just use numbers for everything?

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:18.076
Why letters? So why do we have all these

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:21.811
Xs and Ys and Zs and ABCs when we start dealing with Algebra?

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:22.680
Yeah, exactly.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.286
That's interesting, well why don't we let people think about that for a second.

00:00:28.286 --> 00:00:30.232
So Sal, how would you answer this question?

00:00:30.232 --> 00:00:32.193
Why do we need letters in Algebra?

00:00:32.193 --> 00:00:35.824
So why letters. So there are a couple of ways I'd think about it.

00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:38.026
One is if you have an unknown.

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:44.239
So if I were to write X plus three is equal to ten

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.577
the reason why we're doing this is that we don't know what X is

00:00:46.577 --> 00:00:48.298
It's literally an unknown.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.197
And so we're going to solve for it in some way.

00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:51.710
But it did not have to be the letter X.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.703
We could have literally written blank plus three is equal to ten.

00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:59.725
Or we could have written Question Mark plus three is equal to ten.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.147
So it didn't have to be letters, but we needed some type of symbol.

00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:07.434
It literally could've been Smiley Face plus three is equal to ten.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:12.181
But until you know it, you need some type of a symbol to represent whatever that number is.

00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:15.700
Now we can go and solve this equation and then know what that symbol represents.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.916
But if we knew it ahead of time, it wouldn't be an unknown.

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:20.387
It wouldn't be something that we didn't know.

00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:23.576
So that's one reason why I would use letters

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:26.489
and where just numbers by itself wouldn't be helpful.

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:28.942
The other is when you're describing relationships between numbers.

00:01:28.942 --> 00:01:32.286
So I could do something like - I could say - that

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:38.021
whenever you give me a three, I'm going to give you a four.

00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:43.762
And I could say, if you give me a five, I'm going to give you a six.

00:01:43.762 --> 00:01:46.050
And i could keep going on and on forever.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.626
If you give me a 7.1, I'm going to give you an 8.1.

00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:54.431
And I could keep listing this on and on forever.

00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:57.477
Maybe you could give me any number, and I could tell you what I'm going to give you.

00:01:57.477 --> 00:02:00.879
But I would obviously run out of space and time if I were to list all of them.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:06.259
And we could do that much more elegantly if we used letters to describe the relationship.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.296
Maybe what you give me we call X, and what I give you we call Y.

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:14.678
And so I say, look, whatever you give me, I'm going to add one to it.

00:02:14.678 --> 00:02:16.867
And that's what I'm going to give back to you.

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:20.670
And so now, this very simple equation here

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.717
can describe an infinite number of relationships between X

00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:28.219
or an infinite number of corresponding Ys and Xs.

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.497
So now someone knows whatever X you give me

00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:34.612
you give me three, I add one to it, and I'm going to give you four.

00:02:34.627 --> 00:02:38.200
You give me 7.1, I'm going to add one to it and give you 8.1.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.166
So there is no more elegant way that you could've done it than by using symbols.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.959
With that said, I didn't have to use Xs and Ys.

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.648
This is just a convention that kind of comes to use from history.

00:02:46.648 --> 00:02:49.725
I could've defined what you give me as Star

00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:54.827
and what I give you as Smiley Face

00:02:54.827 --> 00:02:57.733
and this also would've been a valid way to express this.

00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:01.733
So the letters are really just symbols. Nothing more.
