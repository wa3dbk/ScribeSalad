00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.610
Welcome to the video on
completing the square.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.440
What's completing the square?

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.740
Well, it's a way to solve
a quadratic equation.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.700
And actually, let me just write
down a quadratic equation, and

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.570
then I will show you how
to complete the square.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.460
And then we'll do another
example, and then maybe talk

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.650
a little bit about why it's
called completing the square.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:27.770
So let's say I have this
equation: x squared plus 16x

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.600
minus 57 is equal to 0.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.130
So what are the tools in our
toolkit right now that we

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.970
could use to solve this?

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.570
Well, we could try
to factor it out.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.770
We could say, what two numbers
add up to 16, and then when you

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.060
multiply them they're minus 57?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.450
And you'd have to think
about it a little bit.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.360
And you might get whole
numbers, but you're not even

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.050
sure if there are two whole
numbers that work

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.540
out like that.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.630
This problem there are.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.510
But, you know, sometimes the
solution is a decimal number

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.190
and you don't know it.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.150
So the only time you can really
factor is if you're sure that

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.000
you could factor this into
kind of integer expressions.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.620
You know, x plus some integer
or x minus some integer

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.920
times, you know, x plus
some other integer.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.990
Or likewise.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.240
The other option is to do
the quadratic equation.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420
And what we're going to see is
actually the quadratic equation

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.510
is just essentially a shortcut
to completing the square.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.410
The quadratic equation is
actually proven using

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.420
completing the square.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.420
So what is completing
the square?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.340
So what do we do?

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.080
Well, before we move into this
video let's see what happens

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.930
if I square an expression.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.220
Let me do it in this down here.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.250
What is x plus a, squared?

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:50.940
Well that equals x squared
plus 2ax plus a squared.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.680
Right?

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.420
So if you ever see something in
this form, you know that it's

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.740
x plus something squared.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.040
So wouldn't it be neat if we
could manipulate this equation

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.900
so we can write it as x plus a
squared equals something,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.140
and then we could just
take the square root?

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.580
And what we're going to do
is, actually, do just that.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.090
And that is completing
the square.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.010
So let me show you an example.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.515
I think an example will
make it a little clearer.

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:17.620
Let me box this away.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.310
This is what you
need to remember.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.130
This is the whole rationale
behind competing the squares--

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.650
to get an equation into this
form, onto one side of the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.940
equation, and just have a
number on the other side, so

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.210
you could take the square
root of both sides.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.000
So let's see.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.970
First of all, let's just check
to make sure this isn't

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.020
a perfect square.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.700
If this were, this coefficient
would be equivalent to the 2a.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.470
Right?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.440
So a would be 8, and
then this would be 64.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.270
This is clearly not 64, so
this right here is not

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.840
a squared expression.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.680
So what can we do?

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.990
Well let me get rid of the
57 by adding 57 to both

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.200
sides of this equation.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:07.550
So I would get x squared
plus 16x is equal to 57.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.470
All I did is I added 57 to
both sides of this equation.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.300
Now, what could I add here so
that this, the left-hand side

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.480
of this equation, becomes a
square of some expression

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.820
like x plus a?

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.790
If you just follow this pattern
down here, we have x squared

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:37.880
plus 2ax-- so you could view
this right here as 2ax.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.090
Right?

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.900
That's 2ax.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.520
And then we need to add
an a squared to it.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.040
Right?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.300
Plus a squared.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.010
And then we would
have the form here.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.510
But we know from basic algebra
that anything you do to one

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.080
side of an equation you
have to do to another.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.230
So we added an a squared
here, so let's add an a

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.840
squared here as well.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.350
And now you could essentially
rewrite this as a square

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.260
of some expression.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.210
But before that we have to
figure out what a was?

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.520
Well how do we do that?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.740
Well, what is a?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.720
If this expression right
here is 2ax, what is a?

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.380
Well 2a is going to equal
16, so a is equal to 8.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.020
And you could usually do
that just by inspection;

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.630
do it in your head.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.930
But if you wanted to see it
done algebraically you could

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.690
actually write 2ax
is equal to 16x.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.090
And then divide both sides
by 2x, and you get a is

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.430
equal to 16x over 2x.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.950
And assuming that x doesn't
equal 0 this evaluates to 8.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.130
So a is 8.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.430
So if a is 8 we could rewrite
that expression-- I'll switch

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:49.030
colors arbitrarily-- as x
squared plus 16x

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.470
plus a squared.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.180
Well, it's 64, because a is 8.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.170
Is equal to 57 plus 64.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.720
Right?

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.600
I went through a fairly tedious
explanation here, but all we've

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.890
really done to get from there
to there is we added 57 to both

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.870
sides of this equation to kind
of get it on the right-hand

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.320
side, and then we added 64 to
both sides of this equation.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.830
And why did I add 64 to both
sides of this equation?

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.070
So that the left-hand side
expression takes this form.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.200
Now that the left-hand side
expression takes this form

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.030
I can rewrite it as what?

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.170
x plus a, squared.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.620
I can rewrite it in this form.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.550
And we know that a is 8, so it
becomes x plus 8, squared,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.730
is equal to-- and
what's 57 plus 64?

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.090
It's 121.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.270
Now we have what looks like a
fairly straightforward-- it's

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.960
still a quadratic equation,
actually, because if you

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.350
were to expand this side
you'd get a quadratic.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.065
But we can solve this without
using the quadratic equation

00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:54.610
or without having to factor.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.390
We can just take the square
root of both sides of this.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.550
And if we take the square root
of both sides what do we get?

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.610
We get-- once again,
arbitrarily switching colors--

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.230
that x plus 8 is equal to, and
remember this, the plus or

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.880
minus square root of 121.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.590
And what's the
square root of 121?

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.960
Well it's 11, right?

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.630
So then we come here.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.800
Let me box this away.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.620
This was just an aside.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.830
So we get x plus 8 is equal
to plus or minus 11.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.420
And so x is equal to-- subtract
8 from both sides-- minus

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.860
8 plus or minus 11.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:41.590
And so x could equal-- so
minus 8 plus 11 is 3.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.970
Right?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.160
Let me make sure I
did that right.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.310
x is equal to minus
8 plus or minus 11.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.140
Yes.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.350
That's right.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.270
So x could be equal to 3.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.960
And then if I took minus
8 minus 11, x could

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:10.416
also equal minus 19.

00:07:10.416 --> 00:07:11.350
All right.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.200
And let's see if
that makes sense.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.680
So in theory this should be
able to be factored as x

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.770
minus 3 times x plus
19 is equal to 0.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.030
Right?

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.160
Because these are the two
solutions of this equation.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.190
And that works out, right?

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.340
Minus 3 times 19 is minus 57.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.920
And minus 3 plus
19 is plus 16x.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.120
We could have just immediately
factored it this way, but if

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.030
that wasn't obvious to us--
because, you know, at least

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.600
19 is kind of a strange
number-- we could do it

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.800
completing the square.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.690
And so why is it called
completing the square?

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.920
Because you get it in this form
and then you have to add this

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.950
64 here to kind of complete the
square-- to turn this

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.020
left-hand expression into
a squared expression.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.770
Let's do one more.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.920
And I'll do less explanation
and more just chugging through

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.105
the problem, and that actually
might make it seem simpler.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.080
But this is going to
be a hairier problem.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:19.930
So let's say I have 6x squared
minus 7x minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.980
You could try to factor it,
but personally I don't

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.260
enjoy factoring things
when I have a coefficient.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.590
And you can say, oh well why
don't we divide both sides

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.970
of this equation by 6?

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.960
But then you'd get a fraction
here and a fraction here.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.580
And that's even worse to
factor just by inspection.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.190
You could do the
quadratic equation.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.310
And maybe I'll show you in a
future video, the quadratic

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.500
equation-- and I think I've
already done one where I proved

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.630
the quadratic equation.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.380
But the quadratic
equation is essentially

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.170
completing the square.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.090
It's kind of a shortcut.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.280
It's just kind of
remembering the formula.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.320
But let's complete the square
here, because that's what the

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.640
point of this video was.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.650
So let's add the 3 to both
sides of that equation.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.300
We could do-- well,
let's add the 3 first.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:04.820
So you get 6 x squared
minus 7x is equal to 3.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.770
I added 3 to both sides.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.470
And some teachers will leave
the minus 3 here, and then try

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.050
to figure out what to add
to it and all of that.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.170
But I like to get it out of the
way so that I can figure out

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.080
very clearly what number
I should put here.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.230
But I also don't
like the 6 here.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.550
It just complicates things.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:25.990
I like to have it x plus a
squared, not some square root

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.450
coefficient on the x term.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.530
So let's divide both sides of
this equation by 6, and you get

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:39.730
x squared minus 7/6 x is equal
to-- 3 divided by 6

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.566
is equal to 1/2.

00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:43.190
And we could have made
that our first step.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.450
We could have divided by 6
right at that first step.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.250
Anyway, now let's try to
complete the square.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.800
So we have x squared-- I'm just
going to open up some space--

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:59.530
minus 7/6 x plus something is
going to be equal to 1/2.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.400
And so we have to add something
here so that this left-hand

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.290
expression becomes a
squared expression.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.620
So how do we do that?

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.770
Well essentially we look at
this coefficient, and keep

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.610
in mind this is not just
7/6 it's minus 7/6.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.460
You take 1/2 of it, and
then you square it.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.610
Right?

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.690
Let me do it.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:25.290
x plus a, squared, is
equal to x squared plus

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.820
2ax plus a squared.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.070
Right?

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.750
This is what you have to
remember all the time.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.560
That's all completing the
square is based off of.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.980
So what did I say just now?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.260
Well, this term is going
to be 1/2 of this

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.190
coefficient squared.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.190
And how do we know that?

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.880
Because a is going to be 1/2 of
this coefficient if you just

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.850
do a little bit of
pattern matching.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.760
So what's 1/2 of
this coefficient?

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.050
1/2 of minus 7/6 is minus 7/12.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.640
So if you want you could
write a equals minus

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.770
7/12 for our example.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.770
And I just multiplied
this by 1/2.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:01.980
Right?

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.660
So what do I add to both sides?

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.030
I add a squared.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.930
So what's 7/12 squared?

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:13.220
Well that's going to be 49/144.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.000
If I did it to the left-hand
side I have to do it to

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.630
the right-hand side.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:22.240
Plus 49/144.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.120
And now how can I simplify
this left-hand side?

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.880
What's our next step?

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.470
Well we now know it
is a perfect square.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.550
In fact, we know what a
is. a is minus 7/12.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.200
And so we know that this
left-hand side of this equation

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:43.390
is x minus a-- or x plus a,
but a is a negative number.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.980
So x plus a, and a is
negative, squared.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.350
And if you want you can
multiply this out and confirm

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.130
that it truly equals this.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.920
And that is going to be equal
to-- let's get a common

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.360
denominator, 144.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:04.070
So 72 plus 49 equals 121.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.300
121/144.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.210
So we have x minus 7/12,
all of that squared

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.180
is equal to 121/144.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.300
So what do we do now?

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.570
Well now we just take
the square root of both

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.700
sides of this equation.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.140
And I'm trying to
free up some space.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.215
Switch to green.

00:12:22.215 --> 00:12:25.320
Let me partition this off.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:33.310
And we get x minus 7/12 is
equal to the plus or minus

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.940
square root of that.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.120
So plus or minus 11/12.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.390
Right?

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.660
Square root of 121 is 11.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.420
Square root of 144 is 12.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.480
So then we could add 7/12 to
both sides of this equation,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:53.100
and we get x is equal to
7/12 plus or minus 11/12.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.660
Well that equals 7
plus or minus 11/12.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.050
So what are the two options?

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.930
7 plus 11 is 18, over 12.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.210
So x could equal 18/12, is 3/2.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.010
Or, what's 7 minus 11?

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.760
That's minus 4/12.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.370
So it's minus 1/3.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.630
There you have it.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.940
That is completing the square.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.220
Hopefully you found that
reasonably insightful.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.340
And if you want to prove the
quadratic equation, all you

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.320
have to do is instead of having
numbers here, write a x squared

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.820
plus bx plus c equals 0.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.130
And then complete the square
using the a, b, and c's

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.060
instead of numbers.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.180
And you will end up with
the quadratic equation

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.110
by this point.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.510
And I think I did
that in a video.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.600
Let me know if I didn't
and I'll do it for you.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.540
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
