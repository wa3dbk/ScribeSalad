00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.690
We will now embark on what is
probably my least favorite

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.300
exercise or computation in
mathematics-- and I think

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.750
you'll see why-- where we will
invert a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.200
And in my mind, the only thing
less pleasant than inverting a

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.990
3 by 3 matrix is inverting
a 4 by 4 matrix.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.260
It very quickly becomes obvious
to you that it's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.240
probably better for a
computer to do this.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.020
But you need to learn
how to do it.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.020
And it's a good exercise
for me to do.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.040
And if I keep doing it my whole
life, it'll prevent my

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.439
brain from degrading.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.310
But as you'll see, this is
almost an exercise in not

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.870
making careless mistakes.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.160
So let's start with a
3 by 3 matrix and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.630
try to take the inverse.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.770
So let's say I have matrix a.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.570
I think I'm going to need a lot
of space here, so I'll try

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.930
to do this small, without
being confusing.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.640
Matrix a.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.510
Let's say it's 1, 0-- and I'm
specifically choosing this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.640
matrix because the numbers are
reasonably non-hairy-- 0, 2,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.470
1, 1, 1, 1.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.443
So the first thing that I do
when I take an inverse of a 3

00:01:13.443 --> 00:01:16.780
by 3 matrix, I create what I
call-- or not what I call,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.270
what everyone calls--
a matrix of minors.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.450
So let me write that down.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.700
Matrix of minors.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.430
So what's a minor?

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.750
Let me draw that out.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.310
So it's going to be another
3 by 3 matrix.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.570
And what it is, so this
element, this top left

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.050
element, is essentially going
to be the determinant.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.180
If I were to take my original
matrix, and I were to cross

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.240
out this position's
row and column.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.710
So for example, this 1, 1
position, row 1, column 1.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.500
I cross out row 1
and column 1.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.730
What numbers do I have left?

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.190
I have this 2, 1, 1, 1.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.590
I have this right here.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.090
So it's the determinant
of 2, 1, 1, 1.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.320
And actually maybe I'll
write that down.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.210
So it's the determinant
of 2, 1, 1, 1.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.870
So I'm gonna run out
of space I'm sure.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.110
It's going to be 2, 1, 1, 1.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.120
The determinant.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.530
The absolute value sign says
it's the determinant.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.100
Remember, all I did is, I said,
OK, in position 1,1, let

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.550
me cross out the column and
the row 1,1, and take the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.950
determinant of what's left.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.320
Or the minor of this matrix.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.650
And then I will take the
determinant-- so when I go to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.150
this position, I'm in
row 1, column 2.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.810
I'm essentially going to
take the determinant.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.615
If I were to cross out row
1 and column 2, what

00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:55.440
do I have left over?

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.750
I have 0, 1, 1, 1.

00:03:02.402 --> 00:03:04.777
It might be confusing, but just
remember-- I wish I had

00:03:04.777 --> 00:03:06.070
something I could
cover this with.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.500
Unfortunately my fingers can't
show up on this video.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.015
But if you cross this row and
this column out, you're just

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:15.170
left with this 0, this 1,
this 1, and this 1.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.670
And you take the determinant
of that minor.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.690
And we'll keep going.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.650
I'm probably going to run out of
space here, but I will try

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.790
my best. And so when you go to
this position-- row 1, column

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.950
3-- what do you do?

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.610
Well you cross out
row 1, column 3.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.090
And then the determinant, or the
minor that you have to do,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.760
is 0, 2, 1, 1.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.070
So the determinant of that
two by two matrix.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.010
And then you keep doing that,
so forth and so on.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.200
And I'm going to run
out of space.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.250
But what I'm going to
do is I'm just going

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.080
to calculate it.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.940
I think you understand
how to do it.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.400
Well you don't understand how to
do it, but I think when we

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.940
calculate it it'll make
a little more sense.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.580
Let me actually just
calculate it out.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.920
Because if I were to write these
2 by 2 matrices, I would

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.110
run out of space.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.260
But anyway, let's go back
to this position 1, 1.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.390
Cross out the first row, first
column, I want the determinant

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.330
of this thing right here.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.810
So what's the determinant
of this 2 by 2?

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.080
That's not too hard.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.510
It's 2 times 1, minus
1 times 1.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.890
So what's 2 times 1,
minus 1 times 1?

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.740
Well it's just 1.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.230
Then when we go to row 1,
column 2, I want the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.610
determinant of 0, 1, 1, 1.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.770
So it's 0 times 1,
minus 1 times 1.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.290
So 0 times 1 is 0, minus
1 times 1 is minus 1.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.290
And that's just this determinant
right here.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.710
I'm just kind of reshowing you
how I visualize when I cross

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.000
out the rows and columns.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.410
So it's 0 times 1,
minus 1 times 1.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.610
And in this position of course,
you cross out this

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.690
row, this column, and 0 times
1 minus 1 times 2.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.170
So that's minus 2.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.890
Let's keep going.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.790
All right.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.740
So now, when we're in row 2,
column 1, we cross out row 2,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.820
cross out column 1.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.490
And we're left with this 0,
this 1, this 1 and this 1.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.170
So it's 0 times 1, which is 0.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.000
Minus 1 times 1.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.510
So we're at minus 1.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.030
Then when we get row 2, column
2, we cross those two out, and

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.480
we take the matrix of the
minor that's left.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.600
So that's 1 times 1,
minus 1 times 1.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.850
So that's 0.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.620
Almost. We're halfway done.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.070
OK, so then we're in
row 2, column 3.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.680
So we cross out row
2, column 3.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.660
And what we have left is 1
times 1, minus 1 time 0.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.000
So that is just 1.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.120
Last row.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.290
OK, so we're in row
3, column 1.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.660
So we cross out row
3, column 1.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.980
You're left with
0 times 1 is 0.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.260
Minus 2 times 1.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.510
So that's minus 2.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.760
Then we're in row 3, column 2.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.110
So we cross out row
3, column 2.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.390
And you have 1 times
1, minus 0 times 1.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.110
So that's just 1.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.730
Last one.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.900
Row 3, column 3.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.440
So we cross out row 3, we
cross out column 3.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.680
And you're just left with 1
times 2, minus 0 times 0.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.080
So that is 2.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.450
And if I haven't made any
careless mistakes, that is our

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.700
matrix of minors.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.270
Now we now have to convert
this to what we call the

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.930
matrix of cofactors.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.480
And actually this step is
fairly straightforward.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.820
So to convert from a matrix
of minors to a matrix of

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.170
cofactors, you just have to
remember this pattern.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.690
This pattern applies to
any 3 by 3 matrix.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.630
Plus, minus, plus, minus,
plus, minus,

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.270
plus, minus, plus.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.050
And so you can kind of just
imagine this as kind of a

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.960
checkerboard of pluses
and minuses.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.470
And you apply that to this.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.670
So what do I mean by that?

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.530
Well that means, when you start,
it's a checkerboard,

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.300
and you start with a plus
at the top left.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.800
And then you just keep
alternating plus, minus.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.470
So if you applied this
to this, you get

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.020
the matrix of cofactors.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.270
Let me write that down.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.800
You can imagine this is a bit of
a marathon of computation.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.840
OK, so the matrix of cofactors
is essentially applying this

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.880
pattern to the matrix
of minors.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.430
So what do you do?

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.860
You say this plus
1 times 1 is 1.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.680
But now we have a minus.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.240
So that's minus times minus
1 is positive 1.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.812
Then you have plus times
minus 2 is minus 2.

00:08:09.812 --> 00:08:11.500
Then you have a minus here.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.990
Minus times minus
1 is positive 1.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.790
Plus times 0 is still 0.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.820
Minus times 1 is minus 1.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.200
Plus times minus 2 is minus 2.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.690
Minus applied to 1 is minus 1.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.460
And then plus applied
to 2 is just 2.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.510
And we have our matrix
of cofactors.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.299
And we are more than
halfway done with

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.000
inverting this matrix.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.720
And I just want to
take a note here.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.200
What we're doing is kind of
just a magic formula.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.600
It might seem a little bit
like voodoo for you.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.740
But I just want you to keep in
mind that in future videos, I

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.090
will show you where
this comes from.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.630
Although it will be quite
hairy to prove

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.500
it for a 3 by 3.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.750
But I'll definitely show
it to you for a 2 by 2.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.030
And actually, I'll show you
other algorithms that might

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.890
make a little bit more intuitive
sense for doing it

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.040
for a 3 by 3.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.680
But I just wanted to show you
how to do it this way, so that

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.530
at least when you see it on your
Algebra 2 exam-- because

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.430
I think they actually teach this
in Algebra 2-- you could

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.470
at least, if the teacher asks
you, solve for the matrix of

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.730
minors or the cofactors or solve
for the determinant of

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.740
the inverse, you can do it.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.430
And then we'll worry about
getting the intuition, which

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.010
is not how I normally like
to teach things.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.630
But this is an exception.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.910
But anyway, back
to the problem.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.100
This is the matrix
of cofactors.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:34.410
Now from this, we take the
adjoint of matrix a-- or I

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.570
learned from Wikipedia, the
correct term is the adjugate

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.630
of matrix a.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:46.660
But this is determined the
notation is the adjugate of a.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.030
And all this is is
the transpose of

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.510
the matrix of cofactors.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.970
And I know I'm throwing out a
lot of weird terminology here.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.300
But the transpose, all that
means is that you switch the

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.550
rows and the columns.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:08.010
So this one right here is
in row 1, column 1.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.100
But you know, so the rows and
columns are the same, so that

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:10.950
just stays the same.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.170
So actually anything on the
diagonal stays the same.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.260
Because this is row
2, column 2.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.910
This is row 3, column 3.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.480
So the diagonals
stay the same.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.880
And then you switch places.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.130
You kind of flip across
the diagonal.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.470
And what do I mean by that?

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:29.880
Well this 1 was in
row 1, column 2.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.350
So it'll then be moved
to row 2, column 1.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.680
So this 1 right here
will go here.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.400
So you can kind of say that it
flipped over the diagonal.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.910
And similarly, this right here
is in row 1, column 3.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.840
It's going to be switched
to row 3, column 1.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.090
So it's going to go here.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.450
And you can kind of see that it
just flipped over that end.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.890
So this minus 2 isn't
this one.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.040
It's this one over here.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.400
And actually, we see that this
matrix is symmetric.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.330
When you flip it, you actually
get the same thing.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.490
So maybe it was a bad example.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.230
But I want you to understand
that the transpose is where--

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:19.830
if something like this number,
if it's in a row 1, column 2,

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.180
then it moves to row
2, column 1.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.080
So you're switching the
rows and columns.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.480
But anyway, we could
keep doing that.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.080
But essentially you're just
flipping over the diagonal.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.710
So let's see.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.040
So then this number will be
flipped to this position, so

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.970
it goes there.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.340
This is in row 2, column 1.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.820
So it will go to column 2,
row 1, which is that.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.610
And then if we go here, that's
going to be flipped down here,

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:44.870
flipped across the diagonal.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.060
So that's minus 1.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.870
This is going to be flipped
all the way up there.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.680
So that's minus 2.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.245
And then this will
be flipped there.

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:54.730
This is minus 1.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.780
We are almost done.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.530
So this is the adjoint
of matrix a.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.630
So to get the inverse of a-- and
let me actually erase some

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.880
of this, because we're going to
run out of space otherwise.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.520
And as you can see, I'll be very
impressed if I have not

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.060
introduced a careless
mistake yet.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:26.111
So let me erase all of this.

00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:28.370
I'm building an appetite just
doing this problem.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.360
It's so taxing on me.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:39.020
So the inverse of matrix a
is equal to 1 over the

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:44.320
determinant of a times
the adjugate, or

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.590
adjoint, of matrix a.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.680
So we solved for this part.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.760
So now let's solve for
the determinant.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.640
So the determinant of a-- and I
kept the matrix of cofactors

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:04.350
here for a reason-- the
determinant of a is-- if you

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.740
go across-- you can actually go
across any row-- but just

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.820
for simplicity, just remember
it this way.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.380
You go across the top row, and
you multiply each term times

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.000
its corresponding cofactor,
and you add them.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.780
So in this case, it'll be 1
times its corresponding

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.710
cofactor, which is 1.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:29.160
Plus 0 times its corresponding
cofactor, which is 1.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.030
Plus 1 times its corresponding
cofactor plus minus 2.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:40.070
So this is 1 plus 0 minus 2.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.550
It equals minus 1.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.740
And thank God it was a
relatively straightforward

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.510
determinant.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.560
And if you didn't have this
matrix of cofactors, the other

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.040
way you could think about it--
and this is good because it

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.040
gives you an intuition of how
we even got to the matrix of

00:13:51.040 --> 00:14:00.150
cofactors-- you could view this
as the same thing as 1

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.570
times the determinant
of its minor.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.060
So if you cross out the row
and the column, it's this

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.640
determinant.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.640
So it's 2, 1, 1, 1.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.850
And remember there
was that pattern.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.700
You have plus, and then
you go minus.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.770
So minus 0 times the determinant
of its minor.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.280
So you cross out that
row, that column.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.890
So 0, 1, 1, 1.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.280
And then we switch again.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.570
We go back to plus.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.540
Plus 1 times the determinant
of its minor.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.310
So you cross out that
row, that column.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.560
You get 0, 2, 1, 1.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.160
And you could compute
this out.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:47.110
And this is this cofactor.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:51.080
This, with a minor sign,
this is just a minor.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.360
And then when you apply
the minus sign, it

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.850
becomes this cofactor.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.380
And then this is that minor.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.980
And since it's a plus sign
there, that's that cofactor.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.875
But anyway, I just wanted to
explain that, and hopefully it

00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:00.450
hasn't confused you.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.720
But we're ready now to solve
the inverse of a.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.310
We know that the determinant
of a is equal to minus 1.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:11.260
We know that the adjugate of
a is this number here.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.810
So we now can solve
for the inverse.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.630
And let's do that.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.110
Let me erase all
of this stuff.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.300
Cause actually, after I solve
for the inverse, I want to

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.670
prove to you that it is
the inverse-- maybe.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.760
If I have enough time.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.900
Because I just realized I'm
running pretty long.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.410
That might be a good
exercise for you.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.340
OK.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:39.900
So the inverse of a is equal
to 1 over the determinant.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.850
We figured out the determinant
is negative 1 times the

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.640
adjugate of a.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.780
1, 1, minus 2.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.840
1, 0, minus 1.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.650
Minus 2, minus 1, 2.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.350
So this is just minus
1, right?

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.250
So we just apply minus
1 times everything.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.270
So we get-- if I haven't made
any careless mistakes-- minus

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:18.290
1, minus 1, plus 2, minus
1, 0, 1, 2, 1, minus 2.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:23.860
I think that I have-- let's see,
I just did a minus times

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.610
everything.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.730
That looks right.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.140
And so that is a inverse.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.160
And it only took
us 17 minutes.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.050
And I will leave you there,
because it will probably take

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.540
me another 5 or 10 minutes
to [? seed ?]

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.460
and prove.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.800
But that might be a good
exercise for you.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.750
To multiply this matrix times
this matrix, and make sure

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.840
that you get the identity
matrix.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.250
I will see you in
the next video.
