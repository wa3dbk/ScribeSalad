00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.430
Find the sum.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.710
Express the answer as a
simplified rational

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.250
expression, and state
the domains.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.865
We have these two rational
expressions, or two fractions,

00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:08.370
if you will.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.790
And whenever we add fractions,
we need to find a common

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.040
denominator, and the common
denominator has to be

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.740
something that's divisible by
both of these denominators.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.360
In general, we want to find
the least common, or the

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.360
smallest, multiple of these
numbers, or the smallest

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.180
number that's divisible
by both.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.160
When you look at it immediately,
it might pop out

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.930
at you that 6 is divisible by
3, and x to the fourth is

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.110
definitely divisible by x
squared, so 6x to the fourth

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.260
is definitely divisible
by 3x squared.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.190
Of course, it's divisible by
itself, so this actually is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.630
the least common multiple-- this
is the smallest number,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.410
or the smallest expression, I
guess, that is divisible by

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.180
both 6x to the fourth and 3x
squared, so let's make that

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.530
the common denominator.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.080
So this sum is going to be
equal to 5 over 6x fourth

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.320
plus-- and now, what we want
to do is write this with 6x

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.500
fourth as the denominator, so
let me just write it again.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.010
So plus 7 over 3x squared.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.975
So how do we make a 3x squared
into a 6x to the fourth?

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:13.880
Well we're going to have to
multiply it times 2 to make

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.270
the 3 into a 6, and then we're
going to have to multiply it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.350
times another x squared, so
we're going to have to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.720
multiply it by 2x squared.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.070
Now we can't just multiply only
the denominator by 2x

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.210
squared-- that'll fundamentally
change the value

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.220
of this expression.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.220
We can only multiply it by 1,
so let's multiply it by 2x

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.020
squared over 2x squared-- and
we're assuming here that is x

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.335
is not equal to 0.

00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:36.860
x does not equal to 0.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.690
And that was actually a safe
assumption to make, that 0 is

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.530
not a member of our domain right
from the get go, because

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.230
that would've made either of
these expressions undefined.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.180
If we assume x is not equal to
0, we can multiply by 2x

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.230
squared over 2x squared, and
then that will give us the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.410
expression 5 over 6x to the
fourth, plus-- this become 7

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.470
times 2 is 14.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.920
Fourteen x squared over 3 times
2 is 6, x to the squared

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.690
times x squared is x to the
fourth, so now we have a

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.640
common denominator.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.890
The common denominator is 6x to
the fourth, and we can just

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.490
add the numerators, so it's 5
plus 14x squared-- or, I like

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.260
to write the higher degree
term first-- or 14x

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.580
squared plus 5.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.670
And we are assuming that x does
not equal 0, because this

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.840
would make the expression
undefined.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.880
That's about as simple as we can
make it-- we can't divide.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.450
14 is divisible by 2, and so
6, but 5 isn't, so we can't

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.440
divide everything by 2, and
then, there's x squared x to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.110
the fourth, but 5 has no x term
on it, so we can't divide

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.290
everything by x or
a power of x.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.540
We're done: it's 14x squared
plus 5 over 6x to the fourth,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.640
and x cannot be equal to zero.
