00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:01.770
- [Voiceover] Hello and welcome

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.034
to multivariable calculus.

00:00:04.034 --> 00:00:05.439
So I think I should probably start off

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.339
by addressing the elephant
in the living room here.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:09.816
I am, sadly, not Sal,

00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:11.139
but I'm still gonna teach you some math.

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.618
My name is Grant.

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:14.912
I'm pretty much a math enthusiast.

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:17.710
I enjoy making animations
of things when applicable,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.929
and boy, is that applicable

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.193
when it comes to multivariable calculus.

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:22.935
So, the first thing we gotta get straight

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:25.640
is what is this word multivariable

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.172
that separates calculus, as we know it,

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:30.830
from the new topic that
you're about to study?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.616
Well, I could say it's all
about multivariable functions,

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.253
that doesn't really answer anything

00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:36.774
because what's a multivariable function?

00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:39.340
And basically, the kinds of functions

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.953
that we're used to dealing with,

00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:44.680
in the old world, in the
ordinary calculus world,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.373
will have a single input,
some kind of number

00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:48.477
as their input,

00:00:48.477 --> 00:00:50.392
and then the output is
just a single number.

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:52.575
And you would call this a
single variable function.

00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:56.209
Basically because that guy
there is the single variable.

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:58.161
So then a multivariable function

00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:01.250
is something that handles
multiple variables.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.697
So, you know, it's common
to write it as x, y,

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.439
it doesn't really matter
what letters to use,

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.749
and it could be, you know, x, y, z,

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:09.874
x one, x two, x three,
a whole bunch of things,

00:01:09.874 --> 00:01:11.360
but just to get started,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.310
we often think just two variables

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.133
and this will output
something that depends on

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.889
both of those.

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:18.639
Commonly it will output just a number,

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:20.218
so you might imagine a
number that depends on

00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:23.992
x and y in some way,
like, x squared plus y,

00:01:23.992 --> 00:01:26.151
but it could also output a vector, right?

00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:29.160
So you could also imagine something that's

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.500
got multivariable input, f of x, y,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.578
and it outputs something that also has

00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:37.552
multiple variables, like,

00:01:37.552 --> 00:01:39.270
I mean I'm just making stuff up here,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.080
three x and, you know, two y.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.332
And, this isn't set in stone,

00:01:44.332 --> 00:01:46.039
but the convention is to usually think

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.315
if there's multiple numbers
that go into the output,

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:49.452
think of it as a vector,

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:51.438
if there's multiple numbers
that go into the input,

00:01:51.438 --> 00:01:52.621
just kind of write them,

00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:53.951
write them more sideways like this,

00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:56.380
and think of them as a point in space.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.311
Because, I mean when you
look at something like this,

00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:00.435
and you've got an x and you've got a y,

00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:02.653
you could think about those
as two separate numbers.

00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:03.837
You know, here's your number line

00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:05.730
with the point x on it somewhere,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.168
maybe that's five, maybe that's three,

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:08.411
it doesn't really matter.

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:10.637
And then you've got another number line

00:02:10.637 --> 00:02:12.150
and it's y, and you could think of them

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520
as separate entities.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.900
But, it would probably be more accurate

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.396
to call it multidimensional calculus,

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:20.977
because, really, instead
of thinking of, you know,

00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:22.877
x and y as separate entities,

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:24.538
whenever you see two things like that

00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:26.569
you're gonna be thinking
about the x y plane.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.090
And thinking about just a single point.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.081
And you'd think of this as a
function that takes a point

00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:31.022
to a number,

00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:32.589
or a point to a vector.

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:33.866
And a lot of people, when they start

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:35.201
teaching multivariable calculus,

00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:36.606
they just jump into the calculus,

00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:37.546
and there's lots of fun things,

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:39.268
partial derivatives, gradients,

00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:40.569
good stuff that you'll learn.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.865
But I think first of all,

00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:43.470
I want to spend a couple videos

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.965
just talking about the different ways

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.065
we visualize the different types

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:49.215
of multivariable functions.

00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:50.608
So, as a sneak peak,

00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:52.105
I'm just gonna go through a couple of them

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.359
really quickly right now,

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.159
just so you kind of whet your appetite

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.447
and see what I'm getting at,

00:02:56.447 --> 00:02:58.038
but the next few videos are
going to go through them

00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:00.128
in much, much more detail.

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:03.356
So, first of all, graphs.

00:03:03.356 --> 00:03:04.981
When you have multivariable functions,

00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:07.024
graphs become three dimensional.

00:03:07.024 --> 00:03:08.522
But these only really apply
to functions that have

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.228
some kind of two-dimensional input,

00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:11.436
which you might think about as living

00:03:11.436 --> 00:03:12.667
on this x y plane,

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.180
and a single number as their output

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.697
and the height of the graph

00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:17.589
is gonna correspond with that output.

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.586
Like I said, you'll be
able to learn much more

00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:21.636
about that in the dedicated video on it,

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:23.986
but these functions also can be visualized

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:26.599
just in two dimensions,
flattening things out.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.978
Where we visualize the entire input space

00:03:28.978 --> 00:03:31.079
in associated color, with each point.

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.079
So this is the kind of
thing where you, you know,

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.076
you have some function

00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:36.166
that's got a two-dimensional input,

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:37.987
that would be f of x, y,

00:03:37.987 --> 00:03:39.764
and what we're looking
at is the x y plane,

00:03:39.764 --> 00:03:41.169
all of the input space,

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.783
and this output's just some number,

00:03:42.783 --> 00:03:44.002
you know, maybe it's like x squared,

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:45.406
this particular one is an x squared,

00:03:45.406 --> 00:03:46.406
but, you know that,

00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:48.633
and maybe some complicated thing,

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:50.759
and the color tells you roughly the size

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.698
of that output, and the lines here,

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:54.207
called contour lines,

00:03:54.207 --> 00:03:58.282
tell you which inputs all
share a constant output value.

00:03:58.282 --> 00:04:00.163
And again, I'll go into
much more detail there.

00:04:00.163 --> 00:04:01.858
These are really nice,
much more convenient

00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:03.117
than three-dimensional graphs,

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.819
to just sketch out.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.826
Moving right along,

00:04:07.826 --> 00:04:09.683
I'm also gonna talk about surfaces

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:10.705
in three-dimensional space.

00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:11.819
They look like graphs,

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.125
but they actually deal with
a much different animal,

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:16.440
that you could think of it
as mapping two dimensions,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.158
and I like to sort of spoosh it about.

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:20.504
And we've got kind of a
two-dimensional input,

00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:22.965
that somehow moves into three dimensions,

00:04:22.965 --> 00:04:24.660
and you're just looking at what the output

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.048
of that looks like,

00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:28.264
not really caring about how it gets there.

00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:31.022
These are called parametric surfaces.

00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:33.147
Another fun one is a vector field,

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:35.504
where every input point is associated

00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:36.642
with some kind of vector,

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:38.139
which is the output of the function there.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.068
So this would be a function

00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:40.287
with a two-dimensional input

00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:41.820
and a two-dimensional output

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.724
'cause each of these are
two-dimensional vectors.

00:04:43.724 --> 00:04:44.943
And the fun part with these guys

00:04:44.943 --> 00:04:47.489
is that you can just kind of,

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:49.099
imagine a fluid flowing,

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.188
so here's a bunch of droplets, like water,

00:04:51.188 --> 00:04:52.779
and they kind of flow along that.

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.300
And that actually turns
out to give insight

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.821
about the underlying function.

00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:57.389
It's one of those beautiful aspects

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.689
of multivariable calc.

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.361
And we'll get lots of exposure to that.

00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:01.603
Again, I'm just sort of zipping through

00:05:01.603 --> 00:05:02.787
to whet your appetite.

00:05:02.787 --> 00:05:06.061
Don't worry if this doesn't
make sense immediately.

00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:07.965
And one of my all-time
favorite ways to think about

00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:11.321
multivariable functions is
to just take the input space,

00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:14.118
in this case, this is gonna
be a function that inputs

00:05:14.118 --> 00:05:15.332
points in two-dimensional space,

00:05:15.332 --> 00:05:17.520
and watch them move to their output,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.622
so, this is gonna be a
function that also outputs

00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:20.539
in two dimensions.

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.106
And I'm just gonna
watch every single point

00:05:22.106 --> 00:05:24.962
move over to where it's supposed to go.

00:05:24.962 --> 00:05:27.064
These can be kind of
complicated to look at,

00:05:27.064 --> 00:05:28.178
or to think about at first,

00:05:28.178 --> 00:05:30.198
but as you gain a little bit of thought

00:05:30.198 --> 00:05:31.220
and exposure to them,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.822
they're actually very nice,

00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:34.889
and it provides a beautiful connection

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.224
with linear algebra.

00:05:36.224 --> 00:05:37.280
A lot of you out there,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.821
if you're studying multivariable calculus,

00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:40.880
you either are about to
study linear algebra,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.422
or you just have, or maybe
you're doing it concurrently,

00:05:43.422 --> 00:05:45.767
but understanding functions
as transformations

00:05:45.767 --> 00:05:47.846
is gonna be a great way
to connect those two.

00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:48.867
So with that,

00:05:48.867 --> 00:05:51.758
I'll stop jabbering through
these topics really quickly

00:05:51.758 --> 00:05:53.941
and in the next few videos

00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:55.543
I'll actually go through them in detail

00:05:55.543 --> 00:05:57.366
and hopefully you can get a good feel

00:05:57.366 --> 00:06:00.581
for what multivariable functions
can actually feel like.
