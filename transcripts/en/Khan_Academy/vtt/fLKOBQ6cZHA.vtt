00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540
 

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.870
In the last video on the lungs
or the gas exchange in our

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.540
bodies or on the pulmonary
system, we left off with the

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.290
alveolar sacs.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.690
Let me draw one right here.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.400
So we have these alveolar sacs
that I talked about and

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.090
they're in these little
clumps like this.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.460
Let me draw a couple of them
just so you get the idea.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.630
And if you remember from the
last video, these are kind of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.380
where air goes in through our
trachea, then that splits up

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.680
into our bronchi, and then
those split into the

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.730
bronchioles, and
the bronchioles

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.810
terminate at these alveoli.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.790
So that's the alveoli.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.950
These are these super-small sacs
that we talked about in

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.680
the last video on the
pulmonary system.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.420
You might want to watch
that video if none

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.420
of this sounds familiar.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180
And then of course we have our
bronchiole that feeds into

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.920
this, and then that might have
branched off from another one

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.160
that feeds into another set of
alveolar sacs, but I don't

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.270
want to get too focused
on that.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.520
I covered that in
the last video.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:05.630
 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.460
In the last video, we saw that
air, when we breathe in, when

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.970
our diaphragm contracts and
makes our lungs expand and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.380
fill up that space,
air comes in.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.020
Air comes in and that air that
comes in is going to be-- as

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.780
we're breathing atmospheric
air-- it's going to be 21%

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:38.450
oxygen and it's going
to be 78% nitrogen.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.120
And actually, in our atmosphere,
carbon dioxide is

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.290
actually almost a trace gas.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.540
It's less than 1%.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.680
 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.370
So any time you breathe in on
Earth, this is what you're

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.770
going to get.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.880
And we said in the last video
that you have these

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.320
capillaries, these pulmonary
capillaries that are running

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.420
all along the side
of these alveoli.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.160
So let me draw those pulmonary
capillaries-- and so when they

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.390
are de-oxygenated-- so they come
here to be oxygenated.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.700
So when they're de-oxygenated,
they might

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.950
look a little purplish.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.880
 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.050
And then they pick up the
oxygen from inside the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.770
alveoli-- or the oxygen diffuses
across the membrane

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.890
of the alveoli, into these
capillaries, into these super

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.010
small tubes.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.850
And then once they do, that
makes the blood red.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.470
I'm going to talk in a little
bit about why it becomes red.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.720
So then it becomes red, and now
that the blood is red, it

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.950
has its oxygen.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.600
The whole point is to
get the oxygen.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.420
It's ready to go back
to the heart.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.260
So that's just one little
part of it.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.140
And we learned in the last video
that something that goes

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.230
away from the heart-- so this is
going away from the heart--

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.450
that is an artery. "A
for Away" - Artery.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.890
And something that's going
towards the heart is a vein.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.920
So this right here is a vein.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.910
Now one question-- and
this actually came

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.920
up in the last video.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.530
Someone asked-- which I think is
a very good question-- is,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.360
gee, when we breathe in, most
of the air is nitrogen.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.990
Only 21% is oxygen.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.610
What happens to all that
nitrogen there?

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.150
How come that doesn't
go into our blood?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.160
And that's actually an
excellent question.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.960
So to answer that, I think that
actually helps explain

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.430
what's going on here.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.680
Let's draw a little
bit bigger.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.040
 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.320
This is the inside of
of an alveolus.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.560
This is its membrane right here,
super thin, almost one

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.960
cell thick.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.800
And then you have a capillary
running right next to it.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.180
Let me do that in
a neutral color.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.380
So you have a capillary
that's maybe running

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.630
right along the surface.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:14.130
 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.430
And this is porous to gases
like oxygen, and nitrogen,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.550
carbon dioxide.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.040
And what we have here-- let's
say that this is-- so the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.340
heart is over here.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.880
 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.020
So this is blood coming from
the heart and then this is

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.430
going to go back to the heart.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.530
Well, the heart's
on both sides.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.890
So let me write it this way.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:40.530
From the heart and
to the heart.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.550
And what you have here is--
when we're coming from the

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.970
heart, this is de-oxygenated
blood and it's actually going

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.396
to have a high concentration
of carbon dioxide.

00:04:48.396 --> 00:04:53.950
 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.500
I already did nitrogen
as green.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.800
Let me do carbon dioxide
as orange.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.740
There's a lot of carbon dioxide
and actually carbon

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.000
dioxide actually gets diffused
in the blood.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.280
It actually is carried in
the plasma of the blood.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.590
It's not carried by red blood
cells that we're going to talk

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.810
about in a second.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.270
So that's a bunch of carbon
dioxide here.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.880
And the concentration of
carbon dioxide in the

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.580
de-oxygenated blood is going
to be higher than the

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.450
concentration of carbon dioxide
in the alveolus.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.800
so if this is porous to carbon
dioxide, this membrane-- and

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.150
it is, these carbon dioxide
molecules are going to diffuse

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.120
into the alveolus.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.340
Now on the other side of that--
we have oxygen here.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.270
We're breathing it in.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.550
The air is 21% oxygen so you're
actually going to have

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.210
a lot more oxygen than
carbon dioxide.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.830
And this is de-oxygenated
blood.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.690
We used all of the oxygen in our
body and we'll talk more

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.800
about that either at the end of
this video or in a future

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.710
video on how we use it or where
it goes in our body, but

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.020
there's no oxygen here so the
oxygen is going to be taken--

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.450
it's going to diffuse across
this membrane because the

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.620
concentration of
oxygen is low.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.890
Now the question is-- so
immediately you see that as

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.946
the oxygen diffuses across
this membrane, all of a

00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:17.460
sudden, this is oxygenated
blood ready to

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.270
go back to the heart.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.950
So this transition between
artery and vein is a very

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.040
subtle thing.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.990
Very clearly here, you
say that, OK, this is

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.440
going from the heart.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.360
This is our vein.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.450
This is going to the
heart-- sorry.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.440
I always get confused.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.930
This is going away from the
heart-- and I was looking for

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.040
an A and I wrote from.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.610
This is away from the heart
so this is an artery.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.330
And this is going to the heart
so this is a vein.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.770
So you could make
the division.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.780
You could say, OK, once it's
oxygenated, maybe we're going

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.220
back to the heart, but it's kind
of an arbitrary-- sorry.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.060
I spelled artery wrong.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.660
These are my flaws.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.210
Spelling was never
my strong suit.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.840
So it's hard to say where
the artery ends

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.830
and the vein begins.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.320
A good demarcation is when the
carbon dioxide concentration

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.840
goes low and that the oxygen
concentration goes high.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.690
That's a good time, where
we start from

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.060
the pulmonary artery.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.180
Probably in the next video, I
will a make a very-- you'll

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.790
see why the pulmonary arteries
are special, because pulmonary

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.230
arteries coming away from the
heart have no oxygen or very

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.590
little oxygen and they have
a lot of carbon dioxide.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:34.750
So pulmonary veins, which is--
it's arbitrary where the

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.160
artery turns into a vein.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.520
Once it gets oxygenated, it's
ready to go back to the heart.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.070
It's a pulmonary vein and
it is oxygenated.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:47.326
So it has oxygenated-- and we
could write de-oxygenated.

00:07:47.326 --> 00:07:52.280
 

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.900
Now the reason why I say it's
special besides the fact that

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.110
pulmonary arteries and veins go
to and from the lungs, is

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.400
that they're kind
of the opposite.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.680
Because in the rest of the body
when we're going away

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.420
from the heart or we're talking
about arteries, you're

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.910
going to see that that's
oxygenated blood, while when

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.020
we're going away from the heart
to the lungs, that's

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.480
de-oxygenated blood.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.260
Similarly in the rest of the
body, when we're going to the

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.560
heart, where you're to see
that that's de-oxygenated

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.220
blood, but in the pulmonary
vein, when we're going to the

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.340
heart, it's oxygenated because
the lungs are what take up the

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.630
carbon dioxide and give
us the oxygen.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.320
Now I still haven't answered
that interesting question that

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.370
rose on the message board
on the last video.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.330
What happens to the 78% of
nitrogen that's sitting here?

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.320
There's just a ton of nitrogen
over here, more than the

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.350
oxygen, a lot more than
the carbon dioxide.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.050
What happens to all of these
nitrogen molecules?

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.550
And the answer is, nitrogen can
diffuse and does diffuse

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.400
into the blood, but the blood's
ability to take in

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.280
nitrogen isn't that high.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.930
And you might say, well,
why is oxygen special?

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.800
Why can the blood take
up oxygen so

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.360
much easier than nitrogen?

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.250
And that's where the red blood
cells come into play.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:09.920
Let me write this down.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.520
I'll write it in red.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.520
Red blood cells, which
are fascinating on a

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.050
whole set of levels.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.470
What red blood cells-- these
are these cells that are

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:28.010
sitting in-- they're flowing
through our circulatory system

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.260
and they look kind of
like lozenges, if I

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.830
were to draw one.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.400
They're kind of like a flattened
sphere with a little

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.090
divot on either side of it--
a lot like a lozenge.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.730
So if I were to draw it from
the side, it might look

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.480
something like-- well, from the
side, it would look like

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.530
that and if you could see
through it, there'd be a

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.140
little divot on each side.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.190
If I were to draw it at an
angle, it would look

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.440
something like this.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.660
 

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.200
There'd be a little divot on
that side and there'd be a

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.960
similar divot on
the other side.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.750
And red blood cells-- and I
could do a whole set of videos

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.650
just on red blood cells--
they contain hemoglobin.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.250
Maybe we'll do a whole
video on hemoglobin.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:11.420
The hemoglobin are these
small proteins that

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.330
contain four hem groups.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:19.050
So inside of red blood cells,
you have millions of

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.750
hemoglobin proteins.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.460
And the hemoglobin proteins--
I'll just draw them as this--

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.070
they have these four
heme groups.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.380
And heme groups, the main
component is iron.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.600
And that's why iron
is so important.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.990
If you don't have enough iron,
you're going to have trouble

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.450
processing oxygen in your blood
and your hemoglobin

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.340
won't be functional enough.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.350
But it has iron on it.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.350
It has four of these
heme groups.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.750
And each of these heme groups
can bond to oxygen molecules.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.140
They're very good binders
of oxygen.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.370
And we're going to see in a
little bit-- probably the next

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.430
video-- how they release the
oxygen, but this has tons,

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:56.010
this has millions of heme groups
in it and the oxygen

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.120
diffuses across the membrane
of the red blood cells and

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.970
bonds to to the heme groups
on your hemoglobin.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.470
So because the red blood cells
have the hemoglobin inside of

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.380
them, they're like these sponges
for oxygen because

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.340
hemoglobin is so good
at taking in oxygen.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.170
So the red blood cells are able
to essentially suck up

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.710
all of the oxygen out
of the plasma.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.300
The plasma we can view as just
the general fluid of the

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.500
blood, not including the
red blood cells.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:29.320
So the red blood cell
here isn't so red.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.380
And the reason-- and this is the
key point-- the reason why

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.610
it's not so red-- maybe we had
a red blood cell over here--

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.190
let me make it clear.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.450
Carbon dioxide for
the most part is

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.390
traveling within the plasma.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.640
It gets absorbed into the actual
fluid and I'll talk

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.500
about it in a future video.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.590
It's actually in a slightly
different form.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.820
It's as carbonic acid and that's
actually a key point

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.040
for how the plasma knows where
to dump the oxygen, but I'll

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.720
talk about that in
a future video.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.540
But over here, this red blood
cell has a bunch of hemoglobin

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.840
proteins in it, but those
hemoglobin proteins have

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.190
dumped their oxygen.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.250
And it actually turns out it's
the hemoglobin-- so with

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.080
oxygen, hemoglobin looks red.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.980
 

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.660
It reflects red light.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:19.350
When it doesn't have oxygen,
hemoglobin does not look red.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.190
It looks kind of purplish,
bluish, darkish-- something.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.880
And that's why in most of your
body, your veins that have

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.770
de-oxygenated red blood cells
look kind of bluish.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.380
And the reason why it changes
color is that when the oxygen

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.860
bonds to the hem sites on the
hemoglobin, it actually

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.480
changes the entire confirmation,
the entire

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.660
structure of the protein.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.160
We've see that multiple times.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.950
The whole protein folds in
such a way that all of a

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.340
sudden, instead of purplish or
dark light being reflected,

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.690
now red light is reflected.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.130
And that's why red blood cells
will become red once they take

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:54.920
the oxygen.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.240
But I'm going on a tangent.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.720
The whole point here is saying,
why we taking up so

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.310
much more oxygen than nitrogen,
given that there's

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.260
less oxygen in the atmosphere
than nitrogen?

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.720
And the key is these
red blood cells.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.250
These red blood cells have these
millions of hemoglobin

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.280
proteins inside of them and they
take them up and they sop

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.280
up all of the oxygen
out of the plasma.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:23.870
Actually, they sop about
98.5% of the oxygen.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.560
So these red blood cells are
just traveling and they're

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.440
going to go back to the heart.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.670
They are what make
our blood red.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.010
So you have this thing,
hemoglobin, that's sitting in

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:32.770
red blood cells.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.380
It's sopping up all
the oxygen.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.290
So it keeps the oxygen
concentration and the actual

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.610
plasma low.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.760
You have nothing like
that for nitrogen.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.350
There is no cell that's sopping
up the nitrogen.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.280
Nitrogen does not bond
to hemoglobin.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.030
So that's why oxygen
is taken up so

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.990
much better than nitrogen.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:55.690
It's a very interesting question
because if you just

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.700
think about how much nitrogen
is, it's kind of a very

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.630
natural idea.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.640
Now I want to focus a little
bit on the red blood cell

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.840
itself because it's
fascinating.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.240
In the video on the structure
of the cell, I start off

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.020
saying, all cells have
a membrane and

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.190
they all have DNA.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:22.565
Now, the fascinating thing about
a red blood cell-- I

00:14:22.565 --> 00:14:26.980
already said it has millions
of hemoglobin molecules or

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.580
proteins inside of it.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.950
The fascinating thing
about a red blood

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.120
cell-- it has no nucleus.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.760
 

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.200
And no DNA.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.550
This is mind boggling when
I first found out.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:41.980
I was like, well, why
is it a cell?

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.860
Is it really even
a living thing?

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.990
And it turns out when
it's growing,

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.810
it does have a nucleus.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:52.310
All cells need a nucleus with
DNA in order to generate the

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.530
proteins that build it up,
in order to exist and

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.690
structurally make itself the way
it needs to be made, but

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.820
the whole point of a red blood
cell is to contain as much

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.030
hemoglobin as possible.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.490
And so you can imagine, this
is actually a favorable

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.200
evolutionary trait, that as red
blood cells are ready to

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.770
go into business, you've built
the whole structure, they

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.230
actually get rid of
their nucleus.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.440
They actually push their nucleus
out of the cell and

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.950
the whole reason why that's
beneficial is, that's more

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.540
space for hemoglobin.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:33.280
 

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.730
Because the more hemoglobin you
have, the more oxygen you

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:37.610
can take up.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:42.120
And I can do a ton of videos
on hemoglobin and all of

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.040
that-- and actually, I'm going
to do a lot more on the

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.370
circulatory system so don't
worry about that, but I want

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.870
to go over one other really
interesting thing about

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:50.560
hemoglobin.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.880
We already talked about
red blood cells.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.070
I think it's fascinating that
they actually don't have a

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.370
nucleus in their mature form.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.730
They actually have
very short lives.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.360
They live maybe 80, 120 days
so they're not these long

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.720
lived cells-- so it's almost
a philosophical question.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.250
Are are they still alive once
they've lost their DNA or are

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:11.420
they just vessels for oxygen
that aren't really alive

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.210
because they aren't regenerating
and producing

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.530
their own DNA?

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.980
So actually, instead of going
into the hemoglobin discussion

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.390
right now, I'll leave you
there in this video.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.760
I realize I've been making
20-minute videos where my goal

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.810
is really to make
ten-minute ones.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.055
So I'll leave you here and in
the next video, we'll talk

00:16:25.055 --> 00:16:28.590
more about hemoglobin and
the circulatory system.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.154
