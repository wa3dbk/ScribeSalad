00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.800
I've got a 2 by 2 matrix here,
and let's just say its entries

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.690
are a, b, c, and d.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.140
And it's composed of
two column vectors.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.430
We've done this before, let's
call this first column v1 and

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.440
let's call the second
column v2.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.860
So we can rewrite here.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:28.440
We can say v1 one is equal to
ac, and we could write that v2

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.890
is equal to bd.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.270
And these are both members of
r2, and just to have a nice

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.870
visualization in our head,
let's graph these two.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.170
Let me draw my axes.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.870
That's my vertical axis.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.870
That's my horizontal axis.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.240
And maybe v1 looks something
like this.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.860
v1 might look something
like that.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.040
So that is v1.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.222
It's horizontal component will
be a, its vertical coordinant

00:00:57.222 --> 00:01:00.870
-- give you this as maybe a
position vector, or just how

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.950
we're drawing it, is c.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.190
And then v2, let's just say it
looks something like this.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.380
Let's say that they're
not the same vector.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.380
So v2 looks like that.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.230
v2, its horizontal coordinate
is going to b, and its

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.790
vertical coordinate
is going to be d.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.830
Now, what we're going to concern
ourselves with in this

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.190
video is the parallelogram
generated by these two guys.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.770
What I mean by that is, imagine
that these two guys

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.480
are position vectors that are
specifying points on a

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.160
parallelogram, and then of
course the -- or not of course

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.990
but, the origin is also
another point in the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.760
parallelogram, so what will
be the last point on the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.970
parallelogram?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.110
Well, you can imagine.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.380
A parallelogram, we already have
two sides of it, so the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.770
other two sides have
to be parallel.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.130
So one side look like that,
parallel to v1 the way I've

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.700
drawn it, and the other side
will look like this.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.030
That's our parallelogram.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.410
The parallelogram generated
by v2 and v1.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.700
What we're going to concern
ourselves with specifically is

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:14.150
the area of the parallelogram
generated by v1 and v2.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.120
So how do we figure that out?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.510
In general, if I have just any
parallelogram-- this is kind

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.056
of a tilted one, but if I just
have any parallelogram, let me

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:26.060
just draw any parallelogram
right there-- the area is just

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.060
equal to the base-- so
that could be the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.060
base-- times the height.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.945
So it's equal to base -- I'll
write capital B since we have

00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:38.210
a lowercase b there--
base times height.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.560
That's what the area of a
parallelogram would be.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.040
Now what are the base and the
height in this situation?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.640
Let me write this down.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.850
The area of our parallelogram
is equal to the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.310
base times the height.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.250
And actually-- well, let
me just write it here.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.010
So what is the base here?

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.380
The base here is going to be
the length of our vector v.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.730
So this is our base.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.020
So this right here is going to
be the length of vector v1,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.470
the length of this orange
vector right here.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.340
And what's the height of this
parallelogram going to be?

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.660
We could drop a perpendicular
here, and that, the length of

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.086
this line right here, is
going to be our height.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.240
So how can we figure out that,
you know, we know what v1 is,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.010
so we can figure out the
base pretty easily.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.490
But how can we figure
out the height?

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.110
Well, one thing we can do is, if
we can figure out this guy

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.580
right here, we could use the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.110
Because the length of this
vector squared, plus H

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.130
squared, is going to be equal
to the length of v2 squared.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.960
So let's see if we
can do that.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.080
What is this guy?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.510
What is this green
guy right here?

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.160
Well if you imagine a line--
let's imagine some line l.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.410
So let's say l is a line
spanned by v1.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.279
Which means you take all of the
multiples of v1, and all

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.580
of the positions that they
specify will create a set of

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.345
points, and that is my line l.

00:04:24.345 --> 00:04:26.530
So you take all the multiples
of v1, you're going to get

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.835
every point along this line.

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:31.950
Just like that.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.714
Now if we have l defined that
way-- that line right there is

00:04:35.714 --> 00:04:36.610
l, I don't know if
you can see it.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.680
Let me do it a little bit better
-- and it goes through

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.560
v1 and it just keeps
going over there.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.840
What is this green
line right there?

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.450
This green line that we're
concerned with, that's the

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.080
projection onto l of what?

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.830
Well, we have a perpendicular
here, you can imagine the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.060
light source coming down-- I
don't know if that analogy

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.540
helps you-- but it's kind
of the shadow of

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.850
v2 onto that line.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.490
So it's a projection of v2, of
your vector v2 onto l is this

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.360
green line right there.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.010
So, if we want to figure out
H, we can just use the

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.550
Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.830
So we can say that the length
of H squared-- well I'm just

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.370
writing H as the length,
I'm not even

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.040
specifying it as a vector.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.560
So we could say that H squared,
where that is the

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.550
length of this line, plus the
length of this vector

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.130
squared-- and the length of
that vector squared is the

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.010
length of the projection
onto l of v2.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.130
I'll do that in a
different color.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:48.720
So the length of the projection
onto l of v2

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.870
squared-- all right?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.530
We're just doing the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.870
This squared plus this
squared is going

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.320
to equal that squared.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.930
It's going to be equal to the
length of v2 squared.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.410
That's just the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.550
Nothing fancy there.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.740
So how can we simplify?

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.470
We want to solve for H.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.230
And actually, let's just solve
for H squared for now because

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.200
it'll keep things a little
bit simpler.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.160
So we can say that H squared is
equal to this guy, is equal

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.400
to the length of my vector v2
squared minus the length of

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.390
the projection squared.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.740
So minus -- I'll do that in
purple -- minus the length of

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.410
the projection onto
l of v2 squared.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.750
Remember, this thing is just
this thing right here, we're

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.860
just doing the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.680
So let's see if we can simplify
this, or write it in

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.700
terms that we understand.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.620
So the length of a vector
squared, this is just equal

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.390
to-- let me write it this
way-- this is just

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.630
equal to v2 dot v2.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.880
You take a vector, you dot it
with itself, and you get the

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.550
length of that vector
squared, we saw that

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.370
many, many videos ago.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.710
And then what is this guy
going to be equal to?

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.410
Well, the projection--
I'll do it over here.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:20.700
The projection onto l of v2 is
going to be equal to v2 dot

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.580
the spanning vector,
which is v1.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:31.200
So it's v2 dot v1 over the
spanning vector dotted with

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.810
itself, v1 dot v1.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.370
We saw this several videos
ago when we learned about

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.380
projections.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.510
And this is just a number
right there.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.860
And then it's going
to be times the

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.960
spanning vector itself.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.400
So times v1.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.390
That is what the
projection is.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:55.000
So it's going to be this
minus the length of

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.440
the projection squared.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.100
What is the length of the
projection squared?

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.080
Well that's this guy dotted
with himself.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.970
Let me write it this way, let
me take it step by step.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.240
So this is going to be minus--
I'm want to make sure I can

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.250
still see that up there so I
don't have to rewrite it.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.110
The projection is going to be,
it looks a little complicated

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:25.020
but hopefully things will
simplify, v2 dot v1 over v1

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:31.250
dot v1 times-- switch colors--
times the vector-- this is all

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.370
just going to end up being a
number, remember you take dot

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.050
products, you get numbers--
times the vector v1.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.570
And we're going to take
the length of

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.039
that whole thing squared.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.670
And all of this is going to
be equal to H squared.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.300
Once again, just the Pythagorean
Theorem.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.820
This or this squared, which is
the height squared, is equal

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.490
to your hypotenuse squared,
this is your hypotenuse

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.280
squared, minus the other
side squared.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.640
This is the other
side squared.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.770
Looks a little complicated, but
it was just a projection

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.800
of this guy on to that
right there.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.840
So let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.410
We're just going to have to
break out some algebra or let

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.390
s can do here.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.470
Well actually, not algebra,
some linear algebra.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.060
So what is this guy?

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.930
Well this guy is just the dot
product of this with itself.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.610
So this is just equal to-- we
know, I mean any vector, if

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.830
you take the square of its
length, it's just that vector

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.660
dotted with itself.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.290
So this thing, if we are taking
the square of this

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:30.550
guy's length, it's just
equal to this

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.570
guy dotted with himself.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.950
Let me write everything
over again.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:45.210
So we get H squared is equal to
v2 dot v2, and then minus

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.900
this guy dotted with himself.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:58.790
So minus v2 dot v1 over v1 dot
v1, times the vector v1,

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.000
dotted with itself.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.420
Dotted with v2 dot v1--
remember, this green part is

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:15.000
just a number-- over
v1 dot v1 times v1.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.063
And what is this equal to?

00:10:16.063 --> 00:10:17.810
Let's just simplify this.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.370
These are just scalar
quantities, and we saw that

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.110
the dot product is associative
with respect to scalar

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.190
quantities, so we can just
change the order here.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.640
So this is going to be
equal to the scalar

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.750
quantity times itself.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:36.110
So we could say this is
equal to v2 dot v1.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.260
Let me write it this way.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.000
V2 dot v1, that's going to
be-- and we're going to

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.660
multiply the numerator times
itself, v2 dot v1.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:53.240
And then all of that over v1
dot v1 times v1 dot v1.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.690
Remember, I'm just taking
these two terms and

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.290
multiplying them
by each other.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.460
I'm just switching the order,
and then we know that the

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.690
scalars can be taken out,
times these two

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:03.750
guys dot each other.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.470
Times v1 dot v1.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.000
That's what this
simplifies to.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.830
Now this is now a number.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.000
We had vectors here, but when
you take a dot product, you

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.650
just get a number.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.180
And this number is the
same as this number.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.780
So we can simplify
a little bit.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:24.270
So we can cross those two guys
out, and then we are left with

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:30.850
that our height squared
is equal to this

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.960
expression times itself.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.930
We have it times itself twice,
so it's equal to-- let me

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.680
start over here.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:45.630
It's equal to v2 dot v2 minus
this guy times itself.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:53.790
So v2 dot v1 squared, all of
that over just one of these

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:59.370
guys. v1 dot v1.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.650
That is what the height
squared is.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.480
Now we have the height squared,
we could take the

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.670
square root if we just want
to solve for the height.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.350
But to keep our math simple, we
know that area is equal to

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.080
base times height.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.660
Let's just say what the area
squared is equal to.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.410
Because then both of these
terms will get squared.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.024
So if the area is equal to base
times height-- we saw

00:12:22.024 --> 00:12:24.970
that at the beginning of the
video-- then the area squared

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.780
is going to be equal to these
two guys squared.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.640
It's going to be equal to base
squared times height squared.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.440
Now what is the base squared?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.990
Let me do it like this.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.900
So the base squared-- we already
saw, the base of our

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:49.590
parallelogram is the length
of vector v1.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.830
Now what is the base squared?

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.580
The base squared is going
to be the length

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.030
of vector v1 squared.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:03.730
Or another way of writing
that is v1 dot v1.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.300
And we already know what the
height squared is, it's this

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.520
expression right there.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.780
Let me write that down.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.550
The height squared is the height
squared right there.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.890
So what is our area squared
going to be?

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:21.290
Our area squared-- let me go
down here where I'll have more

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:25.610
space-- our area squared is
going to be equal to our base

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.865
squared, which is v1 dot v1
times our height squared.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.275
Let with me write
it like this.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.170
No, I was using the
wrong color.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:52.900
Times this guy over here. v2 dot
v2 minus v2 dot v1 squared

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.830
over v1 dot v1.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.230
Now what does this
simplified to?

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.670
Well, this is just a number,
these are all just numbers.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.310
So if I multiply, if I
distribute this out, this is

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.590
equal to what?

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:12.340
This times this is equal to v1--
let me color code it-- v1

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:22.100
dot v1 times this guy
times v2 dot v2.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.680
And then when I multiplied
this guy times

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.010
that guy, what happens?

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.660
Well I have this guy in the
numerator and that guy in the

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.010
denominator, so they
cancel out.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:37.700
So I'm just left with minus
v2 dot v1 squared.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.650
Now let's remind ourselves what
these two vectors were.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.650
v1 was the vector ac and
v2 is the vector bd.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.110
Let me rewrite it down here so
we have it to work with.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:54.760
So v1 was equal to the vector
ac, and v2 is equal

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.600
to the vector bd.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.790
So what is v1 dot v1?

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.750
That is equal to a dot
a, a times a, a

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.020
squared plus c squared.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.990
That's this, right there.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.800
And that's what? v2 dot v2.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.740
So we're going to have
that times v2 dot v2.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:25.030
v2 dot v2 is v squared
plus d squared.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:30.450
And then we're going to have
minus v2 dot v1 squared.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:34.080
So what's v2 dot v1?

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.590
It's b times a, plus d times c,
or a times b plus -- we're

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.850
just dotting these two guys.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:46.600
So it's ab plus cd, and then
we're squaring it.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.910
And let's see what this
simplifies to.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.630
Hopefully it simplifies
to something.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.050
Let me switch colors.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.550
So if we just multiply this
out, let me write it here.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.185
Our area squared is equal to
a squared times b squared.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:08.150
a squared times d squared,
plus c squared times b

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:13.670
squared, plus c squared
times d squared.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:21.220
And then minus this
guy squared.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.960
What is that going
to be equal to?

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.620
ab squared is a squared,
b squared.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.650
And then I'm going to multiply
these guys times each other

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:35.750
twice, so that's going
to be plus 2abcd.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:40.020
And then you're going to have
a plus c squared, d squared.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.260
I just foiled this out, that's
the best way you

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.010
could think about it.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.920
And then, if I distribute this
negative sign, what do I have?

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.230
Let me rewrite everything.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.380
It's equal to a squared b
squared, plus a squared d

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:59.100
squared, plus c squared b
squared, plus c squared d

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:08.060
squared, minus a squared b
squared, minus 2abcd, minus c

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.200
squared, d squared.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.920
All I did is, I distributed
the minus sign.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.960
Now it looks like some things
will simplify nicely.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.550
And now remember, all this is
equal to our area squared.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:21.180
We have a ab squared, we have
a minus ab squared.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.589
They cancel out.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:27.130
We have a minus cd squared
and a cd squared,

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.650
so they cancel out.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.100
So all we're left with is that
the area of our parallelogram

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:45.490
squared is equal to a squared
d squared minus 2abcd plus c

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.740
squared b squared.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.910
Now this might look a little bit
bizarre to you, but if you

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.210
made a substitution right here,
if you said that x is

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:04.540
equal to ad, and if you said y
is equal to cb, then what does

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.730
this become?

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.220
This is equal to x
squared minus 2

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.180
times xy plus y squared.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:14.750
Right?

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.740
Hopefully you recognize this.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.610
And this is just the same thing
as x minus y squared.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.580
So, if this is our substitutions
we made-- I did

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.940
this just so you can visualize
this a little bit better.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:32.980
So we have our area squared is
equal to x minus y squared or

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:39.640
ad minus cb, or let me
write it, bc squared.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.960
That's what the area of our
parallelogram squared is.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.540
And if you don't quite
understand what I did here, I

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.890
just made these substitutions
so you can

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.080
recognize it better.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.010
But just understand that this
is the same thing as this.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:54.100
If you want, you can just
multiply this guy out and

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.670
you'll get that right there.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.650
But what is this?

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.700
What is this thing right here?

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.250
It's the determinant.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.470
This is the determinant of
our original matrix.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.710
Well, I called that matrix A
and then I used A again for

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.460
area, so let me write
it this way.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.880
Area squared -- let me
write it like this.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:27.870
Area squared is equal to
ad minus bc squared.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.940
So this is area, these
A's are all area.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.940
But what is this?

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.770
This is the determinant
of my matrix.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:43.050
That is the determinant of my
matrix A, my original matrix

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.680
that I started the problem with,
which is equal to the

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.380
determinant of abcd.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:48.870
Right?

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:54.340
The determinant of this is ad
minus bc, by definition.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:59.190
So your area-- this
is exciting!

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.140
So the area of your
parallelogram squared is equal

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.070
to the determinant of the matrix
whose column vectors

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.210
construct that parallelogram.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.650
Is equal to the determinant
of your matrix squared.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.690
Or if you take the square root
of both sides, you get the

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:19.980
area is equal to the absolute
value of the determinant of A.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.030
Which is a pretty neat
outcome, especially

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.732
considering how much hairy
algebra we had to go through.

00:20:24.732 --> 00:20:28.720
Let's go back all the way over
here, go back to the drawing.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.740
So if we want to figure out the
area of this parallelogram

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:39.610
right here, that is defined, or
that is created, by the two

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:44.620
column vectors of a matrix, we
literally just have to find

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.460
the determinant of the matrix.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:51.620
The area of this is equal to
the absolute value of the

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.630
determinant of A.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.060
And you have to do that because

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.930
this might be negative.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.830
You can imagine if you swapped
these guys around, if you

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.150
swapped some of the rows, this
guy would be negative, but you

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.230
can 't have a negative area.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.560
And it wouldn't really change
the definition, it really

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.730
wouldn't change what spanned.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.960
If you switched v1 and v2,
you're still spanning the same

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.470
parallelogram, you just might
get the negative of the

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.770
determinant.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.640
But that is a really
neat outcome.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.240
And you know, when you first
learned determinants in

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.000
school-- I mean, we learned
the first motivation for a

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.640
determinant was this idea of
when we take the inverse of a

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.110
2 by 2, this thing shows up in
the denominator and we call

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.180
that the determinant.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.470
But now there's this other
interpretation here.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:33.590
There's actually the area of the
parallelogram created by

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.360
the column vectors
of this matrix.
