00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.080
Let's see if we can use what we
know about springs now to

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.640
get a little intuition
about how the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.810
spring moves over time.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.600
And hopefully we'll
learn a little bit

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.660
about harmonic motion.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.010
We'll actually even step into
the world of differential

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.930
equations a little bit.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.200
And don't get daunted
when we get there.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.950
Or just close your eyes
when it happens.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.340
Anyway, so I've drawn a spring,
like I've done in the

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.410
last couple of videos.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.150
And 0, this point in the x-axis,
that's where the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.500
spring's natural resting
state is.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.890
And in this example I
have a mass, mass m,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.220
attached to the spring.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.480
And I've stretched the string.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.680
I've essentially pulled it.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.480
So the mass is now sitting
at point A.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.710
So what's going to
happen to this?

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.330
Well, as we know, the force, the
restorative force of the

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.230
spring, is equal to minus some

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.360
constant, times the x position.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.860
The x position starting at A.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.910
So initially the spring
is going to pull

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.870
back this way, right?

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.750
The spring is going to
pull back this way.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.280
It's going to get faster and
faster and faster and faster.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.710
And we learned that at this
point, it has a lot of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.870
potential energy.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.110
At this point, when it kind of
gets back to its resting

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.940
state, it'll have a lot of
velocity and a lot of kinetic

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.680
energy, but very little
potential energy.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.780
But then its momentum is going
to keep it going, and it's

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.950
going to compress the spring all
the way, until all of that

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.930
kinetic energy is turned back
into potential energy.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.370
Then the process will
start over again.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.550
So let's see if we can just get
an intuition for what x

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.160
will look like as a
function of time.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.980
So our goal is to figure out x
of t, x as a function of time.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.900
That's going to be our goal
on this video and

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.610
probably the next few.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.770
So let's just get an intuition
for what's happening here.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.340
So let me try to graph x
as a function of time.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.030
So time is the independent
variable.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.440
And I'll start at time
is equal to 0.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.060
So this is the time axis.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.100
Let me draw the x-axis.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.420
This might be a little unusual
for you, for me to draw the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.860
x-axis in the vertical, but
that's because x is the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.530
dependent variable in
this situation.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.880
So that's the x-axis,
very unusually.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.940
Or we could say x of t, just so
you know x is a function of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.100
time, x of t.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.500
And this state, that I've drawn
here, this is at time

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.490
equals 0, right?

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.400
So this is at 0.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.340
Let me switch colors.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.020
So at time equals 0, what is
the x position of the mass?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.300
Well the x position
is A, right?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.890
So if I draw this, this is A.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.280
Actually, let me draw
a line there.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.700
That might come in useful.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.560
This is A.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.030
And then this is going to be--
let me try to make it

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.420
relatively-- that
is negative A.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.670
That's minus A.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.200
So at time t equals
0, where is it?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.920
Well it's at A.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.530
So this is where the
graph is, right?

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.880
Actually, let's do something
interesting.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.740
Let's define the period.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.880
So the period I'll do
with a capital T.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.950
Let's say the period is how long
it takes for this mass to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.140
go from this position.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.020
It's going to accelerate,
accelerate, accelerate,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.180
accelerate.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.800
Be going really fast at this
point, all kinetic energy.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.080
And then start slowing down,
slowing down, slowing down,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.800
slowing down.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.390
And then do that whole process
all the way back.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.780
Let's say T is the amount of
time it takes to do that whole

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.560
process, right?

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.850
So at time 0 today, and then we
also know that at time T--

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.500
this is time T-- it'll
also be at A, right?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.660
I'm just trying to graph some
points that I know of this

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.050
function and just see if I can
get some intuition of what

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.590
this function might
be analytically.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.060
So if it takes T seconds to go
there and back, it takes T

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.090
over 2 seconds to
get here, right?

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.470
The same amount of time it takes
to get here was also the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.770
same amount of time it
takes to get back.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.880
So at T over 2 what's going
to be the x position?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.780
Well at T over 2, the block
is going to be here.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.690
It will have compressed
all the way over here.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.550
So at T over 2, it'll
have been here.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.680
And then at the points in
between, it will be at x

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.880
equals 0, right?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.310
It'll be there and there.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.600
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.520
So now we know these points.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.900
But let's think about what the
actual function looks like.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.880
Will it just be a straight line
down, then a straight

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.230
line up, and then the straight
line down, and then a

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.690
straight line up.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.220
That would imply-- think about
it-- if you have a straight

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.920
line down that whole time, that
means that you would have

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.910
a constant rate of change
of your x value.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.550
Or another way of thinking about
that is that you would

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.270
have a constant velocity,
right?

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.200
Well do we have a constant
velocity this entire time?

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.880
Well, no.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.200
We know that at this point right
here you have a very

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.650
high velocity, right?

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.850
You have a very high velocity.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.700
We know at this point you have
a very low velocity.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.410
So you're accelerating
this entire time.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.150
And you actually, the more you
think about it, you're

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.480
actually accelerating at
a decreasing rate.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.610
But you're accelerating
the entire time.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.120
And then you're accelerating and
then you're decelerating

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.180
this entire time.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.420
So your actual rate of change
of x is not constant, so you

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.740
wouldn't have a zigzag
pattern, right?

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.850
And it'll keep going here and
then you'll have a point here.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.840
So what's happening?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.980
When you start off, you're
going very slow.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.860
Your change of x is very slow.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.380
And then you start
accelerating.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.290
And then, once you get to this
point, right here, you start

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.540
decelerating.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.050
Until at this point, your
velocity is exactly 0.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.820
So your rate of change, or your
slope, is going to be 0.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.890
And then you're going to start
accelerating back.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.610
Your velocity is going to get
faster, faster, faster.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.870
It's going to be really
fast at this point.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.850
And then you'll start
decelerating at that point.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.750
So at this point, what does
this point correspond to?

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.820
You're back at A.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.350
So at this point your velocity
is now 0 again.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.350
So the rate of change
of x is 0.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.650
And now you're going to
start accelerating.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.290
Your slope increases, increases,
increases.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.500
This is the point of highest
kinetic energy right here.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.220
Then your velocity starts
slowing down.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.420
And notice here, your slope
at these points is 0.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.640
So that means you
have no kinetic

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.710
energy at those points.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.330
And it just keeps on going.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.590
On and on and on
and on and on.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.970
So what does this look like?

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.050
Well, I haven't proven it to
you, but out of all the

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.610
functions that I have in my
repertoire, this looks an

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.700
awful lot like a trigonometric
function.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.860
And if I had to pick one,
I would pick cosine.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.100
Well why?

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.210
Because when cosine is 0--
I'll write it down here--

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.360
cosine of 0 is equal
to 1, right?

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.610
So when t equals 0, this
function is equal to A.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:59.880
So this function probably looks
something like A cosine

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.730
of-- and I'll just use the
variable omega t-- it probably

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.650
looks something like that,
this function.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.570
And we'll learn in a second
that it looks

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.110
exactly like that.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.460
But I want to prove it
to you, so don't just

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.690
take my word for it.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.490
So let's just figure out how we
can figure out what w is.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.100
And it's probably a function of
the mass of this object and

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.910
also probably a function
of the spring

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.400
constant, but I'm not sure.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.620
So let's see what we
can figure out.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.000
Well now I'm about to embark
into a little bit of calculus.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.380
Actually, a decent
bit of calculus.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.470
And we'll actually even touch
on differential equations.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.790
This might be the first
differential equation you see

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.620
in your life, so it's a
momentous occasion.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.120
But let's just move forward.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.670
Close your eyes if you don't
want to be confused, or go

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.290
watch the calculus videos at
least so you know what a

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.510
derivative is.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.190
So let's write this seemingly
simple equation, or let's

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.570
rewrite it in ways
that we know.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.620
So what's the definition
of force?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.030
Force is mass times
acceleration, right?

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:05.820
So we can rewrite Hooke's law
as-- let me switch colors--

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:11.020
mass times acceleration is
equal to minus the spring

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.600
constant, times the
position, right?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.840
And I'll actually write the
position as a function of t,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.010
just so you remember.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.230
We're so used to x being the
independent variable, that if

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.470
I didn't write that function of
t, it might get confusing.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.770
You're like, oh I thought x is
the independent variable.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.350
No.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.150
Because in this function that we
want to figure out, we want

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.270
to know what happens as
a function of time?

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.280
So actually this is also
maybe a good review

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.080
of parametric equations.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.630
This is where we get
into calculus.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.880
What is acceleration?

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:51.650
If I call my position x, my
position is equal to x as a

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.980
function of t, right?

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.500
I put in some time, and it tells
me what my x value is.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.510
That's my position.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.890
What's my velocity?

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.300
Well my velocity is the
derivative of this, right?

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.320
My velocity, at any given point,
is going to be the

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.890
derivative of this function.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.130
The rate of change of this
function with respect to t.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.340
So I would take the rate
of change with

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.080
respect to t, x of t.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.030
And I could write
that as dx, dt.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.490
And then what's acceleration?

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.410
Well acceleration is just
the rate of change

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.340
of velocity, right?

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.560
So it would be taking the
derivative of this.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.940
Or another way of doing it, it's
like taking the second

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.460
derivative of the position
function, right?

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.850
So in this situation,
acceleration is equal to, we

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.930
could write it as-- I'm just
showing you all different

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.650
notations-- x prime prime of t,
second derivative of x with

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.480
respect to t.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.930
Or-- these are just notational--
d squared x over

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.910
dt squared.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.000
So that's the second
derivative.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.280
Oh it looks like I'm running
out of time.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.480
So I'll see you in
the next video.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.510
Remember what I just
wrote. just wrote
