00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.800
Let's say given this diagram right over here

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.770
We know that the length of segment AB is equal to the length of AC

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.830
so AB which is this whole side right over here

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.880
The length of this entire side as a given

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.950
is equal to the length of this entire side right over here

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.160
So that's the entire side right over there

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.560
And then we also know the angle ABF, ABF is equal to angle ACE

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.680
or you could see their measures are equal or this just implies

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.030
that they are congruent so they have the same measures

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.250
It's equal to angle ACE so this angle right over here is congruent

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.550
to that angle right over there

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.430
Or you could say that they have the same measure

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.070
Now the first thing that I want to attempt to prove in this video

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:53.570
is whether BF, is whether BF has the same length as CE

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.450
Does BF have the same length as CE

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.450
So let's try to do that

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.080
So we already know a few things I could do

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.970
it two column professionally

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.240
let me just do it just so that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.690
in case you have to do two column proofs

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.900
in your class you can see how to do it more formally

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.500
So let's try out our statements

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.330
Over here I'm going to write I'm going to write my reason for the statement

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.570
So let me just rewrite this kind of formal two column proof

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.200
so we know AB is equal to AC so this is statement 1 and this is given

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.620
We know statement 2 that angle ABF is equal to angle ACE

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.450
Once again that was given

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.770
Now the other interesting thing on each of these ,we have an angle

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.000
and we have a side, each of these triangles

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.410
And then what you can see is both of the triangles

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.700
and when I say both of the triangles

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.850
I'm talking about triangle ABF and triangle ACE

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.950
and they both share this vertex at A and point A is a vertex for both of these

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:08.680
So, we could say angle A we say BA, let's call it BAF, angle BAF

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.820
We could say is equal to angle BAF

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.110
or we could say is equal to angle CAE

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.700
That makes it little bit clear that we're dealing

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.190
with two different triangles right here

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.250
But it really is the exact same angle

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.280
It's equal to itself right there that's our third statement

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.620
and we could say that it's obvious

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.840
Some people would call this the reflexive property

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.540
It's obvious that an angle is equal to itself

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.320
And so we could say it's obvious

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.040
or we could call it maybe the reflexive property

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.440
that an angle is clearly reflexive obviously equal to itself

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.710
even if we labeled it different way

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.270
this angle is going to be the same measure

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.410
And now we have something interesting going on,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.980
we have an angle, a side, and an angle

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.960
So, we end up having is that triangle so by angle-side-angle

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.710
we have the triangle BAF so our statement number 4

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.510
I'm running out of space right here I'll go down right here

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.020
Statement right here is triangle BAF triangle BAF

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.790
Let me kind of highlight it a little more blue right here

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.350
BAF so that's this entire triangle right over here

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.180
And half of the trick of some

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.250
of this problems is seeing the right triangle

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.910
So we started with this white angle we went through the side

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.150
that we knew then we went to this orange angle right over here

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.670
BBA I'm sorry we started at this angle

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.760
then we work to this orange angle across the side E that we know

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.280
is congruent to that side over there

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.140
And then we went to the side the aim of the vertex is not labeled

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.630
So at triangle BAF

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.900
we now know is going to be congruent Congruent to triangle

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.340
we start at the white angle

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.580
go to the orange angle then go to the unlabeled angle

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.470
It's going be congruent to angle to triangle CAF

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.240
So, this is kind of a messily drawn version

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.450
but you can get the idea

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.700
These two triangles are going to be congruent

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.460
C A sorry CAE I should say

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.320
is congruent to triangle CAE

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.730
White angle, orange angle, and then the unlabeled angle

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.920
on that triangle right over there

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.400
And this comes straight out of angle-side-angle

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.860
This comes straight out of ASA

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.090
and these are the two angles and so this is the side in between

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.550
so it comes out of the statements 1, 2, and 3

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.050
And so they're congruent, we know that corresponding sides are going

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.760
to be congruent so we know our statement 5

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.540
We should do this a little bit neater

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.900
Our statement 5, we now know that BF is equal to CE

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.080
BF is equal to CE

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.480
And this comes straight out of statement 4,

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.670
or we could say, corresponding sides,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.590
sides congruent, corresponding sides are congruent

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.430
Now let's take it up another notch

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.980
Let's see if we can prove whether ED is equal to EF

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.260
So let's just keep going down this and see if we can prove

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.850
whether ED is equal to EF

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.030
I put a question mark there

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.430
'cause we haven't necessarily proven it yet

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.130
So I'm gonna prove that this little short line segment EF is equal to DF

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:44.830
Sorry not EF is equal to DF, ED is equal to DF

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.670
So let's see if we can prove this right over here

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.460
So the interesting thing that

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.690
we might at first it might not be so obvious

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.920
You know, how do we figure out some type of congruency over that

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.930
but we do already have some information here

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.520
We know that BAF is congruent to CAE

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.950
So we also know that this side right over here

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.280
Let me do it with the color I haven't used yet

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.110
Let me see I have been using a lot of the colors in my pallet

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.400
so it's getting a little too

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.360
So we know from these two congruent triangles that side AE

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.630
Side AE which is part of CAE

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:26.870
We know that AE is going to be equal to AF

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.680
That these two sides are congruent and the reason why is

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.780
'cause they're corresponding sides of congruent triangles

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.320
AF is the side opposite the white angle on BAF triangle BAF

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.180
And AE is the side opposite the white angle on triangle CAE

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.340
which we know are congruent

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.990
So we know that AE is equal to AF

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.750
And once again this comes from statement 4

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.570
and we could even say corresponding sides congruent

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.250
Same reason as we gave right up here

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.770
Now, what's interesting here is you know

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.730
this isn't even a triangle that we're seeing up here

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.730
but this information that these two characters

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.090
are congruent help us with this part over here

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:18.850
Because we know that BA or as to say we know that AB is equal to AC

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.560
that was given and so we know that EB

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.910
Let me write it over here

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.400
and make it a little bit messy right over here

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.020
Statement 7 will give us will give us some space

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:36.280
we know that BE is going to be equal to CF

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.600
Let me write that down, we know that BE is equal to CF

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.200
And why do we know that let me put the reason right over here

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.970
Let me try to clean up my work a little bit

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.890
This column has been slowly drifting to the left

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.260
But how do we know that BE is equal to CF?

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:09.600
Well we know that the length of BE is equal to the length of BA minus AE

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.480
or I could just say AB I could that's how

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.560
I call it up here so it's equal to

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:22.670
AB minus AE is the same thing

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.460
based on these last few things that we saw

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:31.950
As saying AC minus AF cause AB is equal to AC so that's equal to AC

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.760
and AE we already showed as the same thing as AF

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:43.480
AC minus AF and AC minus AF is the same thing as CF right over here

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.610
is equal to CF right over there

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:52.230
And we know that because and we know this from statement 1,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:58.420
we know it from statement 5 and we know it from statement 6

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.740
Actually we didn't need we didn't need statement 5 there

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.770
Let me see we just need 1 and 6

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.180
So, let's say we need this is from 1 and 6 is what we had to do there

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.300
So, we just know that look this side is equal to that side

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.810
This little part is equal to that part

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.070
So if you subtract the big part minus the little part

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.920
This right over here is going to be equal to this right over here

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:17.820
So, that's all we're showing

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:23.000
So, this yellow side is equal to this yellow side right over here

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.530
Now the other thing that we know

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.930
And this is straight out of vertical angles is that this angle EDB

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.880
is going to be congruent to angle FDC

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.220
So let me write that down again

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:48.610
So 8, we know that angle EDB is going to be equal to angle FDC

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:55.230
That comes straight out of vertical angles are congruent

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.780
or their measures are equal

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.590
And now all of a sudden we have something interesting again

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.690
We have the Orange angle-white angle-side

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.340
So we know that these two smaller triangles are congruent

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.080
So, now we know I don't want to lose my diagram

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.490
We know that triangle BED, we know so statement number 9

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.660
we know that triangle BED is congruent

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:27.260
So, BED is this one we know that BED is congruent to triangle

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.570
Now we want to use the same sides white angle yellow side

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.550
then orange angle

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:37.580
White angle white angle let me be careful here, white angle

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.880
So B is white angle, E is the unlabeled angle,

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.770
and then D is the labeled angle the orange labeled angle

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.010
So, you want to start C unlabeled angle orange angle

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:53.400
so triangle CFD

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.580
And this comes straight from once again,

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.690
orange angle white angle side

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.040
So angle-angle-side orange sorry,

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.210
orange angle white angle side

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.680
So this come straight angle-angle-side congruency

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.750
And since we've now shown that this triangle is equal

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.100
to that triangle we know that their corresponding sides are equal

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.640
And then this is our homestretch

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.260
We now know since these two triangles are congruent

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:23.000
We now know that ED is equal to DF

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.390
because they're corresponding sides

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.560
And I could write that right over here ED is equal to DF

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.070
And once again the reason here is

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.650
the same thing up here corresponding

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.130
so we know our statement 9 which means they're congruent

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:44.650
And corresponding sides congruent and we are done

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.240
So that was a pretty involved problem

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.860
But you see once again you go step by step

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.290
just try to figure out each triangle and you eventually get it

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.710
But really the hard part isn't so much the realizing which postulate

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.410
to use or how to apply them necessarily

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.060
But seeing the triangle seeing that

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.390
there's some information there

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:06.900
Seeing that you could figure out BE by subtracting it from AE minus BE

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.350
Seeing that there are two triangles kind of overlapping in the star

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.250
or arms or whatever you might want to call it
