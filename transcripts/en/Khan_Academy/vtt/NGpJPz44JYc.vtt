00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.940
Where we left off, we had this
canister, because it had a

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.790
closed top and it had a vacuum
above the fluid.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:15.380
The fluid on top had an area
of A1, and I poked a little

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.490
hole with a super-small
area A2.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.800
I said that the area of
A2 is so small, it's

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.980
1/1,000 of area 1.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.330
Then we used the continuity
equation.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.040
We said the velocity, the rate
at which the surface is moving

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.510
up here, V1, times area 1, the
whole surface area of the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.800
liquid, has to be equal to the
output velocity, which we're

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.840
trying to figure out as a
function of everything else

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.580
times this output area.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.990
I made a mistake.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.820
I don't know if I did this in
the last video, or I did this

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.570
is in the mistake video.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.340
So we know that the initial top
velocity times this top

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.520
area is equal to the output
velocity times-- instead of

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:10.770
writing area 2, we could write
area 1 over 1,000.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.580
You can get rid of the area 1 on
both sides, and then you're

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.475
saying that the velocity up here
is equal to the rate at

00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:24.640
which the top of the surface
moves down and is equal to

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.580
1/1,000 of the velocity of the
liquid spurting out of this

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.460
little hole.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.160
With that, we actually have the
three variables for the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.540
left-hand side of Bernoulli's
equation.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.920
What are the variables on
the left-hand side?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.490
What is the pressure at this
point where we have a hole?

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.630
This is an important thin.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.770
When we talk about Bernoulli's--
let me rewrite

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.550
Bernoulli's equation.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:13.010
It's P1 plus rho gh1 plus rho V1
squared over 2 is equal to

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:23.650
P2 plus rho gh2 plus rho
V2 squared over 2.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.750
We figured out all of these
terms. Now let's figure out

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.660
the things that we have
to input here.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.080
What is the pressure
at point two?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.970
This is the important thing.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.170
You might want to say, and this
was my initial reaction,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.800
too, and that why I made a
mistake, is that what 's the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.250
pressure at this depth
in the fluid?

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.690
That's not what Bernoulli's
equation is telling us.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.330
Bernoulli's equation is telling
us actually what is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.743
the external pressure
at that hole.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.530
When we did the derivation, we
were saying how much work--

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.440
this was kind of the work
term, although we played

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.300
around with it a little bit.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.950
But if we look at the water
that's spurting out of the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:10.670
hole, it's not doing any work,
because it's not actually

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.720
exerting force against anything
so it's not actually

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.940
doing work.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.770
When we think about the
pressure, the output pressure,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.180
it's not the pressure at that
depth of the fluid.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.480
You should think of it as the
external pressure at the hole.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.340
In this case, there is no
external pressure at the hole.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.610
Let's say that if we closed
the hole, then

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.120
at that point, sure.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.870
The pressure would be the
pressure that's being exerted

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.750
by the outside of the canister
to contain the water, in which

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.200
case, we would end up
with no velocity.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.570
The water wouldn't
spurt anywhere.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.270
But now we're seeing the
external pressure is zero.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.480
That's what the hole essentially
creates.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.990
We're going to say that P2 is
zero, so this pressure was

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.850
zero, because we're
in a vacuum.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.440
P2 is also zero, so both
of these are zero.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.430
Remember, that's the
external pressure.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.180
P1 is the external pressure to
the input to the pipe, and you

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.670
can view this as a pipe.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:23.600
I could redraw it as a pipe that
looks like it has a big

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.770
hole on the top, and it goes
down to some level to a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.510
super-small hole like that.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.750
This would be a vacuum, and the
fluid is just going in and

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.260
it's spurting out of this end.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.090
Anyway, the pressure going into
the pipe is zero, and we

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.030
said since we put a hole, the
pressure coming out of the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.030
pipe is zero, so we're
doing no work.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.790
What is this term?

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.580
This was the potential energy
term, and we said that h1 is

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.980
equal to h.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.220
We're saying that this is zero
height, so now this simplifies

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:04.620
to rho times gravity times h
plus rho times V1 squared.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:12.370
V1, we said, is equal to this,
so this is rho over 2 times V2

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.170
over 1,000 squared.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.490
I just substituted V2
over 1,000 for V1.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.570
That equals the pressure at
the hole, the external

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:30.390
pressure at the hole, which
is zero, plus h2.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.720
This is h2 right here, which
we said is zero.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.870
We determined that the hole was
poked at height zero, so

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.940
this is also zero.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.370
That equals this kinetic
energy-like term.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.150
It's not exactly
kinetic energy.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:51.710
It's rho times V squared
divided by 2.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.080
One thing that we can
immediately see is that we

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.860
have all these rhos on both
sides of the equation, so we

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.560
can divide both sides by rho and
get rid of all of those.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.050
Then we can multiply both sides
of the equation by 2,

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:17.500
and we get 2gh plus V2 squared
over-- what's 1,000 squared--

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.750
over 1 million.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.840
That is equal to V2 squared.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.050
We could do the exact thing.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.700
We could subtract 1 over 1
million V2 squared from both

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.510
sides, and we would get 0.999999
V2 squared, but let's

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.970
just say for the sake of
simplicity, or let's say, if

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.430
this wasn't 1,000, but 1
million, and that this surface

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.780
was much bigger, we see that
this term becomes very, very,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.090
very small.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.980
If that hole is one millionth
of the surface area, then it

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.250
becomes really insignificant,
so we can ignore this term

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.200
because it just makes things
complicated, and we're

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.290
assuming this is a really,
really large number, and that

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:10.130
this hole is much smaller than
the surface area of the fluid.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.910
This is like poking a
hole in Hoover Dam.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.290
Hoover Dam is backing up this
huge lake, and you poke a hole

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.940
in it, so that hole is going to
be this very small fraction

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.160
of the surface area
of the fluid.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.490
You can only make this
assumption when that output

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.090
hole is much smaller than
the input hole.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.770
With that said, what is
the output velocity?

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.130
The velocity-- you just take
the square root of both

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:36.390
sides-- is the square
root of 2gh.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.610
That is the output velocity.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:47.330
What is the amount of liquid
that flows out per second?

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.470
We figured that out already.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:54.300
It's a column of fluid that
comes out, so per second, the

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.930
length of the column of fluid
will be the velocity times

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.600
time, and then the cross-section
of that column

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.010
is equal to the output area.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.720
If I wanted to know the flow
coming out, the flow coming

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.740
out or the flux coming out would
be equal to the hole's

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.670
area times the hole's
output velocity.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:24.420
That would equal the area times
the square root of 2gh.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.430
We could use that actually solve
problems in the future

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.850
if we had actual numbers.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.539
I only have a minute
and a half left.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:34.620
I'll see you in the
next video.
