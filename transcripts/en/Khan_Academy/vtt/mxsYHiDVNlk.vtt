00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.480
Welcome.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.160
Well there's been a lot of news
lately about what's going

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.850
on with Bear Stearns and
Carlisle Capital.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.080
And I go to these parties, and
I start explaining to people

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.000
because it's very exciting.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.520
It's actually very important,
to all of our collective

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.890
futures and the whole health of
the financial system, and I

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.790
feel like people's eyes
start to glaze over.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.330
So with that in mind, I decided
to take a little bit

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.820
of a hiatus from the core math
and physics videos, and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.250
actually do some accounting
and finance videos.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.700
Because I think what's happening
in the world right

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.560
now is extremely important.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.090
And I'm not just going to go
straight into what's going

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.770
into Carlisle and Thornburg and
all of these characters.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.900
Because I think the newspapers
do that, but a lot of people

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.650
don't understand the
basic accounting.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.490
What is a write-down, what does
it mean when you don't

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.630
have liquidity, in really
tangible ways.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.500
So I'm going to use the same
Khan Academy techniques to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.130
hopefully explain
some of this.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.080
So I'm going to start with just
a very basic accounting

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.470
concept of the balance sheet.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.210
You might have a sense
of what it is.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.980
So let's say a scenario.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.060
Let's say I want
to buy a house.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.780
So this is, let me
draw a house.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.650
So let's say this is the
house I want to buy.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.540
And the owner of this house
is asking for $1

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.790
million for this house.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.420
And I like the house, and I
think that's a fair price.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.092
Other houses in the neighborhood
also went for $1

00:01:13.092 --> 00:01:14.180
million, whatever.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.230
Maybe they went for more,
so I think it's

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.620
actually a good deal.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:30.320
But all I have in my pocket is,
let's say I have $250,000.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.680
So what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to create my balance

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.520
sheet before I do anything.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.720
Before I go to try
to get the house.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.170
What is my before-house
balance sheet?

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.290
What are my assets?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.540
I'm going to write
down Assets.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.700
Well before we know what my
assets are, let me tell you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.510
what an asset is.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.040
An asset is something that's
going to give you some future

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.200
economic benefit.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.250
So for example, cash
is an asset.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.220
Why is cash an asset?

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.720
Because in the future you can
use that cash to get stuff

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.170
from people, or make them
do things, or buy stuff.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.570
You can, in a month from now,
you can use your cash.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.620
And you can make someone
dance for you.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.290
Or you can buy a car, or
you can go on vacation.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.430
So there's all sorts of
things you can do.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.010
I don't know if someone dancing
for you is an actual

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.260
economic benefit, but
you get the idea.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.820
So cash could be an asset.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.020
A house could be an asset,
because the economic benefit

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.730
you get in the future is, you
get to live in it, and not

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.190
freeze when it's freezing
outside.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.690
So that's what an asset is.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.760
So what are my assets, before
I buy the house, or get a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.650
loan, or all of the things
that are about to happen?

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.550
Well I have cash, I have
$250,000 worth of cash.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.000
What are my liabilities?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.980
I'm going to write the
liabilities on

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.470
the left-hand side.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.180
I think that's the convention,
but I forget.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.460
It doesn't matter.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.270
What are my liabilities?

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.320
Well, a liability is something
that's an economic obligation

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.270
to someone else.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.370
So if I take a loan from
someone, I owe them interest,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.610
or I have to pay them back
the actual value of

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.790
the loan one day.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.990
Say I have an IOU where I
promise to dance for someone

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.880
in the future.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.250
That could be a liability.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.140
It'd be hard to value, but
that's something that I have

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.550
to do in the future.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.690
But what are my liabilities
here?

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.420
Well in the example I gave, I'm
just Sal, I have no debt,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.860
I paid off my college
loans, everything.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.850
And I have $250,000 in cash.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.440
So what are my liabilities
before I buy the house?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.290
Well, nothing.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.810
I don't have any liabilities.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.260
I don't owe anybody anything.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.320
And that's, actually,
that to me is the

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.360
definition of freedom.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.580
So I have zero liability.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.630
So what is my equity?

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.630
And you've probably heard this
word, people borrowing their

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.010
equity, and all of
these things.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.510
So I'm going to give you a
little equation, actually,

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.340
just to take a little
bit of a tangent.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.020
That assets, A for assets,
is equal to

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.900
liabilities plus equity.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.890
So in this case, our assets
are $250,000.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.810
My liabilities are what?

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.130
I owe nothing to nobody.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.510
I don't know if that was
correct, but anyway.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.200
I owe nothing to anyone.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.270
So my liabilities are zero.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:23.000
So my equity must be $250,000.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.450
So in this case, if I made a
balance sheet before I enter

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.430
into any transactions -- let me
make it look a little bit

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.380
like a balance sheet.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.100
My assets are $250,000.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.630
I have no liabilities.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.610
And then my equity would
be $250,000.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.380
And if I were to draw this
graphically-- actually, I

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.210
should probably draw
it like this.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.770
I have no liabilities.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.180
So let me draw another little
mini balance sheet here.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.700
That's a neat square.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.200
You probably can't
see that square.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.270
So I put my assets on
the right-hand side.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.370
And I'll say, there, I have
$250,000 of cash.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.100
And on the left-hand side,
I have no liabilities.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.520
And I'll just say I have equity,
I have $250,000.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.510
Now, equity might not make a lot
of sense to you right now,

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.010
because I'm just saying, well,
my equity is equal to my cash.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.060
in general, equity is
just what you own.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.890
After all of your assets and
liabilities are kind of

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.190
resolved, or they're
cleared up, what do

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.410
you have left over?

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.270
That's equity.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.020
So in this situation, after I
pay off all of my debts, what

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.860
do I have left over?

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.080
Well I have no debts, so I have
$250,000 in cash, total.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.020
This will start to make sense
when I go to the bank now to

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.060
get a loan to buy this house.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.190
So this house is a $1 million
house, right?

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.770
So how much of a
loan do I need?

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.780
Well, I have $250,000 cash, so
I'll go to the bank for a loan

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.490
for the remainder,
for $750,000.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.650
So let me draw the bank.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.650
This is the bank.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.610
The big dollar sign is made out
of granite, to show you

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.690
that it can never fail.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.700
It's going to be there forever,
even if they do silly

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.890
things, like-- well I won't go
into all the silly things that

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.410
they do, but they do
many silly things.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.570
We'll go into that later.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:12.380
But the bank is going to give
me another $750,000 in cash.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.700
And in return, I'm giving
them essentially an IOU.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.090
And I'm going to pay interest.
So they're going to hold this

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.960
little security that says,
Sal owes me $750,000.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.290
And he has to give me 10%
interest every year.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.570
So $75,000 a year, or
something like that.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.280
And in return I get
$750,000 in cash.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.870
So what does my balance
sheet look like now?

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.780
Well, let me draw it.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.130
Let me make sure my balance
sheet now looks, let me draw

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.680
it like a square, because
I think the visual

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:51.000
representation is helpful,
and then I will split it.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.060
So what are all my assets now?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.010
I had $250,000 and
I got another

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.260
$750,000 from the bank.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.480
So now, what are my assets?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.740
Well, $250,000 plus $750,000.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.530
I now have cash of $1 million.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.820
What are my liabilities?

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.460
Well, my liability, that's
something that I owe to

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.000
someone else.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.700
I owe the bank $750,000.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.125
So liabilities, I'll just say L,
L for liabilities, because

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:23.560
I'm running out of space.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.240
My wife was complaining that I
make these things very hard to

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.060
read, but what can I do.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.390
Anyway.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.130
So my liabilities-- I owe
the bank $750,000.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.700
So that's a liability.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.140
And then the equity is,
essentially-- we would look at

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.890
this formula.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.480
Assets equal liabilities
plus equity.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.170
This is $1 million,
this is $750,000.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.500
What do I have left over?

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.670
Well, I have $250,000
left over.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.970
That's my equity.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.820
And I think hopefully the
concept of equity is starting

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.300
to make a little more sense.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.320
Now we have-- I could say that
I have $1 million, and some

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.120
people are like that.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.760
They think they're millionaires
when they have $1

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.000
million in assets.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.580
But they don't consider, well
they might have $1 million of

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.050
assets, but they might owe
other people $900,000.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.040
So I wouldn't consider that
person a millionaire.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.690
They're more of a hundred
thousand-aire.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.140
Your assets might be $1 million,
but you're not nearly

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.620
a millionaire, because
you still owe

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.810
other people $750,000.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.490
What you have left over, that
really is your net worth, or

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.220
what you can have claim to.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.190
And that's your equity.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.810
Sometimes it's called
owners' equity.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.676
Or if there was a bunch of
people pitching together, it

00:08:27.676 --> 00:08:29.030
would be called shareholders'
equity.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.960
And maybe I'll do a little bit
more on that in the future.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.760
But hopefully now you can see
that the balance sheet is

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.330
starting to seem a little
bit useful.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.620
I have the cash, and I took the
loan from the bank, but

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.410
now I still haven't bought
the house yet.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.430
So what am I going to do?

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.490
Well I'm going to give my cash
to the old owner of the house.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.450
Or maybe this Toll Brothers,
they just built this

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.960
McMansion for me.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.060
So I give them $1 million, and
in return they give me the

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.140
deed to the house.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.140
I could just say they
give me the house.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.270
The house is always there, but
you know it's really just a

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.440
contract and all the legal
structure that I get around

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.500
it, and all the property
rights and all of that.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.910
But that's getting too
philosophical.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.390
So now what does my balance
sheet look like?

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.530
Instead of cash-- I think I'm
running out of space and time

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.850
to draw another balance sheet--
I don't have cash

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.460
worth $1 million.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.740
I now have a house
worth $1 million.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.200
Assuming that it really is worth
it, and that was the

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.420
correct price, I didn't
overpay, whatever.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.120
I now have, my assets are
a $1 million house.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.500
And I owe the bank $750,000.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:39.000
So what's left over for me
is $250,000 of equity.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.260
I'm about to run out of time.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.280
So I'm going to leave
you from this video.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.830
In the next video, I'm going
to start explaining what

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.330
happens if the value of the
house goes up or down, or you

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.420
need cash, and all of these
interesting things.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.240
And we'll start to learn a
little bit more about what's

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.210
going on in the world.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.640
See you soon.
