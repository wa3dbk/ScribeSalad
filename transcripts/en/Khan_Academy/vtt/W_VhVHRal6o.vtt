00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.090
We're asked to divide 99.061,
or 99 and 61/1000, by 100.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.470
And there's a few ways to do it.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.420
But what I want to
do in this video

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.760
is focus on kind of a faster
way to think about it.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.343
And hopefully it'll
make sense to you.

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:16.990
And that's also the focus of
it, that it makes sense to you.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.170
So 99, let's just think
about it a little bit.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.570
So if we-- so 99.061.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.000
So if we were to
divide this by 10, just

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.550
to make the point clear, if
we were to divide this by 10,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.920
what would we get?

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.210
Well, we would essentially
move the decimal place one spot

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.570
to the left.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.690
And it should make sense because
we have a little over 99.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.940
If you took 99
divided by 10, you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.990
should have a little over 9.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.550
So essentially, you would
move the decimal place one

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.760
to the left when
you divide by 10.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.710
So this would be
equal to 9.9061.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.150
If you were to divide it
by 100, which is actually

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.269
the focus of this problem, so
if we divide 99.061 divided

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.270
by 100, if we move the decimal
place once to the left,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.210
we're dividing by 10.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.470
To divide it by 100, we
have to divide by 10 again.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.760
So we move it over twice.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.980
So one, two times.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.790
And so now the decimal place
is out in front of that first

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.250
leading 9, which also
should make sense.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.440
99 is almost 100, or a
little bit less than 100.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.420
So if you divide it
by 100, we should

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.830
be a little bit less than 1.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.640
And so if you move the
decimal place two places over

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.050
to the left, because we're
really dividing by 10 twice,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.640
if you want to think
of it that way,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.870
we will get the decimal in
front of the 99-- 0.99061.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.120
We should put a zero out here.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.340
Just sometimes it
clarifies things.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.100
So then we get this
right over here.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.996
Now, one way to think
about it, although I do

00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:54.620
want you to always imagine that
when you move the decimal place

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.515
over to the left, you really are
dividing by 10 when you move it

00:01:57.515 --> 00:01:58.130
to the left.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.070
When you move it to the right,
you're multiplying by 10.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.200
Sometimes people
say, hey, look, you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.300
could just count the
number of zeroes.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.156
And if you're dividing, so over
here, you were dividing by 100.

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:13.990
100 has two zeroes, and
we're dividing by it,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.100
so we could move our decimal
two spaces to the left.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.300
That's all right to do
that, especially it's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.730
kind of a fast way to do it.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.200
If this had 20 zeroes,
you would immediately

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.700
say, OK, let's move the
decimal 20 places to the left.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.650
But I really want you to think
about why that's working,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.080
why that makes sense,
why it's giving you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.430
a number that seems to be the
right kind of size number,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.710
why it makes sense that if
you take something that's

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.580
almost 100 and
divide by 100, you'll

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.140
get something that's almost 1.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.880
And that part, frankly, is just
a really good reality check

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.440
to make sure you're going
in the right direction

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.170
with the decimal.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.980
Because if you tried
this 5, 10 years

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.406
from now, maybe your
memory of the rule

00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:58.280
or whatever you want to
call it for doing it,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.113
you're like hey, wait,
do I move the decimal

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:01.162
to the left or the right?

00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:03.620
It's really good to do that
reality check to say, OK, look,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.120
If I'm dividing by 100, I should
be getting a smaller value

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940
and moving the
decimal to the left

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.620
gives me that smaller value.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.602
If I was multiplying by 100,
I should get a larger value.

00:03:13.602 --> 00:03:15.060
And moving the
decimal to the right

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.860
would give you
that larger value.
