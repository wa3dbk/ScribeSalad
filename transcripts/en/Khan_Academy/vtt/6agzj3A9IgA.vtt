00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.670
Use completing the square
to find the roots of the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.870
quadratic equation right here.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.830
And when anyone talks about
roots, this just means find

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.270
the x's where y is equal to 0.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.940
That's what a root is.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.270
A root is an x value that will
make this quadratic function

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.650
equal 0, that will
make y equal 0.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.205
So to find the x's, let's
just make y equal 0 and

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:31.150
then solve for x.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:39.310
So we get 0 is equal to 4x
squared plus 40x, plus 280.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.240
Now, the first step that we
might want to do, just because

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.430
it looks like all three of these
terms are divisible by

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.810
4, is just divide both sides
of this equation by 4.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.970
That'll make our math a
little bit simpler.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.800
So let's just divide everything
by 4 here.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.300
If we just divide everything by
4, we get 0 is equal to x

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:12.160
squared plus 10x, plus-- 280
divided by 4 is 70-- plus 70.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.320
Now, they say use completing the
square, and actually, let

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.700
me write that 70 a little bit
further out, and you'll see

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.820
why I did that in a second.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.110
So let me just write a plus 70
over here, just to have kind

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.280
of an awkward space here.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.690
And you'll see what I'm about
to do with this space, that

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.160
has everything to do with
completing the square.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.330
So they say use completing the
square, which means, turn

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.410
this, if you can, into
a perfect square.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.470
Turn at least part of this
expression into a perfect

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.650
square, and then we can use that
to actually solve for x.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.960
So how do we turn this into
a perfect square?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.280
Well, we have a 10x here.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.440
And we know that we can turn
this into a perfect square

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.050
trinomial if we take 1/2 of the
10, which is 5, and then

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.300
we square that.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.880
So 1/2 of 10 is 5, you square
it, you add a 25.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.130
Now, you can't just willy-nilly
add a 25 to one

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.540
side of the equation without
doing something to the other,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.780
or without just subtracting
the 25 right here.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.160
Right?

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.640
Think about it, I have not
changed the equation.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.280
I've added 25 and I've
subtracted 25.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.889
So I've added nothing to
the right-hand side.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.260
I could add a billion and
subtract a billion and not

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.160
change the equation.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.610
So I have not changed the
equation at all right here.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.880
But what I have done is I've
made it possible to express

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.130
these three terms as
a perfect square.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.460
That right there,
2 times 5 is 10.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.830
5 squared is 25.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.580
So that is x plus 5 squared.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.880
And if you don't believe
me, multiply it out.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.250
You're going to have an x
squared plus 5x, plus 5x,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.650
which will give you 10x, plus
5 squared, which is 25.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.290
So those first three terms
become that, and then the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.670
second two terms, right there,
you just add them.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.870
Let's see, negative
25 plus 70.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.560
Let's see, negative 20 plus 70
would be positive 50, and then

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.680
you have another 5,
so it's plus 45.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.730
So we've just algebraically
manipulated this equation.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.460
And we get 0 is equal to x
plus 5 squared, plus 45.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.810
Now, we could've, from the
beginning if we wanted, we

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.920
could've tried to factor it.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.970
But what we're going to do here,
this will always work.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.360
Even if you have crazy decimal
numbers here, you can solve

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.810
for x using the method
we're doing here,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.420
completing the square.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.590
So to solve for x, let's just
subtract 45 from both sides of

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.840
this equation.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.330
And so the left-hand side of
this equation becomes negative

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.730
45, and the right-hand
side will be just

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.260
the x plus 5 squared.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.570
These guys, right here,
cancel out.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.250
Now, normally if I look at
something like this I'll say,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.280
OK, let's just take the
square root of both

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.670
sides of this equation.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.000
And so you might be tempted to
take the square root of both

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.500
sides of this equation, but
immediately when you do that,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.950
you'll notice something
strange.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.800
We're trying to take
the square root

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.760
of a negative number.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.180
And if we're dealing with real
numbers, which is everything

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.890
we've dealt with so far, you
can't take a square root of a

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.460
negative number.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.380
There is no real number that if
you square it will give you

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.040
a negative number.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.740
So it's not possible-- I don't
care what you make x-- it is

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.690
not possible to add x to
5 and square it, and

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.820
get a negative number.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:33.680
So there is no x that can
satisfy-- if we assume that is

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.450
x is a real number-- that can
satisfy this equation.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.200
Because I don't care what x you
put here, what real x you

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.920
put here, you add 5 to it, you
square it, there's no way

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.210
you're going to get
a negative number.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.000
So there's no x that can satisfy
this equation, so we

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.260
could say there are no-- and
I'm using the word real

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.280
because in Algebra 2 you'll
learn that there are things

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.310
called complex numbers, but
don't worry about that right

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:08.236
now-- but there no real roots
to the quadratic equation.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.340
And we're done.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.070
And actually, if you had tried
to factor it, you would have

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.950
found it very difficult,
because this is not a

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.530
factorable expression right
here, and you know it because

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.680
there's no real roots.
