00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.070
Let's see if we can use our
knowledge of Green's theorem

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.200
to solve some actual
line integrals.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.950
And actually, before I show an
example, I want to make one

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.960
clarification on
Green's theorem.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.310
All of the examples that I did
is I had a region like this,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.970
and the inside of the region
was to the left of

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.820
what we traversed.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.940
So all my examples I went
counterclockwise and so our

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.800
region was to the left of-- if
you imagined walking along the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.120
path in that direction, it
was always to our left.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.910
And that's the situation which
Green's theorem would apply.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.880
So if you were to take a line
integral along this path, a

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.010
closed line integral, maybe we
could even specify

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.520
it like that.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.900
You'll see that in some
textbooks-- along the curve c

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:50.620
of f dot dr. This is what
equals the double integral over

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:58.680
this region r of the partial of
q with respect to x minus

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.670
the partial of p with
respect to y d area.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.520
And just as reminder, now this
q and p are coming from the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.430
components of f in
the situation.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.600
f would be written as f of xy
is equal to P of xy time the i

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.290
component plus Q of xy
times the j component.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.010
So this is a situation where
the inside of the region is

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.180
to the left of the direction
that we're taking the path.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.200
If it was in the reverse,
then we would put a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.550
minus sign right here.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.110
If this arrow went the other
way, we'd put a minus sign and

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.730
we can do that because we know
that when we're taking line

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.540
integrals through vector
fields, if we were reverse

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.500
the direction it becomes
the negative of that.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.370
We showed that, I think,
4 or 5 videos ago.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.320
With that said, it was
convenient to write

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.590
Green's theorem up here.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.060
Let's actually solve a problem.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.820
Let's say I have the line
integral and let's say

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.140
we're over a curve.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.845
I'll define the
curve in a second.

00:01:58.845 --> 00:02:01.540
But let's say that the integral
we're trying to solve is x

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:13.230
squared minus y squared
dx plus 2xy dy.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.870
And then our curve-- they're
giving us the boundary.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.430
The boundary is the region.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.420
I'll do it in a
different color.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:37.820
So the curve is boundary of the
region given by all of the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.710
points x,y such that x is a
greater than or equal to 0,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.590
less than or equal to 1.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.210
And then y is greater than
or equal to 2x squared and

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.700
less than or equal to 2x.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.520
So let's draw this region that
we're dealing with right now.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.450
So let me draw my x-axis
or my y-axis, sorry.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.210
My y-axis and then my
x-axis right there.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.360
And let's see. x goes from
0 to 1, so if we make--

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.910
that's obviously 0.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.950
Let's say that that is x
is equal to 1, so that's

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.600
all the x values.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.640
And y varies, it's above
2x squared and below 2x.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.120
Normally, if you get to large
enough numbers, 2x squared is

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.530
larger, but if you're below 1
this is actually going to

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.660
be smaller than that.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.880
So the upper boundary is
2x, so there's 1 comma 2.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.240
This is a line y is equal to
2x, so that is the line y is--

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.770
let me draw a straighter
line than that.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.270
The line y is equal to 2x
looks something like that.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.060
That right there is
y is equal to 2x.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.710
Maybe I'll do that in yellow.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.520
And then the bottom curve right
here is y is going to be

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.110
greater than 2x squared.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.250
It might look
something like this.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.830
And of course, the region that
they're talking about is this,

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.620
but we're saying that the curve
is the boundary of this region

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.200
and we're going to go in I
counterclockwise direction.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.300
I have to specify that.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.400
So our curve, we could start at
any point really, but we're

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.900
going to go like that.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.740
Then get to that point and then
come back down along that

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.950
top curve just like that.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.090
And so this met the condition
that the inside of the region

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.340
is always going to be our left,
so we can just do the straight

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.660
up Green's theorem, we don't
have to do the negative of it.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.140
And let's define our region.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.530
Let's just do our region.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.820
This integral right here is
going to go-- I'll just do it

00:04:46.820 --> 00:05:01.940
the way-- y varies from y is
equal to 2x squared to

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.290
2y is equal to 2x.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.380
And so maybe we'll integrate
with respect to y first.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.245
And then x, I'll
do the outside.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.780
The boundary of x
goes from 0 to 1.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.940
So they set us up well to
do an indefinite integral.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.930
Now we just have to figure
out what goes over

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.490
here-- Green's theorem.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.660
Our f would look like
this in this situation.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:37.300
f is f of xy is going to be
equal to x squared minus

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.940
y squared i plus 2xy j.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.190
We've seen this in
multiple videos.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.090
You take the dot product of
this with dr, you're going to

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.250
get this thing right here.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.690
So this expression right
here is our P of x y.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.070
And this expression right
here is our Q of xy.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.060
So inside of here we're just
going to apply Green's

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.320
theorem straight up.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:12.080
So the partial of Q with
respect to x-- so take

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.240
the derivative of this
with respect to x.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.390
We're just going to
end up with the 2y.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.270
And then from that we're going
to subtract the partial

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.750
of P with respect to y.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.300
So if you take the derivative
of this with respect to y that

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.260
becomes 0 and then, here you
have-- the derivative with

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.900
respect to y here is minus 2y.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.900
Just like that.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.360
And so this simplifies
to 2y minus minus 2y.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.470
That's 2y plus plus 2y.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.950
I'm just subtracting
a negative.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.190
Or this inside, and just
to save space, this

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.890
inside-- that's just 4y.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.320
I don't want to have to
rewrite the boundaries.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.940
That right there is
the same thing as 4y.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.310
The partial of Q with respect
to y, 2y minus the partial

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.860
of P with respect to y.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.680
Which is minus 2y.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.510
You subtract a negative
you get a positive.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.500
You have 4y.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.780
Let's take the antiderivative
of the inside with respect

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.350
to y and we're going
to get 2y squared.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.410
Let me do it a
little bit lower.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.620
We're going to get 2y squared
if you take the partial with

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.100
respect to y you're
going to get 4y.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:42.000
We're going to evaluate that
from y is equal to 2x squared

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.550
to y is equal to 2x.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.150
And then of course, we
still have the outside

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.632
integral still there.

00:07:47.632 --> 00:07:51.520
x goes from 0 to 1 dx.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.000
This thing is going to be equal
to the integral from 0 to 1 and

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.750
then we evaluate
it first at 2x.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:04.100
So you put a 2x in here,
2x squared is 4x squared.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.960
2 squared, x squared, so
4x squared times 2 is

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.500
going to be 8x squared.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.790
Minus-- put this guy in there.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:19.600
2x squared squared is
2x to the fourth.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:26.130
4x to the fourth times
2 is 8x to the fourth.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.210
Did I do that right?

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.350
2x squared-- going to
put it there for y,

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.690
substitute y with it.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.760
That squared is 4
X to the fourth.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.430
Times 2 is 8x x to the fourth.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.040
Very good.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.770
All right.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.550
Now dx.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.850
Now this is just a
straightforward

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.600
one-dimensional integral.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.400
This is going to be equal
to-- I'll just do it here.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.720
This is going to be equal to
the antiderivative of 8x

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.485
squared is 8/3 x to the third.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.740
And then the antiderivative
of 8x to the fourth is

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:03.950
minus 8/5 x to the fifth.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.503
Then we're going to have to
evaluate that from 0 to 1, or

00:09:07.503 --> 00:09:09.590
we can put a little line there.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.195
When you put 1 in there
you get-- I'll do it

00:09:12.195 --> 00:09:13.450
in a different color.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.890
We get 8/5 times 1 to
the third, which is 8/5

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:22.550
minus 8/5 minus 8/5.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.335
And then we're going to have
minus-- when you put 0 in

00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:27.490
here you're just going
to get a bunch of 0's.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.170
Oh sorry, I made a mistake.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.210
It would have been a blunder.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:31.760
It's 8/3.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.640
8/3 times 1 to the third minus
8/5 times 1 to the fifth,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.780
so that's minus 8/5.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.705
And then, when you subtract the
0, you evaluate 0 here. you're

00:09:44.705 --> 00:09:45.850
just going to get a bunch of
0's so you don't have

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:46.670
to do anything else.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.470
So now we just have to
subtract these two fractions.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.990
So let's get a common
denominator of 15.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.540
8/3 is the same thing if
we multiply the numerator

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.690
and denominator by 5.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.820
That is 40/15.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.020
And then if we multiply this
numerator and denominator by

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.320
3, that's going to be 24/15.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:15.710
So minus 24/15 and we get
it being equal to 16/15.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:22.390
And so using Green's theorem we
were able to find the answer

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.100
to this integral up here.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.780
It's equal to 16/15.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.960
Hopefully you found
that useful.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.790
I'll do one more example
in the next video.
