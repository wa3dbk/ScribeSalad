00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.070
We've gone over the
general idea

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.610
behind mitosis and meiosis.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.820
It's a good idea in
this video to go a

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.730
little bit more in detail.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.230
I've already done a video on
mitosis, and in this one,

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.130
we'll go into the details
of meiosis.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.710
Just as a review, mitosis, you
start with a diploid cell, and

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.270
you end up with two
diploid cells.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.050
Essentially, it just
duplicates itself.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.540
And formally, mitosis is really
the process of the

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.810
duplication of the nucleus, but
it normally ends up with

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.350
two entire cells.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.119
Cytokinesis takes place.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.880
So this is mitosis.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.020
We have a video on it where we
go into the phases of it:

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.290
prophase, metaphase, anaphase
and telophase.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.800
Mitosis occurs in pretty much
all of our somatic cells as

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.810
our skin cells replicate, and
our hair cells and all the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.080
tissue in our body as it
duplicates itself, it goes

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.180
through mitosis.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.970
Meiosis occurs in the germ
cells and it's used

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.960
essentially to produce gametes
to facilitate sexual

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.630
reproduction.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.020
So if I start off with a diploid
cell, and that's my

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.560
diploid cell right there, this
would be a germ cell.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.710
It's not just any cell
in the body.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.670
It's a germ cell.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.870
It could undergo mitosis to
produce more germ cells, but

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.780
we'll talk about how it
produces the gametes.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.420
It actually goes under
two rounds.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.960
They're combined, called
meiosis, but the first round

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.670
you could call it meiosis
1, so I'll call that M1.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.840
I'm not talking about the
money supply here.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.170
And in the first round of
meiosis, this diploid cell

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.270
essentially splits into
two haploid cells.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.190
So if you started off with 43
chromosomes, formally have 23

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.110
chromosomes in each one, or you
can almost view it if you

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.240
have 23 pairs here, each have
two chromosomes, those pairs

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.930
get split into this stage.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.850
And then in meiosis 2, these
things get split in a

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.050
mechanism very similar
to mitosis.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.010
We'll see that when we actually

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.900
go through the phases.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.160
In fact, the prophase,
metaphase, anaphase, telophase

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.795
also exist in each of these
phases of meiosis.

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:22.100
So let me just draw
the end product.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.490
The end product is you have four
cells and each of them

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.740
are haploid.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.520
And you could already see, this
process right here, you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.260
essentially split up your
chromosomes, because you end

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.790
up with half in each one, but
here, you start with N and you

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.180
end up with two chromosomes that
each have N, so it's very

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.760
similar to this.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.380
You preserve the number
of chromosomes.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.390
So let's delve into the details
of how it all happens.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.290
So all cells spend most of
their time in interphase.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.910
Interphase is just a time when
the cell is living and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.770
transcribing and doing
what it needs to do.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.030
But just like in mitosis, one
key thing does happen during

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.980
the interphase, and actually,
it happens during the same

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.390
thing, the S phase of
the interphase.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.370
So if that's my cell, that's
my nucleus right here.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.580
And I'm going to draw it as
chromosomes, but you have to

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.430
remember that when we're outside
of mitosis or meiosis

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.340
formally, the chromosomes are
all unwound, and they exist as

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.440
chromatin, which we've
talked about before.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.200
It's kind of the unwound
state of the DNA.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.950
But I'm going to draw them wound
up because I need to

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.050
show you that they replicate.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.750
Now, I'm going to be a
little careful here.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.290
In the mitosis video, I just
had two chromosomes.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.350
They replicated and then
they split apart.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.920
When we talk about meiosis, we
have to be careful to show the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.670
homologous pairs.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.100
So let's say that I have
two homologous pairs.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.100
So let's say I have-- let me do
it in appropriate colors.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.800
So this is the one I
got from my dad.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.660
This is the one I
got from my mom.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.470
They're homologous.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.140
And let's say that I have
another one that

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.390
I got from my dad.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.770
Let me do it in blue.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.625
Actually, maybe I should do all
the ones from my dad in

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.900
this color.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.570
Maybe it's a little
bit longer.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.660
You get the idea.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.269
And then a homologous one for
my mom that's also a little

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.589
bit longer.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:22.019
Now, during the S phase of the
interphase-- and this is just

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.700
like what happens in mitosis,
so you can almost view it as

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.490
it always happens during
interphase.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.810
It doesn't happen in either
meiosis or mitosis.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.650
You have replication
of your DNA.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.760
So each of these from the
homologous pair-- and

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.270
remember, homologous pairs
mean that they're not

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.900
identical chromosomes,
but they do code

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.040
for the same genes.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.750
They might have different
versions or different alleles

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.430
for a gene or for a certain
trait, but they code

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.500
essentially for the same
kind of stuff.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.870
Now, replication of these, so
each of these chromosomes in

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.580
this pair replicate.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.690
So that one from my dad
replicates like this, it

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.690
replicates and it's connected
by a centromere, and the one

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.710
from my mom replicates like
that, and it's connected by a

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.010
centromere like that, and then
the other one does as well.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.010
That's the shorter one.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.260
Oh, that's the longer
one, actually.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.110
That's the longer one.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.220
I should be a little bit more
explicit in which one's

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.180
shorter and longer.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.980
The one from my mom does
the same thing.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.720
This is in the S phase
of interphase.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.830
We haven't entered the actual
cell division yet.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.320
And the same thing is true-- and
this is kind of a little

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.830
bit of a sideshow-- of
the centrosomes.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.380
And we saw in the mitosis video
that these are involved

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.230
in kind of eventually creating
the microtubule structure in

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.560
pulling everything apart, but
you'll have one centrosome

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.450
that's hanging out here, and
then it facilitates its own

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.140
replication, so then you
have two centrosomes.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.380
So this is all occurring
in the interphase, and

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.490
particularly in the S part
of the interphase,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.950
not the growth part.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.040
But once that's happens, we're
ready-- in fact, we're ready

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.405
for either mitosis or meiosis,
but we're going

00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:03.280
to do meiosis now.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.990
This is a germ cell.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.120
So what happens is we enter
into prophase I.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.360
So if you remember, in my-- let
me write this down because

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.550
I think it's important.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:22.930
In mitosis you have prophase,
metaphase,

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.720
anaphase and telophase.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.420
I won't keep writing
phase down.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.940
PMAT.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.420
In meiosis, you experience these
in each stage, so you

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.320
have to prophase I, followed
by metaphase I, followed by

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.010
anaphase I, followed
by telophase I.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.720
Then after you've done meiosis
1, then it all happens again.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.790
You have prophase II, followed
by metaphase II, followed by

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.490
anaphase II, followed
by telophase.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.050
So if you really just want to
memorize the names, which you

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.670
unfortunately have to do in
this, especially if you're

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.830
going to get tested on it,
although it's not that

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.990
important to kind of understand
the concept of

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.410
what's happening, you just have
to remember prophase,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.270
metaphase, anaphase, telophase,
and it'll really

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.150
cover everything.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.480
You just after memorize in
meiosis, it's happening twice.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.370
And what's happening is a little
bit different, and

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.930
that's what I really want
to focus on here.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.260
So let's enter prophase
I of meiosis I.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:23.590
So let me call this
prophase I.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.210
So what's going to happen?

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.250
So just like in prophase and
mitosis, a couple of things

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:29.830
start happening.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:35.725
Your nuclear envelope
starts disappearing.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.180
The centromeres-- sorry,
not centromeres.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.750
I'm getting confused now.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.420
The centrosomes.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.750
The centromeres are these things
connecting these sister

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.140
chromatids.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.680
The centrosomes start
facilitating the development

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.490
of the spindles, and they start
pushing apart a little

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.210
bit from the spindles.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.830
They start pushing apart and
going to opposite sides of the

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.610
chromosomes.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.280
And this is the really important
thing in prophase I.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.630
And actually, I'll
make this point.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.860
Remember, in interphase, even
though I drew it this way,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.290
they don't exist in this state,
the actual chromosomes.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.030
They exist more in a
chromatin state.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:23.300
So if I were to really draw it,
it would look like this.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.800
The chromosomes, it would all be
all over the place, and it

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.560
actually would be very difficult
to actually see it

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:29.990
in a microscope.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.919
It would just be a big mess of
proteins and of histones,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.650
which are proteins, and
the actual DNA.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.140
And that's what's actually
referred to as the chromatin.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.300
Now, in prophase, that starts to
form into the chromosomes.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.170
It starts to have a little bit
of structure, and this is

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.710
completely analogous
to what happens

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.420
in prophase in mitosis.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.000
Now, the one interesting thing
that happens is that the

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.320
homologous pairs line up.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.420
And actually, I drew it like
that over here and maybe I

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.310
should just cut and paste it.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.910
Let me just do that.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:10.320
If I just cut and paste that,
although I said that the

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.455
nucleus is disappearing, so let
me get rid of the nucleus.

00:09:14.455 --> 00:09:15.350
I already said that.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.580
The nucleus is slowly
disassembling.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.120
The proteins are coming apart
during this prophase I.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.230
I won't draw the whole cell,
because what's interesting

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.730
here is happening at the
nuclear, or what once was the

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.320
nucleus level.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.070
So the interesting thing here
that's different from mitosis

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.180
is that the homologous pairs
line up next to each other.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:41.520
Not only do they line up, but
they can actually share-- they

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.880
can actually have genetic
recombination.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.700
So you have these points where
analogous-- or I guess you

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.960
could say homologous-- points
on two of these chromosomes

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.240
will cross over each other.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.660
So let me draw that in detail.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.610
So let me just focus on maybe
these two right here.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:05.950
So I have one chromosome from
my dad, and it's made up of

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.400
two chromatids, so it's already
replicated, but we

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.870
only consider it one chromosome,
and then I have

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:16.040
one from my mom in green.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.920
I'm going to draw
it like that.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.370
One from my mom in green, and
it also has two chromatids.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.570
Sometimes this is called a
tetrad because it has four

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.130
chromatids in it, but it's
in a pair of homologous

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.500
chromosomes.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.750
These are the centromeres,
of course.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.730
What happens is you have
crossing over, and it's a

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.770
surprisingly organized
process.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.520
When I say organized,
it crosses over at

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.450
a homologous point.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.450
It crosses over at a point
where, for the most part,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.350
you're exchanging
similar genes.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.690
It's not like one is getting two
versions of a gene and the

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.500
other is getting two versions
of another gene.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.850
You're changing in a way that
both chromosomes are still

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.610
coding for the different genes,
but they're getting

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.670
different versions of those
genes or different alleles,

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.240
which are just versions
of those genes.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.020
So once this is done, the ones
from my father are now not

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.880
completely from my father,
so it might look

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.140
something like this.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.460
Let me see, it'll
look like this.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.860
The one from my father now has
this little bit from my

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.480
mother, and the one from my--
oh, no, my mother's chromosome

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.000
is green-- a little bit from my
mother, and the one from my

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.360
mother has a little bit
from my father.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.560
And this is really amazing
because it shows you that this

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.230
is so favorable for creating
variation in a population that

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.230
it has really become a formal
part of the meiosis process.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.500
It happens so frequently.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.120
This isn't just some random
fluke, and it happens in a

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.490
reasonably organized way.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.840
It actually happens at a point
where it doesn't kind of

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.120
create junk genes.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.670
Because you can imagine, this
cut-off point, which is called

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.690
a chiasma, it could have
happened in the middle of some

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.270
gene, and it could have created
some random noise, and

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.980
it could have broken down some
protein development in the

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.010
future or who knows what.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:09.965
But it doesn't happen
that way.

00:12:09.965 --> 00:12:12.360
It happens in a reasonably
organized way, which kind of

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.710
speaks to the idea that it's
part of the process.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.970
So prophase in I, you also
have this happening.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.210
So once that happens you could
have this guy's got a little

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:26.810
bit of that chromatid and then
this guy's got a little bit of

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.350
that chromatid.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.700
So all of this stuff happens
in prophase I.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.550
You have this crossing over.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.890
The nuclear envelope starts to
disassemble, and then all of

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.460
these guys align and the
chromatin starts forming into

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.990
these more tightly wound
structures of chromosomes.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.840
And really, that's all-- when
we talk about even mitosis,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.000
that's where a lot of the action
really took place.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.020
Once that happens, then we're
ready to enter into the

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.920
metaphase I, so let's go
down to metaphase I.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:00.100
In metaphase I-- let me just
copy and paste what I've

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.710
already done-- the nuclear
envelope is now gone.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.820
The centrosomes have
gone to opposite

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.130
sides of the cell itself.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.010
Maybe I should draw the
entire cell now

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.030
that there's no nucleus.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.090
Let me erase the nucleus
a little bit

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.990
better than I've done.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.070
Let me erase all of that.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.460
And, of course, we have the
spindles fibers that have been

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.750
generated by now with the
help of the centrosomes.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.940
And some of them, as we learned,
this is exactly what

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.310
happened in mitosis.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.290
They attach to the kinetochores,
which are

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:52.550
attached to the centromeres
of these chromosomes.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.970
Now, what's interesting here is
that they each attach-- so

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.510
this guy's going to attach to--
and actually, let me do

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.950
something interesting here.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.770
Instead of doing it this way,
because I want to show that

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.070
all my dad's chromosomes don't
go to one side and all my

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.760
mom's chromosomes don't
go to the other side.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.000
So instead of drawing these two
guys like this, let me see

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.310
if I can flip them.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.880
Let me see.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.150
Let me just flip them
the other way.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.560
Whether or not which direction
they're flipped is completely

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.500
random, and that's what
adds to the variation.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.550
As we said before, sexual
reproduction is key to

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.610
introducing variation
into a population.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.205
So that's the mom's and
that's the dad's.

00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:28.790
They don't have to.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.700
All of the ones from my dad
might have ended up on one

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.300
side and all of them from my mom
might end up on one side,

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.490
although when you're talking
about 23 pairs, the

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.720
probability becomes
a lot, lot lower.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.560
So this is one from my dad.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.930
Of course, it has some
centromeres.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.790
Let me draw that there.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:50.160
And so these microspindles,
some of them attach to

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.480
kinetochores, which are these
protein structures on the

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.560
centromeres.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.100
And this is just
like metaphase.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.050
It's very similar to metaphase
in mitosis.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:05.160
This is called metaphase I,
and everything aligns.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.410
Now we're going to
enter anaphase I.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:13.050
Now, anaphase I is interesting,
because remember,

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.710
in mitosis in anaphase, the
actual chromatids, the sister

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.880
chromatids separated
from each other.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.990
That's not the case in anaphase
I here in meiosis.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:28.020
So when we enter anaphase I, you
have just the homologous

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.840
pairs separate, so the
chromatids stay with their

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.630
sister chromatids.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:37.130
So on this side, you'll have
these to go there.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:42.620
While I have the green out, let
me see if I can draw this

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.070
respectably.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.780
I have the purple.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.780
It's a little bit shorter
version here.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.480
He's got a little bit of
a stub of green there.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.180
This guy's got little stub
of purple there.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.000
And then they have this longer
purple chromosome here.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.510
This is anaphase I.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.290
They're being pulled apart,
but they're being pulled

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.250
apart-- the homologous pair is
being pulled apart, not the

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.610
actual chromosomes, not
the chromatids.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.230
So let me just draw this.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.900
So then you have your
microtubules.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.060
Some are connected to
these kinetochores.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.310
You have your centromeres.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.640
Of course, all of this is
occurring within the cell and

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.570
these are getting
pulled apart.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:28.090
So it's analogous to anaphase
in mitosis, but the key

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:31.830
difference is you're pulling
apart homologous pairs.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.070
You're not actually splitting
the chromosomes into their

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.240
constituent chromatids,
and that's key.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.300
And if you forget that, you can
review the mitosis video.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.840
So this is anaphase I.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.060
And then as you could imagine,
telophase I is essentially

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:57.990
once these guys are at their
respective ends of the cell--

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.190
it's getting tiring redrawing
all of these, but I guess it

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.050
gives you time to let
it all sink in.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:09.240
So these guys are now at the
left end of the cell and these

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:15.490
guys are now at the right
end of the cell.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.099
Now, the microtubules start
to disassemble.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.109
So maybe they're there a
little bit, but they're

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:21.800
disassembling.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.170
You still have your centromeres
here and they're

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.380
at opposite poles.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.339
And to some degree, in the
early part of telophase,

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.870
they're still pushing the cell
apart, and at the same time,

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.510
you have cytokinesis
happening.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:38.030
So by the end of telophase I,
you have the actual cytoplasm

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.480
splitting during telophase right
there, and the nuclear

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.810
envelope is forming.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.640
You can almost view it as the
opposite of prophase.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.300
The nuclear envelope is forming,
and by the end of

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.530
telophase I, it will have
completely divided.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.030
So this is telophase I.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:02.710
Now, notice: we started off with
a diploid cell, right?

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.610
It had two pairs of homologous
chromosome, but it had four

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.310
chromosomes.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.330
Now, each cell only has
two chromosomes.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:18.790
Essentially, each cell got one
of the pair of each of those

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.960
homologous pairs, but it was
done randomly, and that's

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.690
where a lot of the variation
is introduced.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.680
Now, once we're at this stage,
each of these cells now

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.320
undergo meiosis II,
which is actually

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.540
very similar to mitosis.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.550
And sometimes, there's actually
an in-between stage

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.500
called interphase II, where
the cell kind of rests and

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.790
whatever else, and actually the
centromeres now have to

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:41.570
duplicate again.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.610
So these two cells-- I've drawn
them separately-- let's

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.100
see what happens next.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.420
So let's say that the
centromere-- actually, I

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.820
shouldn't have drawn the
centromere inside the

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.740
nucleus like that.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.360
The centromere's going to be
outside the nucleus, outside

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.880
of the newly formed nucleus
there and there.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.320
And then it'll actually
replicate itself at

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.450
this point as well.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.700
So now we have two cells.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:17.900
Let me just cut and paste what
I have. I have this one, this

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.380
chromosome right here.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.650
It's got this little green stub
there and then I have

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.630
this longer fully green
chromosome there.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:32.360
Now, this guy, he's got this
little purple stub here.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.770
Let me draw this whole purple
chromosome there.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.510
Then this guy has one chromatid
like that and one

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.370
chromatid like that.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:47.060
Now, when we enter prophase
II, what do you

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.610
think is going to happen?

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:53.830
Well, just like before, you
have your nuclear envelope

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.090
that formed in telophase I.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.830
It's kind of a temporary
thing.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.470
It starts to disintegrate
again.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.520
And then you have your
centromeres.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.550
They start pushing apart so
now I had two centromeres.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.290
They replicated, and now they
start pushing apart while they

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.260
generate their little
spindles.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.840
They push apart in opposite
directions.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.530
Now, this is happening in
two cells, of course.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.290
They go in opposite directions
while they generate their

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.020
spindle fibers.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.310
And let me make it very clear
that this is two cells we're

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.680
talking about.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.180
That's one of them and that's
the second of them.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:42.860
Now it's going to enter
metaphase II, which is

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.920
analogous to metaphase I, or
metaphase in mitosis, where

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.050
the chromosomes get lined up.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.050
Let me draw it this way.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.480
So now the centromeres, they've
migrated to the two

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.810
poles of the cell.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.770
So those are my centromeres.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.085
I have all of my spindles
fibers.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.630
Oh, sorry, did I call
those centromeres?

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:07.880
The centrosomes.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.655
I don't know how long I've been
calling them centromeres.

00:21:11.655 --> 00:21:14.830
These are centrosomes, and my
brain keeps confusing them.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.360
The centromeres, and maybe
this'll help you not do what I

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.520
just did, the centromeres are
the things that are connecting

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.090
the two sister chromatids.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.070
Those are centromeres.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.810
Centrosomes are the things that
are pushing back the--

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.450
that generate the
spindle fibers.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.500
The chromosomes line up
during metaphase.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.200
Metaphase always involves the
lining up of chromosomes so

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.790
that one-- let me
just draw it.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.790
So I have that and that.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.820
This one's got a purple
guy, too.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.920
This guy's got a purple guy,
a long purple guy, and then

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.880
there's a little stub
for the other guy.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.410
This guy's got a long green
guy and this guy's got a

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:56.540
little green stub, and then this
is the short green guy

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.220
right there.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.650
And, of course, they're
being aligned.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.270
Some of these spindle fibers
have been attached to the

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.360
centromeres or the kinetochores
that are on the

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.460
centromeres that connect these
two chromatids, these sister

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.650
chromatids.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.820
And, of course, we don't have
a nuclear membrane anymore,

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.830
and these are, of course,
two separate cells.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.740
And then you can guess what
happens in anaphase II.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.970
It's just like anaphase
in mitosis.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.340
These things get pulled apart
by the kinetochore

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.190
microtubules, while the other
microtubules keep growing and

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.140
push and these two things
further apart.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.480
So let me show that.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.530
And they the key here: this
is the difference between

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.970
anaphase II and anaphase I.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:42.960
Anaphase I, the homologous pairs
were broken up, but the

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.290
chromosomes themselves
were not.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.120
Now, in anaphase II, we don't
have homologous pairs.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.280
We just have chromatid pairs,
sister chromatids.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.910
Now, those are separated,
which is very similar to

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.080
anaphase in mitosis.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.200
So now, this guy gets pulled in
that direction so it look

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.940
something like this.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.830
The drawing here is the hardest
part of this video.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.200
So that guy gets pulled there.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.570
That guy's getting pulled
in that direction.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.840
He's got that little
green stub on him.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.470
And then you have one green
guy getting pulled in that

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.210
direction with the longer
chromosome.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.220
And then one of the other longer
is getting pulled in

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.190
that direction, and it's all
by these microtubules

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:25.670
connected at the kinetochore
structures by a centrosome as

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.850
kind of the coordinating body.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.350
It's all being pulled apart.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.850
Anaphase has always involved
the pulling apart of the

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.440
chromosomes or pulling
apart of something.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.300
Let me put it that way.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.110
And it's happening on this
side of the cell as well.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.830
Of course, this is
all one cell.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:49.480
And just like in mitosis, as
soon as the sister chromatids

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.450
are split apart, they are now
referred to as chromosomes, or

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.910
sister chromosomes.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.530
And, of course, this
is happening twice.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:59.690
This is also happening
in the other cell.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.010
The other cell's a little
bit cleaner.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.730
It didn't have that
crossover occur.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:08.900
So you have the longer
purple one.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.600
He gets split up into two
chromatids, which we are now

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.820
calling chromosomes, or
sister chromosomes.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.530
And then this guy up here, he
gets split up into this short

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:23.270
green, and then there's a-- let
me do it this way-- this

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.820
short green, and he's
got a little purple

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.490
stub on it right there.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.090
And, of course, it's all being
pulled away by the same idea,

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:30.885
by the centrosomes.

00:24:30.885 --> 00:24:33.700
I want to make sure I
get that word right.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.320
I'm afraid whether I used
centromeres for the whole

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.110
first part of the video, but
hopefully, my confusion will

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.540
help you from getting confused
because you'll realize that

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.590
it's a pitfall to fall into.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.380
So that's anaphase.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.790
Everything is getting
pulled apart.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.810
And then you can imagine
what telophase II is.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.040
In fact, I won't
even redraw it.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.010
Telophase II, these things get
pulled apart even more, so

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.170
this is telophase II.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:00.420
They get pulled apart
even more.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.180
The cell elongates.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:09.180
You start having this cleavage
occur right here.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.350
So at the same time that in
telophase II these get pulled

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.560
part, you have the
cytokinesis.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.440
The tubules start disintegrating
and then you

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.880
have a nucleus that forms
around these.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.720
So what is the end result
of all of these?

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:29.280
Well, that guy's going to turn
into a nucleus that has this

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.590
purple dude with a little green
stub, and then a long

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:38.460
green guy, and then he's got
his nuclear membrane.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.620
And, of course, there's the
entire cytoplasm in the rest

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.300
of the cell.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.280
The other person that was his
kind of partner in this

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.180
meiosis II, he's going
to have a short

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:55.980
purple and a long green.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.610
He has a nuclear membrane,
and, of course, it has

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.340
cytoplasm around it.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.730
And then on this side, you have

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.955
something similar happening.

00:26:05.955 --> 00:26:10.300
You see this first guy, this
first one right here has two

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.840
long purple ones.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.080
They get separated.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.880
So let me see, you have one long
purple in that cell and

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.670
you have another long
purple in this cell.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.780
In that top one, you have a
short green one, and in this

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.260
bottom, you have a short green
one that had got a little bit

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.960
of one of my dad's-- a
homologous part of one of my

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.520
dad's chromosomes on it.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.740
And, of course, these also
have nuclear membranes,

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.630
nuclear membranes, and, of
course, it has a cytoplasm in

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.900
the rest of the cell, which
we'll learn more about all

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.110
those other things.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.900
So what we see here is that we
went from a diploid starting

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.530
way-- where did we start?

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.890
We started up here with a
diploid germ cell, and we went

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.820
through two stages
of division.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.220
The first stage split up
homologous pairs, but it

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.590
started over with that crossing
over, that genetic

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.380
combination, which is a key
feature of meiosis, which adds

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.620
a lot a variation to a species
or to a gene pool.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.080
And then the second phase
separated the sister

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.950
chromatids, just like what
happens in mitosis.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.980
And we end up with four haploid
cells because they

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.750
have half the contingency of
chromosomes, and these are

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.000
called gametes.
