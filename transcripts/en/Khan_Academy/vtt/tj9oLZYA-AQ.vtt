00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.300
Shelagh and Luana realize that
they could express their ages

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.420
more specifically if they
used fractions.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.080
Doing this will allow them to
calculate the difference in

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.270
their ages more precisely.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.650
If Shelagh describes her age
as 15 and 1/2 years old and

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.580
Luana is 7 and 7/12-- I'm
assuming years old-- what is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.060
the difference in their ages?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.320
Write the answer as a simplified
mixed number.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.945
So Shelagh is older, so she's
15 and 1/2 years old, so we

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:36.560
literally want to find the
difference between 15 and 1/2

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.950
and 7 and 7/12.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.870
Now we can see immediately-- or
maybe it's not obvious to

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.210
you, but 1/2 is the same
thing is 6/12, which

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.920
is a less than 7/12.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.060
So if we separated out the whole
number parts and the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.810
fraction parts, this fraction
is actually smaller.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.620
The 1/2 is smaller than the
7/12, so it might be easier to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.240
just do this as mixed numbers so
we don't have to do all of

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.080
that borrowing and regrouping.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.860
So let's write both of them
as mixed numbers.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.680
So we have 1 and 1/2.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.820
We're still going to-- sorry,
let's write both of them as

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.650
improper fractions, so we're
going to keep 2 in the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.000
denominator.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.560
And as an improper fraction, 2
times 15 is 30 plus 1 is 31.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.370
So 31/2 the same thing as
15 and 1/2, so these are

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.250
equivalent.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.310
And then 7 and 7/12, if we
write it as an improper

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.630
fraction, so we're still going
to have the minus sign out

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.360
there, the denominator is 12.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.680
12 times 7 is 84.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.540
84 plus 7 is 91.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.170
It is 91.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.540
Did I do that right?

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.510
91.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.010
Yep, that looks right.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.520
91/12.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.690
Now, we've written both of them
as improper fractions,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.410
but we still have different
denominators, so we have to

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.620
have a common denominator.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.890
So what is the least common
multiple of 2 and 12, or

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.060
what's the smallest
number that's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.740
divisible by both of them?

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.850
Well, 12 is divisible by 12, and
12 is also divisible by 2,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.180
so 12 is the least
common multiple.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.000
So we want both of them
to be over 12.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.500
And this fraction already is
over 12 so we don't have to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.810
change it: 91/12.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.060
Now, on the blue one, to
go from 2 to 12 in the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.720
denominator, we have to multiply
by 6, so we also have

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.385
to multiply by 6 in
the numerator.

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:39.320
So if we multiply 31 by
6, what do we get?

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.860
You can even do this
in your head.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:50.360
6 times 30 is 180, 6 times 1 is
6, so it's going to be 186.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.880
And now we subtract.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.300
So the difference in their
ages is going to be-- the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.900
denominator is going to be 12.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.010
It's going to be 186 minus 91,
which is equal to-- over 12.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.090
Let's see, 186 minus just 90
would be 96, but we're

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.140
subtracting 91, so it's
going to be 95.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.590
95, right?

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.750
6 minus 1 is 5, and then
180 minus 90 is 90,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.390
so that works out.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.090
So the way we've expressed it
right now, it isn't is an

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.460
improper fraction, but they
want us to write it as a

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.520
simplified mixed number,
so let's do that.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.120
So how many times does
12 go into 95?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.190
Let's see, 8 times 12 is 96, so
that's too big, so 12 goes

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.830
seven times.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.210
So this is equal to 7.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.170
And if we take-- well,
let me write it out.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.830
We don't want to do too
much in our head.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.360
If we go 12 into 95, I'm saying
it goes seven times.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.340
So if that's true, if that's the
largest number, then the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.460
remainder should be
less than 12.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.090
7 times 12 we know is 84 from
our times tables, or you could

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.060
just think it's going to be 14
plus 10 times 7, which is 70.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.720
Either way.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.360
And let's see, 95 minus 84: 5
minus 4 is 1, 9 minus 8 is 1,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.310
so we have a remainder of 11.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.779
So 12 goes into 95
seven times.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.180
You get 7 wholes and you
have 11 left over.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.840
So 95/12 is 7 and 11/12.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.890
And we're done!

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.410
The difference between Shelagh
and Luana's age is 7 and

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.310
11/12, or Shelagh is 7 and 11/12
years older than Luana.
