00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.670
what i want to do in this video is a handful of fairly

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.470
simple inequality videos.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.710
But the real value of it, I
think, will be just to get you

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.750
warmed up in the notation
of inequality.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.390
So, let's just start with one.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.590
we have x minus 5 is less than 35.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.480
So let's see if we can find
all of the x's that will

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.940
satisfy this equation.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.370
And that's one of the
distinctions of an inequality.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.000
In an equation, you typically
have one solution, or at least

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.220
the ones we've solved so far.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.150
In the future, we'll see
equations where they have more

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.250
than one solution.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.150
But in the ones we've solved
so far, you solved for a

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.310
particular x.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.350
In the inequalities, there's a
whole set of x's that will

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.720
satisfy this inequality.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.930
So they're saying, what are
all the x's, that when you

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.120
subtract 5 from them, it's
going to be less than 35?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.170
And we can already
think about it.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.690
I mean 0 minus 5.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.290
That's less than 35.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.310
Minus 100 minus 5.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.750
That's less than 35.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.160
5 minus 5.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.300
That's less than 35.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.750
So there's clearly a lot of x's
that will satisfy that.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.610
But what we want to do is come
up with a solution that

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.060
essentially encompasses
all of the x's.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.640
So the way we do that is
essentially the same way that

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.960
we solved any equations.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.610
We want to get just the x terms,
in this case, on the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.720
left-hand side.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.280
So I want to get rid of this
negative 5, and I can do that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.400
by adding 5 to both sides
of this equation.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.350
So I can add 5 to both sides
of this equation.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.930
That won't change
the inequality.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.710
It won't change the
less than sign.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.470
If something is less than
something else, something plus

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.720
5 is still going to be less than
the other thing plus 5.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.580
So on the left-hand side,
we just have an x.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.500
This negative 5 and this
positive 5 cancel out.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.730
x is less than 35 plus
5, which is 40.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.190
And that's our solution.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.010
And to just visualize the
set of all numbers that

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.340
represents, let me draw
a number line here.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.280
And I'll do it around--
let's say that's 40,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.250
this is 40, 41, 42.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.730
And then we could go below 40.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.389
39, 38.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.240
You can just keep
going below 40.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.700
It just keeps going on
in both directions.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.610
And any x that is less than
40 will satisfy this.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.950
So it can't be equal to 40,
because if x is equal to 40,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.010
40 minus 5 is 35.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.130
It's not less than 35.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.820
So x has to be less than 40.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.590
And to show this on the number
line, we do a circle around 40

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.620
to show that we're
not including 40.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.020
But then we can shade in
everything below 40.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.010
So everything that's just
exactly below 40 is included

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.770
in our solution set.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.240
So everything I've shaded in
yellow is included in our

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.040
solution set.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.530
So 39, 39.999999, repeating,
which is about as close as you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.240
can get to 40 as possible,
that's in our solution set.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.370
But 40 is not.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.630
That's why we put that open
circle around it.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.850
Let's do another one.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.095
Let me do it in another
color as well.

00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:06.860
So let's say we have x-- let
me do it over on this top

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.360
right corner.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.320
Say we have x plus 15 is greater
than or equal to

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.570
negative 60.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.220
Notice, now we have greater
than or equal.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.110
So let's solve this the
same way we solved

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.830
that one over there.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.360
We can subtract 15
from both sides.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.800
And I like to switch
up my notation.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.680
Here I added the 5, kind
of, on the same line.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.460
You could also do your adding
or subtracting below

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.480
the line, like this.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.130
So if I subtract 15 from both
sides, so I do a minus 15

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.170
there, and I do a
minus 15 there.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.450
Then the left-hand side
just becomes an x.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.110
Because obviously you
have 15 minus 15.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.420
That just cancels out.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.850
And you get x is greater than or
equal to negative 60 minus

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.000
15 is negative 75.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.050
If something is greater than or
equal to something else, if

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.830
I take 15 away from this and
from that, the greater than or

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.760
equal sign will still apply.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.320
So our solution is x is greater
than or equal to

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.950
negative 75.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.995
Let's graph it on
the number line.

00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:13.060
So let me draw a number
line here.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.310
I'll have-- let's say that's
negative 75, that's negative

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.310
74, that's negative 73,
that's negative 76.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.450
And so on and so forth.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.870
I could keep plotting things.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.280
Now, x has to be greater than
or equal to negative 75.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.590
So x can be equal
to negative 75.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.470
So we can include the point,
because we have this greater

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.840
than or equal sign.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.540
Notice we're not making it
hollow like we did there,

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.090
we're making it filled in
because it can equal negative

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.870
75, or it needs to
be greater than.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.015
So greater than or equal.

00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:52.340
We'll shade in everything above
negative 75 as well.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.160
So in orange is the
solution set.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.200
And this obviously, we could
keep going to the right. x

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.970
could be a million, it
could be a billion,

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.830
it could be a googol.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.220
It can be an arbitrarily large
number as long as it's greater

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.090
than or equal to negative 75.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.080
Let's do a couple more.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:17.940
Let's do x minus 2 is less
than or equal to 1.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.650
Once again, we want to
get just our x on

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.440
the left-hand side.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.830
Get rid of this negative 2.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.400
Let's add 2 to both sides
of this equation.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.410
Plus 2.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.680
The left-hand side just
becomes an x.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.400
You have a less than
or equal sign.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.130
That won't change by adding or
subtracting the same thing to

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.140
both sides of the inequality.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.740
And then 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.010
So x needs to be less
than or equal to 3.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.960
Any x that is less than
or equal to 3 will

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.120
satisfy this equation.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.640
So let's plot it.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.180
And I'd try out any x that's
less than or equal to 3 and

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.160
verify for yourself that it
does indeed satisfy this

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.740
inequality.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.760
I shouldn't call
it an equation.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.790
This inequality.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.520
So let me graph the
solution set.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.140
So let's say this is
0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.830
That's negative 1, negative 2.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.020
So x has to be less than
or equal to 3.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.480
It can be equal to 3, so
we fill in the dot,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.920
or less than 3.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.730
So the solution set for
over here is in pink.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.286
Anything less than
or equal to 3.

00:06:20.286 --> 00:06:21.640
And verify it for yourself.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.670
If x is equal to 3, you get 3
minus 2, which is equal to 1.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.170
And that is valid because it
could be less than or equal.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.950
If you do 2.999999 minus 2,
you get 0.999999, which is

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:35.920
less than 1.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.500
And you can keep trying for any
of these numbers in this

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.280
pink solution set here.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.370
Let's do one more.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:49.830
Let's say we have x minus 32
is less than or equal to 0.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.160
Same drill as before.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.275
Let's add 32 to both sides
of this equation.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.820
The left-hand side just becomes
x, and then the

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.650
right-hand side is less
than or equal to 32.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.800
Pretty straightforward.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.110
Same drill when we graph
this equation.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.250
We draw the number line.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.200
If this is 32, this
is 33, this is 31.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.140
I could keep adding things
above and below 32.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.000
For the solution set is
everything less than or equal,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.410
so we can-- it could be equal
to 32, or less than.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.580
So we fill in everything
below that.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.790
Remember, the reason why we're
filling in this solid, the

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.960
reason why 32 is an acceptable
solution to this original

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.090
inequality, is because of this
less than or equal sign.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.040
Over here, you didn't have less
than or equal, and that's

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.890
why 40 wasn't part of
the solution set.
