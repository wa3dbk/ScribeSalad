00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.730
What I want to do in this video
is to try to figure out

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.470
what type of reaction or
reactions might occur if we

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.150
have-- what is this?

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.710
One, two, three, four,
five It's in a cycle.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.205
This is bromocyclopentane.

00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:18.560
If we have some
bromocyclopentane dissolved

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.380
and our solvent is
dimethylformamide.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.060
Sometimes you'll see that
just written as DMF.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.160
And I've actually drawn the
formula for it here, so we can

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.470
think about what type
of a solvent it is.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.890
And also, in our solution, we
have the methoxide ion.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.340
So we also have the methoxide
ion right here.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.250
So let's think about what type
of reaction might occur.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.400
And just to narrow things down,
we'll think about it in

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.380
the context of the last four
types of reactions

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.850
we've looked at.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.480
So this might be an Sn2
reaction, an Sn1 reaction, an

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.950
E2 reaction, or an
E1 reaction.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.520
We're going to look at all the
clues and figure out what's

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.060
likely to occur, and then
actually draw the mechanism

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.560
for it occurring.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.050
Now, the first thing since they
gave us the solvent and

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.160
other things that are in the
solvent, let's think about how

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.670
those might affect
the reaction.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.960
So if we look at this solvent
right here, whenever you look

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.560
at any of these reactions, when
you look at the solvent,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.330
you just want to
think about it.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.650
Is it protic or not?

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.230
And protic means that it has
hydrogens that can kind of be

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.120
released or that their electrons
could be nabbed off

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.970
and these protons could
just float around.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.610
And if we look over here, we do
have hydrogens, but all of

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.990
the hydrogens are bonded
to carbon.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.910
And carbon is unlikely to just
steal a hydrogen's electrons

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.170
and let the hydrogen
float around.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.080
Carbon is not that
electronegative.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.000
If you had hydrogens bonded
to an oxygen, that'd be a

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.650
different question.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.610
Then you would have
a protic solvent.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.180
But in this case, all the
hydrogens bonded to carbons,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.470
not likely to get their
electrons nabbed off and float

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.870
around as free protons.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.350
So this is an aprotic solvent.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.630
Now, we've gone over this a
little bit with Sn2 and Sn1,

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.650
but the same idea applies.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.020
In order to have an Sn2 or an E2
reaction, you have to have

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.669
either a strong nucleophile or
a strong base, and the same

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.160
thing could actually be both,
although they're not always

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.600
correlated.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.940
We've seen that before.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.790
Now, if you had a protic
solvent, it would stabilize

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.390
the strong base or the
strong nucleophile.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.080
The protons would
react with them.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.450
They would take the electrons
from that strong base or that

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.580
strong nucleophile.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.250
So in order to have an Sn2 or
an E2, you have to have no

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.610
protons flying around, so you
need an aprotic solvent.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.580
So this aprotic solvent will
favor Sn2 or an E2 reaction.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.670
Now, so our mind is already
thinking in Sn2 or E2, let's

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.320
think about the reactants
themselves.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.990
So over here, we have
the methoxide ion.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.180
And let's think about whether
it's a strong or weak.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.370
Let's think about it first as a
strong or weak nucleophile.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.610
It's actually a pretty
strong nucleophile.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.010
It is a strong nucleophile.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.090
So that would put us in the
direction of an Sn1.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.280
So we have two data points.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.670
I'm sorry, for an Sn2.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.510
We have two data points for Sn2
because remember, it has

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.500
to just kind of go in
there and be active.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.640
It's not too big of a molecule,
so it's not going to

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.000
be hindered.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.390
But it's also an extremely
strong base, even stronger

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.880
than hydroxide.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:38.920
So it's also an extremely strong
base, which might lead

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.590
us or that does imply
that we're going

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.680
to have an E2 reaction.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.640
Now, the last thing we need to
think about is the carbon

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.660
where the leaving group
might leave from.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.230
And immediately, when you look
at the bromocyclopentane,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.590
there's only one functional
group attached to the chain,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.350
and that is the bromo group
right here, right there.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.760
It is attached to this carbon.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.860
We could call that the
alpha carbon, and it

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.150
is a secondary carbon.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.100
This carbon right here
is bonded to

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.655
one, two other carbons.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.660
This alpha carbon-- let
me write it this way.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:23.040
This alpha carbon is a secondary
carbon, and that

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.540
kind of makes it neutral
in this mix.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.190
If it was a methyl or
primary carbon, it

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.740
would favor Sn2, actually.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.540
I mean methyl, the only thing
you could have is an Sn2.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.970
And if it was a tertiary carbon,
it would favor Sn1 or

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.500
E1 because it would favor
a stable carbocation.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.770
The leaving group could just
leave. And if this guy was

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.210
bonded to another carbon,
it would be very stable.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.300
But in this situation, it's
a secondary carbon

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.250
bonded to two carbons.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.460
It's a little bit neutral.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.750
Any of these reactions
might occur.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.000
When we look at all of the other
data points, they're

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.010
pointing at both Sn2 or E2.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.430
We have a strong
nucleophile/base.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.770
We have an aprotic solvent.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.110
It's going to be Sn2
or an E2 reaction.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.000
So let's actually draw
the reactions.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.860
Let me do the Sn2 first. So
let me do it in orange.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.770
So if we were to have
an Sn2 reaction, let

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.020
me redraw the molecule.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.630
Let me draw the cyclopentane
part.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.350
I want to make sure-- let me
draw it the same way I had it

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.570
drawn up there.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.750
So the pentagon is
facing upwards.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.790
And then we have our bromo
group right there.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.910
So we have our methoxide
ion right over here.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.980
So CH3O minus.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.410
Or another way we could view
it is that this oxygen has

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.740
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven valence electrons

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.440
with a negative charge.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:02.070
One of these electrons right
over here, this can attack the

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.410
substrate right over
there, that carbon.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.960
Right when that happens,
simultaneously this bromine is

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.460
going to be able to
nab an electron

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.880
from that same carbon.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.350
And then we are going to be left
with-- the bromine now

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.070
becomes the bromide anion.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.620
It had one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.670
seven valence electrons.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.730
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.000
Now it nabbed one more electron,
making it bromide.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.180
Now it has a negative charge.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.300
And if we were to draw
the chain, it

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.550
would look like this.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.195
Well, we could draw it on this,
and I might as well draw

00:06:48.195 --> 00:06:50.250
it on this side, just so it's
attacking from the other side.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.870
This is the chiral substrate,
so we don't have to be too

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.550
particular about how we draw the
connections to the carbon.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.850
We're not actually even
showing anything

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.210
popping in or out.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.470
But we would have the methoxide
ion, where now it's

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.940
bonded, so it's no longer
an ion, so it's

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.450
OCH3, just like that.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.920
It has bonded to this carbon.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.660
Obviously, implicitly this
carbon had another hydrogen

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.150
that we are not showing.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.800
Just that quickly, that
was the Sn2 reaction.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.720
That is the mechanism.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.360
Now let's think about what
the E2 reaction is.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.780
To do the E2 properly, to give
it justice, we're going to

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.540
have to draw some of
the hydrogens.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.030
So on the E2 reaction, let
me draw that in blue.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.320
Let me draw the cyclopentane
part.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.140
Let me draw it big.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.200
Actually, over here, it's less
important to draw it too big.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.890
So let me draw the pentagon.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.130
The pentagon just like that.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:57.660
That is the bromine, three,
four, five, six, and then it

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.590
has a seventh valence electron
right over here.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.080
This is the alpha carbon.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.050
That right there is
the alpha carbon.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.020
And then there are
two beta carbons.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.340
There are two beta carbons right
over there and there.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.970
They each have two hydrogens
on them.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.390
They each have two hydrogens.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.390
I know it's becoming a
little hard to read.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.210
They each have two hydrogens
on them.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.450
And in an E2 reaction, the
strong base will react-- let

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.620
me make it a little
cleaner than that.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.370
Let me get rid of the beta.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.070
The beta makes it's
a little dirty.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.440
OK, so they each have two
hydrogens on them.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.580
Now in an E2 reaction, the
strong base-- over here, the

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.320
methoxide ion was acting as
a strong nucleophile.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.790
In E2, it's going to act
as a strong base.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.470
It's going to nab off a hydrogen
off of one of the

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.500
beta carbons.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.800
And you might want to
say, OK, which one?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.730
Let's look at Zaitsev's rule.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.520
It doesn't matter.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.670
These are symmetric.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.550
They are both bonded to
two other carbons.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.430
They both are bonded to the
same number of hydrogens.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.270
It doesn't matter.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.060
It's actually going to be random
which one, and you

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.710
actually won't be able
tell the difference

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.990
because it's symmetric.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.260
So let's just draw
it like this.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.740
Let me draw the methoxide ion.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.860
One, two, three, four--
or anion, maybe I

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.710
should say-- five, six.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.970
And then it has one
bond to the CH3.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.440
It has a negative charge, very,
very, very strong base.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.980
It can go over here and nab
the hydrogen and leave

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.310
hydrogen's electron behind.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.870
Maybe I'll take a color.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.160
This electron can be given to
the hydrogen so that it forms

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.030
a bond with it.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.220
Hydrogen's electron-- let
me do this in a suitably

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.490
different color.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.180
Hydrogen's electron that is
sitting right over there can

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.940
now be given to the
alpha carbon.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.940
It can now be given to
the alpha carbon to

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.170
form a double bond.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.430
And now that the alpha carbon is
getting that electron, now

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.280
the bromo group can leave. It's
a decent leaving group.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.840
And that was another thing that
we should think about in

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.250
our equation.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.180
But a good leaving group
actually favors all of the

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.140
reactions: Sn2, E2, Sn1, E1.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.800
And so the carbon's getting
the electron, and then the

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:12.150
bromine can then take this
carbon's electron.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.610
And just in one step that's
what's distinctive about the

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.470
E2 and the Sn2 reactions.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.910
All of the reactions
are involved in the

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.850
rate-determining step and there
really is only one step.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.850
Just like that, after that
happens, what we're left with

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.380
is the methoxide anion
takes the hydrogen,

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.330
so it becomes methanol.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.450
Let me draw that.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.510
So it becomes methanol.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:39.150
So it had one, two, three, four
and then five, that's

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.280
this one right there, but then
this guy goes and bonds with

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.540
the hydrogen.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.570
This guy goes and bonds with the
hydrogen, just like that,

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.580
and hydrogen leaves its
electron behind.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.580
Let me draw the cyclopentane
part now.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.470
And so the cyclopentane looked
like this before, if I just

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.770
focus on the ring.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:04.700
Now, this guy was bonded
to a hydrogen.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.540
He was bonded to this hydrogen
over here, but now that

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.470
electron is going to be used to
form a bond with this alpha

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.390
carbon right over here.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.640
Let me draw the alpha carbon.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.040
And the alpha carbon is
right over there.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.680
Obviously, implicitly at
every one of these

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.970
edges, we have a carbon.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.670
But now, a double bond
is going to form

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.350
with that alpha carbon.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.980
We could just draw it like
that, a double bond.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.620
Obviously, there's another
carbon here.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.200
I could write up another
carbon over there.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.070
And now this double
bond will form.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.280
And now the bromide has left.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.700
It's taken an electron with it
from that carbon now that the

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.530
carbon doesn't need it.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.010
It was already starting to
hog it because it's so

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.550
electronegative.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.500
So that's bromine.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.250
It takes that orange electron.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.040
Now, it is bromide.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.080
And we're done.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.030
And so just to go back to the
original question here, which

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.750
reaction is likely to occur
or which mechanism?

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.510
It's actually both Sn2 and E2.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.960
You would see a mix of both of
these occurring because you

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.520
have all of the environmental
factors that

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.800
would enable both.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.130
And so you would have both
of these mechanisms.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.960
Here's the-- let me
separate them out.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.360
Here's the Sn2 reaction.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.650
You would have the Sn2 reaction
occurring in your

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.690
whatever, your vial, or your
pot, or whatever you're making

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:17.180
all of this stuff occur in, and
you would also have your

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.320
E2 reaction.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.960
So you would see some of all of
these, some of all of those

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.780
products and these products
right over there.
