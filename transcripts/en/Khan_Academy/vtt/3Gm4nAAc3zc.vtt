00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.950
SAL: In the last video we
learned that if I had some--

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.420
let's say I have
some weak acid.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.770
So it's hydrogen plus some--
the rest of whatever the

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.790
molecule was called.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.550
We'll just call it A.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.370
And I think this tends to be
the standard convention for

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.890
the rest of the acid.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.580
They can disassociate, or
it's in equilibrium

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.630
because it's a weak acid.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.660
So it can be in equilibrium
with-- since it's a weak acid,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.270
it's going to produce some
hydrogen proton.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.790
And then the rest of
the molecule is

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.170
going to keep the electrons.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.650
So it's going to be
plus-- oh, this is

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.780
in an aqueous solution.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.480
Let me do that.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.660
Aqueous solution.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.050
And then you're going to have
the rest of the acid, whatever

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.730
it might be.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.170
A minus, and that's also going
to be in an aqueous solution.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.540
And that's the general
pattern.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:56.750
We've seen the case where A
could be an NH3, right?

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.620
If A is an NH3, then when you
have this, you have an NH4

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.880
plus, and this would
be ammonia.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.460
And this is just NH3.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:12.450
A could be a fluorine molecule
right there, because then this

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.800
would be hydrogen fluoride
or hydrofluoric acid.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.340
And this would just be the
negative ion of fluorine.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.350
Or a fluorine with an
extra electron.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.170
So it could be a
bunch of stuff.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.590
You can just throw in anything
there, and it'll work.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.680
Especially for the weak acids.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.240
So we learned a last video that
if this is the acid, then

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.800
this is the conjugate base.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.680
And we could write the same
reactions, essentially, as

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.240
kind of more of a
basic reaction.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.790
So we could say, if I start
with A minus-- it's in an

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.290
aqueous solution-- that's
in equilibrium with--

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.880
This thing could grab a hydrogen
from the surrounding

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.780
water and become neutral then.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.479
It's still in an aqueous
solution.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.620
And then one of those water
molecules that it plucked that

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.540
hydrogen off of is now going
to be a hydroxide molecule.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.790
Right?

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.470
Because it's hydrogen.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.530
Remember, whenever I say pluck
the hydrogen, just the proton,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.450
not the electron for
the hydrogen.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.850
So the electron stays on that
water molecule, so it has a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.570
negative charge.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.980
It's in an aqueous solution.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.750
So we could write the same
reaction both ways.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.310
And we can write equilibrium
constants for

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.470
both of these reactions.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.670
So let's do that.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.510
Let me erase this, just because
I can erase this stuff

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.030
right there, and then
use that space.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.590
So an equilibrium reaction
for this first one.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.670
I could call this the K sub
a, because the equilibrium

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.360
reaction for an acid.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.430
And so this is going to be
equal to its products.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.090
So the concentration of
my hydrogen times my

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.880
concentration of whatever my
conjugate base was, divided by

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.820
my concentration of
my original acid.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.860
My weak acid.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.903
So this would be the
concentration of HA.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.170
Fair enough.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.470
I could also write an
equilibrium constant for this

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.980
basic reaction.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.250
Let me do it right down here.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.360
So I'll call that my K sub b.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.640
This is a base equilibrium.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.700
And so this is equal to the
concentration of the products.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.980
It's becoming tedious to
keep switching colors.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.670
Actually, I'll do it.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.480
Because it makes it easier
look at, at least for me.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:52.340
HA times the concentration of
my hydroxide ions divided by

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.820
my concentration of
my weak base.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.440
A minus.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.530
Remember, this can only
be true of a weak

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.900
base or a weak acid.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.020
If we were dealing with a strong
acid or is or a strong

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.140
base, this would not be an
equilibrium reaction.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.730
It would only go in
one direction.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.380
And when it only goes in one
direction, writing this type

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.505
of equilibrium reaction makes
no sense-- or equilibrium

00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:14.320
constant-- because it's
not in equilibrium.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.560
It only goes in one direction.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.550
If A was chlorine, if this was
hydrochloric acid, you

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.329
couldn't do this.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.500
You would just say look, if
you have a mole of this,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.190
you're just dumping a mole of
hydrogen protons in that

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.420
solution and then a bunch of
chlorine anions who are not

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.130
going to do anything.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.990
Even though they are the
conjugate base, they wouldn't

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.460
do anything.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.100
So you can only do this,
remember, for

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.100
weak acids and bases.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.810
So with that said, let's see if
we can find a relationship

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.910
between Ka and Kb.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.290
What do we have here?

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.705
We have an A minus on
both sides of this.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.003
We have H over-- OH
over A minus.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.560
Let's solve for A minus.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.850
Right?

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.450
If we multiply both sides of
this equation by HA over H

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:15.980
plus, on the left-hand
side we get Ka times

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.710
the inverse of this.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:28.960
So you have your HA over
H plus is equal to your

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.620
concentration of your
conjugate base.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.790
A minus.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.905
And let's do the same
thing here.

00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:34.900
Solve for A minus.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.100
So to solve for A minus here,
we might have to do 2 steps.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.970
So if we take the inverse of
both sides, you get 1 over Kb

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:54.990
is equal to A minus over H,
the concentration of my

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.090
conjugate acid times the
concentration of hydroxide.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.130
Multiply both sides by this.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:09.460
And I get A minus is equal
to my concentration of my

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.790
conjugate acid times
concentration of hydroxide.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.220
All of that over my base
equilibrium constant.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.240
Now, these are the
same reactions.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.820
Right?

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.020
In either reaction for given
concentrations, I'm going to

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.150
end up with the same
concentration.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.290
This is going to equal that.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.850
Right?

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.610
These are two different
ways of writing

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.110
the exact same reaction.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.410
So let's set them equal
to each other.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.210
So let me copy and paste
it, actually.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:46.120
So I'm saying that this thing,
copy, is equal to this thing

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.380
right here.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:58.220
So this is equal to-- let me
copy and paste this-- that.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.230
That's equal to that.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.400
So let's see if we can
find a relationship

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.760
between Ka and Kb.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.770
Well, one thing we can
do is we can divide

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.070
both sides by HA.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.765
Right?

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:13.680
So if we divide both
sides by HA.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.580
Actually, I could probably have
that earlier on to the

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.830
whole thing.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.670
If we ignore this part right
here, this is equal to that.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.110
Let me erase all of this.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.420
Oh.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.250
I'm using the wrong tool.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.320
So we could say that
they both equal the

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.680
concentration of A minus.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.130
So that's equal to that.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.290
We can divide both
sides by HA.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:46.040
This over here will cancel
with this over here.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.050
And we're getting pretty close
to a neat relationship.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:58.710
And so we get Ka over our
hydrogen proton concentration

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:06.100
is equal to our hydroxide
concentration divided by Kb.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.980
You can just cross-multiply
this.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.660
So we get Ka, our acidic
equilibrium concentration,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:19.990
times Kb is equal to our
hydrogen concentration times

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.480
our hydroxide concentration.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.150
Remember, this is all in
an aqueous solution.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.110
What do we know about this?

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.470
What do we know about our
hydrogen times our hydroxide

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.299
concentration in an
aqueous solution?

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.580
For example, let me review just
to make sure I'm jogging

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.970
your memory properly.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.560
We could have H2O.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.170
It can autoionize into H plus.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.760
Plus OH minus.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.790
And this has an equilibrium.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.660
K sub w.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.880
You just put the products.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.320
So the concentration of the
hydrogen protons times the

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.600
concentration of the
hydroxide ions.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.370
And you don't divide by this
because it's the solvent.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.550
And we already figured
out what this was.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.590
If we have just completely
neutral water, this is 10 to

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.910
the minus 7.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.880
And this is 10 to the minus 7.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.130
So this is equal to 10
to the minus 14.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.600
Now, these two things
could change.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.600
I can add more hydrogen, I
could add more hydroxide.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.830
And everything we've talked
about so far, that's what

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.470
we've been doing.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.000
That's what acids
and bases do.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.960
They either increase this
or they increase that.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.080
But the fact that this is an
equilibrium constant means

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.090
that, look, I don't care
what you do to this.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.590
At the end of the day, this
will adjust for your new

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.650
reality of hydrogen protons.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.880
And this will always
be a constant.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.200
As long as we're in an aqueous
solution, a solution of water

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:58.790
where water is a solvent
at 25 degrees.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.900
I mean, in just pure water
it's 10 to the minus 7.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.090
But no matter what we do to this
and this in an aqueous

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.510
solution, the product is always
going to be 10 to the

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.550
minus 14th power.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.950
So that's the answer
to this question.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.630
This is always going to
be 10 to the minus 14.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.500
If you multiply hydrogen
concentration times OH

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.390
concentration.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.140
Now they won't each be 10 to the
minus 7 anymore, because

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.010
we're dealing with a weak
acid or a weak base.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.170
So they're actually going
to change these things.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.040
But when you multiply them,
you're still going to get 10

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.770
to the minus 14.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.910
And let's just take the minus
log of both sides of that.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.800
Let me erase all this stuff
I did down here.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.700
I'll need the space.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.640
Let's say we take the
minus logs of both

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.100
sides of this equation.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.120
So you get the-- let me do a
different color-- minus log,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.750
of course it's base 10, of Ka.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.640
Let me do it in the colors.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:04.970
Ka times Kb is going to be equal
to the minus log of 10

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.330
to the minus 14.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.590
So what is this equal to?

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.590
The log of 10 to the minus 14
is minus 14, because 10 to

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.470
minus 14th power is equal
to 10 to the minus 14.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.440
You take the negative of that,
so this becomes 14.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.610
So the right-hand side of your
equation just becomes 14.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.540
And this one, we could
use log properties.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.160
This is same thing as
the minus log of Ka.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.270
We use the colors.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:37.640
Ka plus the minus log of Kb.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.800
Or, though you could think of
this-- this is your pKa, this

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.030
is your pKb.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:51.795
So you can say, this
is pKa plus pKb.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.610
Oh, I wanted to use blue.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:02.330
Plus pKb, and all of that's
going to be equal to 14.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.420
Now why is this useful?

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.650
Well, if you know the pKa for
a weak acid-- For example,

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:14.500
let's say we have NH4 plus.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.810
This is a weak acid, right?

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.830
It can donate an H, but it's not
an irreversible reaction.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.980
That H can be gained back.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.390
So this is a weak acid.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:29.150
If you look it up on Wikipedia,
it'll say, hey, the

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:38.800
pKa of NH4 is equal to 9.25.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.140
Right?

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.570
So this is 9.25 for NH4.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.310
For ammonium.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.390
So what is going to be
the pKb for ammonia?

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:48.720
Right?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.240
Let me write that
reaction down.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.020
So this is NH4.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.100
Is in equilibrium.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:57.810
This is plus.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.290
It can get rid of one of its
hydrogen protons, and you're

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.000
just left with ammonia.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.420
So this is the acidic
reaction.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.550
So this is what the pKa
is associated with.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.790
So the equilibrium constant
for this reaction is-- the

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.380
negative log of the equilibrium

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.130
constant is equal to 9.25.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.230
And if I had the reverse
reaction, the conjugate base

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.210
reaction, so ammonia converts
to ammonium.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:33.980
Plus it grabbed that hydrogen
proton from a water molecule.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.680
If I wanted to figure out the
pKb, or the equilibrium

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.810
constant, or the negative log
of the equilibrium constant

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.860
for this reaction, what is it?

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.110
Well, this one's 9.25.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.470
And 9.25 plus this pKb have
to be equal to 14.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.500
So what's 14 minus 9.25?

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.550
It's what, 4.75.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:58.060
So we immediately know the
equilibrium constant for the

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.710
conjugate base reaction.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:00.840
So it's a useful
thing to know.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.040
That the pKa plus the
pKb is equal to 14.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.190
And always remember, you see
these pKa and pKb, and you

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.880
say, what is that?

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.250
Well, if you see a p, it's a
negative log of something.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.680
And in this case, it's the
negative log of the

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.460
equilibrium constant for
an acidic reaction.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.890
Plus the negative log of the
equilibrium basic reaction,

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.230
where this is the conjugate
base of this acid.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.150
It's always going to be equal to
14 if we're dealing with an

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.260
aqueous solution at 25 degrees
Celsius, which is essentially

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.460
room temperature, which is
usually going to be the case.
