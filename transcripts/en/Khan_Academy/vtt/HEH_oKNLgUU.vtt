00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.900
In the last video, we found the
slope at a particular point of

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.035
the curve y is equal
to x squared.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:09.700
But let's see if we can
generalize this and come up

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.780
with a formula that finds us
the slope at any point of the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.350
curve y is equal to x squared.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.000
So let me redraw
my function here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.720
It never hurts to
have a nice drawing.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.530
So that is my y-axis.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.420
That is my x-axis right there.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.580
My x-axis.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.670
Let me draw my curve.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.900
It looks something like that.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.210
You've seen that
multiple times.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.970
This is y is equal
to x squared.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.740
So let's be very
general right now.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.600
Remember, if we want to find--
let me just write the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600
definition of our derivative.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.450
So if we have some point right
here-- let's call that x.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.630
So we want to be very general.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.470
We want to find the
slope at the point x.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.190
We want to find a function
where you give me an x

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.010
and I'll tell you the
slope at that point.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.800
We're going to call
that f prime of x.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.210
That's going to be the
derivative of f of x.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.830
But all it does is, look, f of
x, you give-- it's a function

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.670
that you give it an x, and it
tells you the value of that.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.810
And we draw the curve here.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.470
With f of x, you give that same
x but it's not going to tell

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.050
you the value of the curve.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.760
It's not going to say,
oh, this is your f of x.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.855
It's going to give you the
value of the slope of

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:26.280
the curve at that point.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.790
So f of x, if you put it into
that function, it should tell

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.540
you, oh, the slope at that
point, is equal to-- you know,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.360
if you put 3 there, you'll say,
oh, the slope there

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.220
is equal to 6.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.590
We saw that in the
last example.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.410
So that's what we want to do.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.600
And we saw on the last-- I
think it was 2-- videos ago,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.130
that we defined f prime of x
to be equal to-- just the--

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.470
well, I'll write it this way.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.210
It's the slope of the secant
line between x and some

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.540
point that's a little
bit further away from x.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.640
So the slope of the secant
line is change in y.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.940
So it's the y value of the
point that's a little

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.290
bit further away from x.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.630
So f of x plus h minus
the y value at x, right?

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.600
Because this is right here.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.200
This is f of x.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.820
So minus f of x.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.830
All of that over
the change in x.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.620
So if this is x plus h
here, the change in x

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.740
is x plus h minus x.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.470
Or this distance right
here is just h.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.830
The change in x is going
to be equal to h.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.150
So that's just slope of
the secant line, between

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.240
any 2 points like that.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.880
And we said, hey, we could find
the slope of the tangent line

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.390
if we just take the limit of
this as it approaches--

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.060
as h approaches 0.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.930
And then we'll be finding the
slope of the tangent line.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.060
Now let's apply this idea to
a particular function, f of

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.970
x is equal to x squared.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.430
Or y is equal to x squared.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.800
So here, we could have the
point-- we could consider this

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.910
to be the point x-- x squared.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.380
So f of x is just
equal to x squared.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.040
And then this would be the
point-- let me do it in

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.140
a more vibrant color.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.510
This is the point x plus h--
that's this point right here.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.040
It's a little bit further down.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.770
And then x plus h squared.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.880
And you know, in the
last video, we did this

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.500
for a particular x.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.590
We did it for 3.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.330
But now I want a
general formula.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.300
You give me any x and I won't
have to do what I did in the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.330
last video for any
particular number.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.490
I'll have a general function.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.570
You give me 7, I'll tell you
what the slope is at 7.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.260
You give me negative 3, I'll
tell you what the slope

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.300
is at negative 3.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.450
You give me 100,000,
I'll tell you what the

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.690
slope is at 100,000.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.310
So let's apply it here.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.740
So we want to find the change
in y over the change in x.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.190
So first of all, the change
in y is this guy's y value,

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.975
which is x plus h squared.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.290
That's this guy's y
value right here.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.270
That's this right here.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.730
That's x plus h squared.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.380
I just took x plus h,
evaluated, I squared it, and

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.820
that's its point on the curve.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.930
So it's x plus h squared.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.630
So that's there right there.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.080
And then what's this value?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.230
f of x right here is equal to--
I know it's getting messy--

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.310
is equal to x squared.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.530
If you take your x, you
evaluate the function

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.600
at that point, you're
going to get x squared.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.300
So it's equal to
minus x squared.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.900
This is your change in y.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.090
That's this distance
right there.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.110
And just to relate it to our
definition of a derivative,

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.820
this blue thing right here is
equivalent to this

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.570
thing right here.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.140
We just evaluated our function.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.850
Our function is f of x
is equal to x squared.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.310
We just evaluated when x
is equal to x plus h.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.920
So if you have to square
it, if I put an a there,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.540
it'd be a squared.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.200
If I put an apple there,
it'd be apple squared.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.970
If I put an x plus h in
there, it's going to

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.580
be x plus h squared.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.210
So this is that thing.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.420
And then, this thing right here
is just the function evaluated

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.810
at the point in question.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.440
Right there.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.120
So this is our change in y.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.920
And let's divide that
by our change in x.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.730
Our change in x-- if this is x
plus h and this is just x, our

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.360
change in x is just
going to be h.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.880
So that's where we
get that term from.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.670
So this is just a slope
between these 2 points.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.350
This is just a slope
between those two points.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.690
But, of course, we want to
find-- the limit at this point

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.500
gets closer and closer to this
point, and this point gets

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.790
closer and closer
to that point.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.530
So this becomes a tangent line.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.480
So we're going to take the
limit as h approaches 0, and

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.250
this is our f prime of x.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.580
And this is the exact same
definition of this, instead

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.400
of being general and saying,
for any function, we know

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.380
what the function was.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.680
It was f of x is
equal to x squared.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.660
So we actually applied it.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.350
Instead of f of x,
we wrote x squared.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.950
Instead of f of x plus h,
we wrote x plus h squared.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.180
So let's see if we can
evaluate this limit.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:04.680
So this is going to be equal
to the limit as h approaches

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.680
0 to square this out.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.160
I'll do it in the same color.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:19.230
That's x squared plus 2xh plus
h squared, and then we have

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.320
this minus x squared over here.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.790
I just multiplied this
guy out over here.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.635
And then all of that
is divided by h.

00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:30.850
Now let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.610
Well, you immediately see you
have an x squared and you

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.390
have a minus x squared,
so those cancel out.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.570
And then we can divide
the numerator and the

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.185
denominator by h.

00:06:38.185 --> 00:06:44.780
So this simplifies to-- so we
get f prime of x is equal to--

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.590
if we divide the numerator and
the denominator by h--

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.260
we get 2x plus h.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.070
I'm sorry, I forgot my limit.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.420
It equals the limit.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.330
Very important.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:01.200
Limit as h approaches 0 of
divide everything by h, and

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.640
you get 2x plus h squared
divided by h is h.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.440
And if you remember the last
video, when we did it with a

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.780
particular x, we said x is
equal to 3, we got 6

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.920
plus delta x here.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.420
Or 6 plus h here, so
it's very similar.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.130
So if you take the limited h
approaches 0 here, that's

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.010
just going to disappear.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.240
So this is just going
to be equal to 2x.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.540
So we just figured out that if
f of x-- this is a big result.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.180
This is exciting!

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.130
That if f of x is equal
to x squared, f prime

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.910
of x is equal to 2x.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.470
That's what we
just figured out.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.570
And I wanted to make
sure you understand

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.880
how to interpret this.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.780
f of x, if you give me a value,
is going to tell you the value

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.560
of the function at that point.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.920
At prime of x it's
going to tell you the

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.960
slope at that point.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.180
Let me draw that.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.490
Because this is a
key realization.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.220
And you might, you know, it's
kind of maybe initially

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.590
unintuitive to think of a
function that gives us the

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.040
slope, at any point,
of another function.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.070
So it looks like this.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.650
Let me draw a little
neater than that.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.290
Ah, it's still not that neat.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.280
That's satisfactory.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.650
Let me just draw it in
the positive coordinate.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.640
Well, I'll just draw the
whole-- the curve looks

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.450
something like that.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.090
Now this is the
curve of f of x.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.050
This is the curve of f of
x is equal to x squared.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.230
Just like that.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.490
So if you give me a point.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.840
You give me the point 7.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.610
You apply, you put it in
here, you square it.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.460
And it is mapped
to the number 49.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.170
So you get the number
49 right there.

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.620
This is the number 7, 49.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.940
You're used to dealing with
functions right there.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.630
But what is f prime of 7?

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.000
f prime of 7.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.740
You say, 2 times 7
is equal to 14.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.990
What is this 14 number here?

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.380
What is this thing?

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.440
Well, this is the slope
of the tangent line

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.030
at x is equal to 7.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.330
So if I were to take that point
and draw a tangent line-- a

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.930
point that just grazes our
curve-- if I were to just

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:03.890
draw a tangent line.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.410
That wasn't tangent
enough for me.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.790
So that's my tangent
line right there.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.200
You get the idea.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.660
The slope of this guy-- you do
your change in y over your

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.260
change in x-- is going
to be equal to 14.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.880
The slope of the curve
at y is equal to 7-- is

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.270
a pretty steep curve.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.990
If you wanted to find the
slope, let's say that this

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.910
is y-- let's say it's
x is equal to 2.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.290
I said at x is equal to
7, the slope is 14.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.900
At x is equal to 2,
what is the slope?

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.230
Well, you figure out f prime of
2, which is equal to 2 times

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.880
2, which is equal to 4.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.990
So the slope here is 4.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.520
You could say m is equal
to 4. m for slope.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.560
What is f prime of 0?

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.170
f prime.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.120
We know that f of
0 is 0, right?

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.120
0 squared is 0.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.710
But what is f prime of 0?

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.180
Well, 2 times 0 is 0.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.480
That's also equal to 0.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.350
But what does that mean?

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.100
What's the interpretation?

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.850
It means the slope of
the tangent line is 0.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.390
So a 0 sloped line
looks like this.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.920
Looks just like a
horizontal line.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.370
And that looks about right.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.220
A horizontal line would
be tangent to the

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.910
curve at y equals 0.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.620
Let's try another one.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:23.190
Let's try the point minus 1.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.290
So let's say we're right
there. x is equal to minus 1.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.220
So f of minus 1, you
just square it.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.380
Because we're dealing
with x squared.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.570
So it's equal to 1.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.180
That's that point right there.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.680
What is f prime of minus 1?

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.050
f prime of minus 1
is 2 times minus 1.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.340
2 times minus is minus 2.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.650
What does that mean?

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.680
It means that the slope of the
tangent line at x is equal to

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.050
1, to this curve, to the
function, is minus 2.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.600
So if I were to draw the
tangent line here-- the tangent

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.140
line looks like that-- and
look, it is a downward

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:57.700
sloping line.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.450
And it makes sense.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:04.700
The slope here is
equal to minus 2.
