00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.750
Let's continue with this example
and I welcome you to

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.120
throw examples my way, and we
can think about whether

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.420
something is consumption
or investment.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.590
And my argument, in general,
is that investment is

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.100
something good for society.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.340
It's good for you.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.030
It is capital, right?

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.350
Or money that's being put to
work to create more wealth or

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.400
more capital or more
good for society.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.100
While consumption is capital
that is, essentially, being

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.730
burned in some way, usually for
some type of social status

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.980
or ego gratification.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.750
Well, let's think about that.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.610
What about a going out once a
month-- Let's say a vacation,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.850
this is an interesting case.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.970
A simple vacation with family.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.370
Maybe it's a family reunion,
depending on your family, it

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.360
might be simple, or it might
be relaxing, it might not.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.530
But let's assume this is
a relaxing vacation.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.720
You're going camping,
or you're going

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.770
to Yosemite or something.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.860
It's a very peaceful, tranquil
thing to do.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.590
So your original gut reaction
would be, well, if we take a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.340
vacation, me and my family,
we're going to take time off,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.820
we're not going to work,
my kids aren't

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.850
going to be in school.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.460
So you might say, oh, well,
that's consumption because

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.270
we're going to spend money.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.120
Let's say, the vacation
cost $2,000, right?

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.190
We're spending $2,000
on this vacation.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.150
So that might be an investment,
or that might be

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.670
consumption.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.830
So, at first you might say
that's consumption, you're not

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.840
going to be working.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.530
Once you go on that vacation,
there's nothing left over.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.650
But there could be a counter
argument here.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.460
There could be an argument that,
by taking this simple

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.120
vacation with the family, it
recenters you, it bonds with

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.910
your family, it makes you
a happier human being.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.530
And it makes you more likely
to be able to contribute to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.980
society once you
get back home.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.980
And if you didn't take this
vacation, you would

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.390
eventually burn out.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.920
So in this example, and it
depends on what you consider a

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.280
simple vacation, I would
consider that actually,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.260
probably an investment.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.560
Especially if it makes you more
relaxed, it eases your

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.070
brain, it allows you to become
more creative and more

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.090
productive for society.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.250
That could be an investment.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.680
That's why I think it's
important that

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.190
people don't overwork.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.360
Now, what if I were to take me
and my family and we were to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.480
have someone carry us or we rode
on someone's back as they

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.470
swam across the ocean to go stay
in golden thrones while

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.480
an army of people
danced for us.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.760
Right?

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.155
So let's say, an extravagant
vacation.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.570
So you could argue a lot of
things, this is, I have a

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.780
family of four and let's say
it costs me $200,000.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.300
Well here, there's
a couple things.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.780
There might be some part of this
vacation that makes you

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.440
more relaxed and might make
you more productive.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.690
I'd argue that it is probably
the opposite, the extravagant

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.770
vacation is probably going to
make you more stressed and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.620
probably feed your ego in ways
that are in some ways

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.910
self-destructive.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.750
But let's say that there is some
component, let's stick to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.590
the benefit of the doubt,
that does relax you.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.150
And I would say that that
component is an investment.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.780
But you know what?

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.490
You probably could have gotten
that for $2,000.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.160
So we could say that $2,000
of this is something of an

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:25.890
investment and that $198,000
of this probably is

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.460
consumption.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.110
Because it's not making
you more productive.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.570
Sure enough, when you go to this
place, it is giving those

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.750
people something to do and it
is giving them jobs, but I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.400
would call that a transfer
of wealth.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.730
This isn't investment.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.670
When you go to whatever country
you decide to go to

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.380
and you blow, essentially,
$198,000 that you didn't need

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.200
to just because it feels good
to have the locals dote on

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.550
you, you're transferring
money to them.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.060
And then, maybe, they transfer
that money to someone else,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.000
but it in no way is increasing
the wealth of the world.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.120
It's not leading to innovation;
it's not leading

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.550
to more factories; and
it's not leading to

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.040
the pie getting bigger.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.510
And you know what?

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.200
I don't even think this is,
necessarily, a bad idea

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.840
because, frankly, this is just
the transfer of wealth from

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.744
someone who needs ego
gratification to a transfer of

00:04:18.744 --> 00:04:21.470
wealth from someone who's
willing to do fairly simple

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.480
things to, essentially, take
that wealth from them.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.960
But, at the end of the day,
it is consumption.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.190
And I think you can imagine,
let's say, a simple purse.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.990
My wife goes out and buys
a purse from Target

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.440
and it costs $20.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.960
Is that consumption or is
that an investment?

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.290
Well, I'd argue that that's
an investment.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.480
Maybe her old purse is falling
apart and by having a new

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.080
purse, maybe it helps her get
a job, be more productive;

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.980
maybe it helps her get
more organized.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.255
So this could be
an investment.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.670
And what about a Louis Vuitton--
not to pick on them

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.390
in particular-- but what about
a Louis Vuitton purse.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.690
I don't know how much they--
I don't even know

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.590
how to spell it.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.560
I think these cost upwards
of $2,000, or whatever.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.750
Well, this, clearly, is some
form of consumption.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.310
You could maybe make some
argument that in certain

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.650
circles, you could get a job
if you carry around one of

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.000
these purses.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.450
But there's some basic core
value to it that you probably

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.220
could have gotten with
a simple purse.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.065
So that, maybe, is $20
of investment.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.790
And then the rest of it, I don't
know, the other $1,980,

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.166
is consumption.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:40.450
Now, I'll ask you a further
question: do you think that

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.490
this is bad or good
for society?

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.990
Well, I'd actually argue that
it's probably neutral for

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.430
society, because it does look
like a quote, unquote, waste

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.830
of money, this extra almost
$2,000 that you spent that you

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.050
really didn't have to, to get
something of fairly basic

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.890
utility, but that those
resources weren't burned.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.720
Those resources went from,
frankly, someone who just

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.110
wanted some ego gratification.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.680
It went from someone's
ego, essentially.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.780
So let's say this is
you, or your ego.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.260
And this is Louis Vuitton,
the company.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.980
So you gave them $1,980 that
you didn't have to.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.210
Their cost of making the purse
probably didn't cost a lot

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.750
more than that simple purse.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.730
And in exchange, they gave
you ego gratification.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.690
So they really didn't have to
waste a lot of resources.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.720
They gave you all of this brand
imagery that makes you

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.970
feel better about yourself.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.830
So I would argue that this
capital actually didn't get

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.350
lost, it just got transferred
from someone who was probably

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.960
a little insecure to someone
who knows how to sell to

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.070
insecure people.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.950
And then Louis Vuitton will then
have that $1,980 and then

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.400
who knows, maybe they give that
to their private equity

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.220
friend or their venture capital
friend, and then that

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.870
gets invested in some new
start-up idea, some solar-cell

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.120
company that actually can create
energy from the sun.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.280
And in which case, that money
did not go wasted.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.970
So they might actually
invest it in solar.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.330
So this, actually, was
not a waste of money.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.300
Although, this transaction, I
would agree, is consumption.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.490
I would say that the waste
of money is all of the

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.050
advertising and all the
sponsorship that Louis Vuitton

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.110
has to do to convince you that
this will make you, somehow, a

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.260
better person if you
buy that purse.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.515
Because those ads you see on TV
with those people you want

00:07:30.515 --> 00:07:34.630
to look like, that will not
give you-- that is not

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.570
creating any net wealth for the
world, or is not making

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.830
the pie any bigger.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.820
Anyway, let me think of
another example here.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.090
Well, let's say, so this example
with the Louis Vuitton

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.550
purse, this is just a
transfer of wealth.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:53.152
But let's say, instead of doing
that, you had your ego

00:07:53.152 --> 00:07:56.510
and instead of buying a Louis
Vuitton purse, you just-- so

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:08.740
this is you-- you thought it
would be nice-- but let's say,

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.300
you thought it was nice, instead
of buying a Louis

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.580
Vuitton purse, which we
established would just be a

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.480
transfer of wealth-- it is
consumption, but at least that

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.980
money doesn't disappear-- let's
say that you wanted to

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:22.690
pay $2,000 to have-- I don't
know-- $10 an hour, you can

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:33.510
have 200 people dance for you
and recite your name and talk

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.919
about what an amazing
person you are.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.400
This, I would argue, is
pure consumption.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.520
Because those 200 people, sure
this money gets transferred to

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.910
them, but they didn't
do anything

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.200
productive with that time.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:47.460
Right?

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.300
Those 200 people, they could
have been tilling the soil;

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.120
they could have been working in
a factory; they could have

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.970
been teaching their children how
to read; they could have

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.570
been doing something that was
productive for society.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.580
But instead, they spent one hour
dancing for you for your

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.210
ego gratification.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.960
And this is, in my mind, the
worst form of consumption

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.930
because, not only-- it's not
just the transfer of wealth,

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.340
it is the destruction
of wealth.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.930
Because 200 people's time is
wealth, that is capital that

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.180
could be used to improve
someone's life.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.330
But instead, this $2,000 was,
essentially destroyed.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.590
Sure, it goes to those
people, right?

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.310
But in the end, they didn't
create anything in

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.200
that amount of time.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.870
And I'll touch more
about that anyway.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.930
In essence, the amount of money
didn't change in the

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.310
system, but the amount of
value in the system got

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.810
degraded because all these
people time got wasted.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.940
And, In the end, that actually
leads to inflation.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.830
If you have more money in a
system with less productive

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:47.110
goods and services, the price
for our productive goods and

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.740
services goes up.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.520
But anyway, I'm out
of time again.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.940
But I encourage you to think as
much as you can about just

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.170
this idea: when you spend money,
is it consumption or is

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.880
it investment?

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.860
And I'll continue this more into
kind of a lot of what the

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.430
government tells you to do when
the economy goes down.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.110
How they say, go by yourself a
nice dress, instead of saying,

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.390
hey why don't you go
build a factory?

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.270
Or why don't you save your
money and invest in your

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.270
child's education?

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.560
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
