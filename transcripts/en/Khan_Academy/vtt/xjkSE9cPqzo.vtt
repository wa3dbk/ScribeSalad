00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.720
My cousin Nadia is taking a
summer calculus course and

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.670
she called me last night.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.150
And she had some limit
problems and they were

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.020
excellent problem.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.050
So I thought it was worthwhile
to make videos on the problems

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.040
that she had to figure out.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.830
Anyway, so let's do them.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.930
If I remember them correctly.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.070
I'm doing this on memory.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.785
So I hope the answers work out
like they did last night when

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.500
we were going over
them on the phone.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.750
So if I remember correctly,
the first one was the limit

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.530
as z approaches 2 of x.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.870
Oh no.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.440
Not that-- There's no x.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.230
It's a z.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:50.080
Of z squared plus 2z minus 8.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.020
All of that over z to
the fourth minus 16.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.810
So the first thing when you
want to do when you try a limit

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.270
problem is, well you just try
to substitute the value into--

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.970
Maybe there's no problem when z
equals 2 and you just evaluate

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.820
the function at z equals 2.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.980
If it's a continuous function,
then the limit as z

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.480
approaches 2 is going to
be the function at 2.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.410
But you immediately see a
problem if you put 2 right

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.850
here-- 2 to the fourth minus
16 --and you get a 0 in the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.970
denominator, which is
undefined, so we have to

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.590
figure out some way
to get around that.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.600
And nine times out of 10, when
you see a problem like this,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.650
the solution, because both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.330
look factorable, is to factor
the numerator and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.130
the denominator.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.130
So this is equal to the
limit as z approaches 2.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.940
What's the numerator factored?

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.400
Let's see.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.550
Something when you add two
numbers, you get positive

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.490
2, and you multiply
them, you get minus 8.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.370
So it's probably plus
4 and minus 2, right?

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.380
So this is going to
be x plus-- No.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.510
Not an x.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.140
I'm so conditioned.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.300
I'm like a dog.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.380
Oh.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.730
I can't even undo it anymore.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.440
Anyway, well z-- Actually
let me erase that.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.536
I don't want to be messy.

00:02:12.536 --> 00:02:13.810
Let me erase.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.130
I tried to undo it and it
doesn't remember everything.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.220
So it's z plus 4
times z minus 2.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.300
That's just factoring
a quadratic.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.420
And what is this?

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.130
This has the form a squared
minus b squared, right?

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.380
So that's going to be-- But a
squared-- If this is a squared

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.450
minus b squared, a would
be z squared, right?

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.330
So it's z squared plus 4
times z squared minus 4.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.830
And then, of course, this
also has the form a squared

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.790
plus b squared, right?

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:02.110
So this will further factor
into z plus 2 times z minus 2.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.790
Well, our factoring paid off.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.280
We see a term in the numerator
and the denominator

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.230
that are the same.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.630
And not only are they the
same, but they-- This is

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.570
the term that was giving
us the problems, right?

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.510
Because you put a 2 in
here, you got a 0.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.590
So let's assume that we're not
evaluating it at z equals 2.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.420
And so, for all other
values, we can divide those

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.430
because those are going
to be the same values.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.260
And then what are we left with?

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.150
This is equal to the limit--
and I've change colors

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:40.060
arbitrarily --as z approaches
2 of z plus 4 over z squared

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.870
plus 4 times z plus 2.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.240
Which is equal what?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.000
That's equal to 6 over--
what's 2 squared plus 4?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.880
Is 8.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.570
And then 2 plus 2 is 4.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.820
6 over 12 is equal to 1/2.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.250
There you go.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.820
I thought that was a pretty
interesting problem.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.980
Let's do another one.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.290
And this one I found
even more interesting.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.160
She gave me-- It's really
testing my memory to see

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.860
if I can-- But I remember
the gist of the problem.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.640
So I might not get the exact
numbers she'd given me, but

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.930
hopefully I get the
exact properties.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:27.250
So it's the limit as x
approaches infinity of the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:40.080
square root of x squared
plus 4x plus 1 minus x.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.860
So when you look at this
you're like well let's see.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.070
What's happening here?

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.160
Let's see this.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.460
As you go to infinity, this
term will get really big.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.750
But then we're taking
the square root of it.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.810
And it seems like this term
would overpower this term.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.460
And then, so maybe this kind
of converges to x, but then

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.670
we would subtract an x.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.700
So maybe it approaches 0.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.860
So that's, at least, that
was my first intuition

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.860
when I spoke to her.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.930
But as we will see, the
intuition here is wrong.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.050
And really to do this you
have to know a little

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.340
bit of a trick.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.470
And this trick pays off a lot
whenever you see something with

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.950
the square root sign, then
subtracting something else, if

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.730
you want to get rid of
that square root sign.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.120
So what we are going to do is
going to multiply-- Essentially

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.380
the conjugate we normally
apply to complex numbers.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.300
But if we have something like
a plus b, the conjugate

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.920
is a minus b, right?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.630
Or if we have something
like a minus b, the

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.300
conjugate is a plus b.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.150
And the reason why-- And what
we're going to do is we're

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.650
going to multiply by
the conjugate of this.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.060
And why does-- Why
is that normal?

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.880
Why is that useful?

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.065
Because we have a minus b.

00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:46.110
If we multiply it times a
plus b, we get a squared

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.440
minus b squared.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.530
Which will make this radical
sign disappear without

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.240
too much work.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.190
So let's do that.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.560
Let's multiply by the
conjugate of this thing.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.060
But we can't just
multiply it, right?

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.800
We have to multiply it
by it over itself.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.790
Because you can only-- To not
change the value of something,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.140
you can only multiply it by 1.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:09.020
So let's multiply it by the
conjugate: x squared plus

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.930
4x plus 1 plus x, right?

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:16.630
That's the conjugate, right?

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.660
Instead of minus x,
we have a plus x.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.780
And we can't just
multiply that.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.360
We have to multiply it by
1, otherwise we would

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.240
be changing the value.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.440
So it's going to be divided
by the same thing.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.630
x squared plus 4x
plus 1 plus x.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.610
Let me erase this stuff
down here so we don't

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.970
get distracted.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.770
Don't want to get distracted.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.930
And so what do we have?

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:48.530
This will become the limit
as x approaches infinity.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.240
Well, this is a minus
b times a plus b.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.560
So we end up with a squared.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.340
Well, what's this squared?

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:01.250
That's x squared plus 4x
plus 1 minus b squared.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.600
Well what's b squared?

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.350
Well, b is x.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.400
So it's going to be
minus x squared.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.740
This is just algebra.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:15.150
Divided by this thing: the
square root of x squared

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:21.995
plus 4x plus 1 plus x.

00:07:21.995 --> 00:07:22.720
So let's see.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.400
There's a little
simplification we can do.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.900
We can subtract-- We can--
These top two terms cancel out.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.820
So x squared minus x squared.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.890
And now let's see
what we can do.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.700
Well since we're taking x
to infinity, and this is

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.490
what you normally do what
you take x to infinity.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.270
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.730
our highest degree term.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.800
And in this case, our highest
degree terms is x, right?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.520
We have an x here
and an x here.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.080
And then when you take-- And
then, of course, when you

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.725
divide something like this
by x, and you take it to,

00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:56.070
infinity, this will approach 0.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.180
So let's do that.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.440
Let's divide the numerator
and the denominator by x.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.000
And remember: anything you do
in the numerator, you have

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.700
to do in the denominator.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.420
Otherwise you're
changing the value.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.630
So times 1 over x
over 1 over x.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.350
I'm just dividing the numerator
and the denominator by x.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:16.360
So this is equal to the limit
as x approaches infinity of--

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:24.620
What's-- That's going to
be 4 plus 1 over x over--

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.420
Let me ask you a question.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.320
What is 1 over x
times this thing?

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.920
What is-- This is a bit of an
algebra review, but 1 over x.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.230
What's 1 over x times x
squared plus 4x plus 1?

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.150
I'm just doing a little
on the side here.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.360
Well if we take the 1 over
x and we put it into the

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.310
radical sign, it becomes
1 over x squared, right?

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:50.630
This is the same thing as--
You can say 1 squared

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.660
over x squared, but--
1 over x squared.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.890
You could say 1 squared.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.640
You could put a square there,
but-- Times x squared

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.410
plus 4x plus 1.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.250
And that should make
sense to you, right?

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.380
Because if we started with
this, we could easily just

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.980
take the square root of
this and take it outside.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.325
And the square root
of this is 1 over x.

00:09:09.325 --> 00:09:11.640
I'm just going in the
other direction, right?

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.050
So, assuming you're comfortable
with that, everything

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.020
under the radical sign.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.070
Even though we're actually
dividing by 1 over x, since

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.060
we're going into the radical
sign, we're actually

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.340
dividing by x squared.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.840
So it becomes-- this is the
radical sign --x squared

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.770
divided by x squared
is 1, right?

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.820
I hope you understand why we're
dividing by x squared here.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.860
We're actually
dividing by 1 over x.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.690
But when you put it under the
radical sign, it becomes

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.440
1 over x squared.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.540
Let me put it this way.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.800
1 over x times the
square root of a.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.140
That's the same thing.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:51.600
That equals the square
root of 1 squared over x

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.630
squared times a, right?

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.970
And this is just 1
over x squared.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.280
So that's the property, or the
algebra that we're using.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.020
So anyway, we divide all
of this by x squared.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:11.160
So that becomes a 1 plus 4
over x plus 1 over x squared.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.770
And then, of course, we divide
this one by-- This term right

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.450
here, we divide by x, right?

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.970
Because it's not in
the radical sign.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.140
So that just becomes a 1.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.150
So now what's the limit as
x approaches infinity?

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.900
Well as x approaches infinity,
this term right here

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.720
goes to 0, right?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.480
1 over infinity is 0.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.560
This term right here goes to 0.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.790
This term right here goes to 0.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.520
And so what are we left with?

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:44.270
This is equal to 4 over the
square root of 1 plus 1.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.070
Well that's just 1.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:53.040
So that equals 4 over 2,
which is equal to 2.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.840
There you go.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.860
Now let's do one more problem.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.120
This is the third
one she'd given me.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.720
In it, we had to kind of brush
off our trig identities.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.560
And really these harder limit
problems, they're all about

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.620
kind of knowing your algebra
and your trigonometry

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.150
really well.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.750
Just so you know how to
manipulate these functions.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.790
Because the limit part-- You
just have to get it into a form

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.405
where taking the limit is
fairly straightforward.

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:13.880
So let's do that trig problem.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.102
Clear image.

00:11:19.102 --> 00:11:20.950
Invert colors.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:27.110
So it was the limit
as x approaches 0

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:33.170
of cotangent of 2x.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.370
Was that it?

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.610
Yeah.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:43.080
It was cotangent of 2x
over the cosecant of x.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.870
And this one, just like
previous problems, more than

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.940
knowing your pre-calculus or
your calculus, you need to

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.020
know your trig identities.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.500
So cosecant of x.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.070
That's just 1 over sine.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.650
I remember that by saying
it's not intuitive.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.800
You would have thought that the
cosecant is 1 over cosine.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.230
But it's not.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.060
It's 1 over sine.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.740
So I remember that
it's not intuitive.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:11.480
And cotangent of 2x is equal
to 1 over tangent of 2x.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.330
And tangent is sine over
cosine, so cotangent's

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:14.610
the opposite.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:22.290
And so that equals cosine of
2x over sine of 2x, right?

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.430
OK.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.180
So what is this equal to?

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:30.100
So this is going to be the
limit as x approaches 0.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:37.740
Cotangent of 2x, we said, was
cosine of 2x over sine of 2x.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.490
And then it's going to be all
of that over the cosecant of x.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.000
Well that's just 1
over sine of x.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.820
Well if you divide by 1 over
sine of x, that's the same

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.120
thing as multiplying
by sine of x.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.780
So we have-- What do we have?

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:08.110
We have cosine-- Well we have
sine of x times cosine of 2x.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.060
All of that divided
by sine of 2x.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.610
Just doing a little arithmetic.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.910
And we have a
problem here still.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.200
Because when you take x
approaches 0, this term right

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.080
here goes to 0 and we have a 0
in the denominator, which

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.140
is just not acceptable.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.130
Because it's undefined.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.520
And that's the whole reason
why we're doing this

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.780
limit to begin with.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.230
And actually that's the first
thing you should have done.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.730
You should have tried to put it
and you would have seen that

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.070
you would've gotten a 0 value
in the denominator and it would

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:32.600
have been unevaluatable.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.170
Right.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.390
Because really, this is
just-- We haven't even

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.340
done any manipulation yet.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.190
This is the same thing as this.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.870
And if you put the 0 right
here, you get undefined.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.040
So what can we do?

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.210
Well this is where your
break out the trig or you

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.710
brush off your memory.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.270
What is the sine of 2x equal?

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.490
And this is your double-- One
of the double angle formulas.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:14:01.660
Sine of 2x is equal to 2
sine of x cosine of x.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.570
So if you know that, then
you've gone a long way because

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.290
then it becomes pretty
simple to simplify.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:13.710
So it becomes 2 sine
of x cosine of x.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.710
And if we assume that x isn't
0, it's just approaching 0, we

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:21.140
can divide the numerator and
the denominator by sine of x.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.340
And what are we left with?

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:29.870
We're left with the limit as
x approaches 0 of cosine

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:35.420
of 2x over 2 cosine of x.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.270
Well what's cosine of 0?

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.400
Cosine of 0 is 1, right?

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.010
So cosine of 2 times 0,
which is 0, that's also 1.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.560
So that is equal to 1 over--
right, cosine of 0 is

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.490
1 --over 2 times 1.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.690
So it equals 1/2.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.160
There you go.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.840
I think those are three
fairly meaty limit problems.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.020
And if you know that, you're
probably prepared for something

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.670
that your calculus teacher
might throw at you.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.960
See you in a future video.
