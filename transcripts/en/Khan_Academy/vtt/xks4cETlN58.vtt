00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.456
Let's say that f(x) is equal to x over the square root of x^2+1

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:18.675
and I want to think about the limit of f(x) as x approaches positive infinity

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:25.289
and the limit of f(x) as x approaches neagative infinity.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.271
So let's think about what these are going to be.

00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:32.336
Well, once again, and I'm not doing this in an ultra-rigorous way but more in an intuitive way

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:36.070
is to think about what this function approximately equals

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.706
as we get larger and larger and larger x'es.

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:44.205
This is the case if we're getting very positive x'es, in very positive infinity direction or very negative.

00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:48.855
Still the absolute value of those x'es are very very very large as we approach positive infinity

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.737
or negative infinity.

00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:54.003
Well, in the numerator we only have only 1 term -- we have this x term --

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.288
-- but in the denominator we have 2 terms under the radical here.

00:00:57.288 --> 00:01:01.404
And as x gets larger and larger and larger either in the positive or the negative direction

00:01:01.404 --> 00:01:05.700
this x squared term is going to really dominate this one

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.205
You can imagine, when x is 1 million, you're going to have a million squared plus one.

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:13.470
The value of the denominator is going to be dictated by this x squared term.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:22.123
So this is going to be approximately equal to x over the square root of x squared.

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:29.335
This term right over here, the 1 isn't going to matter so much when we get very very very large x'es.

00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:34.671
And this right over here -- x over the square root of x squared or x over the principle root of x squared --

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:37.739
-- this is going to be equal to x over --

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:40.374
-- if I square something and then take the principle root --

00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:43.069
-- remember that the principle root is the positive square root of something --

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.373
-- then I'm essentially taking the absolute value of x.

00:01:45.373 --> 00:01:49.737
This is going to be equal to x over the absolute value of x

00:01:49.737 --> 00:01:57.072
for x approaches infinity or for x approaches negative infinity.

00:01:57.072 --> 00:02:00.337
So, another way to say this, another way to restate these limits,

00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:04.803
is as we approach infinity, this limit, we can restate it as the limit,

00:02:04.803 --> 00:02:11.623
this is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches infinity of x over the absolute value of x.

00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:15.289
Now, for positive x'es the absolute value of x is just going to be x.

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:19.958
This is going to be x divided by x, so this is just going to be 1.

00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.621
Similarly, right over here, we take the limit as we go to negative infinity,

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:29.737
this is going to be the limit of x over the absolute value of x as x approaches negative infinity.

00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:35.003
Remember, the only reason I was able to make this statement is that f(x) and this thing right over here

00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:39.573
become very very similar, you can kind of say converge to each other,

00:02:39.573 --> 00:02:45.538
as x gets very very very large or x gets very very very very negative.

00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:50.969
Now, for negative values of x the absolute value of x is going to be positive,

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.580
x is obviously going to be negative and we're just going to get negative 1.

00:02:55.593 --> 00:03:01.138
And so using this, we can actually try to graph our function.

00:03:01.138 --> 00:03:02.336
So let's try to do that.

00:03:02.336 --> 00:03:06.706
So let's say, that is my y axis,

00:03:06.706 --> 00:03:10.405
this is my x axis,

00:03:10.405 --> 00:03:13.955
and we see that we have 2 horizontal asymptotes.

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:17.957
We have 1 horizontal asymptote at y=1,

00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:20.070
so let's say this right over here is y=1,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.602
let me draw that line as dotted line,

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:25.405
we're going to approach this thing,

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:29.204
and then we have another horizontal asymptote at y=-1.

00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:37.004
So that might be right over there, y=-1.

00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:41.537
And if we want to plot at least 1 point we can think about what does f(0) equal.

00:03:41.537 --> 00:03:50.289
So, f(0) is going to be equal to 0 over the square root of 0+1, or 0 squared plus 1.

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.540
Well that's all just going to be equal to zero.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.540
So we have this point, right over here,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.538
and we know that as x approaches infinity, we're approaching this blue, horizontal asymptote,

00:04:02.538 --> 00:04:06.235
so it might look something like this.

00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:12.669
Let me do it a little bit differently. There you go.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.289
I'll clean this up. So it might look something like this.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.337
That's not the color I wanted to use.

00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:25.271
So it might look something like that.

00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:29.592
We get closer and closer to that asymptote as x gets larger and larger

00:04:29.592 --> 00:04:38.138
and then like this -- we get closer and closer to this asymptote as x approaches negative infinity.

00:04:38.138 --> 00:04:39.802
I'm not drawing it so well.

00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:44.206
So that right over there is y=f(x).

00:04:44.206 --> 00:04:48.470
And you can verify this by taking a calculator, trying to plot more points

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.739
or using some type of graphing calculator or something.

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:54.871
But anyway, I just wanted to tackle another situation we're approaching infinity and or negative infinity

00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:57.404
and we're trying to determine the horizontal asymptotes.

00:04:57.404 --> 00:05:01.070
And remember, the key is just to say what terms dominate

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.956
as x approaches positive infinity or negative infinity.

00:05:05.956 --> 00:05:10.469
To say, well, what is that function going to approach, and it's going to approach this horizontal asymptote

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.240
in the positive direction and this one in the negative.
