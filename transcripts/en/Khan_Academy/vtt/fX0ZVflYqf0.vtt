00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.700
Welcome back.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.500
So we're on problem number 5.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.880
In the schedule above,
each session is to be

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.130
an hour and a half.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.285
Each break is to be 1/4 hour.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.830
And lunch is to be
1 hour long.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.170
If Session IV is to end at 4:30
PM, at what time should

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.980
Session I begin?

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.340
So there's actually
two ways to do it.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.730
When I just glanced at this, I
said, well, I'll just fill in

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.210
this chart.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.740
And actually, I'm going to do
that as well, just to show you

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.500
that they get the same answer.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.660
But there is a faster way
to do this problem.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.920
Essentially, what they're saying
is the day ends at

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.660
4:30, right?

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.620
Because 4:30 is the last thing
that happens in the day.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.130
And then they're saying, what
time should Session I begin?

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.280
So they're essentially
saying, what time

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.020
should the day begin?

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.470
So if we can just figure out
how many hours are in this

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.980
day, and then take that many
hours from 4:30 PM, we would

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.580
get our answer for when Session
1 should begin.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.870
So how many hours
are in the day?

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.200
Well, there's one, two,
three, four sessions.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.090
4 sessions times an hour
and a half each.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.800
Well, 4 times 1 and 1/2,
that's 6 hours.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.680
You can multiply the fractions
if you don't believe me.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.230
6 hours.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.250
There's 1 lunch.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.120
1 lunch is 1 hour.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.370
And then how many breaks
are there?

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.280
There's 2 breaks.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.510
So there's 2 breaks times 1/4.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.260
So that equals 1/2.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.043
So if we were to add up the
hours for the sessions, the

00:01:45.043 --> 00:01:49.710
lunch and the breaks, we would
get 7 and 1/2 hours.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.880
And so then you just have to
figure out, well, what is 7

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.430
and 1/2 hours before 4:30 PM?

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060
Sometimes people get
uncomfortable subtracting time

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.070
past noon, because it
gets a little weird.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.780
So the way I think about
it, break it up.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.160
Well, if I go 4 and 1/2 hours
ago, if I go from 4:30 and I

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.490
go minus 4 and 1/2 hours, then
I get to noon, right?

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.515
And so we already took
out 4 and 1/2 hours.

00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:18.460
And we want to take out 7 and
1/2, so we have 3 hours left

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.700
to take out.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.160
So 12-- you take out 3
hours, well, that's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.590
easy, that's 9:00 AM.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.670
And so that would
be our answer.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.320
That's the fast way to do it.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.770
Actually, it might not be the
fast way, because you'd have

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.650
to think about all of these
things, and you're not sure if

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.010
you subtracted right.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.800
The other option is
just fill it in.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.240
This session ends at 4:30, so
it has to begin at 4:00.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.000
Or no, sorry, it has to
begin at 3:00, right?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.900
Hour and a half.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.000
So that means this break would
have to end at 3 o'clock, and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.220
begin at 2:45.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.510
This would have had to end at
2:45, and begin at 1:15.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.590
This would have to end at
1:15, begin at 12:15.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.040
End at 12:15, if you go an hour
and a half before 12:15,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.760
2 hours would be 10:15,
so it would be 10:45.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.210
This ends at 10:45, and so it's
a 15-minute break, so it

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.590
would have to start at 10:30.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.200
And then if this ends at 10:30,
and you subtract an

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.660
hour and a half from that, you
get to 9:00 AM, which is our

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.980
answer either way.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.560
So the second way, filling it
out, actually isn't that bad.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.820
If that immediately is what
comes to you, it still didn't

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.580
take too much time.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.460
You could have done it
that way as well.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.710
Move on to the next problem.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.110
Number 6.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.360
I will change colors.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:04:05.070
If 2x minus 5, x plus 1, and 3x
minus 8 are all integers,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.600
and x plus 1 is the median
of these integers.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.035
So this is the median.

00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:10.510
Now, what does median mean?

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.130
Median just means the middle
number, right?

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:20.240
If I have a bunch of numbers--
if I have 1, 3, 7, 8, 9.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.050
The middle number here,
it's not the average.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.410
It's just what number-- half
the numbers are larger, and

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.570
half the numbers are smaller.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.660
So in this example, the middle
number would be 7.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.280
So that's all median means.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.480
So it's telling us that x plus
1 is the median number.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.050
They say, which of the
following could

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.895
be a value for x?

00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:36.070
And they give a bunch
of choices.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.930
In this type of situation, I
just try them out, because

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.810
these are pretty straightforward
equations.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.150
They're giving us pretty
clean numbers.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.700
Let's just try it out.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.710
Choice A.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.770
So 2x minus 5 is 2
times 5 minus 5.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.950
That's 10 minus 5.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.542
That equals 5.

00:04:56.542 --> 00:05:01.410
x plus 1 is 5 plus 1,
which equals 6.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.320
And this is the x plus 1 term,
so it should be our median.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.430
And then 3 times 5 minus 8.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.350
3 times 5 minus 8, well,
that's 15 minus

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.420
8 is equal to 7.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.650
Well, we lucked out.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.310
Looks like the x plus 1
term was the median.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.720
And that's probably a good
indication that they wanted us

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.200
to try out the numbers, because
they actually gave the

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.840
first choice as being the
one that worked out.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.310
So the choice is A.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.978
Move on.

00:05:30.978 --> 00:05:35.472
I'll try a different method
of deleting things.

00:05:35.472 --> 00:05:36.280
Look at that.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.550
That was pretty neat.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.695
So now we're on number 7.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.330
An exhibitor is selling
decorative wreaths at an arts

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.270
and craft show.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.430
Useless sentence.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.620
The net profit p in dollars from
the sales of the wreath

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.020
is given by-- now, this is a
useful piece of information.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:14.640
p of n is equal to 0.75n minus
50, where n is the number of

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.070
wreaths sold.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.380
How many wreaths must the
exhibitor sell in order to

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.330
earn a net profit of $100?

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.570
Well, we want this thing
to equal $100, right?

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.500
So we just set it
equal to 100.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.710
100 is equal to 0.75n
minus 50.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.270
Add 50 to both sides.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.350
150 is equal to 0.75n.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.910
And I like to write-- I like
to deal with fractions.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.620
I don't not like decimals,
but fractions are easier.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.720
This is the same
thing as 3/4 n.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.880
0.75 is the same thing as 3/4.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.200
So now we just multiply both
sides times-- something was

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.210
ringing in my computer, but
anyway-- multiply both sides

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.500
times the inverse of this
coefficient, so times 4/3.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.420
This of course cancels, so we
just have n left on the

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.580
right-hand side.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.010
And on this side,
4/3 times 150/1.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.025
The 150 cancels out
with the 3.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.330
This becomes 1.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.040
So 4 times 50 is 200.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.440
You just have a 1 in
the denominator.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.560
Is equal to n.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.570
There you go.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:38.830
The exhibitor has to sell 200
wreaths, which is choice E.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.740
Next problem, number 8, which
I will do in yellow.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:55.675
If x squared plus y squared is
equal to 73, and xy is equal

00:07:55.675 --> 00:08:01.170
to 24, what is x
plus y squared?

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.320
What happens when you multiply
x plus y squared?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.570
x plus y squared is the
same thing as x plus y

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.490
times x plus y.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.470
And this might be second nature
to you after taking a

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.090
lot of algebra, but I'll
just multiply it out

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.380
just to show you.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.482
x times x is x squared.

00:08:24.482 --> 00:08:28.300
x times y is xy.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.690
y times x is xy.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.020
And then y times
y is y squared.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:41.539
So it equals x squared plus
2xy plus y squared.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.419
Well, that's interesting.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:50.130
We know that these two terms
combined, that's x squared

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.540
plus y squared.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.650
So we know that that
equals 73.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.740
I know I'm running out of--
let me write it up here.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:02.390
So x squared plus 2xy
6 plus y squared.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.760
So these two terms are 73.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.760
So we have 73 plus-- and we
can cancel those two out.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.120
And then we have 2xy.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.000
Well, we know xy
is equal to 24.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.480
So it's 2 times 24.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.390
So it's 73 plus 48.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.410
And then, let's see.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:29.970
7-- I think this is going
to be what, 121?

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.490
If my math is not-- let's see.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.200
7, so it's 110, plus
another 11.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:36.820
Right.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.400
121.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.150
That's all there was.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.350
You just really have to expand
out x plus y squared, and then

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.430
you say, oh, well, they kind of
give you what the component

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.080
terms, what the values are,
and then we're done.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.940
I'll see you in the
next video.
