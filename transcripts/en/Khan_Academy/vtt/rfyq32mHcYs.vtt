00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.170
Now that we know a little bit
about the convolution integral

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.200
and how it applies to the
Laplace transform, let's

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.950
actually try to solve an actual
differential equation

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.270
using what we know.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.440
So I have this equation here,
this initial value problem,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.410
where it says that the second
derivative of y plus 2 times

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.380
the first derivative of y, plus
2 times y, is equal to

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.970
sine of alpha t.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.340
And they give us some
initial conditions.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.740
They tell us that y of 0 is
equal to 0, and that y prime

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.090
of 0 is equal to 0.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.350
And that's nice and convenient
that those initial conditions

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.280
tend to make the problem
pretty clean.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.170
But let's get to the problem.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.940
So the first thing we do is we
take the Laplace transform of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.960
both sides of this equation.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.470
The Laplace transform of
the second derivative

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.380
of y is just s squared.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.550
This should be a bit of second
nature to you by now.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.530
It's s squared times the Laplace
transform of Y, which

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.580
I'll just write as capital Y
of s, minus s-- so we start

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.500
with the same degree as the
number of derivatives we're

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.040
taking, and then we decrement
that every time-- minus s

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.130
times y of 0-- you kind of think
of this as the integral,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.770
and you take the derivative 1,
so this isn't exactly the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.286
derivative of that-- minus, you
decrement that 1, you just

00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:25.680
have a 1 there, y prime of o.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.210
And that's the Laplace transform
of the second

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.730
derivative.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.370
Now, we have to do the Laplace
transform of 2 times the first

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.860
derivative.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.470
That's just going to be equal
to plus 2, times sY of s-- s

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.930
times the Laplace transform
of Y; that's that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.920
there-- minus y of 0.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.010
And we just have one left.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.110
The Laplace transform of 2Y.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.530
That's just equal to plus
2 times the Laplace

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.320
transform of Y.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.060
And then that's going to be
equal to the Laplace transform

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.910
of sine of alpha t.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.300
We've done that multiple
times so far.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.840
That's just alpha over s squared
plus alpha squared.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.820
Now, the next thing we want to
do is we want to separate out

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.500
the Laplace transform of Y
terms, or the Y of s terms.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.790
Actually, even better, let's
get rid of these initial

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.640
conditions.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.460
y of 0, and y prime of 0 is
0, so this term is 0.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.230
That term is 0, and
that term is 0.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.570
So our whole expression-- I
can get rid of the colors

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.380
now-- it just becomes-- let me
pick a nice color here--

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:51.230
becomes s squared times Y of
s, plus 2s, Y of s-- that's

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.580
that term right there-- plus
2Y of s, is equal to the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.750
right-hand side, is equal to
alpha over s squared plus

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.960
alpha squared.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.390
Now let's factor out the
Y of s, or the Laplace

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.210
transform of Y.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:17.790
And so we get s squared plus 2s,
plus 2, all of that times

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.350
Y of s, is equal to this
right-hand side, is equal to

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.480
alpha over s squared,
plus alpha squared.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.350
Now we can divide both sides of
this equation by this thing

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.250
right here, by that
right there.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.870
And we get Y of s, the Laplace
transform of Y is equal to

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.570
this thing, alpha over s
squared, plus alpha squared,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.770
times-- or, you know, I could
just say times-- 1 over s

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.380
squared, plus 2s, plus 2.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.040
I could just say divided by
this, but it works out the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.700
same either way.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.590
Now, what can we do here?

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.290
Remember, I was doing this in
the context of convolution, so

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.110
I want to look for a Laplace
transform that looks like the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.820
product of two Laplace
transforms. I know what the

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.330
inverse Laplace transform
of this is.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.380
In fact, I just took it.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.890
It's sine of alpha t.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.150
So if I can figure out the
inverse Laplace transform of

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.950
this, I could at least express
our function y of t at least

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.170
as a convolution integral, even
if I don't necessarily

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.070
solve the integral.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.870
From there, it's just calculus,
or if it's an

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.180
unsolvable integral, we could
just use a computer or

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.060
something, although you could
actually use a computer to

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.500
solve this so, you might
skip some steps even

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.080
going through this.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.360
But anyway, let's just try
to get this in terms of a

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.430
convolution integral.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.930
So what can I do with this?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.970
This is, let's see, this
isn't a perfect square.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.250
So if this isn't a perfect
square, the next best thing is

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.870
to try to complete
the square here.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.990
So let's try to write this as
a, so let's see, if I write

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.640
this as s squared plus 2s,
plus something, plus 2.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.110
I just rewrote it like this.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.250
And if I wrote this as s squared
plus 2s, plus 1, that

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.130
becomes s plus 1 squared.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.210
But if I add a 1, I have
to also subtract a 1.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.430
I can't just add 1's arbitrarily
to things.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.990
So if I add 1 I have to subtract
a 1 to cancel out

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.430
with that 1.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.690
So I really haven't changed
this at all, I just

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.720
rewrote it like this.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.890
But this now, I can rewrite
this term right

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.900
here as s plus 1 squared.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.460
And then this becomes plus 1.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.810
That's this term right here.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.250
This is the plus 1.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.390
So I could rewrite my whole Y
of s is now equal to alpha

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:39.690
over s squared, plus alpha
squared, times 1 over this

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.630
thing, s plus 1 squared,
plus 1.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.430
Now, I already said, I know
what the inverse Laplace

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.920
transform of this thing is.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.600
Now I just have to figure out
what the inverse Laplace

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.260
transform of this thing is.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.160
Of this-- let me pick a nice
color-- of this blue thing in

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.240
the blue box, and then
I can express it as

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.350
a convolution integral.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.200
And how do I do that?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.270
I could just do it right now.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.250
I could just immediately say
that y of t-- let me write

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.830
this down-- y of t, so the
inverse is equal to the

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.740
inverse Laplace transform
of, obviously of Y of s.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.430
Let me write that
down, Y of s.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.630
Which is equal to the inverse
Laplace transform

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.420
of these two things.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.370
The inverse Laplace transform of
alpha over s squared, plus

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:46.060
alpha squared, times 1 over
s plus 1 squared, plus 1.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.300
And now the convolution theorem
tells us that this is

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.440
going to be equal to the inverse
Laplace transform of

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.182
this first term in
the product.

00:06:58.182 --> 00:07:02.740
So the inverse Laplace transform
of that first term,

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.960
alpha over s squared, plus
alpha squared, convoluted

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.710
with-- I'll do a little
convolution sign there.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.510
I was about to say convulsion.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.610
They're not too different.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.930
Convoluted with the inverse
Laplace transform of this

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:27.990
term, the inverse Laplace
transform of 1 over s plus 1

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.950
squared, plus 1.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.730
If I have the product of two
Laplace transforms, and I can

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.100
take each of them independently
and I can invert

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.410
them, the inverse Laplace
transform of their product is

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.230
going to be the convolution of
the inverse Laplace transforms

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.460
of each of them, each
of the terms.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.920
And what I just said confused
me a bit, so I don't want to

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.470
confuse you.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.550
But I think you get the idea.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.620
I have these two things.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.590
I recognize these
independently.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.210
I can independently take the
inverse of each of these

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.840
things, so the inverse Laplace
transform of their products is

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.930
going to be the convolution
of each of their inverse

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.610
transforms. Now what's
this over here?

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.340
Well I had this in the beginning
of the problem?

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.210
The inverse Laplace transform
of this, right here, is sine

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.460
of alpha t.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.140
And then we're going to
convolute that with the

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.070
inverse Laplace transform
of this right here.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.980
Let's do a little bit of work on
the side, just to make sure

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.380
we get this right.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:41.490
So the Laplace transform of sine
of t is equal to 1 over s

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.960
squared, plus 1.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.480
That looks like this, but I
was shifted by minus 1.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.780
You might remember that the
Laplace transform of e to the

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:58.090
at sine of t, when you multiply
e to the at times

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.350
anything, you're shifting
its Laplace transform.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.820
So that will be equal
to 1 over s minus a

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.900
squared, plus 1.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.390
We essentially shifted
it by a.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.830
So now we have something that
looks very similar to this.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.110
If we just set our a to be equal
to negative 1, here our

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.400
a is equal to negative 1, then
it fits this pattern.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.230
This is s minus negative 1.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.640
So the inverse Laplace transform
of this thing right

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:34.530
here is just e to the a, which
is minus 1, so minus 1t,

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.800
times sine of t.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.980
So this is the solution to our
differential equation, even

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.780
though it's not in a pleasant
form to look at.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.890
And we can, if we want, express
it as an integral.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.410
I'm not going to actually solve
the integral in this

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.570
problem, because it gets hairy,
and it's not even clear

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.190
that-- well, I won't even
attempt to do it.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.100
But I just want to get into a
form, and from there it's just

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.020
integral calculus.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.500
or maybe a computer.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.110
What's the convolution
of these two things?

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:10.400
It's the integral from 0 to t,
of sine of the first function

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.810
of t minus tau.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.800
Well, I could actually switch,
and I haven't shown you this,

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.170
but we can switch the order
either way, but actually let

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.420
me just do it this way.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.390
I could write this as
sine of [? out ?]

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.950
t minus tau, times alpha-- I'm
taking the sine of all of

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:42.870
those things-- times e to the
minus tau, sine of tau, dtau.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.330
That's one way, that if I wanted
to express the solution

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.310
of this differential equation's
integral, I could

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.310
write it like that.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.660
And it actually should be kind
of obvious to you that this

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.890
could go either way.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:57.190
Because when it was a product up
here, obviously order does

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.730
not matter.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.470
I could write this term first,
or I could write that term

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:05.450
first. So regardless of which
term is written first, the

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.690
same principle would apply.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.910
And I'll formally prove
it in a future video.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.290
So we could have also done
it the other way.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.260
We could have written this
expression as e to the minus

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:22.700
t, sine of t, convoluted
with sine of alpha t.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.510
And that would be equal to the
integral from 0 to t, of e to

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:38.560
the minus t minus tau, sine of
t, minus tau, times sine of

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.800
alpha tau, dtau.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.770
So these are equivalent.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.440
Either of these would be
an acceptable answer.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.480
And normally on a test like
this, the teacher won't expect

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.240
you to actually evaluate
these integrals.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.370
The teacher will just say, get
it into an integral just to

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.150
kind of see whether you know
how to convolute things and

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.260
get your solution to the
differential equation at least

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.310
into this form, because from
here it really is just, I

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.860
won't say basic calculus,
but it's

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.135
non-differential equations.

00:12:05.135 --> 00:12:08.560
So hopefully, this second
example with the convolution

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.790
to solve an inverse transform
clarified

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.940
things up a little bit.
