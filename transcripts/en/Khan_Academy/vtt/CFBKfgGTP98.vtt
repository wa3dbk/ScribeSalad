00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.340
In the last video, we tried
to draw a 2-Propylheptane.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.350
And we did our best attempt at
drawing it, but it was pointed

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.420
out that this wouldn't even be
called a 2-Propylheptane to

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.900
begin with.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.140
So you actually should never
see something called

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.500
2-Propylheptane.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.130
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.930
So when do you see something
like this, you might

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.310
immediately say-- and the way
we drew it was actually

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.570
correct, it just wouldn't be
called 2-Propylheptane.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.950
So you say heptane.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.600
So that is a seven
carbon alkane.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.050
No double bond, so one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.490
And then on the second carbon,
so you have one, two, three,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.420
four, five, six, seven, we
have a propyl group.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.140
Propyl, that is three carbons.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.400
So on the second carbon we
have a propyl group.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.700
That's three carbons.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.090
So that is one, two, three.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.100
And so the way we drew it
was just like this.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.950
And so if someone gave you
2-Propylheptane, this would be

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.010
what you would draw.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.380
But you wouldn't call this
2-Propylheptane.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.750
Because remember, if you're
given the molecule you look

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.020
for the longest chain and the
longest chain here is not the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.730
heptane chain.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.880
It is not one, two, three, it is
not this thing in magenta--

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.930
in this kind of mauve color.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.550
It's this chain where
you start over here.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.870
If you start over here, one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.490
seven, eight, nine, you actually
get a longer chain.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.870
So this would actually be the
backbone of this molecule

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.850
right over there.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.860
That right over there would be
the backbone, and so you

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.830
would number it.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.590
You start numbering closest to
the group that's attached, so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.460
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.500
So you have nine carbons in
your backbone, so we're

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.560
dealing with nonane.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.450
We're dealing with nonane.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.410
And you have a methyl group:
one carbon attached to the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.880
fourth carbon of our
main backbone.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.780
So this is going to be four
methyl, this is our methyl

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.340
group right here,
4-Methylnonane.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.030
So it was brought up, I think
the user name is Minoctu, and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.200
they correctly corrected me,
that there would never be such

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.490
a thing as 2-Propylheptane.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.560
I just made that up.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.010
If someone were to, kind of,
label this molecule they would

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.665
call it 4-Methylnonane
and ask you draw it.

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:38.815
But either way, both of
these would point you

00:02:38.815 --> 00:02:40.390
in the right direction.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.140
This would just be the incorrect
name for it, because

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.370
you'd be looking at-- if someone
gave you this molecule

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.590
and you named it this way,
that would be incorrect.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.750
So I apologize for this.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.360
This is 4-Methylnonane.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.850
If you do heptane you're not
finding the longest chain.
