00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.420
Welcome to the presentation
on 45-45-90 triangles.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.200
Let me write that down.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.300
How come the pen--
oh, there you go.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.770
45-45-90 triangles.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.050
Or we could say 45-45-90 right
triangles, but that might be

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.630
redundant, because we know any
angle that has a 90 degree

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.110
measure in it is a
right triangle.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.790
And as you can imagine, the
45-45-90, these are actually

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.910
the degrees of the
angles of the triangle.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.220
So why are these
triangles special?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.720
Well, if you saw the last
presentation I gave you a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.950
little theorem that told you
that if two of the base angles

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.000
of a triangle are equal-- and
it's I guess only a base angle

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.800
if you draw it like this.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830
You could draw it like this, in
which case it's maybe not so

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.410
obviously a base angle, but
it would still be true.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.520
If these two angles are equal,
then the sides that they don't

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.000
share-- so this side and this
side in this example, or this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.280
side and this side in this
example-- then the two sides

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.050
are going to be equal.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.140
So what's interesting about
a 45-45-90 triangle is that

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.900
it is a right triangle
that has this property.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.400
And how do we know that it's
the only right triangle

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.690
that has this property?

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.790
Well, you could imagine a
world where I told you that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.140
this is a right triangle.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.030
This is 90 degrees, so
this is the hypotenuse.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.140
Right, it's the side opposite
the 90 degree angle.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.780
And if I were to tell you that
these two angles are equal to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.640
each other, what do those
two angles have to be?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.840
Well if we call these two
angles x, we know that the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.410
angles in a triangle
add up to 180.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.220
So we'd say x plus x
plus-- this is 90-- plus

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.650
90 is equal to 180.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.950
Or 2x plus 90 is equal to 180.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.260
Or 2x is equal to 90.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.500
Or x is equal to 45 degrees.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.180
So the only right triangle in
which the other two angles are

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.990
equal is a 45-45-90 triangle.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.680
So what's interesting about
a 45-45-90 triangle?

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.160
Well other than what I just
told you-- let me redraw it.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.180
I'll redraw it like this.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.190
So we already know this is 90
degrees, this is 45 degrees,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.320
this is 45 degrees.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.370
And based on what I just told
you, we also know that the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.850
sides that the 45 degree
angles don't share are equal.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.560
So this side is
equal to this side.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.080
And if we're viewing it from a
Pythagorean theorem point of

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.240
view, this tells us that the
two sides that are not the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.710
hypotenuse are equal.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.400
So this is a hypotenuse.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.500
So let's call this side
A and this side B.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.360
We know from the Pythagorean
theorem-- let's say the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.880
hypotenuse is equal to C-- the
Pythagorean theorem tells us

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.380
that A squared plus B squared
is equal to C squared.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.863
Right?

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.620
Well we know that A equals
B, because this is a

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.070
45-45-90 triangle.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.010
So we could substitute
A for B or B for A.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.580
But let's just
substitute B for A.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.960
So we could say B squared
plus B squared is

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.530
equal to C squared.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.490
Or 2B squared is
equal to C squared.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.940
Or B squared is equal
to C squared over 2.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:03.640
Or B is equal to the square
root of C squared over 2.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.530
Which is equal to C-- because
we just took the square root of

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.130
the numerator and the square
root of the denominator-- C

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.570
over the square root of 2.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.250
And actually, even though this
is a presentation on triangles,

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.630
I'm going to give you a little
bit of actually information

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.930
on something called
rationalizing denominators.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.270
So this is perfectly correct.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.950
We just arrived at B-- and we
also know that A equals B-- but

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.510
that B is equal to C divided
by the square root of 2.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.820
It turns out that in most of
mathematics, and I never

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.780
understood quite exactly why
this was the case, people

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.870
don't like square root of
2s in the denominator.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.720
Or in general they don't
like irrational numbers

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.140
in the denominator.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.030
Irrational numbers are numbers
that have decimal places that

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.920
never repeat and never end.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.870
So the way that they get rid
of irrational numbers in the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.230
denominator is that you do
something called rationalizing

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.570
the denominator.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.456
And the way you rationalize
a denominator-- let's take

00:04:55.456 --> 00:04:56.110
our example right now.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.640
If we had C over the square
root of 2, we just multiply

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.200
both the numerator and
the denominator by the

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.130
same number, right?

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.120
Because when you multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.280
by the same number, that's just
like multiplying it by 1.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.680
The square root of 2 over
the square root of 2 is 1.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.530
And as you see, the reason
we're doing this is because

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.020
square root of 2 times square
root of 2, what's the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.040
square root of 2 times
square root of 2?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.220
Right, it's 2.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.030
Right?

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.930
We just said, something times
something is 2, well the square

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.990
root of 2 times square root
of 2, that's going to be 2.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.010
And then the numerator is C
times the square root of 2.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.420
So notice, C times the square
root of 2 over 2 is the same

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.150
thing as C over the
square root of 2.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.520
And this is important to
realize, because sometimes

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.090
while you're taking a
standardized test or you're

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.190
doing a test in class, you
might get an answer that looks

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.320
like this, has a square root of
2, or maybe even a square root

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.550
of 3 or whatever, in
the denominator.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.420
And you might not see your
answer if it's a multiple

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.750
choice question.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.710
What you ned to do in that case
is rationalize the denominator.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.990
So multiply the numerator and
the denominator by square

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.470
root of 2 and you'll get
square root of 2 over 2.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.250
But anyway, back
to the problem.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.450
So what did we learn?

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.880
This is equal to B, right?

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.240
So turns out that B is equal
to C times the square

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.420
root of 2 over 2.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.410
So let me write that.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.760
So we know that A
equals B, right?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:27.610
And that equals the square
root of 2 over 2 times C.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.680
Now you might want to memorize
this, though you can always

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.440
derive it if you use the
Pythagorean theorem and

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.720
remember that the sides that
aren't the hypotenuse in a

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.110
45-45-90 triangle are
equal to each other.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.370
But this is very good to know.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.645
Because if, say, you're taking
the SAT and you need to solve a

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:48.180
problem really fast, and if you
have this memorized and someone

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.943
gives you the hypotenuse, you
can figure out what are the

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:51.890
sides very fast, or i8f someone
gives you one of the sides,

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.100
you can figure out the
hypotenuse very fast.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.290
Let's try that out.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.250
I'm going to erase everything.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:06.060
So we learned just now that A
is equal to B is equal to the

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.210
square root of 2
over 2 times C.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:16.220
So if I were to give you a
right triangle, and I were to

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:23.760
tell you that this angle is 90
and this angle is 45, and that

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.570
this side is, let's
say this side is 8.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.670
I want to figure out
what this side is.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.590
Well first of all, let's
figure out what side

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.500
is the hypotenuse.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.620
Well the hypotenuse is the side
opposite the right angle.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.060
So we're trying to actually
figure out the hypotenuse.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.640
Let's call the hypotenuse C.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.560
And we also know this is a
45-45-90 triangle, right?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.180
Because this angle is 45, so
this one also has to be 45,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.620
because 45 plus 90 plus
90 is equal to 180.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.840
So this is a 45-45-90 triangle,
and we know one of the sides--

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:05.880
this side could be A or B-- we
know that 8 is equal to the

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.030
square root of 2
over 2 times C.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.160
C is what we're trying
to figure out.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.400
So if we multiply both sides of
this equation by 2 times the

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.010
square root of 2-- I'm just
multiplying it by the inverse

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.600
of the coefficient on C.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.750
Because the square root of 2
cancels out that square root

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.430
of 2, this 2 cancels
out with this 2.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:37.640
We get 2 times 8, 16 over the
square root of 2 equals C.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.200
Which would be correct, but as
I just showed you, people don't

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.120
like having radicals
in the denominator.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.250
So we can just say C is equal
to 16 over the square root of

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.290
2 times the square root of 2
over the square root of 2.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:58.790
So this equals 16 square
roots of 2 over 2.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:04.330
Which is the same thing
as 8 square roots of 2.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:10.170
So C in this example is
8 square roots of 2.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.790
And we also knows, since this
is a 45-45-90 triangle,

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.700
that this side is 8.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.940
Hope that makes sense.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.740
In the next presentation
I'm going to show you a

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.680
different type of triangle.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.900
Actually, I might even start
off with a couple more examples

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.080
of this, because I feel I
might have rushed it a bit.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.450
But anyway, I'll see you soon
in the next presentation.
