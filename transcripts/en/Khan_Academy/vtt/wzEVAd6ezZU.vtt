00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.980
So we're on problem number one
on the California Standards

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.280
Test Problems for Algebra II.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.260
And so the theory being is if
you're able to do all or at

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.100
least understand all 80 of these
questions, I think you

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.610
have a pretty good understanding
of Algebra II,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.540
at least from the perspective
of California.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.820
Let's see, problem number one.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.850
What is the complete solution
to the equation the absolute

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.920
value of 3 minus 6x
is equal to 15?

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.689
So let's think about it.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.880
3 minus 6x could clearly be 15,
because the absolute value

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.600
of 15 is 15.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.620
So we could say that 3
-- sorry that's a 3.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.490
3 minus 6x could
be equal to 15.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.430
But 3 minus 6x could also be
equal to minus 15, right?

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.430
Because the absolute value
of minus 15 is also 15.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.620
So let's write that down.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.270
Or 3 minus 6x is equal
to minus 15, right?

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.640
If this was equal to minus 15,
you'd take the absolute value,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.590
you'd get positive 15.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.239
So either of these
could be true.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.700
So let's solve for x.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.750
Subtract 3 from both sides,
you get minus

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.400
6x is equal to 12.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.980
Divide both sides by minus 6,
you get x is equal to minus 2.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.250
And so here, if we subtract 3
from both sides, you get minus

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.120
6x is equal to minus
15 minus 3.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.920
That's minus 18.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.800
Divide both sides my minus
6, you get x is equal

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.300
to positive 3, right?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.990
A negative divided by a negative
, so x is equal to 3.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.240
So x could be minus 2 or
3, and that's choice b.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.790
Problem two.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.630
Let me switch colors to make
things interesting.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.840
And this is a similar
type of problem.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.820
What are the possible values of
x in the absolute value of

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.320
12 minus 4x is equal to 2?

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.190
Same logic.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.210
12 minus 4x could be 2, right?

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.530
The absolute value of 2 is 2.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.980
So you you get 12 minus
4x is equal to 2.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.260
Or 12 minus 4x could
be minus 2, right?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.570
Because the absolute value
of minus 2 is 2.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.420
So then you get 12 minus 4x
could be equal to minus 2.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.590
So this is an or proposition.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.800
So let's see, subtract 12 from
both sides, you get minus 4x.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.626
2 minus 12 is minus 10.

00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:37.940
Then you get x.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.220
Divide both sides by minus 4
is minus 10 over minus 4.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.980
The negatives cancel out.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.665
And that's equal to 5/2,
or 2 and 1/2, for 2.5.

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:54.720
And the only reason I wrote 2.5
is I was looking at the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.190
choices, and they have
everything as decimals.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.900
So let's look at the other
possibilities.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.110
Subtract 12 from both sides, you
get minus 4x is equal to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.634
minus 2 minus 12 is minus 14.

00:03:08.634 --> 00:03:14.670
x is equal to minus
14 over minus 4.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.230
Negatives cancel out, which is
equal to 7/2, which is equal

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.810
to 3 and 1/2, which
is equal to 3.5.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.580
So x could be 2.5 or 3.5,
and that is choice d.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.620
Problem three.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.140
I'll switch to maybe green.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.120
Problem three.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.270
For weddings, Sherada bought
several dozen roses and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.720
several dozen carnations.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.562
The roses cost $15 per dozen,
so roses are $15 per dozen,

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:52.490
the carnations cost $8 per
dozen, so the carnations are

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.460
$8 per dozen.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.650
Sherada bought a total of
17 dozen flowers and

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.535
paid a total $192.

00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:03.040
How many roses did she buy?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.230
All right, so let's set
some variables.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.080
Let R equal dozens of roses.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.285
I hope you can read
my handwriting.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.540
And let C equal to dozens
of carnations.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.700
All right, so they say
that she bought a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.600
total of 17 dozen flowers.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.200
So the dozens of roses she
bought plus the dozens of

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.330
carnations she bought must be
equal to 17 because she bought

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.060
a total of 17 dozens.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.270
It also tells us that
she spent $192.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.240
So how do we figure out how
much money she spent?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.420
So if she bought R dozens
of roses, how much did

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.320
she spend on roses?

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.800
Well, each dozen of
roses is $15.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.560
So she spent 15 times the
number of dozens.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.800
That's how much she
spent on roses.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.750
How much did she spend
on carnations?

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.630
Well, she bought C dozens
of carnations.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.900
Each dozen was $8.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.900
She spent 8C dollars
on carnations.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.840
So her total amount of money she
spent was the amount she

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.160
spent on roses plus the amount
she spent on carnations, and

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.090
that is equal to 192.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.070
Now, we have two linear
equations and two unknowns.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.240
We can just solve them.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.880
We want to solve for the
number of roses.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.872
That was the question.

00:05:24.872 --> 00:05:28.790
So let's try to cancel out
the number of carnations.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.770
So if we multiply this top
equation by minus 8, we'll get

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.780
a minus 8C.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.570
That'll cancel out with that,
so let's do that.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.250
So let's multiply that top
equation by minus 8.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.550
You get minus 8R minus 8C.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.230
What's minus 8 times 17?

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.800
Let's see, 17-- I'll do it in
the corner here-- 17 times 8,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:06:00.120
7 times 8 is 56, 1 times 8 is
13, plus 5 is 1, 1 times-- oh,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.030
my brain was getting
ahead of me.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.460
1 times 8 is 8, plus 5 is 13.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.130
Sorry.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.930
It's equal to 136.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.910
Oh, and we would multiply it by
negative 8, so we'd put a

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.900
negative there.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.100
And now we can add these
two equations.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.020
15 minus 8, 7R.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.760
8C minus 8C is 0-- and that
was the whole point behind

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.640
multiplying this top equation
by minus 8-- is equal

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.270
to 192 minus 36.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.940
Let's see.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.680
We can do little borrowing, or
regrouping, they call it now.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.220
That's 12, that's 8,
so it equals 56.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.220
7R is equal to 56, so
R is equal to 8.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.815
So Sherada bought 8 dozens of
roses, and that is choice C.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.380
Problem four.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.430
What is the solution
to the system of

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.070
equations shown below?

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.130
And there's three of them with
three variables, always the

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.250
hairiest problem.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.160
Let's see.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:08.990
We have 2x minus y plus
3z is equal to 8.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:18.400
We have x minus 6y minus
z is equal to 0.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:26.670
And then you get minus 6x plus
3y minus 9z is equal to 24.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.390
Now there's a bunch of
ways to solve these.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.230
You could use matrices and
inverses of matrices and

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.010
Gauss-Jordan elimination, or you
can just kind of use your

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.140
traditional multiplying
equations by each other and

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.240
adding them so that you can kind
of constrain them or take

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.920
out variables.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.160
And we'll do the last one
because I don't want to

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.570
introduce any other kind of
matrix manipulation here.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.680
So what I want to do is, let's
use this equation with both of

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.300
these, and try to cancel
out the x's, right?

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.390
Well, let's think of how
we could do that.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.280
Well, one thing I like to do,
just to simplify it, is to get

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.050
all of the equations in what I
consider lowest integer from.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.690
I know that's not
a formal term.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.960
But look at all the terms
in this equation.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.510
They're all divisible
by 3, right?

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.340
So let's divide all
of them by 3.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.520
So this last equation would
become-- if you divide

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:21.720
everything by 3, you'd get minus
2x plus y minus 3z is

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.070
equal to 8.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.220
So let's cancel that out.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.350
I just divided it by 3.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.110
It's the same thing.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.880
Remember, whatever you do to
one side of an equation you

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.570
can do to the other side
of the equation.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.260
Anyway, so let's use this
equation and this equation and

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.320
then this equation and this
equation to get two equations

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.169
with just y's and z's.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.419
So essentially we want to
cancel out the x's.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.710
So to cancel out the x's with
this one and this one, we can

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.550
just add them, right?

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.670
Because 2x plus minus
2x, that's going to

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.320
cancel out the x's.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.210
So we can just do that.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.710
And then when we do it with
this equation, we could

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.220
multiply this equation times
minus 2 first and it'll cancel

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.520
out the x's there.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.210
So let's do it.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.990
So let's just write it and
I'll write it in green.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:07.220
So if I add this equation to
this equation, 2x minus 2x is

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:14.230
0x minus y plus y, that's 0y.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.220
These are all zero, but I'm just
writing them down to show

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.230
that we're done.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.030
Well, they all cancel out.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.380
Plus 0z.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.030
These are equal to 8 plus
8 is equal to 16.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:33.060
So you get 0 is equal to 16,
which makes no sense.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.840
So there's actually
no solution here.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.030
And if you wanted to think
about visually what's

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.590
happening is each of these
equations represents a plane

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.060
in three dimensions.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.780
And the only way you get no
solution or no intersection

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.070
between this equation and this
equation or this equation,

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.000
which are essentially the same
equation, the only reason why

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.730
you can't get the intersection
between them is that they must

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.510
be parallel equations.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.680
You could get an infinite number
of solutions if they

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.400
were actually the same plane.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.630
But these are parallel planes,
so they'll never intersect.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.390
So we saw.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.090
And it kind of makes sense
because this part-- well, I'm

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.000
not going to go into
the details.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.270
We're just focused on solving
problems right now.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.410
But it's fair enough to say
that when you add this

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.710
equation to this equation to
cancel out the x's, everything

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.830
else cancels out and you got
a nonsensical statement, 0

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.160
equals 16, so there's no
solution and that's choice c.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.900
And those are parallel planes
in three dimensions.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.360
Problem five.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.770
A restaurant manager bought
20 packages of bagels.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.720
Some packages contained 6
bagels each and the rest

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.090
contain 12 bagels each.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.480
There were a 168
bagels in all.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.500
How many packets of 12 bagels
did the manager buy?

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.090
So he bought some
packages of 6.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.930
So the packages of 6 plus the
packages of 12, that's just my

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.700
random notation that
I invented.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.570
He bought a total of 20
packages, so that equals 20,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.860
and he bought a total of
168 bagels in all.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.050
So how many bagels did he
get from the 6-packs?

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.520
Well, each of them had
6 bagels, right?

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.160
So he got 6 times the
number of packs.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.680
So he got 6 times this.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.420
This is the number of bagels he
got from the 6-packs, and

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.750
then this is the number
bagels he got from

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.720
the 12-packs, right?

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:33.500
The number of packs times 12,
and then that is equal to 168.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.680
Two equations, two unknowns.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.670
They're linear equations.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.360
We should be able
to solve this.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.020
So they want to know how
many packages of the 12

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.710
bagels did he buy?

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.735
So they want to know what p sub
12, or whatever you want

00:11:45.735 --> 00:11:47.250
to call that is.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.860
So if we want to do that, let's
cancel out the P6's.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:55.330
So if we multiply that top
equation by minus 6, you get

00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:02.695
minus 6 times the 6-packs, minus
6 times the 12-packs--

00:12:02.695 --> 00:12:05.540
I'm just multiplying this top
thing by minus 6-- is

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.200
equal to minus 120.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.220
Now, we can add the
two equations.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.130
These cancel out.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.080
That was the whole point.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.430
12 times the 12-packs minus 6
times the 12-packs, that's

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.085
equal to 6 times the 12-packs.

00:12:20.085 --> 00:12:24.950
It's equal to 168
minus 120 is 48.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.210
And so we get the 12-packs,
there were 48

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.810
divided by 6 is 8.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.240
So there were 8 12-packs.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.610
The manager bought 8 12-packs.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.110
That is choice b.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.850
And I'll see you in the
next video because

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.560
I'm all out of time.
