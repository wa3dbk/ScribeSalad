00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.710
In this video we're going to
think a little bit about

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:11.580
parallel lines, and other lines
that intersect the parallel

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.780
lines, and we call
those transversals.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.810
So first let's think about
what a parallel or what

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.490
parallel lines are.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.700
So one definition we could use,
and I think that'll work well

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.220
for the purposes of this video,
are they're two lines that

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.660
sit in the same plane.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.090
And when I talk about a plane,
I'm talking about a, you can

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.490
imagine a flat two-dimensional
surface like this screen --

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.910
this screen is a plane.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.730
So two lines that sit in a
plane that never intersect.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.570
So this line -- I'll try my
best to draw it -- and imagine

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.750
the line just keeps going in
that direction and that

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.280
direction -- let me do another
one in a different color --

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.050
and this line right
here are parallel.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.690
They will never intersect.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.660
If you assume that I drew it
straight enough and that

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.000
they're going in the exact
same direction, they

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.840
will never intersect.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.070
And so if you think about what
types of lines are not

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.840
parallel, well, this green line
and this pink line

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.940
are not parallel.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.940
They clearly intersect
at some point.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.350
So these two guys are parallel
right over here, and sometimes

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.690
it's specified, sometimes
people will draw an arrow going

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.900
in the same direction to show
that those two lines

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.840
are parallel.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.400
If there are multiple parallel
lines, they might do two arrows

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.760
and two arrows or whatever.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.270
But you just have to say
OK, these lines will

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.550
never intersect.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.060
What we want to think about
is what happens when

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.200
these parallel lines are
intersected by a third line.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.820
Let me draw the
third line here.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.690
So third line like this.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.970
And we call that, right there,
the third line that intersects

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.170
the parallel lines we
call a transversal line.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.150
Because it tranverses
the two parallel lines.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.230
Now whenever you have a
transversal crossing parallel

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.190
lines, you have an interesting
relationship between

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.320
the angles form.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.660
Now this shows up on a lot
of standardized tests.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.200
It's kind of a core type
of a geometry problem.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.450
So it's a good thing to really
get clear in our heads.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.620
So the first thing to realize
is if these lines are parallel,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.350
we're going to assume these
lines are parallel, then we

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.760
have corresponding angles
are going to be the same.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.820
What I mean by corresponding
angles are I guess you could

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.840
think there are four angles
that get formed when this

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.195
purple line or this
magenta line intersects

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:32.350
this yellow line.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.070
You have this angle up here
that I've specified in green,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.970
you have -- let me do another
one in orange -- you have this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.280
angle right here in orange, you
have this angle right here in

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.600
this other shade of green, and
then you have this angle

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.290
right here -- right there
that I've made in that

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.930
bluish-purplish color.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.790
So those are the four angles.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.680
So when we talk about
corresponding angles, we're

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.770
talking about, for example,
this top right angle in green

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.930
up here, that corresponds to
this top right angle in, what

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.040
I can draw it in that same
green, right over here.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.570
These two angles
are corresponding.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.990
These two are corresponding
angles and they're

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.520
going to be equal.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.820
These are equal angles.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.410
If this is -- I'll make up
a number -- if this is 70

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.880
degrees, then this angle
right here is also

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.410
going to be 70 degrees.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.000
And if you just think about it,
or if you even play with

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.150
toothpicks or something, and
you keep changing the direction

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.140
of this transversal line,
you'll see that it actually

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.750
looks like they should
always be equal.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.200
If I were to take -- let me
draw two other parallel

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.980
lines, let me show maybe
a more extreme example.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.350
So if I have two other parallel
lines like that, and then let

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.340
me make a transversal that
forms a smaller -- it's even a

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.930
smaller angle here -- you see
that this angle right here

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.070
looks the same as that angle.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.340
Those are corresponding angles
and they will be equivalent.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.330
From this perspective it's kind
of the top right angle and each

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.430
intersection is the same.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.600
Now the same is true of the
other corresponding angles.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.660
This angle right here in this
example, it's the top left

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.120
angle will be the same as the
top left angle right over here.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.080
This bottom left angle will
be the same down here.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.000
If this right here is 70
degrees, then this down here

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.040
will also be 70 degrees.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.040
And then finally, of course,
this angle and this angle

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.990
will also be the same.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.520
So corresponding angles -- let
me write these -- these are

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.170
corresponding angles
are congruent.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:55.180
Corresponding angles are equal.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.050
And that and that are
corresponding, that and

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.400
that, that and that,
and that and that.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.600
Now, the next set of equal
angles to realize are sometimes

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.610
they're called vertical angles,
sometimes they're called

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.440
opposite angles.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.700
But if you take this angle
right here, the angle that is

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.060
vertical to it or is opposite
as you go right across the

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.650
point of intersection is this
angle right here, and that is

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.580
going to be the same thing.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.860
So we could say opposite -- I
like opposite because it's not

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.720
always in the vertical
direction, sometimes it's in

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.650
the horizontal direction, but
sometimes they're referred

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.400
to as vertical angles.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:37.370
Opposite or vertical
angles are also equal.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.940
So if that's 70 degrees, then
this is also 70 degrees.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.980
And if this is 70 degrees,
then this right here

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.710
is also 70 degrees.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.240
So it's interesting, if that's
70 degrees and that's 70

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.230
degrees, and if this is 70
degrees and that is also 70

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.750
degrees, so no matter what this
is, this will also be the same

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.060
thing because this is
the same as that, that

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.770
is the same as that.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:07.180
Now, the last one that you need
to I guess kind of realize are

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.870
the relationship between
this orange angle and this

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.860
green angle right there.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.890
You can see that when you add
up the angles, you go halfway

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.710
around a circle, right?

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.230
If you start here you do
the green angle, then

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.570
you do the orange angle.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.600
You go halfway around the
circle, and that'll give you,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.720
it'll get you to 180 degrees.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.870
So this green and orange angle
have to add up to 180 degrees

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.710
or they are supplementary.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.120
And we've done other videos on
supplementary, but you just

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.720
have to realize they form the
same line or a half circle.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.990
So if this right here is 70
degrees, then this orange angle

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.720
right here is 110 degrees,
because they add up to 180.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.320
Now, if this character right
here is 110 degrees, what

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.660
do we know about this
character right here?

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.370
Well, this character is
opposite or vertical

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.450
to the 110 degrees so
it's also 110 degrees.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.370
We also know since this angle
corresponds with this angle,

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.360
this angle will also
be 110 degrees.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.830
Or we could have said that
look, because this is 70 and

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.180
this guy is supplementary,
these guys have to add up to

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.180
180 so you could have
gotten it that way.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.270
And you could also figure out
that since this is 110, this

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.300
is a corresponding angle,
it is also going to be 110.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.190
Or you could have said
this is opposite to

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.430
that so they're equal.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.800
Or you could have said that
this is supplementary with

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.150
that angle, so 70 plus
110 have to be 180.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.600
Or you could have said 70
plus this angle are 180.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.810
So there's a bunch of ways
to come to figure out

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.740
which angle is which.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.000
In the next video I'm just
going to do a bunch of examples

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.990
just to show that if you know
one of these angles, you

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.880
can really figure out
all of the angles.
