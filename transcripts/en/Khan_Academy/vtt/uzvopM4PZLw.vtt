00:00:00.731 --> 00:00:02.875
Sal: This is Sal, I'm here with Ben Eater.

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:03.356
Ben: Hi Sal.

00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:05.117
Sal: And you've made this module,

00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:05.413
Ben: I did.

00:00:05.413 --> 00:00:08.554
Sal: called the fundamental theorem of arithmetic!

00:00:08.554 --> 00:00:09.018
Ben: Very exciting!

00:00:09.018 --> 00:00:12.523
Sal: Very exciting, isn't this? This says that we can essentially get to

00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:16.679
any whole number greater than one

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:17.299
Ben: Right.

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:19.556
Sal: by taking products of prime numbers.

00:00:19.556 --> 00:00:20.386
Ben: That's right.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:21.136
Sal: That any number

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:21.613
Ben: Any number.

00:00:21.613 --> 00:00:23.314
Sal: can be made by taking

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:24.553
Ben: Just the right prime numbers

00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:26.152
Sal: by multiplying a bunch of prime numbers together.

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:26.832
Ben: Yeah

00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:29.220
Sal: and right over here, were essential going to try to do that.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.406
Ben: and there's one and only

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:31.457
one way to get to that number.

00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:34.354
Sal: There's only one way, there's not other

00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:34.868
kind of ways..

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.251
Ben: There's only one set of prime numbers that will get you to any number

00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:39.113
Sal: Very, very interesting. So let's see, they say

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:42.904
find the prime factorization of 42. So when their saying prime factorization,

00:00:42.904 --> 00:00:46.548
you know when your saying, since you wrote this, your saying

00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:48.903
factor this and all the numbers that when I multiply them together

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:50.796
I get to 42. Well, the prime numbers.

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:51.895
Ben: Prime numbers. And so we only give you

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:52.951
prime numbers

00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:54.939
Sal: You only give the prime numbers, 2 through

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:59.246
13. It says use arrows to change the exponent

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:02.757
on each prime number. So the exponent is how many times you're going to

00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:06.334
multiply that,or, and we have many videos on this,

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:09.119
going into depth on exponents, but you could also, one way to visualize it

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.096
is how many times your going to multiply one times its number.

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:12.652
Ben:Right.

00:01:12.652 --> 00:01:16.161
Sal:For at least this case right over here, we're multiplying

00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:19.206
one times two 0 times, so the answer is

00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:23.001
one there. If you mulitply it by 2 once, you get a two there.

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.347
and then if you do it by 2 twice, you get 2 times 2, is 4.

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:30.418
So the prime factorization of 42. So the way I

00:01:30.418 --> 00:01:32.589
think well, lets use your hints. Ben: OK

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:34.050
Sal: Sometimes, you've got these hints

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.934
you should think about if their.. so lets see, I'd like a hint.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:42.049
so let's see what it tells us to do. We can

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.232
use a factor tree to break 42 into its prime factorization.

00:01:46.232 --> 00:01:49.986
Which of the pime numbers divides into 42? so.

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:51.610
Ben: A good place to start is think of any of those prime numbers

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.672
and which ones divide... Sal: And maybe start with those at the smaller end...Ben: thats what I like to do, Yeah. ..Sal:And 2 is

00:01:55.672 --> 00:01:59.284
usually the easiest one to think of. This is an even number, 2 is going to didive into it.

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:03.050
so lets see if thats what ya'll confirm in the hints. Oh, yes, right there,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.215
2 goes in, and you can do this on paper if you want, or you should

00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:12.598
but 2 goes into 42 21 times, so I can just try doing it 21 times, but we're not

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:16.142
done yet, because 21 is not a prime number, is not even listed here,

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:20.681
keep listing the prime numbers, 21 is not prime,and so

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:23.636
2 does not go into 21 anymore, so we're kinda done with 2,

00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:31.278
2's, so actually, lets see, we have 1 2 over there, but 3 does go into 21!

00:02:31.278 --> 00:02:33.166
Ben: It does. Sal: 3 does go into 21, and so lets see,

00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:36.498
so 21 can be factored into 3 times, so lets

00:02:36.498 --> 00:02:40.723
see if thats what your hint...Ben:which are both prime Sal: which are both prime!

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:43.249
lets see if thats what the hint confirms. Yes! 3 times 7

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.971
and then 7 is prime and your done Ben: Thats right!

00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:51.021
Sal: So you can say your gonna have, er, your gonna have this 2 right over here, your gonna have

00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.584
a 3, and then were gonna need a 7. 2 times 3 times

00:02:54.584 --> 00:03:00.200
7 is 42. And were done! And we go right over here

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.119
answer, check, click the.. need to change your answer, no no already did that.

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.406
so now i just check the answer, and I'm done! Correct! Next question.

00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:17.319
and I got two, we used the hints so we dont get full credit.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.757
Lets do the next one. Lets see what shows up. Oh,we already know the prime factors of 21, we just did that!

00:03:24.757 --> 00:03:29.021
So we got a three, and we got a 7 in there, and there we go!

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:33.887
Lets do another one. 18.

00:03:33.887 --> 00:03:36.040
So 2 goes into 18. Ben: It does. Sal: 2 goes into 18.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:45.720
and so, if I wanna do this in my head, 2 times 9, and I dont need to do this in my head, since I have hints,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.788
Ben: You have hints!

00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:49.790
Sal: You have hints, that essentially do that.so we can use our factor tree

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.558
and break 18 into its prime factorization. It's 2 times 9!

00:03:51.558 --> 00:03:55.345
and 9 is odd, but not prime.2 doesnt go into it, 3 does.

00:03:55.345 --> 00:04:03.972
so we have 3 times 3, leaving us with 3..

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:09.157
3 is prime so were done factoring. So this is interesting, so we have a 2, and then were multiplying by 3 twice.

00:04:09.157 --> 00:04:19.058
3 times 3 is 9, and times 2 is 18. And were done.

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:26.358
we have not been able to prove the fundamental theoem of arithmatic wrong! Ben: Thats right!

00:04:26.358 --> 00:04:30.358
(both men laughing) haven't disproved it. Sal: right, very good. well, this is very neat.
