I've already made videos on the
arcsine and the arctangent, so
I've already made videos on the

I've already made videos on the
arcsine and the arctangent, so

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.820
to kind of complete the
trifecta, I might as well make

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.090
a video on the arccosine.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.240
And just like the other inverse
trigonometric functions, the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.600
arccosine is kind of the
same thought process.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.800
If I were to tell you the arc,
no, I'm doing cosine, if our

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.370
tell you that arccosine
of x is equal to theta.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.530
This is an equivalent statement
to saying that the inverse

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.330
cosine of x is equal to theta.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.700
These are just two different
ways of writing the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.940
exact same thing.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
And as soon as I see either an
arc- anything, or an inverse

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.590
trig function in general, my
brain immediately

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.780
rearranges this.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.620
My brain immediately says, this
is saying that if I take the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.640
cosine of some angle theta,
that I'm going to get x.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.080
Or that same statement up here.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.760
Either of these should
boil down to this.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.820
If I say, you know, what is the
inverse cosine of x, my brain

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.880
says, what angle can I take
the cosine of to get x?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.790
So with that said, let's
try it out on an example.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.650
Let's say that I have the arc,
I'm told, no, two c's there,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.020
I'm told to evaluate the
arccosine of minus 1/2.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.310
My brain, you know, let's say
that this is going to be equal

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.330
to, it's going to be
equal to some angle.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.210
And this is equivalent to
saying that the cosine of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.550
my mystery angle is
equal to minus 1/2.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.290
And as soon as you put it in
this way, at least for my

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.820
brain, it becomes a lot
easier to process.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.130
So let's draw our unit circle
and see if we can make

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.580
some headway here.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.650
So that's my, let me see if I
can draw a little straighter.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.150
Maybe I could actually draw,
put rulers here, and if I put

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.330
a ruler here, maybe I can
draw a straight line.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.880
Let me see.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.150
No, that's too hard.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:10.350
OK, so that is my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.620
Not the most neatly drawn
axes ever, but it'll do.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.180
Let me draw my unit circle.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.460
Looks more like a unit ellipse,
but you get the idea.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.660
And the cosine of an angle as
defined on the unit circle

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.960
definition is the x-value
on the unit circle.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.990
So if we have some angle,
the x-value is going to

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.330
be equal a minus 1/2.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.120
So we got a minus
1/2 right here.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.300
And so the angle that we have
to solve for, our theta, is the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.620
angle that when we intersect
the unit circle, the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.350
x-value is minus 1/2.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.350
So let me see, this is
the angle that we're

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.070
trying to figure out.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.720
This is theta that we
need to determine.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.750
So how can we do that?

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.030
So this is minus
1/2 right here.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.470
Let's figure out these
different angles.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.480
And the way I like to think
about it is, I like to figure

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.330
out this angle right here.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.100
And if I know that angle, I can
just subtract that from 180

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.650
degrees to get this light blue
angle that's kind of the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.050
solution to our problem.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.240
So let me make this triangle
a little bit bigger.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.620
So that triangle, let
me do it like this.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.770
That triangle looks
something like this.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.160
Where this distance
right here is 1/2.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.910
That distance right
there is 1/2.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.820
This distance right here is 1.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.720
Hopefully you recognize
that this is going to be

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.500
a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.230
You could actually solve
for this other side.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.550
You'll get the square
root of 3 over 2.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.680
And to solve for that other
side you just need to do

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.660
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.780
Actually, let me just do that.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.650
Let me just call this, I don't
know, just call this a.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.160
So you'd get a squared,
plus 1/2 squared, which

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.650
is 1/4, which is equal to
1 squared, which is 1.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.300
You get a squared is equal to
3/4, or a is equal to the

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.920
square root of 3 over 2.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.080
So you immediately know this
is a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.750
And you know that because the
sides of a 30, 60, 90 triangle,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.960
if the hypotenuse is 1, are 1/2
and square root of 3 over 2.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.290
And you also know that the side
opposite the square root of

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.910
3 over 2 side is 60 degrees.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.930
That's 60, this is 90.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.570
This is the right angle, and
this is 30 right up there.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.360
But this is the one
we care about.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.260
This angle right here we just
figured out is 60 degrees.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.380
So what's this?

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.880
What's the bigger angle
that we care about?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.370
What is 60 degrees
supplementary to?

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.990
It's supplementary
to 180 degrees.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.720
So the arccosine, or the
inverse cosine, let

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.490
me write that down.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:05:01.354
The arccosine of minus 1/2
is equal to 120 degrees.

00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:03.630
Did I write 180 there?

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.120
No, it's 180 minus the 60, this
whole thing is 180, so this is,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.810
right here is, 120
degrees, right?

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.230
120 plus 60 is 180.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.970
Or, if we wanted to write that
in radians, you just write 120

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:26.240
degrees times pi radian per 180
degrees, degrees cancel out.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:35.030
12 over 18 is 2/3, so it
equals 2 pi over 3 radians.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:43.130
So this right here is equal
to 2 pi over 3 radians.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.150
Now, just like we saw in the
arcsine and the arctangent

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.530
videos, you probably say, hey,
OK, if I have 2 pi over 3

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.160
radians, that gives me
a cosine of minus 1/2.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.440
And I can write that.
cosine of 2 pi over 3

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.220
is equal to minus 1/2.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.210
This gives you the same
information as this

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.390
statement up here.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.520
But I can just keep going
around the unit circle.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.930
For example, I could, how
about this point over here?

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.230
Cosine of this angle, if I were
to add, if I were to go this

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.030
far, would also be minus 1/2.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.560
And then I could go 2 pi
around and get back here.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.240
So there's a lot of values that
if I take the cosine of those

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.250
angles, I'll get
this minus 1/2.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.190
So we have to
restrict ourselves.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.190
We have to restrict the
values that the arccosine

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.400
function can take on.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.470
So we're essentially
restricting it's range.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.880
We're restricting it's range.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.740
What we do is we restrict it's
range to this upper hemisphere,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.130
the first and second quadrants.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:48.950
So if we say, if we make the
statement that the arccosine

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.480
of x is equal to theta,
we're going to restrict our

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.110
range, theta, to that top.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.010
So theta is going to be greater
than or equal to 0 and less

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:06.310
than or equal to 2 pi.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.850
Less, oh sorry, not 2 pi.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.620
Less than or equal
to pi, right?

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.630
Where this is also 0
degrees, or 180 degrees.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.020
We're restricting ourselves
to this part of the

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.530
hemisphere right there.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.230
And so you can't do this, this
is the only point where the

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.220
cosine of the angle
is equal minus 1/2.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.200
We can't take this angle
because it's outside

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.750
of our range.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.290
And what are the
valid values for x?

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.210
Well any angle, if I take
the cosine of it, it can be

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.700
between minus 1 and plus 1.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:43.595
So x, the domain for the
arccosine function, is going

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:48.060
to be x has to be less than
or equal to 1 and greater

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.760
than or equal to minus 1.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.710
And once again, let's
just go check our work.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.130
Let's see if the value I got
here, that the arccosine of

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.230
minus 1/2 really is 2 pi over
3 as calculated by the TI-85.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.860
 

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.120
We turn it on.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.900
So i need to figure out the
inverse cosine, which is the

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:15.710
same thing as the arccosine
of minus 1/2, of minus 0.5.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.420
It gives me that decimal,
that strange number.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.570
Let's see if that's the
same thing as 2 pi over 3.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:27.880
2 times pi divided by
3 is equal to, that

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.820
exact same number.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.390
So the calculator gave me
the same value I got.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.980
But this is kind of a
useless, well, it's

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.700
not a useless number.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.950
It's a valid, that
is the answer.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.560
But it doesn't, it's not
a nice clean answer.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.780
I didn't know that this
is 2 pi over 3 radians.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.290
And so when we did it using
the unit circle, we were

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.840
able to get that answer.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.070
So hopefully, actually let
me ask you, let me just

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.450
finish this up with an
interesting question.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.370
And this applies
to all of them.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:58.970
If I were to ask you, you know,
say I were to take the

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:05.270
arccosine of x, and then I were
to take the cosine of that,

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.810
what is this going
to be equal to?

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.280
Well, this statement right here
can be said, well, let's say

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.870
that the arccosine of x is
equal to theta, that means that

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:26.540
the cosine of theta is
equal to x, right?

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.410
So if the arccosine of x
is equal to theta, we can

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.020
replace this with theta.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.200
And then the cosine of theta,
well the cosine of theta is x.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.180
So this whole thing
is going to be x.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.680
Hopefully I didn't get
confuse you there, right?

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.690
I'm saying look, arccosine
of x, just call that theta.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.620
Now, by definition, this
means that the cosine

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.650
of theta is equal to x.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.260
These are equivalent
statements.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.220
These are completely equivalent
statements right here.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.360
So if we put a theta right
there, we take the cosine of

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.000
theta, it has to be equal to x.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.340
Now let me ask you a bonus,
slightly trickier question.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.550
What if I were to ask you,
and this is true for any

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.950
x that you put in here.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.730
This is true for any x, any
value between negative 1 and 1

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.030
including those two endpoints,
this is going to be true.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:20.730
Now what if I were ask you
what the arccosine of

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.860
the cosine of theta is?

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.140
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.160
My answer is, it
depends on the theta.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.880
So, if theta is in the, if
theta is in the range, if theta

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:43.920
is between, if theta is between
0 and pi, so it's in our valid

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:50.020
a range for, kind of, our range
for the product of the

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.580
arccosine, then this
will be equal to theta.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.630
If this is true for theta.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.940
But what if we take some
theta out of that range?

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.720
Let's try it out.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.580
Let's take, so let me do one
with theta in that range.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:09.790
Let's take the arccosine of
the cosine of, let's just do

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.820
one of them that we know.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.180
Let's take the cosine
of, let's stick with

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.250
cosine of 2 pi over 3.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.320
 

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.960
Cosine of 2 pi over 3 radians,
that's the same thing as

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.090
the arccosine of minus 1/2.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.210
Cosine of 2 pi over
3 is minus 1/2.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.860
We just saw that in the
earlier part of this video.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.390
And then we solved this.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.320
We said, oh, this is
equal to 1 pi over 3.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.360
So for in the range of thetas
between 0 and pi it worked.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.380
And that's because the
arccosine function can

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.350
only produce values
between 0 and pi.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:52.210
But what if I were to ask you,
what is the arccosine of the

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:58.540
cosine of, I don't
know, of 3 pi.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.780
So if I were to draw the unit
circle here, let me draw the

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.290
unit circle, a real quick one.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.610
And that's my axes.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.080
What's 3 pi?

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.700
2 pi is if I go around once.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.620
And then I go around another
pi, so I end up right here.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.810
So I've gone around 1 1/2
times the unit circle.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.870
So this is 3 pi.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.130
What's the x-coordinate here?

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.640
It's minus 1.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.460
So cosine of 3 pi
is minus 1, right?

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.390
So what's arccosine of minus 1?

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.990
Arccosine of minus 1.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.640
Well remember, the range, or
the set of values, that

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.810
arccosine can evaluate to is
in this upper hemisphere.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:44.920
It's between, this can
only be between pi and 0.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.350
So arccosine of negative 1
is just going to be pi.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.210
So this is going to be pi.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.000
Arccosine of negative, this
is negative 1, arccosine

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.250
of negative 1 is pi.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.370
And that's a reasonable
statement, because the

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.730
difference between 3 pi and pi
is just going around the unit

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.130
circle a couple of times.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.180
And so you get an equivalent,
it's kind of, you're at the

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.480
equivalent point on
the unit circle.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.260
So I just thought I would
throw those two at you.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.390
This one, I mean this
is a useful one.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.700
Well, actually, let
me write it up here.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.770
This one is a useful one.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.330
The cosine of the arccosine of
x is always going to be x.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.680
I could also do that with sine.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:28.070
The sine of the arcsine of
x is also going to be x.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.830
And these are just useful
things to, you shouldn't just

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.710
memorize them, because
obviously you might memorize it

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.780
the wrong way, but you should
just think a little bit about

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.870
it, and you'll never forget It.
