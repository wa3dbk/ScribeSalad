00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:08.300
In the last video we saw that
if you wanted to take a plus b

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.000
to the nth power, and if n is
larger than, really, 2-- but

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.590
really, especially larger than
3-- it is very tedious to

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.930
multiply it out, essentially
using the distributive

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.480
property, or doing polynomial
multiplication, or FOIL, or

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.130
however you learned it.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.410
It is extremely,
extremely tedious.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.920
And then we learned that the
binomial theorem, which said

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.170
this, that that is equal to
the sum from k is equal to 0,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.470
to n of n choose k-- right?

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.390
Where that was what we learned
in combinatorics as the

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.350
binomial coefficient.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.130
And that's why it's called a
binomial coefficient, because

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.970
it's actually the coefficient
of the binomial theorem.-- Of

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.570
x to the n minus k-- oh,
sorry, I keep writing x.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.210
Let me undo that.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.920
Edit, undo.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.250
Edit, undo.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250
Oh, it's taking too long.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.810
Oh, let me just-- oh no, that's
not what I wanted to do.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.860
Let me erase it.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.086
OK.

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:11.190
I keep writing x.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.680
It could be an x, but then
this would have to be

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.650
an x here, as well.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.810
Maybe I should do that.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:26.780
--Of a to the n minus
k, times b to the k.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.840
So each term-- you know, the n
stays constant-- but each term,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.130
you start at k equals 0 and
you keep incrementing up.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.060
And we did an example to solve
a plus b to the fourth power

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.210
in the previous video.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.840
And as you saw, that was
tedious, but less tedious than

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.640
actually multiplying it out.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.610
And if you get really fast
at computing n choose k

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.640
for different ns and k, it
could be reasonably fast.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.130
So what I want to do is, I'm
going to show you a slightly

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.010
faster method than
what we just did.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.060
Kind of a faster way to compute
the binomial coefficients.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.480
And then after that, I'm going
to show you a super fast way

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.290
that, short of memorizing the
coefficients-- which I actually

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.520
know some people who've done
that-- is a pretty amazing way

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.590
to essentially multiply
out any binomial.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.410
So what's my pseudo
fast way of doing it?

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.820
Well, I hinted in the last
presentation that those

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.640
coefficients were actually
terms of a Pascal triangle.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.720
So what's a Pascal triangle?

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.430
So if we start off with a 1 and
then you just go-- actually,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.210
let me do it-- well, yeah,
let me do it right here.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.190
And then, actually let
me start with two 1s.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.340
And what you do is, you take
the sum of both of these.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.100
So that's a 2.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.190
And then you bring down
a 1, to the left and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.450
the right hand side.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.620
And notice, these are
the coefficients of

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.740
a plus b squared.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.100
And these are the
coefficients of a plus b.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.530
You could say a
plus b to the one.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.480
1a plus 1b.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.980
This is a squared-- so you
could rewrite, a plus b

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.070
squared. is 1a squared
plus 2ab plus 1b squared.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.400
So these are the coefficients
of a plus b squared.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.110
Let me arbitrarily
switch colors.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.090
And so, 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.290
2 plus 1 is 3.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.010
Bring down the 1.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.610
Bring down the 1.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.560
And now we have the
coefficients for a

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.720
plus b to the third.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.570
Which we computed in
the-- that was the very

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.150
first thing we did.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.250
We actually multiplied it out.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.520
And we just know the pattern.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.150
The first coefficient is 1.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.780
So it's 1a to the third, b to
the zero-- so we don't have

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.200
to write the b-- plus 3.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.680
We just decrement
this exponent 1.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:03.370
3a squared b plus 3ab squared,
and then plus 1a to the zero--

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.680
which is just 1-- b cubed.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.790
So that was pretty fast.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.260
And we can keep going down
the Pascal triangle.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.890
So let's do the next one.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.760
So we can bring down a 1.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.750
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.220
3 plus 3 is 6.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.080
And this is neat.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.400
I mean, just very simply, you
can actually generate binomial

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.990
coefficients without
having to compute them.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.160
Very simple, I guess you
could call it an algorithm.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.750
Or drawing.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.970
And it's symmetric, just as
you would expect it, right?

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.750
Because you could
easily switch b and a.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.540
a plus b is the same thing
as b plus a, so you

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.620
should essentially
get the same answer.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.920
And so, we just-- very quickly
we figured out the binomial

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.770
coefficients for a
plus b to the fourth.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.990
Which was a lot faster than
we did in the last example.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.660
a plus b to the fourth.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.700
So then we-- I think
you get the point.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.660
But, so it's 1-- let me write
in a different color-- 1a

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.080
to the fourth, b to the
zero, plus 4a cubed b

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.400
squared-- b to the one.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.930
Plus 6a squared b squared.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.640
Which makes sense that, you
know, this is a middle number

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.890
and they both-- and a and b
have the same exponent

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.150
at this point.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.490
And then plus 4a-- we
decrement it-- b cubed.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.640
Plus b to the fourth.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.946
1b to the fourth, right? a
to the zero, so that's what

00:05:22.946 --> 00:05:23.780
we didn't write there.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.620
So 1b to the fourth.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.940
And that was very fast compared
to what we had to do at

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.420
the end of the last video.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.460
We could just keep going.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.990
You know, for 5.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.980
So 1 plus 4 is five.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.250
4 plus 6 is 10.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.810
6 plus 4 is 10.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.910
4 plus 1 is 5.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.620
Bring down the 1.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.240
So these are the coefficients
for the expansion of a

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.910
plus b to the fifth power.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.360
And so this is a reasonably
fast way of doing it, although

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.040
it can get-- one, it will
take a lot of space.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.270
And it can work reasonably
well, you know, for up to a

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.030
power of eight or nine or ten.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.490
Even then it starts to get
pretty big and cumbersome.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.080
But you know, for powers
up to seven or eight or

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.450
nine, you could do this.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.400
You could draw it out really
fast and do this, and it's

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.950
probably faster than actually
computing each of the

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.830
binomial coefficients.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.590
Although you might be pretty
fast at computing n choose k,

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.580
in which you don't
have to do this.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.230
So with that out of the way,
let me show you an even faster

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.200
way of doing it, short
of memorizing it.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.810
And this will allow you to
really calculate a plus b

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.200
to the nth-- you know, to
the twentieth power--

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.030
almost in your head.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.610
Depending on how good you are
at arithmetic in your head.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.850
So here is the trick.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.800
And I encourage you to
experiment for why it

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.720
works, but it does work.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.580
And I mean it's
not even a trick.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.340
It's just-- and this Pascal's
triangle isn't even a trick.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.960
Pascal's triangle is just an
alternative way to generate

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.480
binomial coefficients, and what
I'm about to show you is just

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.380
another way of essentially
generating the binomial

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.960
coefficients.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.301
Although it's probably a
faster way to compute them.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.690
And it's a good project for you
to think about why this works.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.010
So I'm just going to start
with a very concrete example.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.020
Instead of a plus b, let
me just do x plus y.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.320
Just because you might
see the binomial theorem

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.140
written that way.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.160
So let's say x plus y
to the tenth power.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.100
This would take me all
day if I was to actually

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.150
multiply it out.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.570
It would take me probably 20
to 30 minutes, without

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.720
making careless mistakes, to
actually figure out all the

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.680
binomial coefficients.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.670
Maybe not that long, but
it would take me a while.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.130
And to draw Pascal's triangle
would fill up a whole page,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.570
and I'd still probably
make a careless mistake.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.990
So how can I do this?

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.700
So what you do is-- so
one thing you know.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.260
This is going to have
11 terms, right?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.160
Because you're going to
start with x to the

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.435
tenth, y to the zero.

00:07:56.435 --> 00:07:59.230
And you're going to go all
the way to y to the tenth.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.602
So if you start at 0 and you
go to 10, that's 11 terms.

00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:03.790
So it has 11 terms.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.340
What I want you to do
is just write down the

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.700
first, just the numbers.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.210
You know, you can almost
count the terms.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.820
You don't have to go all the
way to 11, and I'll show you.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.830
But actually, let's write
all the way to 11.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:26.010
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.780
Just squeezed it in.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.250
And you'll see, you don't
actually have to go

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:28.770
all the way to 11.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.680
You could probably
just stop at 6.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.450
So here's the trick.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.430
We know that the first
term is going to be x

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.350
to the tenth, right?

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.100
We know that x to the tenth.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.310
Actually, we know that it's
going to be x to the tenth.

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.320
The second term is going
to be x to the ninth.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.680
Then it's going to
be x to the eighth.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.510
It's going to be x
to the seventh.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.630
A little tedious.
x to the sixth.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.080
x to the fifth.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.735
x to the fourth.

00:08:52.735 --> 00:08:54.400
x to the third.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.790
x squared.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:56.750
x.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.060
And then there's going to be
x to the zero, or just one.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.970
Let me just do the y's.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.410
So this was x to the tenth.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.400
That's not bright
enough, this color.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.080
So this is y to the zero.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.910
So we don't have to
write it there.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.230
But then we have a y.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.770
y to the first.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.650
y squared.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.370
y to the third.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.120
y to the fourth.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.320
y to the fifth.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.470
Which makes sense, this
is the middle term.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.750
y to the sixth.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.830
y to the seventh.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.750
y to the eighth.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.860
y to the ninth.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.300
I don't want you to get
confused, each of these

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.120
is a separate term.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.890
I don't want you to think
I'm multiplying them all.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.010
And then, we just have to
figure out the coefficients

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:46.820
on each of these terms.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.500
Those are divider lines
I attempted to draw.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.350
I wasn't trying to
confuse you more.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.970
I just wanted to-- because they
seemed to be running together,

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.770
each of the terms
that I'm writing.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.130
But I think you know
what I'm doing.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.570
So now we have to figure
out the coefficients.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.100
And then this is the neat part.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.250
So we know that the coefficient
on the first term-- let me draw

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.370
a dividing line here and here--
the coefficient on the first

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.710
term is always 1, right?

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.570
So, the coefficient is 1.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.110
So the coefficient on the
second term is going to be the

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.750
exponent on the first term
times its coefficient-- so 10

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.670
times 1-- divided by
the term that it is.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.510
So it's going to be 10
times 1, divided by 1.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.900
So it's going to be 10.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.720
The third term's coefficient
is going to be the

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.180
exponent on the x, right?

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.980
So it's 9 times its
coefficient-- which is 10-- so

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.040
it's going to be 9 times 10--
divided by the term it is.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:45.510
So it's going to be 9 times its
coefficient, 10, divided by 2.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.480
So what's 9 times 10?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.440
That's forty-- it's 90
divided by 2 which is 45.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.640
And you keep going.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.700
The fourth term is going to be
the third term's exponent-- so

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.140
it's going to be 8 times-- let
me write this down in a

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:06.840
different color-- it's going to
be 8 times its coefficient,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.140
times 45 divided by
which term it is.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.050
So it's the third term.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.610
Divided by 3.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.740
Well, that's just 8 times 15.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.060
And we'll see,
that's 80 plus 40.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.920
So that's equal to 120.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.730
So that is the fourth term.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.745
And so then let me just
draw these dividers.

00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:27.630
I know it's getting a
little complicated.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.310
And I'm writing it all out like
this, but if you practice

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.510
this enough, you can actually
just write it straight out.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.060
And so the fifth term.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.230
What is the fifth term?

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.910
Well, you take the
exponent on the x.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:42.670
So 7 times the fourth
term's coefficient--

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.960
times 120-- divided by 4.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.220
Right?

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.040
Divided by the
previous term, by 4.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.950
Well, that's just 7 times
30, which equals 210.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.900
That's the fifth coefficient.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.010
What's the sixth coefficient?

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:06.280
Well, it's 6 times-- you
know the exponent on

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.160
the x-- times 210.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.780
Times its coefficient-- times
the fifth term's coefficient--

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.830
divided by 5, for
the fifth term.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.780
Well, 5 goes into
210 how many times?

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.100
42 times, right?

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.020
So it's 6 times 42--
that's 240 plus 12.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:30.250
That's 252.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.590
And then once you're at the
middle point-- the sixth term

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.220
is the middle term-- you'll
see that, you know, you start

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.130
going back the other way.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.360
And we learned one from the
Pascal's triangle, or even the

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.240
definition of the binomial
theorem, that the

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.450
coefficients are symmetric.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.830
So we know that the next one is
going to be the same-- this was

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.040
the middle one, right?-- so we
know the next one is

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.340
going to be 210.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.620
And you could calculate it
using the same system.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.020
This is just a quick
way of doing it.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.680
This one's going to be 120.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.800
This one's going to be 45.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.880
And this one is going to be
the tenth coefficient--

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.860
this is going to be 10.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.640
And then of course the last
coefficient is just 1.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.210
1y to the tenth power.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:15.510
So if I were to write this out,
the answer is-- and if you

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.870
practice this, you'll find that
you can do quite fast-- it's x

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:35.280
to the tenth, plus 10x to the
ninth y, plus 45x to the eighth

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:43.500
y squared, plus 120x to the
seventh y to the third, plus

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:49.910
210x to the sixth y to the
fourth, plus 252-- already at

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:56.520
the middle term-- x to the
fifth y to the fifth, plus 210x

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.460
to the fourth y to the sixth--
I'm running out of space.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.070
But you can you can hopefully
extrapolate what I'm doing,

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.100
and it makes sense to you.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.620
And hopefully you have an
appreciation that if you

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.346
actually had to multiply out x
plus y to the tenth, it would

00:14:08.346 --> 00:14:09.960
have taken you all day.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.213
Maybe I'll do one more video
with a smaller example to show

00:14:13.213 --> 00:14:15.620
you that it's a little less
complicated when you do, say,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.260
x plus y to the sixth power.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.762
See you soon.
