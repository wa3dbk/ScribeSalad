00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.650
Now I introduce you to the
concept of exact equations.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.470
And it's just another method for
solving a certain type of

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.370
differential equations.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.220
Let me write that down.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.610
Exact equations.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.710
Before I show you what an exact
equation is, I'm just

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.050
going to give you a little bit
of the building blocks, just

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.970
so that when I later prove it,
or at least give you the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.260
intuition behind it, it doesn't
seem like it's coming

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.080
out of the blue.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.500
So let's say I had some function
of x and y, and we'll

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.430
call it psi, just because that's
what people tend to use

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.080
for these exact equations.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.220
So psi is a function
of x and y.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.280
So you're probably not familiar
with taking the chain

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.870
rule onto partial derivatives,
but I'll show it to you now,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.030
and I'll give you a little
intuition, although

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.950
I won't prove it.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.210
So if I were to take the
derivative of this with

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.010
respect to x, where y is also
function of x, I could also

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.709
write this as y-- sorry,
it's not y, psi.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.130
Undo.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.890
So I could also write this as
psi, as x and y, which is a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.760
function of x.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.820
I could write it
just like that.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.940
These are just two
different ways of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.990
writing the same thing.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.440
Now, if I were to take the
derivative of psi with respect

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.100
to x-- and these are just the
building blocks-- if I were to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.020
take the derivative of psi with
respect to x, it is equal

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410
to-- this is the chain rule
using partial derivatives.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.820
And I won't prove it, but
I'll give you the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.390
intuition right here.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.410
So this is going to be equal to
the partial derivative of

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:45.980
psi with respect to x plus the
partial derivative of psi with

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.780
respect to y times dy dx.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.720
And this is should make a
little bit of intuition.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.470
I'm kind of taking the
derivative with respect to x,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.410
and if you could say, and I know
you can't, because this

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.190
partial with respect to
y, and the dy, they're

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.860
two different things.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.540
But if these canceled out,
then you'd kind of have

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.590
another partial with
respect to x.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.030
And if you were to kind of add
them up, then you would get

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.040
the full derivative
with respect to x.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.600
That's not even the intuition,
that's just to show you that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.970
even this should make a little
bit of intuitive sense.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.280
Now the intuition here, let's
just say psi, and psi doesn't

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.380
always have to take this form,
but you could use this same

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.600
methodology to take psi to
more complex notations.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.560
But let's say that psi, and
I won't write that it's a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.300
function of x and y.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.320
We know that it's a function
of x and y.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.190
Let's say it's equal to some
function of x, we'll call that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.480
f1 of x, times some
function of y.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.050
And let's say there's a bunch
of terms like this.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.780
So there's n terms like this,
plus all the way to the nth

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.660
term is the nth function of x
times the nth function of y.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.570
I just defined psi like this
just so I can give you the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.380
intuition that when I use
implicit differentiation on

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.000
this, when I take the derivative
of this with

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.450
respect to x, I actually
get something that

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.850
looks just like that.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.260
So what's the derivative of
psi with respect to x?

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.700
And this is just the implicit
differentiation that you

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.780
learned, or that you hopefully
learned, in your first

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.640
semester calculus course.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.150
That's equal, and we just do
the product rule, right?

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.500
So the first expression, you
take the derivative of that

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.540
with respect to x.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.970
Well, that's just going to be f1
prime of x times the second

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.650
function, well, that's
just g1 of y.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.640
Now you add that to the
derivative of the second

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.690
function times the
first function.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.500
So plus f1 of x, that's just the
first function, times the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.690
derivative of the
second function.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.280
Now the derivative of the second
function, it's going to

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.030
be this function with
respect to y.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.015
So you could write that
as g1 prime of y.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:11.050
But of course, we're doing
the chain rule.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.930
So it's that times dy dx.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.149
And you might want to review the
implicit differentiation

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.399
videos if that seems a
little bit foreign.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.430
But this right here, what I
just did, this expression

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.070
right here, this is the
derivative with

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.570
respect to x of this.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.040
And we have n terms like that.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.170
So if we keep adding them, I'll
do them vertically down.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.630
So plus, and then you have a
bunch of them, and the last

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.320
one's going to look the
same, it's just the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.660
nth function of x.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:49.400
So fn prime of x times the
second function, g n of y,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.930
plus the first function, fn of
x, times the derivative of the

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.580
second function.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.350
The derivative of the second
function with respect to y is

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.980
just g prime of y times dy dx.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.650
It's just a chain rule.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.620
dy dx.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.440
Now, we have two n terms. We
have n terms here, right,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.260
where each term was a f of x
times a g of y, or f1 of x

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.040
times g1 of y, and then
all the way to fn of

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.590
x times gn of y.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.150
Now for each of those, we got
two of them when we did the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.220
product rule.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.850
If we group the terms, so if
we group all the terms that

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.500
don't have a dy dx on them,
what do we get?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.430
If we add all of these, I guess
you could call them on

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:42.010
the left hand side, I'm just
rearranging, it all equals f1

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:54.660
prime of x times g1 of y, plus
f2, g2, all the way to fn

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.770
prime, I'm sorry, fn prime
of x, gn of y.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.900
That's just all of these
added up, plus all

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.890
of these added up.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:13.080
All the terms that have
the dy dx in them.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.640
And I'll do them in
a different color.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.080
So all of these terms
are going to be

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.092
in a different color.

00:06:20.092 --> 00:06:21.880
I'll do it in a different
parentheses.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:30.990
Plus f1 of x g1 prime of y, and
I'll do the dy dx later,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.100
I'll distribute it out.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:41.370
Plus, and we have n terms, plus
fn of x gn prime of y,

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.200
and then all of these terms
are multiplied by dy dx.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.080
Now, something looks
interesting here.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.240
We originally defined our psi,
up here, as this right here,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.090
but what is this green term?

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.470
Well, what we did is we took all
of these individual terms,

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.800
and these green terms here are
just taking the derivative

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.400
with respect to just x on each
of these terms. Because if you

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.340
take the derivative just with
respect to x of this, then the

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.890
function of y is just
a constant, right?

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.900
If you were to take just a
partial derivative with

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.310
respect to x.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.220
So if you took the partial
derivative with respect to x

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.740
of this term, you treat a
function of y as a constant.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.360
So the derivative of this would
just be f prime of x, g1

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.080
of y, because g1 of y
is just a constant.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.060
And so forth and so on.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.410
All of these green terms you
can view as a partial

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.430
derivative of psi with
respect to x.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.090
We just pretended like
y is a constant.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.600
And that same logic, if you
ignore this, if you just look

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.890
at this part right here,
what is this?

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:52.000
We took psi, up here, we treated
the functions of x as

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.880
a constant, and we just took
the partial derivative with

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.870
respect to y.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.055
And that's why the primes
are on all the g's.

00:08:00.055 --> 00:08:03.060
And then we multiply
that times dy dx.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.360
So you could write this, this
is equal to-- I'll do this

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.730
green-- this green is the same
thing as the partial of psi

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.830
with respect to x.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:21.140
Plus, what's this purple,
this part of the purple?

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.850
Let me do it in a different
color, in magenta.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:32.409
This, right here, is the partial
of psi with respect to

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.799
y, and then times dy dx.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.624
So that's essentially all I
wanted to show you right now

00:08:41.624 --> 00:08:43.150
in this video, because
I realize I'm almost

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:43.700
running out of time.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.530
That the chain rule, with
respect to one of the

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:53.620
variables, but the second
variable in the function is

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.140
also a function of x, the
chain rule is this.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.590
If psi is a function of x and
y, and I would take not a

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.380
partial derivative, I would take
the full derivative of

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.620
psi with respect to x, it's
equal to the partial of psi

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.830
with respect to x, plus the
partial of psi with respect to

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.180
y, times dy dx.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:17.250
If y wasn't a function of x, or
if y if it was independent

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.740
of x, than dy dx would be 0.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.220
And this term would be 0, and
then the derivative of psi

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.460
with respect to x would be just
the partial of psi with

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.170
respect to x.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.140
But anyway, I want you to
just keep this in mind.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.770
And in this video I didn't prove
it, but I hopefully gave

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.630
you a little intuition if
I didn't confuse you.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.020
And we're going to use this
property in the next series of

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.190
videos to understand exact
equations a little bit more.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.710
I realize that in this video I
just got as far as kind of

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.610
giving you an intuition here.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.810
I haven't told you yet what
an exact equation is.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.400
I will see you in
the next video.
