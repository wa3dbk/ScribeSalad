00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.740
Let's say I had the reaction
where I had some copper ions.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.560
They have a positive
charge of 2.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.000
It's an aqueous solution.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.780
There could be some
other negative

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.970
ions in that solution.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.600
Actually we could talk about
that in a little bit.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.820
But we know that when you have
these ions in solution, they

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.890
all disassociate.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.910
So you just have to know you
have a bunch of ions just

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.780
floating around in water.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.140
There could be some other
negative ones to neutralize

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.580
the entire solution, but let's
just worry about the positive

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.650
ones for now.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:37.940
And in that solution, I'm going
to put a bar of zinc.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.465
And what happens is that they
essentially switch places.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.260
The copper wants to jump out
of your aqueous solution.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.250
I should probably draw this.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.340
Let me draw it.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.500
This is my solution.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.460
And in my solution, we make it
blue, because it's aqueous, so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.010
most of it is water.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.275
I have some copper molecules
here in the solution.

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:11.830
They're a plus-2 charge.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.490
I could have some other ions
that are negative, like some

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.790
nitrate ions or whatever, but
they're all disassociated.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.490
They're all mixing around with
the water molecules that are

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.940
polar, and that's why ions
disassociate, or salts in

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.460
general, disassociate
well in water.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.360
And I stick a bar
of zinc in it.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.500
Solid zinc. So let me do that.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.640
So I stick of bar of
solid zinc into it.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.050
And so what this reaction says
is that these copper ions, if

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.930
they can get a hold of some
electrons and essentially

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.080
become neutral, they would
rather go back

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.630
into the solid state.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.920
And the molecules of zinc out
here that are in the solid

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.650
state, if they can lose some
electrons, they want to jump

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.350
into the solution.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.210
So let me write down
the whole reaction.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.130
So if the copper can get some
electrons, they're going to go

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.229
into the solid state.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.980
Copper will go into
the solid state.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.320
And if the zinc can lose some
electrons, they'll become

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.740
positive ions or cations.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.630
And then they will go into the
solution, plus-- I'll do the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.550
same color-- zinc plus
2 plus aqueous.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.260
Actually just so, a little
side note here, these are

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.170
actual ions.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.850
We've been dealing with
oxidation numbers.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.070
And when you want to know the
oxidation number of an ion,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.860
the oxidation number is the
same thing as its charge,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.780
because it's no longer
hypothetical.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.980
Remember oxidation numbers were
hypothetical charges if a

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.910
bond were ionic.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.420
In this case they are ionic, so
the oxidation state, or the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.730
oxidation number is the
same as the charge.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.380
And just as a side note, the
convention, if it's written 2

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.690
plus, this means that this
is a real charge.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.810
If it's written plus 2-- at
least this is the way I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.410
learned, and maybe there's
different conventions in

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.980
different places-- then it would
be an oxidation state,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.300
which says, oh, it's not
necessarily an ion, but this

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.380
is what it would be
if it was an ion.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.185
So if someone writes plus 2,
this is oxidation state.

00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:17.900
If they write 2 plus,
they say, hey

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.400
this is a real charge.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.690
And likewise, if you just have
a regular ion that has, like,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.720
a charge of 1-- so let's say you
have Na plus-- this means

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.830
that it's an actual charge.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.730
If you wanted to write its
oxidation state, you would

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.270
write plus 1.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.870
Small little note, it doesn't
probably make a big difference

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.560
in the whole scheme of things,
but sometimes it can get

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.690
confusing whether something is
an oxidation state or an ion.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.820
But depending on where you're
going to school and what your

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.090
teachers or conventions are, you
might want to clarify that

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.425
and just make sure that they use
the same conventions that

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:50.290
at least I remember when
I first learned it.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.390
So anyway, let's go back
to this reaction

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.470
that's happening here.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.010
So let's do the half
reactions for this.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.230
So we start here, and actually
we can just look at the

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.750
oxidation states
to begin with.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.720
This guy has an oxidation.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.890
He has a charge of 2, which is
also an oxidation number of 2.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.990
And he goes to a
neutral charge.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.760
So clearly, he gains two
electrons, which means that he

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.830
was reduced.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.450
He went from a positive
charge to a zero

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.170
oxidation state or charge.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.699
So his charge was reduced.

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.760
Just let me write that.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.830
So this guy was reduced.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.220
And let me write his
half reaction.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.950
He essentially started off
with some copper in the

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.370
aqueous state, and he
got two electrons.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.870
That's how you get reduced.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.440
So plus two electrons.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.035
And he ended up in the solid
state of copper.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.120
And his oxidation
number is now 0.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.930
Now let's see what happened to
the zinc. The zinc, it starts

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.150
completely neutral in
the solid state.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.440
No extra electrons or deficiency
of electrons.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.100
But then once the zinc jumps
into the solution

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.000
here, he has a charge.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.960
So he must have lost
electrons.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.060
So the half reaction for zinc--
in this situation you

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.610
have zinc as a solid and he
reacts to produce two

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:28.830
electrons and he's in the water
and he's now an ion.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.450
So let me put that there.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.120
An aqueous solution.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.140
So if we did this experiment
right here-- and I will tell

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.160
you right now this reaction
moves forward.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.670
This is truly a reaction.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.560
We're going to talk about, in
a second, how badly do the

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.240
electrons essentially want to
jump from-- where are they

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.820
jumping from?

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.860
They're jumping from the
zinc to the copper.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.240
So we're going to talk a little
bit about how strongly

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.880
they want to jump
in the voltage.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.840
And voltage is really just how
badly does charge want to move

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.020
or how much potential energy
does charge have. But this

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.620
whole reaction, you just have
to think about what's

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.820
happening, is that you have
charge moving from-- as the

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.330
zinc jumps into the water, as
the zinc jumps into the

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.070
aqueous solution, it's passing
on some charge to the copper

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.330
that jumps into the
solid form.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.270
So electrons are moving here.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.770
And if somehow we could
harness these moving

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.390
electrons, we could
create a current.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.920
In this situation, it's
all chemical.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.270
The electrons are moving around,
but they're not doing

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.640
it in any organized way.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.270
Because the solution
is all mixed up.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.160
But this is an interesting
situation we're

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.960
dealing with here.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.100
And we can even talk about how
badly the electrons want to

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.080
move in these directions.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.470
You can look at these
half reactions.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.320
You can look it up in a table,
and you can get these energies

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.740
or the voltage is for
these reactions.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.720
And this half reaction right
here has a voltage.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.970
So they'll sometimes right E.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.720
Sometimes it's an E not right
over there, but that's like

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.800
kind of out of the scope
of at least a

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.150
first-year chemistry course.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.760
But they'll say it's
0.34 volts.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.450
And then this reaction in this
direction has a potential

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.770
difference.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.840
The energy is 0.76 volts.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.290
If I wrote this in the other
way, if I wrote this reaction

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.090
of zinc plus 2 electrons going
to zinc solid, then you would

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.480
just switch the sign.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.010
But what this says is that this
state, this state right

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.020
here, is a higher energy
than that state.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.830
So it wants to go in
that direction.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.510
And it wants to do that with
an energy per coulomb.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.450
And you can watch the
physics playlist on

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.160
more details of volts.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.720
But volt units are joules
per coulomb.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.710
This is how badly the electrons

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.160
want to join the copper.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.520
That's the best way
of viewing it.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.090
And this is a measure of how
badly the electrons want to

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.030
leave the zinc. So if you wanted
to talk about this

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.370
whole reaction, so this whole
reaction that we have up here,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.510
we could say it's an energy, so
the energy of this entire

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.510
reaction up here.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.530
We know that electrons really
want to join the copper with

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.330
this energy, and they really
want to leave the zinc with

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.250
this energy.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.600
So the energy of this entire
reaction, how badly do

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.010
electrons want to move from zinc
to copper to form this

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.340
over there, is just the
sum of the two.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.970
So you get what's 1.1 volts.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.530
You're probably saying, hey Sal,
all this talk of volts,

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.190
this is interesting
and current.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.539
Is there some way that we could
construct a battery or a

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:35.679
galvanic cell?

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.179
If you don't know what a
galvanic cell is, it's what

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.669
we're about to construct
right now.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.039
And the answer is obviously yes,
because that's the whole

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.220
point of this video.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.080
So how can we somehow
harness that charge?

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.370
So let's separate the
two reactions.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.830
Let's separate the two.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:09:01.310
So let me put my
zinc bar here.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.590
I'll try to stay true to the
colors that I used earlier.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.570
And let me put my copper
bar there.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.400
Actually maybe I should
copy and paste

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.720
what I wrote up here.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.640
Just so we remember the
reaction itself.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.880
Actually, yeah let me do that.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.620
Never hurts.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.641
OK.

00:09:22.641 --> 00:09:24.760
I'll paste it down here.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.825
Ignore all the squiggly
lines around it.

00:09:26.825 --> 00:09:31.330
And let me put but both of my
bars in some aqueous solution.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.310
And there could be some other
dissolved ions in there to

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.630
help neutralize the different--
so I put them both

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.230
in an aqueous solution.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.480
But they're separate.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.060
And let me label them
appropriately.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:55.210
So this is my zinc. Zinc right
here, a bar of solid sync.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.490
And this is my bar
of solid copper.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.960
I should do that in
a different color.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.980
So this is copper right here.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.270
My bar of solid copper.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.470
And then I have an
aqueous solution.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.050
So what happens if we
were to connect

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.640
these two metals, right?

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.230
They're metals.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.480
If you look at the periodic
table they're

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.660
both transition metals.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.570
They both have the
sea of electrons.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.350
So they both conduct
electricity well.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.880
What happens if you connect
these two with a wire?

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:27.370
So if I connect them with a
wire right here like that.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.780
So we already know that the
zinc is just dying to jump

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.880
into the water and lose
its electrons, right?

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.670
So let's say that happens.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.430
So the zinc jumps into the
aqueous solution, and it turns

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.720
into a positive ion of zinc.
And then its electrons are

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.030
left behind, right?

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.980
So it essentially has
two electrons.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.300
I did the half reaction
right here, right?

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.410
The zinc jumps into the solution
and it leaves behind

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.850
two electrons right here.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.810
Two electrons here, they really
want to jump off of the

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.470
zinc.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:05.110
Now I have a lot of copper out
of here, out here in the

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.850
solution, that really want to
jump on to this bar of copper.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.050
But right now they're
all ions.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.340
These are all plus 2 ions.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.970
And they really want to jump on
to the bar and join all of

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.190
these other copper ions here.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.530
But in order to jump
on to that, they

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.880
have to get some electrons.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.270
Each of these guys have
to grab two electrons.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.580
And we know that kind
of potential, or the

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.170
electromotive force with which
they want to grab those

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.830
electrons is 0.34 volts.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.940
These guys want to jump here
and grab electrons from

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.260
someplace with plus
0.34 volts.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.350
These guys want to jump off
of the bar and leave their

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:59.350
electrons behind with
0.76 volts.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.820
So what do you think's going
to happen if we have a

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.500
conducting wire here?

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.960
Well those electrons are, once
this zinc just jumps off,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.260
those electrons are going to
travel through the wire.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.050
And then they're going to be
available, because these are

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:17.290
surplus electrons, to merge with
these copper ions that

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.670
want to jump back
on to the bar.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.850
So these copper ions are going
to jump back on to the bar.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.780
But from this reaction
what's happening?

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.380
You're having a current flow.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.750
Current is actually flowing.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.610
And what is the voltage
across this?

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.450
How badly does an electron want
to go from the zinc on

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.420
this bar to over here, join
with some copper in the

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.400
solution and let that copper
join on to that bar?

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.960
It wants to do it with
plus 1.1 volts.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.520
Now the question is the
electrons are flowing in that

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.480
way, what is the cathode
and what is the anode?

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:59.660
So the cathode is the positive
terminal of, well, you can

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.430
already imagine, this is a
battery of sorts, right?

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.270
Because we are able to generate
a current by having a

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.430
voltage difference across
two terminals.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.550
The cathode is the positive
terminal.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.460
That's where the electrons
want to go to.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:19.450
And then the anode-- and you can
familiarize yourself with,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.570
you know, just a cation is a
positive ion and anion is a

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.010
negative ion.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.430
So the anode is a negative
terminal.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.890
So what's the negative
terminal here?

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.800
The negative terminal is where
the electrons come from.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.560
See, electrons are coming from
the zinc jumping off.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.980
So is your negative terminal.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.140
And what's the positive
terminal?

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.790
That's where the electrons
want to go to.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:46.200
They want to go down here and be
available for these coppers

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.700
that want to jump out
of the solution.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:53.200
So this is our positive
terminal, or our cathode.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.510
This is the cathode.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.650
This is the anode.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.460
And if someone says, hey, does
oxidation or reduction occur

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.690
at the cathode or the anode?

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.220
Well what's occurring
right here?

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.620
We have zinc in its solid
state right here.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.170
We have solid zinc jumping in--
and it's neutral-- and it

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.180
jumps into the solution and it
leaves two electrons behind.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.100
So it's losing electrons.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.750
When you lose electrons
you're being oxidized.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.140
So this is where the oxidation
is occurring.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.090
Likewise, on this side you
have copper ions that are

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.090
already in the solution, and
they're gaining electrons.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.250
So their charge is
being reduced.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:36.280
So the cathode is where
reduction is taking place.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.690
Reduction.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.860
Now you're probably saying, oh
Sal, this is a nice cute

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.190
little, you know, battery-- or
this is called a galvanic

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.630
cell-- that, you know, you've
created this current.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.860
But I see a problem here.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.780
Because as this happens, you're
going to have more and

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.670
more positive zinc ions jump
into the solution here.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.960
You have more and more positive
zinc ions in here as

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.270
this progresses.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:07.940
And you're going to have fewer
and fewer copper ions in here.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.720
So if you assume that there
were some other, let's say

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:17.560
there was, I mean, maybe to keep
the solution neutral--

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.460
the copper is positive-- maybe
you had some chloride in

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:28.190
there, chloride anions
that were keeping

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.250
this solution neutral.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.450
And maybe you had some chlorine
anions here that were

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.910
keeping, well, it started
negative but then it maybe

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.150
gets a little bit more neutral
as the zinc jumps in.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.060
But once this happens a
lot then it becomes

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.160
very positive, right?

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.960
This is becoming more and more
positive as more and

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.170
more zinc jumps in.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.780
And this is becoming more and
more negative as more copper

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.020
jumps on to this bar.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.340
So what can we do to
solve that problem?

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.710
What they do is-- and this is
just one way to solve the

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.770
problem, there's actually many
but this probably what you

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.020
might encounter in your
first-year chemistry class--

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:01.185
is they create something
called a salt bridge.

00:16:01.185 --> 00:16:03.620
And what they do is they create
a, I guess we could

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.280
call it a pseudo-aqueous
solution of salt.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.980
Maybe it's potassium chloride.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.320
So in here we have potassium.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.370
Potassium has a plus charge.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.600
It's aqueous, plus
chlorine with a

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.300
negative charge aqueous.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.330
And I say pseudo-aqueous
because it's not really

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.490
super-liquid water.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.280
What they do is they try to
make it more viscous so it

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.580
just doesn't mix completely.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.190
If this was pure water, then all
of it would just fall into

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.800
the solution, and you would
really have nothing up here.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.150
It would be a useless device.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.460
But what they do is they create
a gel that's still

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.210
aqueous enough that the
ions can move around.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.780
The sodium and chloride
ions can move around.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.520
So let's say that those are
the-- sorry, not the sodium,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.565
the potassium-- let's say
that's the potassium.

00:16:52.565 --> 00:16:56.195
And let's say the chlorine ions
are-- I already did it in

00:16:56.195 --> 00:16:58.870
that blue-- so chlorine
are the minus.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.910
And what happens is as we have
this oxidation reduction

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.160
reaction that's causing these
electrons to travel from the

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.880
anode to the cathode, this
becomes positives, this

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.089
becomes negative.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:13.740
The salt bridge allows the
negative components of the

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.240
ionized salt and just waste the
chlorine to go into the

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.589
solution to neutralize it.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.220
So they'll end up having more
and more chlorine as

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.130
the zinc pops off.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.020
If you were to evaporate the
solution you'd end up with a

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.500
bunch of zinc chloride.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.040
And on this side, to keep the
balance here, you'll have a

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.610
lot of the positive parts,
components, of the salt.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:40.450
So the sodium would jump in to
replace the copper that's

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.610
jumping out.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.810
So when you have this whole
thing it enables the current

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.150
to keep flowing without having
a bad effect on the charge.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.490
Because, you know, what
happens if this

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.140
becomes really positive?

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.350
If this becomes really
positive-- I'll do it in

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:56.310
vibrant color because there's no
salt bridge-- at some point

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.650
the electrons are going to say,
hey, I can either go over

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.120
here and drive this reaction
or, hey, I got a lot of

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.860
positive stuff hanging
out here.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.430
Maybe I don't want
to leave it all.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.290
So you have to do something to
neutralize the charge here.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.310
Likewise, if this becomes really
negative from all the

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:13.780
chlorine atoms jumping out,
electrons aren't going to want

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.390
to go here.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.940
Because like charges
repel each other.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.670
So that's what having the salt
bridge neutralizing the

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.650
solution does for you.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.600
It keeps it from getting
negative, and then our

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.500
galvanic cell can
keep operating.
