00:00:00.915 --> 00:00:04.180
Let's now move away from the world of the hunter-gatherer

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.209
and into the dinnerware market.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:08.678
So let's say we're going to talk about two products --

00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:11.760
two types of dinnerware.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.347
We'll have cups on this axis,

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.464
and we will have plates on this axis.

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:19.518
And let's say we have a producer, Charlie,

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:21.895
and if he were to focus all of his time on cups,

00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:29.167
he could produce - let me put these [labels]10, 20, 30.

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:31.337
So if he were to focus all of his time on cups,

00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:33.275
he could produce 30 cups,

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:36.900
and if he were to focus all of his time on plates,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.052
he could produce 10 plates.

00:00:39.052 --> 00:00:40.432
And we're going to assume he has

00:00:40.432 --> 00:00:43.318
a linear Production Possibilities Frontier.

00:00:43.318 --> 00:00:47.060
So, this is what his PPF is going to look like.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.951
We draw a little bit, actually connect the 2 dots,

00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:52.959
so that's.. I want to make it more looking like a line,

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:54.372
so that's about as good as I can do.

00:00:54.372 --> 00:01:00.222
So that right over there is the PPF for Charlie.

00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:02.062
Now let's think about his opportunity cost.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.862
And because this is a linear PPF

00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:05.489
his opportunity cost does not change.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.127
The slope of this line is not changing.

00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:08.878
It's not that bow-shaped curve

00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:10.630
that we saw for the hunter gatherer.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.727
So it's going to be a fixed opportunity cost

00:01:12.727 --> 00:01:14.251
for one product relative to the other,

00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:18.321
at any point along this production possibilities frontier.

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:20.236
So let's say we're sitting over here,

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:21.247
this will just make things simple

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.802
to just think about the end points,

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:24.427
and he's producing 30 cups,

00:01:24.427 --> 00:01:27.497
what is his opportunity cost of producing 10 plates?

00:01:27.497 --> 00:01:28.843
Well to produce 10 plates,

00:01:28.843 --> 00:01:31.388
he's going to have to give up those 30 cups.

00:01:31.388 --> 00:01:37.264
So his opportunity cost of producing 10 plates,

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:40.985
is equal to 30 cups.

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:43.149
Or if you want the opportunity cost for one plate,

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.395
you just divide both sides by 10,

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:47.996
and so you get the opportunity cost of 1 plate,

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:54.421
is equal to 3 cups. That's fair enough.

00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.970
Now let's think about the same scenario

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.065
or let's think about another producer,

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:03.238
in this market for dinner ware. Let's call her Patty.

00:02:03.238 --> 00:02:05.355
If Patty focused all of her time on cups

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:07.227
she could produce 10 cups in a day

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.831
and if she focused all of her time on plates,

00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:12.989
she could produce 30 plates in a day.

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.154
So that is..

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:17.456
and she also has a linear production possibilities frontier,

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:25.999
so that right over there is the PPF for Patty.

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.371
And let's think about

00:02:27.402 --> 00:02:29.928
her opportunity cost for producing a plate.

00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:32.514
So the opportunity cost, if she's sitting right over here,

00:02:32.514 --> 00:02:34.347
and she was focused all on cups,

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:36.044
and if she wanted to produce 30 plates,

00:02:36.044 --> 00:02:37.828
and I'm intentionally using the end points

00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:39.611
to make the math more obvious.

00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:41.730
If she wanted to produce 30 plates

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.807
then she would have to give up 10 cups.

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:49.155
So her opportunity costs to produce 30 plates

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:53.148
is equal to 10 cups.

00:02:53.148 --> 00:02:55.319
Or if you divide both sides by 30,

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.118
the opportunity cost of her producing 1 plate,

00:02:59.118 --> 00:03:00.332
in terms of cups,

00:03:00.332 --> 00:03:04.628
is 10 divided by 30, is 1/3, 1/3 of a cup.

00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:06.094
Now this is interesting,

00:03:06.094 --> 00:03:09.143
we can now compare their relative opportunity costs.

00:03:09.143 --> 00:03:10.541
The opportunity cost for Charlie

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.432
to produce a plate is 3 cups,

00:03:12.432 --> 00:03:13.986
the opportunity cost for Patty

00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:16.547
to produce a plate is 1/3 of a cup.

00:03:16.547 --> 00:03:17.805
So for Patty,

00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:19.585
especially when you measure it in terms of cups,

00:03:19.585 --> 00:03:21.995
it is cheaper for her to produce a plate.

00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:23.642
She has a lower opportunity cost

00:03:23.642 --> 00:03:25.903
than Charlie does in producing plates.

00:03:25.903 --> 00:03:29.189
So relative to Charlie, we say, because her opportunity cost

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.688
is lower in producing plates, 1/3 relative to 3,

00:03:32.688 --> 00:03:44.159
we say that Patty has the comparative advantage in plates,

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.817
relative to Charlie.

00:03:47.817 --> 00:03:52.190
And it's not just because she can produce -

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.825
We'll see situations in maybe the next video where

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:55.915
we'll actually show this.

00:03:55.915 --> 00:03:57.256
It doesn't even have to be the case that

00:03:57.256 --> 00:04:00.421
she can produce more plates in a given day.

00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:02.465
This is not why she has a comparative advantage.

00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:03.964
This is called an absolute advantage,

00:04:03.964 --> 00:04:05.500
and we'll talk about that more.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.101
She has a comparative advantage

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:09.937
because her opportunity cost is lower.

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:11.940
Her opportunity cost for producing a plate

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.313
is lower than it is for Charlie.

00:04:14.313 --> 00:04:16.870
Now let's think about it the other way around.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.515
Who has a comparative advantage in cups?

00:04:19.515 --> 00:04:25.161
Well, if we divide both sides of this right over here by 3,

00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:28.993
well let's swap both sides,

00:04:28.993 --> 00:04:32.856
so the opportunity costs for Charlie of producing 3 cups,

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.162
is equal to 1 plate.

00:04:35.162 --> 00:04:37.867
Or if you divide both sides by 3,

00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:43.318
opportunity cost of 1 cup is 1/3 of a plate.

00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:46.080
If we go to the situation for Patty,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.019
let's swap these 2 around,

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:55.562
the opportunity cost for 10 cups is 30 plates.

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:57.224
If you divide both sides by 10,

00:04:57.224 --> 00:05:02.502
the opportunity cost of 1 cup is equal to 3 plates.

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:05.000
And obviously, and we've talked about this before,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.952
the opportunity cost of 1 incremental unit

00:05:06.952 --> 00:05:10.818
is the same thing as the marginal cost of a cup.

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:11.816
But anyway,

00:05:11.816 --> 00:05:15.922
who has the lower opportunity cost for producing cups?

00:05:15.922 --> 00:05:19.011
Well, let's see, Charlie can produce a cup,

00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:22.074
or Charlie's opportunity cost for producing an extra cup

00:05:22.074 --> 00:05:25.391
is 1/3 of a plate, and Patty's is 3 plates.

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.653
So Charlie has

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:30.561
the lower opportunity cost for producing a cup.

00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:33.676
So, it's only 1/3 plate relative to 3 plates.

00:05:33.676 --> 00:05:40.194
So this is where Charlie has the comparative advantage.

00:05:40.194 --> 00:05:41.391
What we're going to see is

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:43.563
if both of these parties

00:05:43.563 --> 00:05:46.411
specialize in their comparative advantage

00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:50.452
and then trade, they can get outcomes that are beyond

00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:53.996
each of their individual production possibility frontiers.

00:05:53.996 --> 00:05:55.446
So what we can see is, for example,

00:05:55.446 --> 00:05:57.687
they can get an outcome where

00:05:57.687 --> 00:06:01.040
they are each able to get 15 cups and 15 plates,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.745
which would have been impossible left to their own devices.

00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:05.626
So let's see how they can actually do it.

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:06.881
So we've said that

00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:09.028
Charlie has a comparative advantage in cups.

00:06:09.028 --> 00:06:11.524
His opportunity cost of producing a cup

00:06:11.524 --> 00:06:14.021
is lower than it is for Patty.

00:06:14.021 --> 00:06:16.610
It's only 1/3 of a plate relative to 3 plates.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.219
So let's make him specialize in cups. So cup specialties.

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:23.437
So he's going to specialize in cups, and

00:06:23.437 --> 00:06:29.506
Patty, for the same reason, is going to specialize in plates.

00:06:29.506 --> 00:06:32.183
So Charlie specializing in cups means

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.785
he's going to focus only on cups.

00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:38.848
So he's going to produce 30 cups every day.

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:41.308
And Patty specializing in plates means

00:06:41.308 --> 00:06:44.638
that she's going to produce 30 plates every day.

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:47.254
(Let me do this in a different color: magenta).

00:06:47.254 --> 00:06:49.762
She's going to produce 30 plates every day.

00:06:49.812 --> 00:06:52.083
Now imagine, I'm going to make an assumption here,

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:54.387
but imagine that they both do that but

00:06:54.387 --> 00:06:57.383
they don't each only want to have what they're producing

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:59.253
they want to have some combination of them,

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:00.593
so they decide to trade.

00:07:00.593 --> 00:07:02.308
And I'm going to fix the price here.

00:07:02.308 --> 00:07:04.720
We're going to talk more about markets in the future.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:13.062
But I assume that they agree to trade at 1 cup for 1 plate.

00:07:13.062 --> 00:07:15.251
And this makes sense for either of them

00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:19.387
because this trading price, or this market price,

00:07:19.387 --> 00:07:21.718
is lower than their opportunity cost.

00:07:21.718 --> 00:07:25.245
So here's Charlie, he's got all of these cups,

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:28.655
left to his own devices, if he wanted an extra plate

00:07:28.655 --> 00:07:30.808
he would have to spend 3 cups but now

00:07:30.808 --> 00:07:32.838
in the market, with this price over here,

00:07:32.838 --> 00:07:36.105
he only has to spend 1 cup for an extra plate.

00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:39.460
So, this makes sense for him because the market price

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.681
is lower than his opportunity cost.

00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:45.253
So he would definitely rather get a plate in the market

00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:47.717
than have to do it by producing it himself.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:48.774
It‘s cheaper this way.

00:07:48.774 --> 00:07:50.317
And the same thing for Patty.

00:07:50.317 --> 00:07:53.099
She has all of these plates, but if she wants a cup,

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:56.446
left by herself, she would have to spend 3 plates to do it.

00:07:56.446 --> 00:07:58.056
She would have to give up 3 plates.

00:07:58.056 --> 00:07:59.622
But now in the market,

00:07:59.622 --> 00:08:03.588
she would only have to give up 1 plate.

00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:04.775
So this is a good deal,

00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:06.731
this is lower than her opportunity cost.

00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:08.580
So she'll want to transact.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.678
And so they can do, each of them,

00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:13.585
so for example, Charlie could keep trading cups for plates

00:08:13.585 --> 00:08:17.430
and he could end up anywhere on this line over there.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.084
And Patty could actually do the same thing:

00:08:19.084 --> 00:08:20.398
she could trade the cups for plates

00:08:20.398 --> 00:08:22.079
and end up someplace over there.

00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:24.140
But obviously where they end up is dependent on

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.246
how much the other one is willing to trade.

00:08:26.246 --> 00:08:27.561
But let's say

00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:29.415
that they both want to get to that 15-15 scenario

00:08:29.415 --> 00:08:33.200
so they can both trade 15 cups to the other person.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.427
So Charlie could trade 15 cups for 15 plates

00:08:35.427 --> 00:08:38.302
and obviously Patty would be trading 15 plates for 15 cups.

00:08:38.302 --> 00:08:41.619
And they would both be able to get right over there.

00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:43.940
Which is a situation that was unattainable

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.790
left to their own production possibilities.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.671
So hopefully you found that interesting.

00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:51.745
By specializing they could get these gains of trade.

00:08:51.745 --> 00:08:55.745
They specialize in their comparative advantage.
