00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.420
In the last video, we showed
that the Laplace transform of

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:15.150
f prime of t is equal to s times
the Laplace transform of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.160
our function f minus f of 0.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.640
Now, what we're going to do
here is actually use this

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.430
property that we
showed is true.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.630
And use it to fill in some more
of the entries in our

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.080
Laplace transform table, that
you'll probably have to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.455
memorize, sooner or later,
if you use Laplace

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:37.240
transforms a lot.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.620
But we already learned that the
Laplace transform of sine

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.520
of a t is equal-- and we did
a very hairy integration by

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.765
parts problems to show that
that is equal to a over s

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:58.840
squared plus a squared.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.500
So let's use these two things we
know to figure out what the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.470
Laplace transform of
cosine of a t is.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.642
So the Laplace transform
of cosine of a

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:18.140
t is equal to what?

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.960
Well, if we assume that the
Laplace transform of cosine of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.060
a t is the derivative of some
function, what is it the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.170
derivative of?

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.670
Right?

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.180
Let me do it on the side.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.950
If f prime of t is equal to
cosine of a t, what is a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.200
potential f of t?

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.020
Well, it's the antiderivative.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.240
And we can just forget about the
constant, because we just

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.880
have to know nf of t for
which this is true.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.720
So what's the antiderivative
cosine of it?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.660
It's 1/a sine of a t.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.220
Right?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:09.630
So if this is f prime of t, then
that is equal to s times

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:20.620
the Laplace transform of its
antiderivative, or 1/a sine of

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.830
a t minus the antiderivative
evaluated at 0.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.140
Minus 1/a sine of-- well,
a times 0 is 0.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.310
Well, sine of 0 is 0.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.725
So this whole term goes away.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.510
This is a constant, right?

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.060
This 1/a.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.385
And we showed that the Laplace

00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:41.300
transform is a linear operator.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.320
So we can take it out.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.490
So this is equal to s/a times
the Laplace transform

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.290
of sine of a t.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.975
And that is equal to
s/a times a over f

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:59.910
squared plus a squared.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.280
And the a's cancel out.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.520
And that was much simpler than
the integration by parts we

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.050
had to do to figure this out.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.500
So then we get that the Laplace
transform of cosine of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.180
a t is equal to s over s
squared plus a squared.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.630
And in three minutes, we filled
in another table in our

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.570
Laplace transform table.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.190
And now we have the two most
important trig functions.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.260
Let's keep going.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.710
We haven't really done much
with polynomials.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.960
We know a couple of things.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.060
We did this already.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.500
We know that the Laplace
transform of

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.420
1 is equal to 1/s.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.600
So let's see if we could use
this and the fact that the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.750
Laplace transform of f prime
is equal to s times the

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:04.680
Laplace transform of
f minus f of 0.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.470
Or another way.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.550
Let's rearrange this.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.860
If we know f, how can we
figure out some Laplace

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.240
transforms in terms of
f prime and f of 0?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.460
So let's just rearrange
this equation.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.779
So we get the Laplace transform
of f prime.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.050
I could write of t, but
that gets monotonous.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.850
Plus f of 0 is equal to
s times the Laplace

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.230
transform of f.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.820
Divide both sides by s.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.800
Let me put the Laplace transform
of-- and I'm also

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.660
going to the sides.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.020
So I guess the Laplace
transform-- my

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.270
l's are getting funky.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.310
The Laplace transform of
f is equal to 1/s.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.690
I'm just dividing both sides
by s, so 1/s times this.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:59.270
Times the Laplace transform of
my derivative plus my function

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.830
evaluated at 0.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.310
And let's see if we can use this
and this to figure out

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.180
some more useful Laplace
transforms.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:17.106
Well what is the Laplace
transform of f of

00:05:17.106 --> 00:05:18.370
t is equal to t?

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.330
Well, just use this property.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.980
This is going to be equal
to 1/s times the Laplace

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.250
transform of the derivative.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.660
Well, what's the derivative
of t?

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.270
The derivative of t is 1.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.840
So it's the Laplace transform
of 1 minus f of 0.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.540
When t equals 0,
this becomes 0.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.450
Minus 0.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.600
So the Laplace transform of t
is equal to 1/s times the

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.040
Laplace transform of 1.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.840
Well that's just 1/s.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.530
So it's 1 over s squared
minus 0.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.350
Interesting.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.530
The Laplace transform of 1 is
1/s, Laplace transform of t is

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.840
1/s squared.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.260
Let's figure out what the
Laplace transform

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.200
of t squared is.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.340
And I'll do this one in green.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.830
And maybe we'll see
a pattern emerge.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.440
The Laplace transform
of t squared.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:25.140
Well, it equals 1/s times the
Laplace transform of it's

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.820
derivative.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.340
So what's it's derivative?

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:36.550
Times the Laplace transform of
2t plus this evaluated at 0.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.350
Well, that's just 0.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.660
So this is equal to-- well
we can just take

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.550
this constant out.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:50.440
This is equal to 2/s times the
Laplace transform of t.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.380
Well, what does that equal?

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.300
We just solved it.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.800
1/s squared.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.950
So it's 2/s times 1/s squared.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.340
So it's equal to 2/s
to the third.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.040
Fascinating.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.940
Well, let me just
do t the third.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.300
And I think then you'll
see the pattern.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.000
The pattern will emerge.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The Laplace transform.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.120
And this is actually
kind of fun.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.340
I recommend you do it.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.430
It's somehow satisfying.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.190
It's much more satisfying than
integration by parts.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.090
So the Laplace transform of t to
the third is 1/s times the

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.560
Laplace transform of it's

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.450
derivative, which is 3t squared.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.900
Which is-- take the constant
out because

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.830
it's a linear operator.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:48.270
3/s times the Laplace transform
of t squared.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.200
So it equals what?

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.680
What's the Laplace transform
of t squared?

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.380
It's 2/s to the third.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:58.470
So this equals 3 times 2 over
what? s to the fourth.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.510
And you can put a t/n here and
use an inductive argument to

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.060
figure out a general formula.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.130
And that general formula
is-- I think you

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.490
see the pattern here.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.750
Whatever my exponent is, the
Laplace transform has an s in

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.420
the denominator with one
larger exponent.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.280
And then the numerator is the
factorial of my exponent.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.760
So in general, and this is one
more entry in our Laplace

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.380
transform table.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:35.059
The Laplace transform of t to
the nth power is equal to n

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:42.674
factorial over s to
the n plus 1.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.360
That's a parenthesis.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.520
I guess I didn't have to write
those parenthesis.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.800
That just confuses it.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.270
But anyway, when you see this in
a Laplace transform table,

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.250
it seems intimidating.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.150
Oh boy, I have n's and I have n
factorials and all of that.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.440
But it's just saying with this
pattern we showed, t to the

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.300
third increase it by 1, so
s the fourth, put another

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.640
denominator and take three
factorial on the numerator,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.200
which is 6, right?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.440
And that's all it is.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.130
So using the derivative property
of Laplace transform,

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:22.240
we figured out the Laplace
transform of cosine of a t and

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.610
the Laplace transform of really
any polynomial, right?

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.410
Because it's a linear
operator.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.960
So now we know t to the
nth power, t to

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.860
the whatever power.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.690
And we can multiply
it by a constant.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.170
So we know the basic
trig functions.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.610
We know the exponential
function.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:41.740
And we know how to take the
Laplace transform of

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.680
polynomials.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.930
See you in the next video.
