00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:05.457
We're asked to rationalize and simplify this expression right over here

00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:08.847
and like many problems there are multiple ways to do this.

00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:15.526
We could simplify a little bit then rationalize, then simplify a little bit more, or we could just rationalize and simplify.

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:20.782
And just to make sure that you know what they are even talking about rationalize is just a fancy word,

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:27.516
fancy way of saying we don't want to see any square roots of numbers in the denominator. Thats all it says.

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:30.627
So try to get these things outside of the denominator.

00:00:30.627 --> 00:00:35.773
So the first thing we can do is just simplify then rationalize, then we can think about other ways to do it.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:41.215
So what I'd like to do first is say the principle square root of 8 that can be simplified a little bit because

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:48.135
8 is the same thing as the square root of 4 times 2 which is the same thing as

00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:53.944
the square root of 4 times the square root of 2. So we can rewrite this entire expression as,

00:00:53.944 --> 00:01:03.501
the numerator is still the same, 16 plus 2X squared. All of that over, we can rewrite this as the square root of 4 times the square root of 2.

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:14.681
The principle square root of 4 we know is just 2. So the square root of 8 we can rewrite as 2 times the principle square root of two.

00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:21.057
And I've simplified a little bit, I've done no rationalizing just yet, and it looks like there is a little more simplification I can do first.

00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:25.204
Because everything in the numerator and everything in the denominator is divisible by 2.

00:01:25.204 --> 00:01:27.673
So lets divide the numerator by 2.

00:01:27.673 --> 00:01:30.797
So if you divide the numerator by 2, 16 divided by 2,

00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:34.436
or you could view it as multipying the numerator and denominator by one half.

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:37.965
So 16 times one half is 8.

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:49.319
2X squared times one half is just X squared. And then 2 times the principle square root of 2 times one half is just the square root of 2.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.729
It is 1 square roots of 2.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.306
So this whole thing has simplified to 8 plus X squared, all of that over the square root of 2.

00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:01.930
And now lets rationalize this.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.268
The best way to get this radical out of the denominator is just multiply the numerator and the denominator by the principle square root of 2.

00:02:09.268 --> 00:02:16.646
So lets do that. So times the principle square root of 2 over the principle square root of 2.

00:02:16.646 --> 00:02:22.116
Now just to show that it works on the denominator what is the principle square root of 2 times the principle square root of 2?

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:29.687
Well its going to be 2. And in our numerator, we are going to distribute this term onto both terms in this expression,

00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:39.238
so you have 8 times the principle square root of 2 plus the square root of 2 times X squared.

00:02:39.238 --> 00:02:45.010
And we could consider this done, we have simplified the expression, or if you want you could break it up.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:58.166
You could say this is the same thing as 8 square roots of 2 over 2, which is 4 square roots of 2, plus the square root of 2 times X squared over 2.

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:04.020
So depending on your tastes, you might view this as more simple or this as more simple but both are equally valid.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.240
Now I said there were multiple ways to do this.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.779
We could have rationalized right from the get go. Let me start with our original problem.

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:17.697
So our original problem was 16 + 2X squared, all of that over the principle square root of 8.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:28.097
We could have rationalized from the get go by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the principle square root of 8.

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:30.635
And so in our denominator we'll just get 8.

00:03:30.635 --> 00:03:41.937
And then in our numerator we would get 16 times the principle square root of 8, plus 2 times the principle square root of 8X squared.

00:03:41.937 --> 00:03:45.117
And now we could try and simplify this a little bit more.

00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:57.113
You can say, well, everything in the numerator and denominator is divisible by 2, so the 16 could become an 8 if you divide by 2. The 2 becomes a 1. And this 8 becomes a 4.

00:03:57.113 --> 00:04:13.071
And then you get 8 square roots of 8 plus the square root of 8X squared. All of this over 4.

00:04:13.071 --> 00:04:15.938
And then you say wait, this looks different from what we had over here.

00:04:15.938 --> 00:04:19.436
And the reason is we still haven't simplified this radical.

00:04:19.436 --> 00:04:27.759
We know that we can rewrite the principle square root of 8 as 2 square roots of 2.

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:33.800
And then we can see again that everything in the numerator and the denominator is also divisible by 2, so lets do that again.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.871
So if you divide everything in the numerator by 2 you can get rid of this 2 and that 2.

00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:41.574
And everything in the denominator by 2, this will become a 2.

00:04:41.574 --> 00:04:53.639
So then you have 8 square roots of 2 plus the square root of 2X squared, all of that over 2.

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.476
Which is exactly what we had gotten here.
