00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.670
We're on problem 14.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.970
If the function f as defined
by f of x is equal to x

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.160
squared plus bx plus c, where
b and c are positive

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.110
constants, which of the
following could be

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.440
the graph of f?

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.330
So b and c are positive.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.470
So what does that tell us?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.560
So a couple of things you
immediately know.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.455
The x squared term-- whatever's
the coefficient of

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:34.650
x squared, that tells us whether
the parabola opens up

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.110
or opens down.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.820
It opens up if the coefficient
on the x term is positive,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.360
which it is.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.650
It's positive 1, right?

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.480
So we know the graph is
going to open up.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.840
It's not going to be a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.870
downward-opening graph like that.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.080
So we know the graph is going
to look like a U, as opposed

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.760
to-- I don't know what
this is like.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.800
An A without the line?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.710
Whatever.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.180
So we know it's going
to be a U.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.210
And what else do we
know about it?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.450
What do we know about
its y-intercept?

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.320
Well, this is the y-intercept.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.340
When x is equal to 0, f
of 0 is equal to what?

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.530
These two terms are going to be
0, so f of 0 is equal to c.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.280
And so we know that the
y-intercept is positive.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.450
So let's see if that
alone allows us

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.700
to solve the problem.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.850
So we know that the y-intercept
is positive, so

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.110
when f of 0 is going to
intersect someplace on the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230
positive y-axis.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.660
And we know that it's an
upward-opening graph.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.800
So the graph could
look like this.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.820
It could also look like-- well,
this b term-- I won't

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.480
get too much into the b term.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.350
So we actually know that it
is shifted to the left.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.070
But based on just what I said,
that it's opening upwards and

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.350
that it has a positive
y-intercept-- this would've

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.540
also been a legitimate graph.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.780
Anything that is opening upwards
like a U-- because

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.630
this is a positive x squared
here-- and intersects the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.680
y-axis in the positive area
would be a correct answer.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.690
And if you look at the choices,
A opens down.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.440
That's not the right answer.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.250
B opens down.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.890
Not the right answer.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.440
C intercepts the y-axis
at 0, so that's

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.430
not the right answer.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.330
D opens up, but it intersects
the y-axis in the negative y.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.450
And then finally E is
very similar to

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.390
what I drew in yellow.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.270
So that is our answer.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.610
E.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.860
Next problem.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.690
Almost finished with
this section.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.670
OK, they drew us a cube.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.760
Let me draw it big, because
this looks like it might

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.905
involve some fancy-- let
me draw the cube.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:55.642
So this is the front face.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:58.107
Whoops.

00:02:58.107 --> 00:02:59.810
Undo.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.890
All my time is spent drawing
diagrams. Cube.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.660
Drawing a diagram.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.690
And then it comes
back like that.

00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:28.130
Goes back like that.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.660
I should always draw the back
first. Good enough.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.530
I think you get the point.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.660
And it draws the dotted line.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.550
Maybe I'll draw that later,
if I have to.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.970
So they tell us this is point
A, and that this right

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.790
here is point B.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.660
They say the cube shown above
has edges of length 2.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.670
So each of these sides are 2.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.450
2, 2, 2, 2, and so on.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.900
And A and B are midpoints
of the two edges.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.310
So A and B are midpoints.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.760
So this side is equal
to this side.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.410
So if the whole side is equal
to 2, and A is a midpoint,

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.200
then we know that this
is 1, this is 1, this

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.910
is 1, this is 1.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.540
What is the length of AB?

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.362
So this is what they want
us to figure out.

00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:18.779
They want me to draw it in
kind of a darker color.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.089
No, that's not a darker--
that's that line.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.860
This is a pure visualization
problem.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.950
And at first, you're like, boy,
that's three dimensions.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.840
It's crazy.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.895
What am I going to do?

00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:30.470
What you're going to have to
do is do the Pythagorean

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.000
Theorem twice.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.600
So what do we know?

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.960
Well, we know everything we need
to solve this problem.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.410
Let's see if we can do it.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.530
So let me draw that bottom
surface of the cube.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.100
So I'll ask you a question.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.310
Can we figure out-- so
let me draw a line

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.620
along the bottom surface.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.250
Let's say that this line I'm
drawing is along the bottom

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.430
surface of the cube.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.570
So I'm going to draw
this line.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.640
That's along the bottom
surface of the cube.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.860
And let me label this
side like this.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.800
This is actually a really
fun problem.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.050
I'll do this in yellow.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.560
So can we figure out what
that magenta dotted

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.260
line's length is?

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.950
Well, sure.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.960
We know, first of all, that
is a right triangle,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.740
the way I drew it.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.770
I can redraw it like this, where
this is yellow, brown,

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.020
and then dotted line magenta.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.450
All I did is I kind of
flipped it up so that

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.820
you could see it.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.370
So what is that?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.640
We know the brown length.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.200
We know that's 1.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.270
We know the yellow
length is what?

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.070
It's 2.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.460
Because all the sides
of the cube are 2.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.240
So we can use the Pythagorean
Theorem to figure out the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.040
magenta line.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.460
So it's 1 squared plus
2 squared is equal

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.295
to this side squared.

00:06:00.295 --> 00:06:03.040
So we can just take the
square root of it.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.040
So that equals the square
root of 5, right?

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.580
1 plus 4.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.420
Square root of 5 is
this magenta line.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.830
So now can we figure
out that gray line

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.310
that I drew at first?

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.770
Well, sure.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.350
Because now we have another
right triangle.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.490
That gray line is just the
hypotenuse of this right

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.720
triangle, that's kind
of at an angle.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.350
So let me make sure you
understand what I'm saying.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.610
If I were to flatten
it out, I have this

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.330
green side right here.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:41.180
I have this dotted line base,
and then I have the gray line,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.430
which is the hypotenuse.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.170
And just so you know, this point
right here would be A,

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.250
and then this point right
here would be B.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.000
And do we know the sides?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.480
Yes, we do.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.540
We know this green line here is
1, so this side here is 1.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.080
I'm just redrawing it here.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.550
We know the magenta dotted line
at the bottom, which I

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.320
kind of switched colors a bit.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.880
We just figured out that that
magenta bottom line is

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.830
square root of 5.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.010
So now we can just use the
Pythagorean Theorem to figure

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.950
out the length of this line.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.750
The length of this line squared
is going to be equal

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.670
to the square root of 5,
squared, plus 1 squared.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.460
So the hypotenuse squared is
equal to this, so we could

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.700
take the square root of that.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.940
So that equals the square
root of-- what's the

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.995
square root of 5 squared?

00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:30.480
Well, it's just 5, right?

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.010
Plus 1.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.440
So it's just equal to the
square root of 6.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.150
So this line is equal to
the square root of 6.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.530
And that is choice D.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.830
We luckily have not
made a mistake.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.080
Last problem.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.780
Problem 16.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.930
Let x-- with this kind of
oval-looking thing around it--

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:01.830
be defined as x squared minus
x, for all values of x.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:11.540
If a-- so they're telling us
that a is equal to a minus 2,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.510
what is the value of a?

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.320
So what does this mean? a
kind of with this oval?

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.680
Well, that just means that
a squared minus a, right?

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.700
That maps to that,
just like that.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.750
And what does a minus
2 map to?

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.470
And I'm just bringing
the equal sign down.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.800
a minus 2 maps to-- every place
where I see an x, I put

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.669
an a minus 2 in there.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:39.510
So that equals a minus 2
squared, minus a minus 2.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.115
And now we just keep solving.

00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:43.280
And most of the solving is
on the right-hand side.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:43.700
So let's see.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:57.850
That equals a squared minus
4a plus 4 minus a plus 2.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:04.190
So we get a squared minus
a is equal to a

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.480
squared minus 5a, right?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.200
Minus 4a minus a plus 6.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.270
We can subtract a squared
from both sides.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.730
Let me add 5a to both sides.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:24.370
So 5a, so you get 4a
is equal to 6.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.040
Divide both sides by 4.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:33.732
You get a is equal to 6/4, which
equals 1 and 1/2 or 3/2.

00:09:33.732 --> 00:09:36.540
And that is choice C.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.260
And we are done this section.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.800
I'll see you in the next
practice test.
