00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
We're asked to graph the function

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.848
y = 2sin(-x) on the interval

00:00:07.848 --> 00:00:10.349
the closed interval so it includes the endpoints

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.648
-2π to 2π

00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:14.681
So to do this

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:18.507
I'm going to graph the function y = sin(x)

00:00:18.507 --> 00:00:21.402
and then think about how it's changed by the 2

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:24.519
and the negative in front of the x over here

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.873
So let's look at the sine of x first

00:00:27.873 --> 00:00:32.633
So let me draw our x-axis

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:36.754
let me draw the y-axis

00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:37.894
pretty straight forward

00:00:37.894 --> 00:00:38.869
and we care about it

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:40.865
between -2π and 2π

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:43.913
so let's say this is -2π

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:48.081
and then this one right over here would be -π

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.151
this of course is 0

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:54.435
then this is positive π

00:00:54.435 --> 00:01:00.842
and then this right over here is 2π again

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:04.201
And then this could be 1

00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:05.792
this could be 2

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:07.730
this could be -1

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.876
and this can be -2

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:12.665
Now let me copy this thing so I can use it for later

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:14.627
when I adjust this graph

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:18.021
So just this graph so let me copy

00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:21.804
Alright so let's think about sin(x)

00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:23.863
So what happens when sine is zero?

00:01:23.863 --> 00:01:25.408
When sine is zero

00:01:25.408 --> 00:01:30.330
Oh sorry, when x is zero, sin(0) is 0

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.158
Ok, I'll draw a little unit circle here for reference

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:35.072
This is what I like to do in my head

00:01:35.072 --> 00:01:36.664
as I like to figure out the value

00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:39.697
of the trigonometric functions

00:01:39.697 --> 00:01:41.128
so this is x

00:01:41.128 --> 00:01:42.741
this is y

00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:45.724
Draw unit circle

00:01:45.724 --> 00:01:49.613
And remember over here x is refering to the angle

00:01:49.613 --> 00:01:52.038
So that's my unit circle radius 1

00:01:52.038 --> 00:01:55.062
So then the angle is 0

00:01:55.062 --> 00:01:56.453
sin is going to be the y-coordinate here

00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:59.062
so sin(0) is a 0

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.230
when as sine increases

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.389
we go up all the way to sin(π/2) which is 1

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:11.251
so sin(π/2) is going to get you to 1

00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:14.934
then sin(π) gets you to 0

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:19.618
sin(3π/2) gets you to -1

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:22.233
and then sin(2π) gets you back to 0

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:24.535
So if I were to graph this I'd look something like this

00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:30.666
so this is between 0 and 2π it looks something like that

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:31.925
And we also want to go in the negative direction

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:39.402
and so as we go in the negative direction

00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:40.799
as we go in the negative direction

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:49.182
so sin(-π/2) is -1

00:02:49.182 --> 00:02:52.303
then you go back to -π and you go back to zero

00:02:52.303 --> 00:02:56.276
-3π/2 you're going all the way back around like that

00:02:56.276 --> 00:03:00.070
that gets you all the way back to sine is equal to 1

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.872
so sine is equal to 1

00:03:01.873 --> 00:03:07.096
And then 2π you go back sine is back equalling 0

00:03:07.127 --> 00:03:11.258
So the curve will look something like this

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.616
In the negative so as you go from

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:17.438
between 0 and -2π

00:03:17.438 --> 00:03:20.431
And this is consistent with everything else we know about sine

00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:23.752
the period of sin(x)

00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:24.823
what you see here

00:03:24.823 --> 00:03:26.398
you have a coefficient of 1 here

00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:29.512
so the period is going to be 2π over the absolute value of 1

00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:31.794
which is a little bit obvious it's just 2π

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:34.176
or you just see here that the period is 2π

00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:42.500
It took 2π length to do our smallest repeating pattern

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.248
And what is the amplitude?

00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:47.918
Well we vary between 1 and -1

00:03:47.918 --> 00:03:50.448
The total difference between the minimum and maximum is 2

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:52.062
Half of that is 1

00:03:52.062 --> 00:03:53.549
Or another way of thinking about it is

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.787
we vary 1 from our middle point

00:03:57.787 --> 00:04:01.132
So that was pretty straight forward

00:04:01.132 --> 00:04:02.814
Let's change it up a little bit

00:04:02.814 --> 00:04:14.101
Now let's graph y=2sin(x)

00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:16.726
So let me draw

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:21.071
let me put my little axis there

00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:23.170
want to do it right under it

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.696
So what is going to happen

00:04:25.696 --> 00:04:30.576
now that we have y = 2sin(x)

00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:34.838
how is the graph going to change?

00:04:34.838 --> 00:04:40.336
Well all we did is multiply this function by 2 so

00:04:40.336 --> 00:04:43.410
whatever this value it takes on is going to be twice as high now

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.658
so 2 times 0 is 0

00:04:45.658 --> 00:04:48.645
2 times 1 is now 2

00:04:48.645 --> 00:04:49.742
2 times 1 is 2

00:04:49.742 --> 00:04:51.156
2 times 0 is

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:52.464
let me be careful

00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:55.302
2 times 1 is 2

00:04:55.302 --> 00:04:56.884
that's a π/2

00:04:56.884 --> 00:04:59.894
2 times 0 is a 0

00:04:59.894 --> 00:05:04.726
2 times -1 is -2

00:05:04.726 --> 00:05:08.256
2 times 0 is 0

00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:10.700
so it looks something like this

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.932
between 0 and 2π

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:18.533
so it looks something like that

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:20.936
and we keep going in the negative direction

00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:25.726
2 times -1 is -2

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:28.238
2 times 0 is 0

00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:31.517
2 times 1 is 2

00:05:31.517 --> 00:05:32.864
2 times 0 is 0

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.950
so in the negative direction it looks something like that

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.845
my best attempt to draw a relatively smooth curve

00:05:39.845 --> 00:05:41.956
hopefully you get the idea

00:05:41.956 --> 00:05:43.605
so it would look something like that

00:05:43.605 --> 00:05:45.820
So what just happened?

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.875
Well the difference between the minimum

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:52.151
value and the maximum value just increased by a factor of 2

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:56.532
the total difference is 4, half of that difference is 2

00:05:56.532 --> 00:05:59.178
So what is the amplitude here?

00:05:59.178 --> 00:06:05.101
Well the amplitude is 2

00:06:05.101 --> 00:06:08.124
you can view it as the absolute value of 2

00:06:08.124 --> 00:06:09.972
well it's common sense

00:06:09.972 --> 00:06:14.953
the amplitude here was 1 but now you're swaying from that middle position twice as far

00:06:14.953 --> 00:06:17.983
because you're multiplying by 2

00:06:17.983 --> 00:06:19.488
Now let's go back to

00:06:19.488 --> 00:06:23.580
sin(x) and let's change it in a different way

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.230
Let's graph sin(-x)

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.546
so now let me once again put some graph paper here

00:06:31.546 --> 00:06:40.736
And now my goal is to graph sin(-x)

00:06:40.736 --> 00:06:43.703
y=sin(-x) so at least for the time being I've got rid of that 2 there

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:47.118
and I'm just going straight from sin(x) to sin(-x)

00:06:47.118 --> 00:06:50.922
So let's think about how the values are going to work out

00:06:50.922 --> 00:06:56.048
So when x is 0 this is still going to be sin(0) which is 0

00:06:56.048 --> 00:07:01.845
But then what as x increases, what happens when x is π/2

00:07:01.845 --> 00:07:04.017
the angle that we're inputting in to sine

00:07:04.017 --> 00:07:05.270
we're going to have to multiply by this negative

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.681
so when x is π/2

00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:09.948
we're really taking sin(-π/2)

00:07:09.948 --> 00:07:16.740
but what's sin(-π/2) but we can see over here here it's -1

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.705
It's - 1

00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:24.988
and then when x = π well sin(-π) we see this is 0

00:07:24.988 --> 00:07:29.588
When x is 3π/2 well it's going to be sin(-3π/2)

00:07:29.588 --> 00:07:32.851
which is 1

00:07:32.851 --> 00:07:38.515
Once again when x is 2π it's going to be sin(-2π)

00:07:38.515 --> 00:07:39.689
is 0

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:45.083
So notice what was happening as I was trying to graph between 0 and 2π

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:48.514
I kept referring to the points in the negative direction

00:07:48.514 --> 00:07:51.740
so you can imagine taking this negative side

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.325
right over here between 0 and -2π

00:07:56.325 --> 00:07:59.855
and then flipping it over to get this one right over here

00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:02.187
that's what that -x seems to do

00:08:02.187 --> 00:08:05.079
and by that same logic when we go in then negative direction

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:10.198
you say when x = -π/2 where you have the negative in front of it

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.654
so it's going to be sin(π/2) so it's going to be equal to 1

00:08:13.654 --> 00:08:17.677
and you can flip this over the y-axis

00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:19.581
so essentially what we have done

00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:20.672
is we have flipped it we have

00:08:20.672 --> 00:08:26.983
reflected the graph of sin(x) over the y-axis

00:08:26.983 --> 00:08:38.940
So we have reflected it over the y-axis

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.050
This is the y-axis so hopefully you see that reflection

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.218
that's what that -x has done

00:08:47.218 --> 00:08:51.117
So now let's think about kind of the combo

00:08:51.117 --> 00:08:54.185
Having the 2 out the front and the -x right over there

00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:58.502
so let me put the graph on the axis there one more time

00:08:58.502 --> 00:09:02.981
And now let's try to do what was asked of us

00:09:02.981 --> 00:09:04.533
So I'll do it in a new colour

00:09:04.533 --> 00:09:05.285
I'll do it in blue

00:09:05.285 --> 00:09:17.502
now let's graph y = 2sin(-x)

00:09:17.502 --> 00:09:19.789
so based on everything we've done

00:09:19.789 --> 00:09:21.010
how will this look

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.215
what are the transformations we will do?

00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:32.648
If we are going from the original sin(x) to y=2sin(-x)

00:09:32.648 --> 00:09:35.062
Well there're 2 ways of thinking about it

00:09:35.062 --> 00:09:37.333
You could either take 2sin(x)

00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:41.421
so here we multiply it by 2 to get double the amplitude

00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:42.752
And you could say

00:09:42.752 --> 00:09:47.018
well I'm going to flip it over to get the negative side of x

00:09:47.018 --> 00:09:50.013
And so if you did that you'd get

00:09:50.013 --> 00:09:51.728
so let me make it clear what I'm flipping

00:09:51.728 --> 00:09:56.318
so if I took between 0 and -2π

00:09:56.318 --> 00:09:58.054
and I flip it over

00:09:58.054 --> 00:10:02.340
what used to be here you reflect it over the y-axis

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.906
and you now have

00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:07.435
so we go negative first

00:10:07.435 --> 00:10:09.556
then we go back to 0 and then it'll go positive

00:10:09.556 --> 00:10:13.974
and then you get right over there

00:10:13.974 --> 00:10:17.268
So all I did to get from 2sin(x) to 2sin(-x)

00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:20.701
is I just reflected over the y-axis

00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:24.186
and then of course what is between 0 and -2pi

00:10:24.186 --> 00:10:26.610
you just have to look between 0 and 2pi

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.102
so it's going to go up

00:10:29.102 --> 00:10:30.192
up and down

00:10:30.192 --> 00:10:32.000
and make it even a little bit better

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.167
draw a little bit neater

00:10:33.167 --> 00:10:37.691
and then down and then down and up

00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:41.093
so it's a reflection of what was between 0 and 2π

00:10:41.093 --> 00:10:43.320
so you see that right over here

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.140
or if you start with sin(-x) and you go to 2sin(-x)

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:52.163
notice what happens between sin(-x) and 2sin(-x)

00:10:52.163 --> 00:10:55.570
What's the difference between this graph and this graph?

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.460
Well we just have twice the amplitude

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.955
we're multiplying this one by 2

00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:05.057
and so you get twice the amplitude

00:11:05.057 --> 00:11:07.937
And so the last thought or question I have for you

00:11:07.937 --> 00:11:13.791
is how does the period of 2sin(-x)

00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:17.866
how does that relate to the period of sin(x)

00:11:17.866 --> 00:11:19.340
Well there's 2 ways of thinking about it

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.451
we could actually I'll you think about it for a second

00:11:23.451 --> 00:11:25.331
Well there's 2 ways to thinking about it

00:11:25.331 --> 00:11:28.150
you could refer to the graphs over here

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.753
or you can think about the formula which is hopefully a little intuitive right now

00:11:31.753 --> 00:11:35.274
if you wanted to refer to the kind of classical formula

00:11:35.274 --> 00:11:37.742
the period is going to be 2π

00:11:37.742 --> 00:11:40.464
and you divide by the absolute value of the coefficient

00:11:40.464 --> 00:11:44.269
to figure out how much faster you're going to get to 2π

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:52.020
So the absolute value of -1 is just 1

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.435
so you get 2π

00:11:53.435 --> 00:11:58.973
So you get the exact same period as the period of sin(x)

00:11:58.973 --> 00:12:00.236
And you see that

00:12:00.236 --> 00:12:08.083
you complete one cycle every 2π ...

00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:09.975
Now what is the difference?

00:12:09.975 --> 00:12:11.051
Well the period's the same.

00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.310
But remember this negative is not completely ignored.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.203
It doesn't change the period but it does change how the graph looks

00:12:18.203 --> 00:12:20.314
When you start getting increased x's

00:12:20.314 --> 00:12:22.763
instead of sin being positive as it would be

00:12:22.763 --> 00:12:25.805
in the case of a traditional sine function

00:12:25.805 --> 00:12:27.616
here as x grows

00:12:27.616 --> 00:12:29.492
you're taking the sine of -x

00:12:29.492 --> 00:12:32.056
You're taking the sine of a negative angle

00:12:32.056 --> 00:12:35.439
And that's why you start off having negative values of sine

00:12:35.439 --> 00:12:36.696
and that's also another way

00:12:36.696 --> 00:12:37.673
if you want to think about it

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:39.861
that it's just a reflection over the y-axis

00:12:39.861 --> 00:12:41.158
of just sin(x)

00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:43.804
These two are reflections and these two are reflections

00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:47.296
this one is two times the amplitude of this one

00:12:47.296 --> 00:12:51.296
and that one is two times the amplitude of that one
