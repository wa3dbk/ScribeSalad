00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.420
Simplify negative 1
times this expression

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.290
in brackets, negative 7 plus
2 times 3 plus 2 minus 5,

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.140
in parentheses, squared.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.920
So this is an order
of operations problem.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.750
And remember, order
of operations,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.280
you always want to
do parentheses first.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.230
Parentheses first.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.870
Then you do exponents.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.540
Exponents.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.940
And there is an exponent in
this problem right over here.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.290
Then you want to
do multiplication.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.560
Multiplication and division.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.790
And then finally, you do
addition and subtraction.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.380
So let's just try to
tackle this as best we can.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.900
So first, let's do
the parentheses.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.780
We have a 3 plus 2
here in parentheses,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.156
so we can evaluate
that to be equal to 5.

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:53.780
And let's see, we
could do other things

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.363
in other parts of
this expression that

00:00:55.363 --> 00:00:58.190
won't affect what's going on
right here in the parentheses.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.280
We have this negative 5 squared.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.310
Or I should just, we're
subtracting a 5 squared.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.050
We want to do the
exponent before we

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.390
worry about it being subtracted.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.380
So this 5 squared over
here we can rewrite as 25.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.600
And so let's not do
too many steps at once.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.970
So this whole thing will
simplify to negative 1.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.070
And then in brackets, we have
negative 7 plus 2 times 5.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.530
And then, 2 times 5.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.280
And then close brackets.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.285
Minus 25.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.869
Now, this thing-- we want
to do multiplication.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:39.910
You could say, hey, wait.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.940
I still have a parentheses here.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.990
Why don't I do that first?

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.220
But when you just
evaluate what's

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.360
inside of this parentheses,
you just get a negative 7.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.776
It doesn't really
change anything.

00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:49.847
So we can just leave this
here as a negative 7.

00:01:49.847 --> 00:01:50.680
And this expression.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.220
We do want to evaluate this
whole expression before we

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.930
do anything else.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.429
I mean, we could distribute
this negative 1 and all of that,

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.480
but let's just do straight
up order of operations here.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.230
So let's evaluate
this expression.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.950
We want to do multiplication
before we add anything.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.520
So we get 2 times
5 right over there.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.239
2 times 5 is 10.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.090
That is 10.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.465
So our whole
expression becomes--

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.840
and normally, you wouldn't
have to rewrite the expression

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.590
this many times.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.006
But we're going
to do it this time

00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:17.750
just to make sure no
one gets confused.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.670
So it becomes negative 1
times negative 7 plus 10.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.650
Plus 10.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.660
And we close our brackets.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.020
Minus 25.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.110
Now, we can evaluate
this pretty easily.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.980
Negative 7 plus 10.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.190
We're starting at negative 7.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.430
So I was going to draw
a number line there.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.710
So we're starting-- let
me draw a number line.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.640
So we're starting at negative 7.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.610
So the length of this
line is negative 7.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.650
And then, we're adding 10 to it.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.136
We're adding 10 to it.

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:56.760
So we're going to
move 10 to the right.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.180
If we move 7 to the
right, we get back to 0.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.800
And then we're going to
go another 3 after that.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.820
So we're going to
go 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.590
So that gets us to positive 3.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.250
Another way to
think about it is we

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.590
are adding integers
of different signs.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.500
We can view the
sum as going to be

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.490
the difference of the integers.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.710
And since the larger
integer is positive,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.470
our answer will be positive.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.940
So you could literally just
view this as 10 minus 7.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.100
10 minus 7 is 3.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.590
So this becomes a 3.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.990
And so our entire expression
becomes negative 1.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.960
Negative 1 times.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.880
And just to be clear,
brackets and parentheses

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.130
are really the same thing.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.804
Sometimes people
will write brackets

00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:44.470
around a lot of
parentheses just to make

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.900
it a little bit easier to read.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.150
But they're really just the
same thing as parentheses.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.620
So these brackets out here,
I could just literally

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.230
write them like that.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.244
And then I have a
minus 25 out over here.

00:03:56.244 --> 00:03:58.660
Now, once again, you want to
do multiplication or division

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.350
before we do addition
and subtraction.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.260
So let's multiply the negative
1 times 3 is negative 3.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.100
And now we need to
subtract our 25.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.880
So negative 3 minus 25.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.079
We are adding two
integers of the same sign.

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.620
We're already at
negative 3 and we're

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.980
going to become 25 more
negative than that.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.390
So you can view
this as we're moving

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.270
25 more in the
negative direction.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.515
Or you could view it
as 3 plus 25 is 28.

00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:26.390
But we're doing it in
the negative direction,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.480
so it's negative 28.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.460
So this is equal to negative 28.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.650
And we are done.
