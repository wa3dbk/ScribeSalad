00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.150
Hello.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.100
In the last presentation we
kind of re-defined the sine,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.140
the cosine, and the tangent
functions in a broader way

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.580
where we said if we have a unit
circle and our theta is, or our

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.795
angle, is -- let me use the
right tool -- let's say, and

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:24.950
our angle is the angle between,
say, the x-axis and a radius in

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.570
the unit circle, and
this is our radius.

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:33.870
the coordinate of the point
where this radius intersects

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.070
the unit circle is x comma y.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.490
Our new definition of the trig
functions was that sine of

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.000
theta is equal to the
y-coordinate, right, this is

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.920
y-coordinate where it
intersects the unit circle.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.400
And remember, this
is the unit circle.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.260
It's not just any circle, which
means it has a radius of 1.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.990
Cosine of theta is equal to the
x-coordinate of this point.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.360
This is the x-coordinate.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.550
And tangent of theta
equaled opposite over

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.050
adjacent or y over x.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.665
That's interesting because
that's also equal to sine of

00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:22.060
theta over cosine of theta.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.000
I'll just do that.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I wasn't even planning on
covering that, but just it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.370
leaves you something
to think about.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.850
So with that said, let's take a
look or let's try to see how

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.940
this defines these functions.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.120
And I guess a good place to
start is just with the sine

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.450
function and we can
try to graph it.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.080
So let's write, let's do a
little table like we always do

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.470
when we define a function.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.190
Let's put in values of
theta, and let's figure

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.690
out what sine of theta is.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.370
So when theta is equal to 0
radians, what is sine of theta?

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:05.430
So when theta's 0, right, then
the radius between it -- this

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.600
is the radius and this is
the point where the radius

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.210
intersects the unit circle.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.720
And this point has a
coordinate 1 comma 0, right?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.120
And so if where it intersects
the unit circle is at 1 comma

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.460
0, then sine of theta is
just the y-coordinate.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.620
So sine of theta is 0.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.570
If we said what is sine
of theta when theta is

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.870
equal to pi over 2.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.370
So now our radius is this
radius and we intersect the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.180
unit circle right here
at the point 0 comma 1.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.010
And what's the y-coordinate
at 0 comma 1?

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.900
Well it's 1.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.910
What happens when we have
theta is equal to pi radians?

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.350
So at pi radians we intersect
the unit circle right here.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.700
We're at pi radian.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.600
This is the angle, pi.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.520
We intersect with unit circle
at negative 1 comma 0.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.950
Because once again, this
is the unit circle.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.790
So at negative 1 comma 0,
what's the y-coordinate?

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.410
Well, it's 0.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.710
So sine of pi is equal to 0.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.750
Let's just keep going
around the circle.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:32.185
When we have the angle, when
theta is equal to 3 pi over 4

00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:37.370
-- no, sorry, 3 pi over 2.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.220
Because this is pi and
this is another half pi.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.310
So this is 3 pi over 2, sorry.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.720
So when theta is equal to 3 pi
over 2, what is sine of theta?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.430
Well, now we intersect the
unit circle down here at the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.920
point 0 comma negative 1.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.040
So now sine of theta is
equal to negative 1.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.320
Then if we go all the way
around the circle to 2

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.680
pi radians, we're back
at this point again.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.300
So sine of theta, so we're
at 2 pi, sine of theta

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.960
is now 0 once again.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.210
So let's graph these points out
and then we'll try to figure

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.970
out what the points in between
look like, and I'll show

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.050
you the graph of a
sine function is.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.800
So let's draw the x-axis.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.450
This is my x-axis.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.595
And let's draw the y-axis.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.700
Not as clean as I
wanted to draw it.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.735
This is y.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.410
And that's x.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.360
But in this case instead of
saying that's the x-axis, let's

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.910
call that the theta axis,
because we defined theta as the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.370
input or our domains
in terms of theta.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.170
So this is the theta axis.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.290
Now we're going to
graph sine of theta.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.565
So when we said when
theta equaled 0, sine

00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:09.030
of theta is equal to 0.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.260
So that's this point
right here, 0 comma 0.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:24.760
When theta is equal to pi over
2, sine of theta is equal to 1.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.680
So this is the point pi
over 2 comma 1, right?

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.270
That's just this 1.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:40.610
When theta is equal to pi,
sine of theta is 0 again.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.660
So this is the
point pi comma 0.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:56.540
And when theta equaled 3 pi
over 2, what was sine of theta?

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.420
I equaled negative 1.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.730
Interesting.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.330
Then when we got to 2 pi --
when we got to theta equal

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.700
to 2 pi, sine of theta,
again, equaled 0.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.570
So we know that these
points are on the graph

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.680
of sine of theta.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.720
And if you actually tried the
points in between, and as

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.480
an exercise it might be
interesting for you to do so.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.140
You could actually figure out
a lot of the points using

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.650
30-60-90 triangles or using
the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.930
But you actually get a curve
that looks something -- let me

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.630
use a nicer color than this
kind of drab grey -- you

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.360
get a graph that looks
something like this.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.430
And you've probably
seen that before.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.990
The term for this function
is actually a sine wave.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.870
It looks like something
that's oscillating or

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.140
that's moving up and down.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.390
And actually if you were to put
in thetas that were less than

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.470
0, the sine wave will
keep going into the

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.520
negative theta axis.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.220
It keeps going forever
in both directions.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.940
It keeps oscillating between
1 and negative 1 and

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.960
the points in between.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.180
So that's the graph of
the sign function.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.390
In the next module I'll
actually do the graph of the

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.350
cosine function, or actually I
might just show you the graph

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.840
of the cosine function.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.580
Then I'll show you how they
relate and how these can

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:27.480
describe any kind of, or many
types of oscillatory things in

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.150
the world and how it relates to
frequency and amplitude.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.740
So I'll see you in
the next module.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.270
And just for fun you might want
to sit down with a piece of

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.920
paper and try to graph the
cosine function or the

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.680
tangent function as well.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.160
Have fun.
