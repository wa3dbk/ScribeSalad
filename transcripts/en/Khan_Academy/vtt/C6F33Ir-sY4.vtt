00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.810
Eric is selling raffle tickets
for a school fundraiser.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.160
Each ticket costs $3, and he
knows the amount of money he

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.670
collects is a function of how
many tickets he sells.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.540
What are the domain and range
for that function?

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.350
So let's write the
function for how

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.040
much money he collects.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.850
So I'll call that m, the
function will be m, and it's a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.690
function of how many
tickets he sells.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.290
So it's a function of
t, for tickets.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.030
So m, the amount of money
collected, is a function of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.820
the number of tickets
he sells.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.940
That's a pretty straightforward
function.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.690
Every ticket costs $3.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.920
He gets $3 for every ticket.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.630
So it's going to be 3 times
t dollars or 3t dollars.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.420
That's how much money
he collects.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.490
Now they ask us, what
are the domain and

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.850
range for that function?

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.250
It sounds all fancy and
difficult, but just remember

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.070
the domain, this just
means, what can I

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.320
input into the function?

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.140
So another way to think about
is what are the possible t's

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.520
that can be input into
this function?

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.270
The range is, what are the
possible values that the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.190
function can take on?

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.710
So think about it.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.980
You might at first say I could
put any t there, but think

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.820
about the actual reality
of what he's doing.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.540
He's selling tickets,
and so he can't

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.670
sell negative tickets.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.880
He might sell 0 tickets,
and he might

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.280
sell a gazillion tickets.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.290
I guess he could sell an
infinite amount of tickets.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.670
At some point that becomes
unrealistic.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.590
But he definitely can't
sell negative tickets.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.970
He also is not going to
sell half of a ticket.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.520
Every ticket he sells is a whole
number, it's an integer.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:58.590
So the domain for this function,
we could say t has

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:09.389
to be a non-negative integer.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.160
I think that covers what
I just talked about.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.150
Non-negative.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.730
Instead of saying positive,
because it could be 0.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.620
He might literally
sell no tickets.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.550
He can't sell a negative 1
ticket or negative 2, so it's

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.730
anything that's non-negative.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.450
It has to be an integer, he
can't sell half of a ticket,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.730
so, and he definitely-- it
has to be an integer.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.200
So that's our domain,.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.050
And let's think about
what our range is.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.960
A range is the possible values
that we can take on.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.850
If t is always going to be a
non-negative integer, then

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.910
what's 3t always going to be?

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.850
Well it's going to be a
non-negative multiple of 3.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:58.130
So non-negative multiples
of 3.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.450
Think about it.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.530
He'll never be able to collect
$2, because he could either

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.920
sell 0 tickets and
get nothing.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.790
Let me write this down.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.480
He might sell 0 tickets, so m
of 0, he's going to get $0.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.050
m of, if he sells one ticket,
he's going to get $3.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.800
If he sells two tickets,
he's going to get $6.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.710
So he's never going to be
able to get 2 or 4.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.440
Every possible value for the
amount of money he collects

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.370
for our function has to
be a multiple of 3.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.660
It's going to be a non-negative
multiple of 3

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.610
because the domain is
non-negative integers.
