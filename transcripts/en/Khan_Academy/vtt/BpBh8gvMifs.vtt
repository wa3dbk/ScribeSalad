00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
I have here a bunch of radical
expressions, or square root

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.110
expressions.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.600
And what I'm going to do is
go through all of them and

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.500
simplify them.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.240
And we'll talk about whether
these are rational or

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.390
irrational numbers.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.710
So let's start with A.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.440
A is equal to the square
root of 25.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.560
Well that's the same thing as
the square root of 5 times 5,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.000
which is a clearly
going to be 5.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.440
We're focusing on the positive
square root here.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.060
Now let's do B.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.920
B I'll do in a different color,
for the principal root,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.250
when we say positive
square root.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.200
B, we have the square
root of 24.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.960
So what you want to do, is
you want to get the prime

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.530
factorization of this
number right here.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.560
So 24, let's do its prime
factorization.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.250
This is 2 times 12.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.720
12 is 2 times 6.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.430
6 is 2 times 3.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.220
So the square root of 24, this
is the same thing as the

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:15.320
square root of 2 times
2 times 2 times 3.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.080
That's the same thing as 24.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.530
Well, we see here, we have one
perfect square right there.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.870
So we could rewrite this.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.330
This is the same thing as the
square root of 2 times 2 times

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.030
the square root of 2 times 3.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.890
Now this is clearly 2.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.010
This is the square root of 4.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.920
The square root of 4 is 2.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.710
And then this we can't
simplify anymore.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.520
We don't see two numbers
multiplied by itself here.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.940
So this is going to be times
the square root of 6.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.110
Or we could even right this as
the square root of 2 times the

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.540
square root of 3.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.210
Now I said I would talk
about whether things

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.550
are rational or not.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.460
This is rational.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.630
This part A can be expressed
as the ratio of 2 integers.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.920
Namely 5/1.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.340
This is rational.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.590
This is irrational.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.060
I'm not going to prove
it in this video.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.770
But anything that is the product
of irrational numbers.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.920
And the square root of any prime
number is irrational.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.790
I'm not proving it here.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.060
This is the square root of 2
times the square root of 3.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.365
That's what the square
root of 6 is.

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:32.280
And that's what makes
this irrational.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.910
I cannot express this as
any type of fraction.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.830
I can't express this as some
integer over some other

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.280
integer like I did there.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.250
And I'm not proving it here.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.910
I'm just giving you a little
bit of practice.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.010
And a quicker way to do this.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.300
You could say, hey,
4 goes into this.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.770
4 is a perfect square.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.830
Let me take a 4 out.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.120
This is 4 times 6.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.770
The square root of 4 is 2, leave
the 6 in, and you would

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.160
have gotten the 2 square
roots of 6.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.990
Which you will get the hang of
it eventually, but I want to

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.590
do it systematically first.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.820
Let's do part C.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.610
Square root of 20.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.350
Once again, 20 is 2 times
10, which is 2 times 5.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.050
So this is the same thing as the
square root of 2 times 2,

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.740
right, times 5.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.690
Now, the square root of 2 times
2, that's clearly just

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.120
going to be 2.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.530
It's going to be the square
root of this times

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.380
square root of that.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.400
2 times the square root of 5.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.090
And once again, you could
probably do that in your head

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.910
with a little practice.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.920
The square root of the
20 is 4 times 5.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.550
The square root of 4 is 2.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.080
You leave the 5 in
the radical.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.200
So let's do part D.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.380
We have to do the square
root of 200.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.350
Same process.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.390
Let's take the prime
factors of it.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.310
So it's 2 times 100, which is
2 times 50, which is 2 times

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.030
25, which is 5 times 5.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.640
So this right here,
we can rewrite it.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.800
Let me scroll to the
right a little bit.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:15.030
This is equal to the square
root of 2 times 2 times 2

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.390
times 5 times 5.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.730
Well we have one perfect square
there, and we have

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.350
another perfect square there.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.290
So if I just want to write out
all the steps, this would be

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.170
the square root of 2 times 2
times the square root of 2

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.120
times the square root
of 5 times 5.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.345
The square root of
2 times 2 is 2.

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:40.245
The square root of 2 is just
the square root of 2.

00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:43.680
The square root of 5 times 5,
that's the square root of 25,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.430
that's just going to be 5.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.880
So you can rearrange these.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.830
2 times 5 is 10.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.730
10 square roots of 2.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.150
And once again, this
it is irrational.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.800
You can't express it as a
fraction with an integer and a

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.850
numerator and the denominator.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.270
And if you were to actually try
to express this number, it

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.610
will just keep going on and on
and on, and never repeating.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.790
Well let's do part E.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.720
The square root of 2000.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.660
I'll do it down here.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.620
Part E, the square
root of 2000.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.950
Same exact process that we've
been doing so far.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.820
Let's do the prime
factorization.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:35.680
That is 2 times 1000, which is
2 times 500, which is 2 times

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:45.930
250, which is 2 times 125,
which is 5 times 25,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.580
which is 5 times 5.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.600
And we're done.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.180
So this is going to be equal to
the square root of 2 times

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.630
2-- I'll put it in parentheses--
2 times 2, times

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:06.350
2 times 2, times 2 times
2, times 5 times 5,

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.840
times 5 times 5, right?

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.390
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 2's, and
then 3, 5's, times 5.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.000
Now what is this going
to be equal to?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.520
Well, one thing you might see
is, hey, I could write this

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.140
as, this is a 4, this is a 4.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.510
So we're going to have
a 4 repeated.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.600
And so this the same thing as
the square root of 4 times 4

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.330
times the square root of
5 times 5 times the

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.480
square root of 5.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.310
So this right here
is obviously 4.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.570
This right here is 5.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.070
And then times the
square root of 5.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.070
So 4 times 5 is 20 square
roots of 5.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.290
And once again, this
is irrational.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.990
Well, let's do F.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:16.850
The square root of 1/4, which
we can view this is the same

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.250
thing as the square root of 1
over the square root of 4,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.180
which is equal to 1/2.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.170
Which is clearly rational.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.400
It can be expressed
as a fraction.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.050
So that's clearly rational.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:39.380
Part G is the square
root of 9/4.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.600
Same logic.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.160
This is equal to the square root
of 9 over the square root

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.910
of 4, which is equal to 3/2.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.960
Let's do part H.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.720
The square root of 0.16.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.250
Now you could do this in your
head if you immediately

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.670
recognize that, gee, if
I multiply 0.4 times

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.170
0.4, I'll get this.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.190
But I'll show you a more
systematic way of doing it, if

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.040
that wasn't obvious to you.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.330
So this is the same thing
as the square

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.730
root of 16/100, right?

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.840
That's what 0.16 is.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.740
So this is equal to the square
root of 16 over the square

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:37.010
root of 100, which is equal to
4/10, which is equal to 0.4.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.260
Let's do a couple
more like that.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:39.429
OK.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:46.180
Part I was the square root of
0.1, which is equal to the

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.840
square root of 1/10, which is
equal to the square root of 1

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.980
over the square root of 10,
which is equal to 1 over--

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.890
now, the square root of 10--
10 is just 2 times 5.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.380
So that doesn't really
help us much.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.920
So that's just the square
root of 10 like that.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.130
A lot of math teachers don't
like you leaving that radical

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.870
in the denominator.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.330
But I can already tell you
that this is irrational.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.650
You'll just keep getting
numbers.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.850
You can try it on your
calculator, and

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:17.530
it will never repeat.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.430
Your calculator will just give
you an approximation.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.100
Because in order to give the
exact value, you'd have to

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.560
have an infinite number
of digits.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.770
But if you wanted to
rationalize this,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.820
just to show you.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.620
If you want to get rid of the
radical in the denominator,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.090
you can multiply this times the
square root of 10 over the

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.520
square root of 10, right?

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.910
This is just 1.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.130
So you get the square
root of 10/10.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.630
These are equivalent statements,
but both of them

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.540
are irrational.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.870
You take an irrational number,
divide it by 10, you still

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.660
have an irrational number.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.930
Let's do J.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.820
We have the square
root of 0.01.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.570
This is the same thing as the
square root of 1/100.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.680
Which is equal to the square
root of 1 over the square root

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:07.050
of 100, which is equal
to 1/10, or 0.1.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.030
Clearly once again
this is rational.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.880
It's being written
as a fraction.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.185
This one up here was
also rational.

00:10:14.185 --> 00:10:16.030
It can be written expressed
as a fraction.
