00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:05.133
I'm going to define a function S of n

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.759
and I'm going to define it as

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:16.754
the sum of all positive integers

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:22.221
including N.

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.995
And so the domain of this function is really all

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:28.533
positive integers - N has to be a positive integer.

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.467
And so we can try this out with a few things, we can

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:35.200
take S of 3, this is going to be equal to 1 plus

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.071
2 plus 3, which is equal to 6. We could take S of

00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:46.610
4, which is going to be 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.225
which is going to be equal to 10.

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:57.441
Now what I want to do in this video is prove to you that

00:00:57.441 --> 00:01:02.200
I can write this as a function of N, that the sum of all

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.200
positive integers up to and including N is equal to

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:11.400
n times n plus one, all of that over 2.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.821
And the way I'm going to prove it to you is by induction.

00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:23.785
Proof by induction.

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:27.867
The way you do a proof by induction is first, you prove

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:36.871
the base case. This is what we need to prove.

00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:41.933
We're going to first prove it for 1 - that will be our base case.

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:47.400
And then we're going to do the induction step, which

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.000
is essentially saying "If we assume it works for some

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.513
positive integer K", then we can prove it's going to work

00:01:55.513 --> 00:01:59.467
for the next positive integer, for example K + 1.

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:01.995
And the reason why this works is - Let's say that

00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:10.754
we prove both of these. So the base case we're going to prove it for 1.

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.800
But it doesn't always have to be 1.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.908
Your statement might be true for everything above 55.

00:02:16.908 --> 00:02:18.667
Or everything above some threshold.

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:21.533
But in this case, we are saying this is true for all positive integers.

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:24.333
Our base case is going to be 1.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:34.533
Then in our induction step, we are going to prove that if you assume that this thing is true,

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:37.333
for sum of k.

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:42.533
If we assume that then it is going to be true for sum of k + 1.

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:48.333
And the reason why this is all you have to do to prove this for all positive integers

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:50.000
it's just imagine:

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Let's think about all of the positive integers right over here.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.467
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 you could just keep going on forever.

00:02:57.467 --> 00:03:00.200
So we are going to prove it for 1.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.600
We are going to prove that this formula right over here,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.067
this expression right over here applies for the case of 1, when n is 1.

00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:12.867
And then we are going to prove that if we know it is true for any given k that is true for the next one

00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:16.333
So if we know it is true for 1 in our base case then the second step,

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:19.067
this induction step must be true for 2 then.

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:22.867
Because we proved generally if it's true for k it's going to be true for k + 1.

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:25.733
When it's true for 2, then it must be true for 3,

00:03:25.733 --> 00:03:29.600
because we have proved it, when it's true for k, it's true for k + 1.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.667
So if it's true for 2 it's true for 3.

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.067
and if it's true for 3 it's going to be true for 4.

00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:37.667
You can just keep going on and on forever, which means it's true for everything.

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:43.533
Now spoken in generalaties let's actually prove this by induction.

00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:51.800
So let's take the sum of, let's do this function on 1.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.533
that is just going to be the sum of all positive integers

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.800
including 1 is just literally going to be 1.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.400
We've just added all of them, it is just 1.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.000
There is no other positive integer up to and including 1.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.400
And now we can prove that this is the same thing as

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.600
1 times 1 plus 1 all of that over 2.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.533
1 plus 1 is 2, 2 divided by 2 is 1, 1 times 1 is 1.

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:17.533
So this formula right over here, this expression

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:23.267
it worked for 1, so we have proved our base case.

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:24.867
we have proven it for 1.

00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:31.385
Now what I want to do is I want to assume that it works for some number k.

00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:41.467
So I will assume true for some number k.

00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:48.000
So i'm going to assume that for some number k, that this function at k is going to be equal to

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.133
k times k plus 1 over 2.

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:54.200
So I'm just assuming this is true for that.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:01.400
Now what I want to do is think about what happens when I try to find this function for k + 1.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.133
This is what I'm assuming.

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:05.133
I'm assuming I know this.

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:07.200
Now let's try to do it for k + 1.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.323
So what is the sum of all of the integers up to and including k + 1?

00:05:14.323 --> 00:05:20.800
Well this is going to be 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus all the way up to k.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.667
Plus k plus 1.

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:26.933
Right? this is the sum of everything up to and including k plus 1.

00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:30.333
Well we are assuming that we know what this already is.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:32.600
We are assuming that we already have a formula for this.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.133
We are assuming that this is going to simplify to k times k plus 1 over 2.

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:41.000
We are assuming that we know that.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.733
So we will just take this part and we will add it to k plus 1.

00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:50.190
so we'll add it to k plus 1 over here.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.467
And if you find the common denominator, the common denominator is going to be 2.

00:05:55.467 --> 00:05:58.667
So this is going to be equal to...

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:00.600
I'll write the part in magenta first.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:10.667
so this is k times k plus 1 over 2 plus 2 times k plus 1 over 2.

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:13.533
This thing in blue is the same thing as that thing in blue.

00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:16.533
The 2's would cancel out, I'd just wrote it this way so I have a common denominator.

00:06:16.533 --> 00:06:20.615
So this is going to be equal to...

00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:25.800
We have a common denominator of 2 and I'll write this in a different colour here.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.400
So we are going to have k times k plus 1 plus 2 times k plus 1.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.867
Now at this step right over here you can factor out a k plus 1.

00:06:36.867 --> 00:06:39.267
Both of these terms are divisible by k + 1.

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:41.000
So let's factor this out.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.400
So if you factor out a k + 1, you get k plus 1 times

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.867
refractoring out over here, if you factor out k + 1 you'd just have a k.

00:06:50.867 --> 00:06:54.252
Over here if you factor out k + 1 you would just have a 2.

00:06:54.252 --> 00:06:55.225
Let me colour code those.

00:06:55.225 --> 00:06:56.800
So you would know what I'm doing.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:06.667
So this 2 is this 2 right over there and this k is this k right over there.

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:08.533
We factored it out.

00:07:08.533 --> 00:07:12.533
These k+1's we factored out is this k+1 over there.

00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:17.267
And it's going to be all of this over 2.

00:07:17.267 --> 00:07:21.533
Now, we can rewrite this. This is the same thing.

00:07:21.533 --> 00:07:23.333
This is equal to.

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:31.867
This is the same thing as k plus 1, that's this part right over here.

00:07:31.867 --> 00:07:37.200
Times k plus 1 plus 1.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.800
Right? This is clearly the same thing as k + 2.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.692
All of that over 2.

00:07:43.692 --> 00:07:46.141
Why is this interesting to us?

00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:47.538
Well we have just proven it.

00:07:47.538 --> 00:07:56.467
If we assume that this is true and if we use that assumption we get

00:07:56.467 --> 00:08:05.769
that the sum of all positive integers up to and including k + 1 is equal to k + 1 times k + 1 + 1 over

00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:06.415
2.

00:08:06.415 --> 00:08:13.133
We are actually showing that the original formula applies to k+1 as well.

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:20.867
If you would take k + 1 and put it in for n you got exactly the result that we got over here.

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:24.200
So we showed , we proved our base case.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.533
This expression worked for the sum for all of positive integers up to and including 1.

00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:34.867
And it also works if we assume that it works for everything up to k.

00:08:34.867 --> 00:08:39.533
Or if we assume it works for integer k it also works for the integer k plus 1.

00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:42.467
And we are done. That is our proof by induction.

00:08:42.467 --> 00:08:45.000
That proves to us that it works for all positive integers.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.400
Why is that?

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.200
We have proven it for 1 and we have proven it that if it works for some integer

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.385
it will work for the next integer.

00:08:56.385 --> 00:08:59.477
So if you assume it worked for 1 then it can work for 2.

00:08:59.477 --> 00:09:03.267
Well we have already proven that it works for 1 so we can assume it works for 1.

00:09:03.267 --> 00:09:05.067
So it definitely will work for 2.

00:09:05.067 --> 00:09:06.800
So we get 2 checked.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.333
But since we can assume it works for 2 we can now assume it works for 3.

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:14.000
Well if it works for 3 well then we have proven it works for 4.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.600
You see how this induction step is kinda like a domino,

00:09:16.600 --> 99:59:59.999
it cascades and we can go on and on forever so it works for all positive integers.
