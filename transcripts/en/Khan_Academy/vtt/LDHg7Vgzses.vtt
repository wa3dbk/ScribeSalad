00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.740
In the last video we talked
about how every atom really

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.280
wants to have eight-- let me
write that down-- eight

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.030
electrons in its outermost
shell.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.510
This is kind of the most stable
configuration than an

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.740
electron can have. And given
this fact that's been

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.180
determined just by observing
the world, really, we can

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.420
start to figure out what's
likely to happen in different

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.350
groups of the periodic table.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.820
A group of a periodic table
is just a column of

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.220
the periodic table.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.479
Like this group, right here, and
actually I'll start with

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.960
this group, because it's
got a special name.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.160
This group right here is
called the noble gases.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.860
And what's common when you
go down a group in

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.900
the periodic table?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.970
What's common about a column
in the periodic table?

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.100
Well, in the last video we saw
that every element in a column

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700
has the same number of
valence electrons.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.220
Or it has the same number
of electrons in

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.580
its outermost shell.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.000
And we figured out
what that was.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.160
This column, right here, which
we learned were the alkali

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.830
metals, this has one electron
in its outermost shell.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.530
And I made that one caveat
that hydrogen isn't

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.830
necessarily considered
an alkali metal.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.230
One, it's usually not
in metal form.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.320
And it doesn't want to give
away electrons as much as

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.490
other metals do.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.080
When people talk about
metal-like characteristics of

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.160
an element, they're really
talking about how likely it is

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.640
to give away electron.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.460
We'll talk about other
characteristics of a metal,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.020
especially the way that we
perceive metals as being

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.610
shiny, and maybe they conduct
electricity, and see how that

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.060
plays out in the
periodic table.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.760
But anyway, back to what
I was talking about.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.610
This column, right here,
this is called the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.680
alkaline earth metals.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.420
So this is alkaline earth.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.340
These all have two atoms
in its outermost shell.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.450
So remember, everyone wants
to get to eight.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.070
If these guys wanted to get to
eight by adding electrons,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.130
they would have a
long way to go.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.570
This way, we would have to
add seven electrons.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.850
They would have to add
six electrons.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.340
And who are they going
to take it from?

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.090
Because these guys don't want to
give away their electrons.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.860
They're so close to
getting to eight.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.980
So it's much easier when you're
on the left-hand side

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.350
of the periodic table to
give away electrons.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.120
In fact, when you only have one
to give away-- especially

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.150
in the case of elements other
than hydrogen-- when you only

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.980
have one to give away, it
really wants to do that.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.330
And because of that, these
elements right here are very

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.440
seldom found in their
elemental state.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.900
When I say elemental state, it
means there's nothing but

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.730
lithium there, there's nothing
but sodium there, there's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.950
nothing but potassium there.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.610
They're very likely, if you
find this, it's probably

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.530
already reacted with
something.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.470
Probably with something on
this side of the periodic

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.520
table, because this wants to
give away something really

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.150
bad, this wants to take
something really bad.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.340
So the reaction will
probably happen.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.100
These are still reactive.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.200
The alkaline earth metals are
still reactive, but not as

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.160
reactive as the alkali metals.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.090
And that's because these guys
are really close to getting to

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.840
the stable magic eight number.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.210
These guys are a little
bit further away.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.420
So it takes a little bit more,
I guess you could say, of a

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.670
push for them to
give away two.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.820
These guys only have
to give away one.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.485
And then we learned that
this has two in

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:20.440
its outermost shell.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.140
And then all of these elements,
which are called the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.710
transition metals, as you add
electrons, they're just

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.410
backfilling the previous
shell's d subshell.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.940
Right?

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.920
So their outermost shell
still has two.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.660
It still has those.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.300
If this is the fourth period,
all of these elements'

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.460
outermost shell has 4s2.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.560
And these elements are just
backfilling their 3d

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.720
suborbital.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.950
Or their 3d subshell.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.690
These are 2's.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.400
So these all have two
outermost electrons.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.190
So all of these, like the
alkaline earth metals, need to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.320
lose two electrons in order to,
quote-unquote, be happy.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.410
And the way I think about this,
and this is really just

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.810
a way-- and it maybe it bears
out in physical reality-- is

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.870
that these guys have kind of
a deep bench of electrons.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.649
That if they are able to shed
some of these valence

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:25.580
electrons-- so if I write iron
has two valence electrons like

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.890
that-- even if they shed these
electrons, they kind of have a

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.660
reserve of electrons in
the d subshell for

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.420
the previous shell.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.980
So if it sheds its 4s2
electrons, it still has all

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.740
those 3d electrons that have a
high energy state that can

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.650
maybe kind of replace them.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.930
And I'll use everything in
quotation marks, because these

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.770
are just ways for me to
visualize things.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.010
And the reason why I make that
point is because metals are

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.020
just very giving with
their electrons.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.380
And these guys react.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.780
They say, hey, take
my electrons.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.680
These guys say, take these
two electrons.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.680
And these guys, they start to
say, especially as you fill

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.260
the d subshell, I've got these
two electrons, and not only do

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.420
I have those two electrons,
but I have more electrons

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.520
where-- well almost where--
that came from.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.050
I have some in reserve
in my d.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.690
And what happens in these
transition metals, and it

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.470
especially happens in the
metals-- so these are the

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.110
metals right here, and these
don't follow just a group, but

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.960
this is the metals, this color
right here-- is that they have

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.940
so many electrons to hand off,
not only do they have these

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.370
extra there, but they filled
their d subshell, that they

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.660
can kind of, especially when
they're in elemental form, and

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.820
when I say elemental form, this
means that you just have

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.450
a big block of aluminum.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.700
Aluminum hasn't reacted with
anything like oxygen.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.500
It's just a bunch of aluminum.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.810
Right?

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.640
When you have a bunch of
aluminum, what happens is you

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.840
have these metallic bonds where
all of the aluminum

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.550
atoms say, you know what, I have
all these extra, I have

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.525
definitely, in the case of
aluminum, three electrons in

00:05:58.525 --> 00:05:59.470
my outermost shell.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.840
But I have all of these kind of
backfilled electrons in my

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.040
d suborbital.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.600
I'm just going to share them
with the other aluminum atoms.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.170
So you create this sea of
aluminum atoms. And they're

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.430
attracted to each other.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.750
Or you create this sea of
aluminum electrons.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:20.090
So you have a bunch of electrons
sitting in between

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.620
the atoms, and since the atoms
kind of donated these

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.270
electrons, they're attracted
to them.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.950
Right?

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.030
So the actual atoms-- so this
would be an aluminum plus, and

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.405
maybe we would have donated
three electrons.

00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:33.470
But I'm not being exact here.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.410
I want to just give you the
sense of how things work.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.320
And that's why metals conduct
really well, because

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.320
electricity is just a bunch of
electrons moving, and in order

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.460
to have electrons moving, you
have to have surplus electrons

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.330
lying around.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.480
So elements right around this
area are really good

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.980
conductors.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.650
In fact, silver is the
best conductor.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.240
Silver, right here, is the best
conductor on the planet.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.440
And the reason why that's not
used for our wiring and copper

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.300
is because copper is easier
to find than silver.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.140
But silver is the
best conductor.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.340
And the way I think about it
is that these-- once you've

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.010
filled an orbital, that orbital

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.890
becomes somewhat stable.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.140
So all of these guys have
filled their d orbital.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.960
While these guys, their d
orbital is not filled.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.910
So they just have a lot of
surplus electrons that are

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.970
really good for conduction.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.120
Now, that's just an intuition.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.000
I haven't done the experiment
to prove that.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.100
But it'll give you a
sense of why things

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.100
conduct and all of that.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.370
So these are the transition
metals.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.870
These are actually considered
the metals.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.940
But the reason why these are
considered the transition

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.960
metals is because they're
filling the d-block.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.600
But transition metals kind
of sound like not

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.390
as good as a metal.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.460
But when I think of metals,
iron is kind of the first

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.610
metal I always think of.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.020
I definitely think of silver and
copper and gold as metals.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.270
So to call them transition
metals is a little not fair.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.120
I don't really consider aluminum
more of a metal than,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.230
let's say, iron is.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.140
But in chemistry classification
world, aluminum

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.370
is more of a metal.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.880
These elements right here.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.700
And I know I dropped off come
from kind of the group notion.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.280
But let me just actually write
the valence electrons.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.220
So these all have three
valence electrons.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.720
Four, five, six, seven.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.680
So these all have three
electrons in

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.150
its outermost shell.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.420
It still seems easier for them
to give them away than to take

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.990
them, but maybe now, in certain
cases, there could be,

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.910
especially in the case of, let's
say, boron, there could

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.180
be a situation where it maybe
could gain five electrons,

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.820
although that seems hard.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.090
It's much easier to give away
three and that's why a lot of

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.470
the, quote-unquote,
official metals

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.340
show up in this category.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.230
And as you can see, as you go
down the periodic table you

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.480
can kind of have metals
that have more and

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.650
more valence electrons.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.730
So for, let's say, lead.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.120
It's still a metal,
even though it has

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.690
four valence electrons.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:09:00.490
And that's because the atom is
so big, its radius is so large

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.030
that the outermost shell is so
far away from the nucleus,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.150
that those electrons are
easier to take off.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.510
So for example, as you go down,
carbon, those electrons

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.470
are very close to the nucleus.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.820
So they're very hard
to take off.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.290
So carbon would probably more
likely gain electrons from

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.840
somebody else to get to eight.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.270
While these guys' valence
electrons are so far away from

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.070
the nucleus that they're more
likely to kind of want to get

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.440
rid of them to get to eight and
get back to an electron

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.960
configuration of, let's
say, xenon.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.260
And you go and then these
guys are the nonmetals.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:32.600
Right?

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.560
They're likely to probably gain

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.330
electrons in most reactions.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.820
And then this yellow category
that I said was highly

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.720
reactive, especially highly
reactive with the alkali

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.030
metals over here, these
are called halogens.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.620
And you've probably heard
the word before.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.870
Halogen lamps.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.930
That's no mistake there to
call them halogen lamps.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.070
That's not a random
choice of words.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.560
Maybe I'll do a video on halogen
lamps in the future.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.260
And then finally, we're
at the noble gases.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.760
What's interesting about
the noble gases?

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.000
Well they have eight
electrons in their

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.540
outermost shell, right?

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.220
Except for helium.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.850
Helium has two, right?

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:19.010
Helium's electron configuration
is 1s2.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.250
But all of these other guys,
this guy's electron

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.290
configuration is 1s2.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.040
This is neon.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.050
1s2, 2s2, 2p6.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.510
So he has eight electrons
in his outermost shell.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.370
So he's happy.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.960
Argon, same thing.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.010
The outermost shell will
look like 3s2, 3p6.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.050
Krypton will have in
its outermost shell

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.000
will be 3s2, 3p6.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.750
It will also have some 3d
electrons around as it

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.840
backfilled back here.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.070
But all of these have eight
in its outermost shell, so

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.000
they're happy.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.680
They have no incentive
to react.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.700
They're kind of like, hey, all
of you other elements, just,

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.720
you know, you guys can do all
that crazy reactions that

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.960
you've got to do,
but we're happy.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.850
And we don't want to give
or take electrons.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:06.130
And because of that these guys
are highly, highly unreactive.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.460
Very, very unreactive.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.550
And you know, back in the day,
when they used to make these

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:17.150
kind of zeppelins, these big
blimps-- the Hindenburg is a

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.290
famous example-- they
used hydrogen.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.380
And obviously hydrogen is a
pretty reactive substance.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.560
It's actually very combustible
and that's why it blows up

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.630
very fast. And that's why now,
clowns or children's balloon

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.930
manufacturers, they instead
would prefer to use helium.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.840
Because helium is a noble gas
and it's very unreactive.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.150
And it's very unlikely
to explode at a

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.790
child's birthday party.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.300
But anyway, I think I'm done
now with this video.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.780
And in the next video we'll talk
a little bit more about

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.820
trends across the
periodic table.
