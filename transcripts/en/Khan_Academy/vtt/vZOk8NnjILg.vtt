00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.440
Let's say we observe some object--

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.970
let's say for the sake of argument, it's happening in space

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.870
It's traveling in a circular path with

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.100
the magnitude of its velocity being constant

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.050
Let me draw its velocity vector

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.510
The length of this arrow is the magnitude of the velocity

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.700
I want to be clear. In order for it to be traveling in the circular path

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.220
the direction of its velocity needs to be changing

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.590
So this time the velocity vector might look like that

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.880
After a few seconds the velocity vector might look like this

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.210
After another few seconds the velocity vector might look like this

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.450
I'm just sampling. I actually could've sampled after a less time and it would be right over there

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.780
but I am just sampling sometimes as it travels around the circle

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.330
After a few more seconds the velocity vector might look something like that

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.120
I want to think about what needs to happen

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.310
what kind of force would have to act

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.850
in particular the direction of the force would have to act on this object

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.500
in order for the velocity vector to change like that?

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.510
This remind ourselves if there was no force acting on this body

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.680
this comes straight from Newton's 1st Law of motion

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.900
then the velocity would not change

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.450
neither the magnitude nor the direction of the velocity will change

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.640
If there were no force acting on the subject

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.940
it would just continue going on in the direction it was going

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.230
it wouldn't curve; it wouldn't turn; the direction of its velocity wasn't changing

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.620
Let's think about what the direction of that force would have to be

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.200
and to do that, I'm gonna copy and paste these velocity vectors and keep

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.860
track of what the direction of the change in velocity has to be

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.990
Copy and paste that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.210
So that is our first velocity vector

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.920
Copy all of these. This is our second one right over here

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.810
Copy and paste it

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.210
I'm just looking at it from the object's point of view

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.760
how does the velocity vector change from each of these points in time to the next?

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.860
Let me get all of these in there

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.430
This green one

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.910
That. Copy and paste it

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.890
That. I could keep going, keep drawing velocity vectors around the circle

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.530
but let me do this orange one right over here

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.050
Copy and paste

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:57.030
So between this magenta time and this purple time

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.160
what was the change in velocity?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.950
Well, we could look at that purely from these vectors right here

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.110
The change in velocity between those two times was that right over there

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.110
That is our change in velocity

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.900
So I take this vector and say in what direction was the velocity changing

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.440
when this vector was going on this part of the arc

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.640
It's roughly--if I just translate that vector right over here

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.850
it's roughly going in that direction

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.010
So that is the direction of our change in velocity

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.160
This triangle is delta; delta is for change

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.970
Now think about the next time period

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.020
between this blue or purple period and this green period

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.750
Our change in velocity would look like that

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.260
So while it's traveling along this part of the arc

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.180
roughly it's the change in velocity if we draw the vector starting at the object

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.710
It would look something like this

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.050
I'm just translating this vector right over here

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.310
I'll do it one more time

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.500
From this green point in time to this orange point in time

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.520
and obviously we're just sampling points continuously moving

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.980
and the change in velocity actually continues changing

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.770
but hopefully you're going to see the pattern here

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:21.340
So between those two points in time, this is our change in velocity

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.730
And let me translate that vector right over there

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.860
It would look something like that

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.590
change in velocity

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.330
So what do you see, if I were to keep drawing more of these change in velocity vectors

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
you would see at this point, the change in velocity would have to be going

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.590
generally in that direction

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.920
At this point, the change in velocity would have to be going generally in that direction

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.490
So what do you see? What's the pattern for any point along this circular curve?

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.970
Well, the change in velocity

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.340
first of all, is perpendicular to the direction of the velocity itself

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.040
And we haven't proved it, but it at least looks like it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.080
Looks like this is perpendicular

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.870
And even more interesting, it looks like it's seeking the center

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:10.410
The change in velocity is constantly going in the direction of the center of our circle

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.560
And we know from Newton's first law

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.620
that if--the magnitude could stay the same but the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.710
velocity change in any way, either the magnitude or the direction or both

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.430
there must be a net force acting on the object

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.790
And the net force is acting in the direction of the acceleration

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.770
which is causing the change in velocity

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.450
So the force must be acting in the same direction as this change in velocity

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.950
So in order make this object go in this circular

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.710
there must be some force kind of pulling the object towards the center

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.530
and a force that is perpendicular to its directional motion

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.300
And this force is called the centripetal force

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.850
Centripetal

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.490
Not to be confused with centrifugal force, very different

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.400
Centripetal force, centri- you might recognize as center

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:13.910
and then -petal is seeking the center. It is center seeking

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.650
So this centripetal force, something is pulling on this object towards the center that

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.340
causes it to go into this circular motion

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.350
Inward pulling causes inward acceleration

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.730
So that's centripetal force

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.190
causing centripetal acceleration

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.130
which causes the object to go towards the center

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.580
The whole point why I did this is that at least it wasn't intuitive to me

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.760
that if you have this object going in a circle

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.220
that the change in velocity, the acceleration, the force acting on this object

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.550
would actually have to be towards the center

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.780
The whole reason why I drew these vectors

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.220
and then translate them over here and drew these change in velocity vectors

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:04.830
is to show you that the change in velocity is actually towards the center of this circle

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.600
Now with that out of the way, you might say, well, where is this happening in in everyday life

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.240
or in reality in some way it perform

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.880
And the most typical example of this and this is something that I think most of us have done

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.900
when we were kid if you had a yoyo

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.550
My best attempt to draw a yoyo

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.680
If you have a yoyo and if you whip it around on a string

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:36.330
you know that the yoyo goes in a circle

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:42.080
Even though its speed might be constant, or the magnitude of its velocity might be constant

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.090
we know that the direction of its velocity is constantly changing

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.830
It's going in a circle and what's causing it to go in a circle is your hand right over here

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.200
pulling on this string and providing tension into the string

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.330
So there's a force, the centripetal force in this yoyo example is the tension in the string

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.180
that's constantly pulling on the yoyo towards the center

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.720
and that's why that yoyo goes in a circle

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:10.090
Another example that you are probably somewhat familiar with or at least have heard about

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.380
is if you have something in orbit around the planet

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.630
So let's say this is Earth right here

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:27.620
and you have some type of a satellite that is in orbit around Earth

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:33.140
That satellite has some velocity at any given moment in time

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.740
What's keeping it from not flying out into space and keeping it going in a circle

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.590
is the force of gravity

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.750
So in the example of a satellite or anything in the orbit

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.190
even the moon in orbit around the Earth

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.830
the thing that's keeping an orbit as opposed to flying out into space

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.430
is a centripetal force of Earth's gravity

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.010
Now another example, this is probably the most everyday example because we do it all the time

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.860
If you imagine a car traveling around the racetrack

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.860
Let's draw a racetrack. If I have a racetrack

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.250
Before I tell you the answer, I'll have you think about it

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.190
It's circular. Let's view the racetrack from above

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.470
If I have a car on a racetrack. I want you to pause it before I tell it to you

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.700
because I think it's an interesting thing think about

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.910
It seems like a very obvious thing that's happening

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.040
We've all experienced; we've all taken turns in cars

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.810
So we're looking at the top of a car. Tires

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.650
When you see a car going at a constant speed

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.560
so on the speedometer, it might say, 60 mph, 40 mph, whatever the constant speed

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.530
but it's traveling in a circle

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.840
so what is keeping--what is the centripetal force in that example?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.340
There's no obvious string being pulled on the car towards the center

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.660
There is no some magical gravity pulling it towards the center of the circle

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.170
There's obviously gravity pulling you down towards the ground

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.280
but nothing pulling it to the side like this

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:07.180
So what's causing this car to go in the circle as opposed to going straight?

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.390
And I encourage you to pause it right now before I tell you the answer

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.520
Assuming you now unpaused it and I will now tell you the answer

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.370
The thing that's keeping it going in the circle is actually the force of friction

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:26.750
It's actually the force between the resist movement to the side between the tires and the road

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.270
And a good example of that is if you would remove the friction

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.770
if you would make the car driving on oil or on ice

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.070
or if you would shave the treads of the tire or something

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.990
then the car would not be able to do this

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.240
So it's actually the force of friction in this example

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.560
I encourage you to think about that
