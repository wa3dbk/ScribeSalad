00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.630
Welcome back.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.860
And I've made this balance
sheet so messy I think it

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.950
would make sense to redraw it
cleaned up a little bit.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.540
So what's our new balance sheet,
after we've unloaded a

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.790
lot of those assets?

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.920
All I have now, I have a little
bit of cash, let me

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.490
write that down, I had
$1 billion of cash.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.520
I'll write the 'b' there
so you know.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.259
And just so you know, a bank
needs cash to operate.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.610
It can't just use all of its
cash to pay off things.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.320
Because then it won't be able
to even transact with its

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.500
customers, or pay its rent, or
send its executives on their

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.070
Learjets, whatever
it needs to do.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.490
But anyway, you have
$1 billion of cash.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.420
So you might have been thinking,
why not just use its

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.730
cash to unload some
of that debt?

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.770
Well, you always have to keep
some cash on line just to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.480
conduct business.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.190
And actually, that's called
working capital.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.860
But anyway, back to the
point of this video.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.650
So you have $1 billion
in cash.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.240
And at least the management of
this company thinks that it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.349
has $4 billion worth of
residential CDOs.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.710
And this is the toxic stuff
that's the focus of this

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.370
government bailout, which is
really historic in its

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.880
proportions.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.630
And I'll talk more
about that later.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:22.080
And on the liabilities
side, what was left?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.500
I think I had called
it Loan C.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.085
I'll write liabilities in red,
just because they're bad.

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.720
They're not bad, but they're
something you owe, so they're

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720
not as pleasant.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.950
So Loan C, we said
was $3 billion.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.490
And then what is the equity?

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.740
I'll do that in yellow.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.825
So the total assets were
$5 billion in assets.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.870
Total assets.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.800
You have $3 billion
in liabilities.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.860
So if you believe what the
accountants or the bank

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.610
management has said about their
assets, if you wanted to

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.900
just liquidate everything.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.440
If you had $5 billion in assets,
you liquidate them,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.880
got $5 billion, you paid off
your $3 billion in loans,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.330
you'd be left with $2 billion.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.580
So that's the equity.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.830
And just as a reminder, how
many shares where there?

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.760
I think I originally set in
the original video that we

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.840
have 500 million shares.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.670
So each of those shares is one
500 millionth of this equity.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:37.500
So let's see, the book value
per share is what?

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.770
It's going to be the book value,
$2 billion, divided by

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.740
500 million.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.990
So it's $4.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.870
Remember, it was $6
not too long ago.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.065
But we had to take those
commercial mortgages that we

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:52.560
thought were worth $10 billion,
actually ended up

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.050
being worth $9 billion.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.190
So we lost $1 billion
of our book value.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.640
And $1 billion translates to
$2 of the share price.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.320
Anyway, fair enough.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:11.480
And maybe at this point the
market value of the share, so

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.300
that's essentially the stock
price if you were to look up

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.600
this company's ticker price,
let's say it's at $1.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.930
Because they're like, boy, after
all this Bear Stearns

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.920
and Lehman Brothers, this
is all getting a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.390
little nerve racking.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.970
And they have this shady
thing over here.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.170
So we have to be careful.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.840
So if the market value
is $1, what are they

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.170
saying about the assets?

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.650
Or what are they saying
about the equity?

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.270
Well, what's the market cap?

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.990
It's the share price times
the number of shares.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.870
So they're saying essentially
that the market cap, and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.560
that's equivalent to the market
value of the equity, or

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.390
what the market thinks the
equity is worth, that's $1

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.760
times 500 million shares.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.530
So it's worth $500 million.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.980
Or $0.5 billion.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.240
So the market is actually
saying, no, you don't have $2

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.840
billion of equity, you only have
half a billion of equity.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.290
And it's probably because they
think this is worth a billion

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.140
and a half left.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.600
But anyway, we'll leave
that aside for now.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.940
But now we're getting to
the crux of the issue.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.980
Two of those other loans, they
came due, no-one was willing

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.840
to renew the loans, or
give them new loans.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.279
So the company had to liquidate
some of their assets

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.050
in order to pay those
loans down.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.040
Now, this is the endgame.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.220
We have Loan C.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.640
And let's say Loan
C comes due.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.890
So they say, things are really
shady, your assets they look

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.030
very similar to Lehman Brothers
and Bear Stearns,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.480
we're not going to
renew your loan.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.510
You go out to the credit
markets, you try to issue

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.980
bonds, you try to do
anything you can.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.290
No-one's willing to give you a
loan, just because they're all

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.230
a little bit scared.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.340
So what do you do?

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.170
Well, you have to pay
$3 billion of loans.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.130
You just have to.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.480
Because no-one's willing
to give you $3 billion.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.180
Well you say, out of this cash
I can't use all of it.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.560
If I just wanted to operate
bare-bones, maybe I could give

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.030
$0.5 billion in cash.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.460
But that's not going to help
my situation at all.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.190
Because I still would have
$2.5 billion left.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.950
So you're like, wow I'm in a
situation where I have to sell

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.680
these CDOs.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.070
So now, all my models and all
my assumptions are going to

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.880
see if they were even
vaguely accurate.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.760
If these things are really
worth $4 billion.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.220
So I go out there and I
try to sell my CDOs.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.190
I try to sell them for whatever
I can get for them,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.390
because I have to sell them.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.610
And one, there's no
market for them.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.540
Because there's a lot of people
who want to unload

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.020
them, but there's not
really anybody who's

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.770
keen on buying it.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.510
So there there might not
even be any market.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.840
But you're like, no I
want to sell them.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.400
So you broadcast it out to every
hedge fund and private

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.090
equity fund and every
bank out there.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.270
And you say, who wants
to buy my CDOs?

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.760
And some private equity firm
comes and says, OK well, I

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.570
think that those things are
pretty toxic, but they're

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.710
probably worth maybe
something.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.600
I'm pretty optimistic about
the real estate market.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.560
And maybe in 10 years they
might come back.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.930
So I'm willing to give you $1
billion for those CDOs.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.220
So essentially, what's the
market price of something?

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.260
It's the best price that
someone's willing to give you

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.650
for something.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.560
So the market price of this,
because you've shopped it

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.400
around, you've gone to the
market, you've gone to

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.450
everyone you can, the market
price for this is,

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.130
essentially, the market
is offering you $1

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.760
billion for this CDO.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.000
So what do you do?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.060
Well, if you sell it for
$1 billion, does

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.380
that help your situation?

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.020
If you sell this for $1 billion,
you get $1 billion

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.680
here, you have $1 billion of
cash, you have a total of $2

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.920
billion, that still won't
pay your loan.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.420
You're still going
to be bankrupt.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.780
And even more, the company
management is very stubborn.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.000
They say, if I sell it I'm
going to go bankrupt.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.890
And I think that that's some
kind of fire sale price,

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.420
quote-unquote.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.040
That's not the real price.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.230
All of a sudden for the first
time in my career when I was

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.700
getting $30 million a year
bonuses, I heavily believed in

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.380
the market.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.240
But now I'm in denial
of the market.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.720
I say, the only reason why I'm
only getting $1 billion for

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.770
this is because everyone
is afraid.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.580
And these things, if someone
were to just hold them to

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.380
maturity, if someone were to
just hold these assets for the

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.520
30 years over which the
underlying mortgages will just

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.390
pay out, someone's going to
collect roughly $4 billion.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.800
Or maybe at worst,
$3.5 billion.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.270
So I'm not going to do this.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.190
But really, you have
no choice.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.830
So what you try to do is you
say, well can someone give me

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.520
some type of a loan?

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.590
Just lend me some money in the
short term just so that I

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.970
could get this paid off.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.030
And I'll be willing to give
this as collateral.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.500
Collateral on a loan is you give
me a loan, and you take

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.900
this as collateral, and if I
don't pay the loan, you just

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.110
keep the asset.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.130
And that's essentially what
the Fed was doing.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.310
The Fed traditionally only
gives loans if you give

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.940
something really nice as a
collateral, like treasuries,

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.320
essentially just treasuries.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.320
And they'll still take a
little discount of your

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:01.700
collateral.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.960
Like if you give the Federal
Reserve $1 of treasuries, they

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.550
might give you $0.80 of loans.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.750
But over this whole credit
crunch, the Fed has gotten

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.200
looser and looser in terms of
what it's willing to accept as

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.090
collateral.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.680
So actually, the Fed, I don't
know the details of how toxic

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.640
of an asset they were willing
to take as collateral, but

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.210
they started loosening it up
to pretty toxic assets.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.600
So maybe you could get a loan.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.750
But let's just put that
aside right now.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.660
But this is the situation
we're facing.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.690
You have a bank, and it's
essentially being forced, or

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.049
it perceives it, forced
into bankruptcy.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:40.260
Even though, it thinks that
it has positive equity.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.059
So you could get a loan from
the Fed or someone else if

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.540
they're willing to take this
kind of toxic stuff as

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:45.970
collateral.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.870
Let's assume that they're
not for now.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.920
The other option is you
can recapitalize.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.950
You can get someone to
invest in the firm.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.460
You can sell equity in the firm
and get some more cash to

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.340
pay off this loan.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.600
If you can convince someone that
no, your firm is really

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.630
in the future going to
be worth a lot more.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.500
This is just a stressful
situation.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.870
So you go to some sovereign
wealth fund, and that's just a

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.640
way of saying some foreign
government that's been

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.090
collecting dollars because
they've been selling us oil or

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.170
cheap manufactured goods.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:20.110
So you go those and say, look,
we are Goldman Brothers or

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.120
we're Lehman Sachs.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.020
We are this great brand in the
banking industry, wouldn't you

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.270
like to have a piece of this
thing that represents American

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.300
capitalism?

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.350
And they say sure, we'll be
interested in investing.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:39.830
So they say, well the market
price is $1 and I think that's

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.950
probably a little distressed,
so we'll be willing to pay

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.520
$1.50 per share.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.740
And we'll buy, how
much do you need?

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.540
We'll buy 2 billion shares
at $1.50 per share.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.260
So what happens?

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.480
So let's say the sovereign
wealth fund, they're going to

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:09.020
buy 2 billion shares
at $1.50 per share.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.340
So now what does the balance
sheet look like?

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:19.150
So 2 billion, $1.50 per share,
that is equal to $3 billion.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.090
So now you get $3 billion
more in cash, so

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.700
this becomes $4 billion.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.270
But you can't get something for
free, so what happened?

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.590
Are our liabilities
increasing?

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.200
Well no, our liabilities
didn't increase.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.890
They didn't give us a loan.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.755
They invested in us.

00:10:34.755 --> 00:10:37.870
They essentially bought
shares of the company.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.950
They bought 2 billion shares.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.890
So how does that get
accounted for?

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.630
Well instead of our share
account being 500 million

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.680
shares, this is how many shares
we had before, the

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.240
company essentially created
2 billion new shares.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.375
So now the company has
2.5 billion shares.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.520
And it's something
interesting here.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.130
What is the new book value
of the shares?

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.940
So what are our total assets?
$4 billion plus $4 billion,

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.970
it's $8 billion of assets.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.150
Our liabilities are
still $3 billion.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.620
Now the the value of our share
after the investment, and you

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:20.370
can kind of call this the post
money valuation or book value,

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.960
is $5 billion.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.510
$8 billion minus $3 billion.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.360
And now what's the book
value of our shares?

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:34.920
$5 billion divided by $2.5
billion, it's $2 per share.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.290
And that's interesting.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.220
It's someplace in between our
old book value and the price

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.920
that the company paid, or the
sovereign wealth fund paid,

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.310
$1.50 per share.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.380
But anyway, I just realized I'm
out of time again, I'll

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.650
continue this in
the next video.
