00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.270
In the last video we had a
three-dimensional surface,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.170
where the height z was
a function of x and y.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.760
And it gave us surface in
three-dimensional space.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.700
Now let's try to get our heads
around what the gradient

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.340
of a function of three
variables looks like.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.920
So the easiest one for me to
imagine is a scalar field.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.440
So what's a scalar field?

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.920
One that I find fairly
intuitive is temperature in

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.140
a three-dimensional room.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.140
So let's say the temperature
in a room is a function of

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.700
where I am in the room.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.670
So let's say it's a function of
my x, y, and z coordinates.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.340
And I don't know, I have never
actually modeled temperature.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.330
But let's say I have, I don't
know, a 20 kelvin-- actually,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.290
let me make it so that our
vector field works out right.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.460
Let's say we have a 10
kelvin heat force in

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.950
the center of our room.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.650
I can imagine as you go further
and further away from that

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.600
heat source it's going to
get colder and colder.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.940
So let's say that the
temperature function.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.810
And let's say that center of
the room is at the coordinates

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.240
x, y, and z is equal to 0.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.170
So let's say our temperature
function-- I'm just making this

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:23.880
up, I don't know if this is an
accurate model of temperature--

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.700
it's equal to 10 times e
to the minus r squared.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.940
Now why did I say r?

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.260
I said it's a function
of x, y, and z.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.350
Well I'm just saying that it
exponentially decays as you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.560
get further and further
away from that source.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.200
Kind of radially further and
further away from that source.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.440
So what's the radial
distance away?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.310
And this actually isn't that
relevant to learning gradients,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.320
but let's get a little
intuition about what that

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.230
actual temperature function--
how it actually changes as

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.210
you go through the room.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.030
So the radius away from the
center, that's just going to be

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.030
r squared is just x squared
plus y squared plus z squared.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.070
That's just the Pythagorean
theorem in three dimensions.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.550
So let's write our
temperature function.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.840
So let's write temperature as
a function of x, y, and z is

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:29.990
equal to 10 e to the minus x
squared plus y squared plus z

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.370
squared-- which is exactly
what I wrote up here.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.790
Instead of x squared plus y
squared plus z squared, I wrote

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.130
r squared, just to kind of give
you the intuition that this

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.220
expression is just saying the
square of the distance as we

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.010
get away from the center of
our room, or from the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.990
coordinate 0, 0, 0.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.310
But that's not what
we're learning here.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.880
But I want you to understand,
at least conceptualize this,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.350
it's hard to draw
a scalar field.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.460
All a scalar field means is
that in any point in this

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.970
base-- and in this case we're
dealing with three-dimensional

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.040
space-- at any point in that
space we can associate a value.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.840
And that makes sense.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.400
If you were to take a
thermometer and measure any

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.180
point in space in the room
that you're in right now,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.540
you would get a temperature.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.590
You wouldn't get a temperature
and a direction, so it's

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.250
not a vector field.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.530
You would just get
a temperature.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.510
And that's why it's
called a scalar field.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.090
Associated with every
coordinate is just

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.610
a temperature.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.890
So how would we view the
gradient of this function?

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.720
Well the gradient of this
function is going to tell us in

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.290
which direction-- and actually,
the gradient of this function

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.210
is going to generate a vector
field, because it's going to

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.990
tell us in which direction
do we have the largest

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.580
increase in temperature.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.660
And also, the magnitude of
those vectors in that vector

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.230
field will tell us how large
of an increase in temperature

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.320
we are looking at.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.910
Or you can kind of
view it as almost a

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.220
three-dimensional slope.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.190
Hope that doesn't confuse you.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.260
So let's compute the gradient,
and then I'll show you a

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.630
diagram that might make things
a little bit more intuitive.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.210
Let me erase this
thing down here.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.480
And I'm going to switch from
this blue color, because

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.590
it's a little nauseating.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.540
So the gradient of T is going
to be equal to the partial

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.490
derivative T with respect to x
times the unit vector in the x

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.550
direction, plus the partial
derivative of the temperature

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.940
function with respect to y
times the unit vector in the y

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.740
direction, plus the partial
derivative of the temperature

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.830
function with respect to z
times the unit vector

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.080
in the z direction.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.180
And now we just plug and
chug and figure out the

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.130
partial derivatives.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.470
So the gradient of T is equal
to-- now you might be daunted.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.250
Oh, I have an e to this three
variable function, how do I

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.050
take the partial derivative?

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.500
Remember, if you're taking the
partial derivative with respect

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.140
to x you just pretend like the
y's and the z's are constants.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.360
So let's do that.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.500
So let's take the derivative
of the inside function.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.090
That's the way I view it.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.870
So minus x squared plus y
squared plus z squared,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.440
with respect to x.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.810
So you could distribute
this minus if you like.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.980
So it'd be minus x
squared minus y squared

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.850
minus z squared.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.890
So the derivative of that with
respect to x is just going to

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.715
be-- these are just constants,
so the derivative with

00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:38.180
respect to x is just 0.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.590
So the derivative is minus 2x.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.860
Right?

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.670
Minus 2x is the derivative
of minus x squared.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.330
Minus 2x times the
derivative of the outside.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.510
Well, what's the
derivative of e to the x?

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.100
The derivative of e to
the x is e to the x.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.990
That's why e is such
an amazing number.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.810
And this 10 here, this is just
a constant that when you take

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.320
the derivative of a constant
times something the

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.700
constant carries over.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.370
So the derivative of the
outside expression, the way I

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.810
imagine it, is equal to 10 e
to the minus x squared plus

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.860
y squared plus z squared.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.280
And then all of that times the
unit vector in the i direction.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.600
Right?

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.040
And now we can do the same
thing for the y direction.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.790
So plus-- what's the
partial derivative of

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.760
this with respect to y?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.820
Well it's going to
look very similar.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.803
The partial derivative of this
inner function with respect

00:06:39.803 --> 00:06:42.500
to y, it's minus y squared.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.250
So it's minus 2y.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.320
And then the derivative
of the whole thing is

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.680
just itself again.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.680
So times 10 e to the
minus x squared plus y

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.180
squared plus z squared.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.660
And then all of that times
the unit vector in the

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.920
y direction times j.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.370
And then finally, the partial
derivative of the temperature

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.140
function with respect to z.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:23.350
And that's just minus 2z times
10 e to the minus x squared

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.500
plus y squared plus z squared.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.620
This is just the chain rule.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.690
And I'm treating the other two
variables that I'm not taking

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.870
the partial derivative with
respect to, as constants.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.430
And then all of that times the
unit vector in the k direction.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.800
And we could simplify
this a little bit.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.040
You could have
minus 2x times 10.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.910
That's minus 20x.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.750
Let me write it up here.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.740
So the gradient of the
temperature function is equal

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:58.120
to minus 20 e to the minus x
squared plus y squared-- you

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:07.970
probably can't read this-- plus
z squared, times i minus 20y.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.860
And actually, I'm not going to
go into that, because I realize

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.820
I'm running out of time.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.880
I think you can simplify
this algebraically.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.370
But anyway, the more important
thing is I always find with

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.980
gradients it's easy to
calculate them, but the

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.800
intuition-- oh sorry.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.680
This is also included.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.180
This is a k right here.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.520
The harder part is
the intuition.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.920
So let's get an intuition of
what this gradient function

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.130
will actually look like.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:29.880
So what would happen.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.220
If you wanted to know the
gradient at any point in space,

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.170
you would substitute an
x, y, and z in here.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:40.560
So you could write it as
the gradient function is a

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.160
function of x, y, and z.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.170
Remember, T, the temperature at
any point, was a scalar field.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.820
At any point in three
dimensions it just

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.890
gave you a number.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.040
Now when you have the gradient,
at any point in three

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.100
dimensions it gives
you a vector.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:55.380
Right?

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.950
Because it has i, j,
and k components.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.330
Where the magnitude are the
partial derivatives, and

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.850
then the direction is
given by i, j, and k.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.990
So we've gone from having a
scalar field to a vector field.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.070
And let's see what
it looks like.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.120
And let me make it bigger so we
can explore it a little bit.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.480
I think that's pretty good.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.600
So this is the vector field.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.220
This is actually the gradient
of the function that

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.220
we just solved for.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.170
And as you can see, at any
point-- and when this graphing

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.780
program that did it, it just
picked different points and it

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.620
calculated the gradients at
that point, and then it

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.230
graphed them as vectors.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.550
So the length of the vectors
are just the magnitudes of

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.170
the x, y, and z components.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.260
And then you add them together
like you would add any vectors.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.880
And then the direction is given
by the relative weighting of

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.880
the i, j, and k components.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.440
And as you can see, the
intuition is pretty

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.950
interesting.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.850
As you get closer and closer to
our heat source, the rate at

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.440
which the temperature
increases, increases!

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:07.720
Right?

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.680
The vectors as you get closer,
get bigger and bigger.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.390
And let me zoom in.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.875
Let's actually fly in
to the vector field.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.620
So we're now within
the vector field.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.840
And you can see as we get
closer and closer to the center

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.980
of our heat source, the
vectors, the rate at which the

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.860
temperature increases, gets
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.450
Anyway, I hope I
didn't confuse you.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.950
When I first learned gradients,
I think the computation is

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:37.840
relatively straightforward.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.130
It's just partial derivatives.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.660
But the intuition is always
the interesting thing.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.440
And hopefully this temperature
analogy-- and not even

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.515
analogy-- this temperature
model will make a

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:49.020
little sense to you.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.360
But it applies to pretty
much any scalar field.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.100
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
