00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.230
The mean emission of all engines
of a new design needs

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.570
to be below 20 parts per million
if the design is to

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.280
meet new emission
requirements.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.020
10 engines are manufactured for
testing purposes, and the

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.910
emission level of each
is determined.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.410
The emission data is, and they
give us 10 data points for the

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.450
10 test engines, and I went
ahead and calculated the mean

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.410
of these data points.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.940
The sample mean of 17.17.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.740
And the standard deviation of
these 10 data points right

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.480
here is 2.98, the sample
standard deviation.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.420
Does the data supply sufficient
evidence to

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.520
conclude that this type of
engine meets the new standard?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.700
Assume we are willing to risk
a type-1 error with a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.760
probability of 0.01.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.570
And we'll touch on
this in a second.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.920
Before we do that, let's just
define what our null

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.440
hypothesis and our alternative
hypothesis are going to be.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.780
Our null hypothesis
can be that we

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.690
don't meet the standards.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.500
That we just barely don't
meet the standards.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.420
That the mean of our new engines
is exactly 20 parts

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.140
per million.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.740
And you essentially want the
best possible value where we

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.239
still don't meet, or the lowest
possible value, where

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.380
we still don't meet
the standard.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.160
And then our alternative
hypothesis says no, we do meet

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.710
the standard.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.230
That the true mean for our
new engines is below

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.270
20 parts per million.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.910
And to see if the data that we
have is sufficient, what we're

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.400
going to do is assume,
we're going to assume

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.650
that this is true.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.440
And given that this is true, if
we assume this is true, and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.660
the probability of this
occurring, and the probability

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.750
of getting a sample mean of that
is less than 1%, then we

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.810
will reject the null
hypothesis.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.170
So we are going to reject our
null hypothesis if the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.870
probability of getting a sample
mean of 17.17 given the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.340
null hypothesis is true,
is less than 1%.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.130
And notice, if we do it this way
there will be less than a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.680
1% chance that we are making
a type-1 error.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.400
A type-1 error is that
we're rejecting it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.390
even though it's true.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.550
Here there's only a 1% chance,
or less than a 1% chance that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.040
we will reject it
if it is true.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.870
Now the next thing we have to
think about is what type of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.760
distribution we should
think about.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.420
And I guess the first thing that
rings in my brain is we

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.040
only have 10 samples here.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.630
We only have 10 samples.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.320
We have a small sample
size right over here.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.760
So we're going to be dealing
with a T-distribution and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.680
T-statistic.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.860
So with that said, so let's
think of it this way.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.240
We can come up with a
T-statistic that is based on

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.680
these statistics right
over here.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.660
So the T-statistic is going to
be 17.17, our sample mean,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.920
minus the assumed population
mean-- minus 20 parts per

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:10.880
million over our sample standard
deviation, 2.98--

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.890
this is really the definition
of the T-statistic.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.310
And hopefully we see now that
this really comes from a

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.360
Z-score and the T-distribution
is kind of an engineered

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.340
version of the normal
distribution using

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.610
T-statistics.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.700
2.98 divided by the square
root of our sample size.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.940
We have 10 samples, so
it's divided by the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.630
square root of 10.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.550
So this value right here-- let
me get the calculator out just

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.110
to get a value in place there.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:46.800
So this is going to be 17.17
minus 20, close parentheses,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:55.120
divided by 2.98 divided
by the square root--

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.320
that's not what I wanted.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.120
Let me delete that.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.820
Let me go back.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.560
Divided by the square root
of 10, and then close

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.810
parentheses.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.970
It is almost exactly
negative 3.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.620
Our T-statistic is
almost exactly

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.360
negative 3, negative 3.00.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.769
And what we need to figure out,
because T-statistics have

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.640
a T-distribution, so what we
need to figure out is the

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.260
probability of getting this
T-statistic or a value of T

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.570
equal to this or less than this,
is that less than 1%?

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.440
So the way we can think
about it is we have a

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.690
T-distribution.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.320
And let's say we have a
normalized T-distribution.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.550
The distribution of all the
T-statistics would be a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.570
normalized T-distribution.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.800
This is the mean of the
T-distribution.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.510
There's going to be some
threshold T-value right here.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.970
So this is our threshold
T-value.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.290
My writing isn't that
easy to view.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.680
This is some threshold T-value
right over here.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.520
And we want a threshold T-value
such that any T-value

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.070
less than that, or the
probability of getting a

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.850
T-value less than that is 1%.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.110
So that entire area
in yellow is 1%.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.250
And we need to figure out a
threshold T-value there.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.620
And this is for a T-distribution
that has n

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.300
equal to 10 or 10 minus 1 equals
9 degrees of freedom.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.380
So what is that threshold
value over there?

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.360
And notice that this is a
one-sided distribution.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.020
We care about this is 1% and
then all of this stuff over

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.450
here is going to be 99%.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.550
And just the way most T-tables
are set up, they don't set up

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.620
a negative T-value that is
oriented like this, they'll

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.220
just give you a positive
T-value that's

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.800
oriented the other way.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.710
So the way T-tables-- and I have
one that we're going to

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.840
use in a second right over
here-- the way T-tables are

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.370
set up is you have your
distribution like this, and

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:22.110
they will just give a positive
T-value over here, some

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.610
threshold value.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.000
Where the probability of getting
a T-value above that

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.770
is going to be 1%, and the
probability of getting a

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:37.280
t-value below that is
going to be 99%.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.700
And you can see that-- well,
we know T-distributions are

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.530
symmetric around their mean, so
whatever value this is, if

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.550
this number is 2 then this
value's just going to be

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.400
negative 2.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.730
So we just have to keep
that in mind.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.940
But the T-tables actually help
us figure out this value.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.730
So let's figure out a T-value
where the probability of

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.420
getting a T-value below
that is 99%.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:09.540
And once again, this is going
to be a one-sided situation.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.680
So let's look at
that over here.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.760
So one-sided-- this is just
straight from Wikipedia--

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.200
one-sided, we want the
cumulative distribution below

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.770
that T-value to be 99%.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.940
We have it right
over here, 99%.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.550
We have 9 degrees of freedom.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.440
We have 10 data points,
10 minus 1 is 9.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.630
9 degrees of freedom.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:33.620
So our threshold T-value here
is 2.821, so our threshold

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.250
T-value in the case that we care
about is just flip this

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.010
over, it's completely symmetric
is negative 2.821.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.950
So what this tells us is the
probability of getting a

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:53.970
T-value less than the negative
2.821 is going to be 1%.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.310
Now we got a value that's
a good bit less that we.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.540
Got a T-value of negative 3.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.410
We got a T-value right here, our
T-statistic of negative 3

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.480
right over here.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.820
So that definitely goes into
our-- I guess you could call

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.290
it our area of rejection.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.340
This is even less probable
than the 1%.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.720
We could even figure it out that
the area over here, the

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.680
probability of getting a
T-statistic less than negative

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.260
3 is even less than, it's a
subset of this yellow area

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.370
right over here.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:36.070
So because the probability of
getting the T-statistic that

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:43.890
we actually got is less than 1%,
we can safely reject the

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:51.250
null hypothesis and feel
pretty good about our

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.570
alternate hypothesis right over
here, that we do meet the

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.550
emission standards.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.550
And we know that we have a
lower than 1% chance of

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.210
actually making a type-1 error
in this circumstance.
