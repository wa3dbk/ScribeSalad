00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.460
Welcome back.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.040
We are on problem number 10.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.420
I'm trying to do as many
problems as possible, because

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.935
today is Thanksgiving.

00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:12.750
And I want to build up an
appetite to really take down

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.650
that turkey.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.130
Anyway, they say, what is the
coordinate of the point on a

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.140
number line that is exactly
halfway between the points

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.800
with coordinates 53 and 62?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.840
So the point that's halfway
between those two is just

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.980
going to be the average
of these two points.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.840
So what's the average?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.910
It's 53 plus 62 over 2.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.590
And that's what?

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.460
5 plus 6 is 111,
so it's 115/2.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.240
That equals 57.5.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.080
So that's the answer.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.980
And this is one of those ones
we have to fill it in.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.350
57.5 is half way between
the two.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.900
And at first, I was
little taken aback

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.270
because of the decimal.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.700
I was thinking maybe is an
integer number line.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.450
But they don't say that.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.580
So on a regular number line,
you can have decimals.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.220
So this is the point
that is exactly

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.270
halfway between the two.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.180
This is the coordinate
of the point.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.780
Number 11.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.100
A certain triangle has
two angles that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.750
have the same measure.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.730
If the lengths of the two sides
of the triangle are 50

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.610
and 30, what is the least
possible value for the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.160
perimeter of the triangle?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.555
All right, so we've
got a triangle.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.740
And we know that two
of these sides are

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.570
the same angle, right?

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.270
And we know, from geometry, if
the two base angles are the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.190
same, then that means that these
two sides are going to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.670
be the same.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.870
And they tell us that two of
the sides are 50 and 30.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.610
So either this could be 50
and this could be 30.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.240
Or this could be 30 and
this could be 50.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.990
Because this can't
be 50 and 30.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.470
These have to be
the same thing.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.080
So we want to know the
least possible

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.590
value of the perimeter.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.080
So if we want the smallest
possible value for the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.385
perimeter, we want
more 30 sides and

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:09.440
less 50 sides, right?

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.810
So why don't we make
this side 30?

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.970
Because then, this side
will be 30, and this

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.600
side will be 50.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600
And the other option would
have been to do this.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.190
50, 50, and 30.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.010
But clearly, this would have
had a larger perimeter,

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.300
because we would have
used 50 twice

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.790
instead of using 30 twice.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.170
So this has a smaller
perimeter.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.860
And what is the perimeter?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.650
It's 60 plus 50.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.230
It's 110.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.920
That is the smallest perimeter
we could have.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.170
Next problem.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.310
Problem number 12.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.695
I don't want to use
the whiteboard.

00:02:44.695 --> 00:02:46.460
There's something psychological
about a

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.020
blackboard, I think.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.430
It makes it more engaging.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:59.380
All right, if x squared minus y
squared is equal to 77, and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.550
x plus y is equal to 11,
what is the value of x?

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.490
So this is something that some
people-- oh my God, I've got a

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.600
system soon. of equations.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.650
Or I've got a quadratic.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.110
What is it?

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.290
All you have to do
is factor this.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.850
What is x squared
minus y squared?

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.410
Well, a squared minus b
squared is, a plus b

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.410
times a minus b.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.280
Or, in this case, x squared
minus y squared, that's just x

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.880
plus y times x minus
y is equal to 77.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.960
And the biggest clue on why you
can do that immediately,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.770
is that they told you what
x plus y is, right?

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.680
So we know that x
plus y is 11.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.310
So 11 times x minus
y is equal to 77.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.776
So now we know, divide
both sides by 11.

00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:47.415
x minus why is equal
to 7, right?

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.490
Now, we have a very

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.040
straightforward system of equations.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.610
And we want to solve
for x, right?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.860
So we can let the
y's cancel out.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.370
Let's take that top one down
here and just rewrite it.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.250
x plus y is equal to 11.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.290
Add the two equations.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.690
x plus x is 2x.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.500
Minus y plus y is 0.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.330
y is equal to 18, right?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.360
7 plus 11 is 18.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.640
2x is equal to 18.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.120
x is equal to 9 Done.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.370
Next problem.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.595
OK, we are on problem
number 13.

00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:34.500
Tamara cut a circular pizza into
wedge shaped pieces, one

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.030
of which is shown above.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.010
The tip of each piece is at
the center of the pizza.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.820
And the angle of the tip is
always greater than 20

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.870
degrees, but less
than 30 degrees.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.980
OK, what is one possible value
for the number of pieces into

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.120
which the pizza is cut?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.210
OK, so this is interesting.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.270
So we have a pizza pie, although
it could just be a

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.730
regular pie.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.300
And each of her slices
goes to the center.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.300
And this angle right here--
so let's call it theta.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:27.486
It's going to be-- it's greater
than 20 degrees.

00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:31.800
And it's less than 30
degrees, right?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.760
Well, let me ask a question.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.520
If theta was 20 degrees,
how many slices

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.950
could she have cut?

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.710
Well, there's 360 degrees
in a circle, right?

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.260
So if every slice is 20
degrees-- Well, 20 goes into

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.930
360 how many times?

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.550
20 goes into 360,
18 times, right?

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.390
2 into 36 goes 18 times.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.740
So if every slice is 20 degrees,
it'd be 18 slices.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.490
Similarly, if every slice was
30 degrees-- 30 degrees goes

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.100
into 360, how many times?

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.560
Well, it goes into it 12 times.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.566
12 slices.

00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:13.060
you

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.760
So we know that the slices
are larger than 20 and

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.090
less than 30, right?

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.080
So the slices are going
to be greater than 12

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.680
and less than 18.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.860
And so you, literally,
can pick any number.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:37.690
The answer could be 13, 14,
15, 16, or 17 slices.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.520
Any of those numbers would be
a suitably correct answer.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.120
That sometimes confuses
people, but

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.990
you should be confident.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.330
Any of these numbers that
you put down will work.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.140
Maybe you want to put the
middle one just to be

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.570
comfortable.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.590
I think that would be
a 25 degree slice.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.840
Next problem.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.670
14.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:09.962
We have this sequence a,
3a, dot, dot, dot.

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.212
[SNEEZES]

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.832
The first term in the
sequence above is a.

00:07:17.832 --> 00:07:20.840
I just went for a hike at a
place called Windy Hill, and

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.980
it was freezing.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.560
The first term in the sequence
above is a, and each term

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.130
after the first is 3 times
the preceding term.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.370
If the sum of the first five
terms, is 605, what is the

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.180
value of a?

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.330
So the first five terms-- well,
that's just going to be

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:45.965
a, 3a, and then the next
one's going to be 9a.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.336
The next one is going
to be 27a.

00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:50.100
The next one is going
to be 81a, right?

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.920
That's the first five terms.
So you add them all up.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.430
3 plus 9 is 12.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.800
This is where I always
mess up.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.390
3 plus 9 is 12.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.530
12 plus 27 is 39.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:12.960
39 plus 81-- 9 plus 1 is 10.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.150
And then 1 plus 3 is 120.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.830
So that equals 120a.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.690
So these are the first
five terms, right?

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.530
Each one is 3 times
the preceding one.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:28.850
And the sum of these
is equal to 605.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.330
What is the value of a?

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.650
a is equal to 605/120.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.289
And let's see, can
we simplify this?

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:47.300
Sure, if we divide the top and
the bottom by five, how many

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.610
times does 5 goes into 120?

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.950
It goes into it 24 times.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.440
Are these divisible by 3?

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.160
No.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.170
I think that's in simplest
terms, because you can't

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.960
divide by 2.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.500
Can't divide by 3.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:08.460
121 times 5 is 605.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.940
So I think that is the simplest
form that you can do

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.130
this problem.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.100
I'm running out of time.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.350
So I will wait to
do next the next

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.400
problem in the next video.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.650
