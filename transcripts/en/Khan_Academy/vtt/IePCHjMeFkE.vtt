00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
 

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.110
In the last video we tried to
figure out the slope of a

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.570
point or the slope of a
curve at a certain point.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.310
And the way we did, we said OK,
well let's find the slope

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.970
between that point and then
another point that's not too

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.220
far away from that point.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.630
And we got the slope
of the secant

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.920
line.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.530
And it looks all fancy, but
this is just the y value of the

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.570
point that's not too far away,
and this is just the y value

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.700
point of the point in
question, so this is

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.100
just your change in y.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.020
And then you divide that
by your change in x.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.580
So in the example we did,
h was the difference

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.610
between our 2 x values.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.420
This distance was h.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.210
And that gave us the
slope of that line.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.940
We said hey, what if we take
the limit as this point

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.510
right here gets closer
and closer to this point.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.420
If this point essentially
almost becomes this point, then

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.230
our slope is going to be the
slope of our tangent line.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.620
And we define that as the
derivative of our function.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.280
We said that's equal
to f prime of x.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.520
So let's if we can apply this
in this video to maybe make

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.750
things a little bit more
concrete in your head.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.910
So let me do one.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.140
First I'll do a particular
case where I want to find the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.980
slope at exactly some point.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.670
So let me draw my axes again.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.520
Let's draw some
axes right there.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.400
Let's say I have the curve--
this is the curve-- y

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.110
is equal to x squared.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.790
So this is my y-axis, this is
my x-axis, and I want to know

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.270
the slope at the point
x is equal to 3.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.660
When I say the slope you can
imagine a tangent line here.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.760
You can imagine a tangent line
that goes just like that, and

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.710
it would just barely graze
the curve at that point.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.260
But what is the slope
of that tangent line?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.570
What is the slope of that
tangent line which is the same

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.360
as the slope of the curve
right at that point.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.770
So to do it, I'm actually going
to do this exact technique that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.270
we did before, then we'll
generalize it so you don't have

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.910
to do it every time for
a particular number.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.805
So let's take some
other point here.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:09.610
 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.110
Let's call this 3 plus delta x.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.380
I'm changing the notation
because in some books you'll

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.530
see an h, some books you'll see
a delta x, doesn't hurt to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.660
be exposed to both of them.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.500
So this is 3 plus delta x.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.770
So first of all what is
this point right here?

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.890
This is a curve y is equal to
x squared, so f of x is 3

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.720
squared-- this is the point 9.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.805
This is the point
3,9 right here.

00:02:36.805 --> 00:02:39.350
 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.870
And what is this
point right here?

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.180
So if we were go all the way
up here, what is that point?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.120
Well here our x is
3 plus delta x.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.310
It's the same thing as
this one right here,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.990
as x naught

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.300
plus h.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.235
I could have called this
3 plus h just as easily.

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:58.110
So it's 3 plus
delta x up there.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.930
So what's the y
value going to be?

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.080
Well whatever x value is, it's
on the curve, it's going

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.550
to be that squared.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:12.310
So it's going to be the point
3 plus delta x squared.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.790
So let's figure out the
slope of this secant

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.240
line.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.080
 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.270
And let me zoom in a little
bit, because that might help.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.950
So if I zoom in on just
this part of the curve,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.250
it might look like that.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.330
And then I have one point
here, and then I have the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.776
other point is up here.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:32.330
 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.070
That's the secant

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.510
line.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.100
 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.210
Just like that.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.510
This was the point over
here, the point 3,9.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.230
And then this point up here is
the point 3 plus delta x, so

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.340
just some larger number than
3, and then it's going to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.790
be that number squared.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.110
So it's going to be 3
plus delta x squared.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.070
What is that?

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.310
That's going to be 9.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.720
I'm just foiling this out,
or you do the distribute

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.940
property twice.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.280
a plus b squared is a squared
plus 2 a b plus b squared, so

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.430
it's going to be 9 plus two
times the product

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.020
of these things.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.345
So plus 6 delta x, and then
plus delta x squared.

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:21.070
 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.530
That's the coordinate
of the second line.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.470
This looks complicated, but I
just took this x value and I

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.230
squared it, because it's on the
line y is equal to x squared.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.430
So the slope of the secant

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.500
line is going to be the
change in y divided

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.050
by the change in x.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.500
So the change in y is just
going to be this guy's y value,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.430
which is 9 plus 6 delta
x plus delta x squared.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.610
That's this guy's y value,
minus this guy's y value.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.310
 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.000
So minus 9.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.510
That's your change in y.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.630
And you want to divide
that by your change in x.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.020
Well what is your change in x?

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.210
This is actually going to
be pretty convenient.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.490
This larger x value-- we
started with this point on the

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.460
top, so we have to start with
this point on the bottom.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.680
So it's going to be
3 plus delta x.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.340
And then what's this x value?

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.700
What is minus 3?

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.070
That's his x value.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.760
So what does this simplify to?

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.020
The numerator-- this 9
and that 9 cancel out,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.320
we get a 9 minus 9.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.780
And in the denominator
what happens?

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.560
This 3 and minus 3 cancel out.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.550
So the change in x actually end
up becoming this delta x, which

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.490
makes sense, because this delta
x is essentially how much more

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.990
this guy is then that guy.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.360
So that should be the
change in x, delta x.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.810
So the slope of my secant

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:53.860
line has simplified to 6 times
my change in x, plus my change

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.130
in x squared, all of that
over my change in x.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.640
And now we can simplify
this even more.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.140
Let's divide the numerator
and the denominator

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.790
by our change in x.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.900
And I'll switch colors just
to ease the monotony.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.110
So my slope of my
tangent of my secant

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.580
line-- the one that goes
through both of these-- is

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.483
going to be equal if you
divide the numerator and

00:06:17.483 --> 00:06:19.650
denominator this becomes 6.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.420
I'm just dividing numerator
and denominator by delta

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.130
x plus six plus delta x.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.080
So that is the slope
of this secant

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.630
line So slope is equal
to 6 plus delta x.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.280
That's this one right here.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.990
That's this reddish line that
I've drawn right there.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.340
So this number right here, if
the delta x was one, if

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.390
these were the points 3 and 4,
then my slope would be 6 plus

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.640
1, because I'm picking a point
4 where the delta x here

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.480
would have to be 1.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.780
So the slope would be 7.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.730
So we have a general formula
for no matter what my delta

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.790
x is, I can find the slow
between 3 and 3 plus delta x.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.640
Between those two points.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.010
Now we wanted to find the
slope at exactly that

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.120
point right there.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.100
So let's see what happens
when delta x get

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.810
smaller and smaller.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.470
This is what delta
x is right now.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.580
It's this distance.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.510
But if delta x got a little
bit smaller, then the secant

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.160
line would look like that.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.360
Got even smaller, the secant

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.680
line would look like that,
it gets even smaller.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.240
Then we're getting pretty
close to the slope

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.860
of the tangent line.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.970
The tangent line is this
thing right here that I

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.910
want to find the slope of.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.970
Let's find a limit as our
delta x approaches 0.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.400
So the limit as delta
x approaches 0 of our

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.240
slope of the secant

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.700
line of 6 plus delta
x is equal to what?

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.830
This is pretty straightforward.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.350
You can just set this equal
to 0 and it's equal to 6.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:54.280
So the slope of our tangent
line at the point x is equal to

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.615
3 right there is equal to 6.

00:07:57.615 --> 00:08:01.280
And another way we could write
this if we wrote that f of

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.450
x is equal to x squared.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.770
We now know that the derivative
or the slope of the tangent

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.350
line of this function at the
point 3-- I just only evaluated

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:18.410
it at the point 3 right there--
that that is equal to 6.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.670
I haven't yet come up with a
general formula for the slope

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.790
of this line at any point, and
I'm going to do that

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:26.330
in the next video.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.630
