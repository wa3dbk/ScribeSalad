00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.950
Let's do a couple of example
problems where we use

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.190
information to set up equations
to solve our

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.690
problem, and then we'll actually
solve the equation.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.660
So let's do problem number 1.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.280
Write a mathematical equation
that describes the

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.380
relationship between the
variables in the table.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.890
So you have your days
and your profit.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.820
And if we look at them, on day
1 profit of 20, on day 2

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.290
profit of 40, day
3 profit of 60.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.690
It looks like no matter what
happens the profit is always

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.370
going to be equal to-- let's
see, it's 20, 40, 60, 80.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.300
It looks like every day
it increases by 20.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.910
This is plus 20, to go from 20
to 40, then it's plus 20, plus

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.900
20, plus 20.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.850
So every day it increases
by 20.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.810
So maybe the formula here is
that our profit is equal to

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.890
the day times 20, is equal
to 20 times the day.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.460
Does that fit the data?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.120
Let's see, you could try it with
all of them, but when the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.670
day is 5, 20 times 5 is 100.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.560
5 times 20 is 100.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.140
Yeah, it looks like it actually
fits the data.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.790
And if we wanted to write it a
little bit more algebraically,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.630
we could say that profit is p
and day is d, and we would

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.260
write our equation as profit is
equal to 20 times d or 20d.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.140
So that's part a.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.840
I wrote a mathematical equation
that describes the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.920
relationship.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.290
And then part b, they say what
is the profit on day 10?

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.070
Well lucky for us we've written
our equation, so

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.370
they're essentially just saying
what happens to p,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.640
profit, what happens to profit
when d or day is equal to 10?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.780
So profit is going to be equal
to 20 times the day

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.630
we're on, day 10.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.230
20 times 10, which
is equal to 200.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.430
That's it.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.420
Problem 3.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.320
Write a mathematical equation
for the following

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.270
situations and solve.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.500
All right, let's do part a.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400
7 times a number is 35.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.610
What is the number?

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.500
So whenever someone says a
number, I'll just use the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.350
variable x.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.270
I could use any variable,
I could say y

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.640
or b or z or anything.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.280
But I'll go with x because
that's what I'm most used to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.310
and what's most typically
done unless you've

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.690
already used your x.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:41.690
So 7 times a number, I'll say
7 times x is equal to 35.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.990
So that's our equation.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.980
We've written our mathematical
equation.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.040
And now it's, what
is the number?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.730
So to solve for x you could
it one of two ways.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.950
You could divide both sides
of the equation by 7.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.930
So if you divide that side by 7
and that side by 7-- And the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.270
whole reason I'm doing that
is because I want this

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.080
coefficient to become 1.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.600
And anything I do to one side
of the equation I have to do

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.780
to the other side.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.360
So 7 divided by 7 is 1, so you
just have 1x or you just have

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.200
x is equal to 35 divided by 7.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.980
x is equal to 5.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.480
The other way you could have
thought about this, you could

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.670
have said that this is
multiplying both sides of the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.140
equation times 1/7.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:29.180
So 1/7 times 7x is equal
to 35 times 1/7.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.830
These are equivalent
ways of doing it.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.830
Either way these would
have canceled out.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.420
You would have gotten
1x is equal to 5.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.670
Part b.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.690
One number is 25 more than
2 times another number.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.330
All right, so let's say
that x is equal to a

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.220
number, the one number.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.875
And let's say that y is equal
to the other number.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.440
So they're introducing
more variables here.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.250
So one number, let's say x,
is-- is, that's like equal

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:17.279
--it's equal to 25 more than
2 times another number.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.760
Well, this is the
other number.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.440
So 2 times our other number.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.400
That's what I got out of this
first line right there.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.310
One number is 25 more than
2 times another number.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.580
2 times another number plus 25
is going to be equal to my

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.780
first number.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.460
All right, now what is the
second [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:48.760
If each number is multiplied by
5, their sum would be 350.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.900
So that means 5 times this plus
5 times that is going to

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.580
be equal to 350.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:05.500
So 5 times x plus 5 times y is
going to be equal to 350.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.230
And they're asking what
are the numbers?

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.050
Well, here we can do something
called substitution.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.230
We already see that x is equal
to this whole thing over here.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.490
It's just like saying x is equal
to 5 or x is equal to 9

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.272
or whatever.

00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:20.830
x is equal to something.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.050
So every time we see an
x, we can replace

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.940
it with this something.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.640
So we see an x right here, so
we can replace it with this

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.550
something, and then we'll have
an equation that only has a y

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.670
in it and then we'll be
able to solve for y.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.590
So this can be written as 5
times, instead of an x we have

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.650
all this business, 25 plus 2y.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.310
I substituted for x, because
they told us x is equal to

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.440
this thing.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.860
25 plus 2y plus 5y
is equal to 350.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.110
Use the distributive property.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:07.360
5 times 25 is 125 plus 5 times
2y is 10y, plus all of this,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.670
5y is equal to 350.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.940
10y plus 5y is 15y.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:26.070
That's 15y plus 125
is equal to 350.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.510
Now we can subtract 125 from
both sides, so minus 125--

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.900
Sorry, minus 125.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.040
I'm doing that to get
rid of the 125 from

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.460
the left-hand side.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.950
So our equation simplifies to--
I'll continue it up here.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:51.700
We get 15y is equal
to 350 minus 125.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.130
That is equal to 225.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.120
And you may or may not already
know that 15 times 15 is 225,

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.210
so we already know what y is.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.990
Let's divide both sides
by 15 just to make it

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.510
clear what I'm doing.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.280
You divide both sides by 15 you
get y is equal to 225 over

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.730
15, which is equal to 15.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.300
Now we're not completely
done yet.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.860
We know what y is, but we still
have to solve for x.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.260
So x is equal to 25
plus 2 times y.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.720
y is equal to 15.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:29.090
2 times 15, that
is equal to 30.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:36.750
25 plus 30 is 55.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.420
Let me do part c.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.110
Let me clear this
out of the way.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.170
Clear this out of
the way as well.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.420
Part c.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.490
The sum of two consecutive
integers is 35.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.060
What are the numbers?

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.020
Well, let's say that x is equal
to the first integer.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.690
Then what's the second
integer going to be?

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.710
Well the second integer's
just going to be

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.970
one more than that.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.610
They're consecutive, they're
one after another.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:17.730
So x plus 1 is equal to
the second integer.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.280
And they're saying the sum of
both of these numbers is 35.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.360
So x plus the number that comes
right after x, x plus 1,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.490
is equal to 35.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:35.440
Add these together, you get
2x plus 1 is equal to 35.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.600
Subtract 1 from both sides of
the equation, you get 2x is

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.919
equal to 34-- just subtracted
1 from both sides.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.560
Divide both sides by 2 and
you get x is equal to 17.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.240
So the first number is 17, and
the second number is just one

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.140
more than that, it's 18.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.270
And notice, two consecutive
integers, 17 then 18, add them

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.740
together, you get 35.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.990
Part d.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.050
Peter is 3 times as old
as he was 6 years ago.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.690
How old is Peter?

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.130
So Peter-- I'll say p for
Peter's age --is equal to 3

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.540
times as old as he
was 6 years ago.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.620
How old was he 6 years ago?

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.430
Well, if he's p years old
now, he was p minus 6

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.420
years old 3 years ago.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.360
So let me write this as p minus
6-- that's as old as he

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.630
was 6 years ago.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.120
That's what p minus 6 is.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.020
This 3 times-- that's the
3 times as old as

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.980
he was 6 years ago.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.010
And, of course, this is how
old he is right now.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.710
So we just have to
solve for p.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.350
So we get p is equal to,
distribute the 3, 3 times p is

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:56.140
3p minus 3 times 6 is 18.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.310
Now we can subtract 3p from both
sides of the equation.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:05.040
We get minus 2p, right? p
minus 3p is minus, or

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.240
negative, 2p is equal
to negative 18.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.450
And divide both sides by
negative 2 and you get p is

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.050
equal to 9.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.910
Just multiply both sides
by negative 2.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.230
And you can verify it.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.810
Right now he's 9.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:27.120
6 years ago he was 3, and he
is 3 times as old as that.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.690
Right, 6 years ago he was 3,
and at 9 years old he is 3

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.250
times as old as he
was 6 years ago.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.820
So it definitely works out.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.460
That's the cool thing about
algebra, you can

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.400
always check your work.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.080
You always know when you
got the right answer.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.010
Problem 6.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.600
The price of an MP3 player
decreased by 20% from last

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.300
year to this year.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.670
This year the price of
the player is $120.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.820
What was the price last year?

00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:03.760
So let me say, p is equal
to the price last year.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.420
And they're telling us that
the price of an MP3 player

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.910
decreased by 20% from last
year to this year.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.240
So let's take 20%
away from this.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:20.230
So price minus 20% of the
price-- this is decreasing by

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.880
20% --is equal to the price
this year, which they're

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.950
telling us is $120.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.570
Well what's p minus 0.2
or minus 20% of p?

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.840
We decreased by 20%.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.360
Well you're going to
be left with 80%.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.560
So we could say 80% of the price
last year is equal to

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.950
the price this year.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.180
Like we did before, we divide
both sides by the coefficient

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.510
on our variable.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:57.485
Divide both sides by 0.8, or
0.80, depending how you want

00:11:57.485 --> 00:11:58.450
to view it.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.460
0.80.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.420
These cancel out.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:11.980
So we have to divide
0.8 into $120.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.870
A little exercise in
dividing decimals.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.840
Let me put some zeroes there.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.870
We could multiply the 0.8
and the 120 by 10.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.460
That's essentially moving
the decimals over to

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.990
the right by one.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:33.510
So this is the same as dividing
8 into 1,200.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.520
So this decimal isn't there
anymore, it's over here.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.810
This decimal is now over here.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.060
8 goes into 12 one time,
1 times 8 is 8.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.140
12 minus 8 is 4, bring
down the zero.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.930
8 goes into 40 five times.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:54.700
5 times 8 is 40, 40 minus 40
is 0, bring down another 0.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.470
8 goes into 0 zero times, 0
times 8-- you get the idea.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.430
0 times 8 is 0.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:01.730
We have no remainder.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.170
So our answer is $150.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.810
So it was $150 last year,
it decreased by 20%.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.720
20% of $150's $30, so it
decreased by $30, and it

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.960
definitely got us to $120.
