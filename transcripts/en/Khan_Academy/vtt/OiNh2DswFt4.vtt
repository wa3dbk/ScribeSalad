00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.980
I'll now introduce you
to the concept

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.460
of the Laplace Transform.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.930
And this is truly one of the
most useful concepts that

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.840
you'll learn, not just in
differential equations, but

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.100
really in mathematics.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.050
And especially if you're going
to go into engineering, you'll

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.610
find that the Laplace Transform,
besides helping you

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.480
solve differential equations,
also helps you transform

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.210
functions or waveforms from
the time domain to this

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.170
frequency domain, and study
and understand a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.740
whole set of phenomena.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.480
But I won't get into
all of that yet.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.920
Now I'll just teach
you what it is.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.170
Laplace Transform.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.100
I'll teach you what it is, make
you comfortable with the

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.330
mathematics of it and then in
a couple of videos from now,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.220
I'll actually show you how it
is useful to use it to solve

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.180
differential equations.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.200
We'll actually solve some of the
differential equations we

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.800
did before, using the
previous methods.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.470
But we'll keep doing it, and
we'll solve more and more

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.000
difficult problems.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.890
So what is the Laplace
Transform?

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.575
Well, the Laplace Transform,
the notation is the L like

00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:12.056
Laverne from Laverne
and Shirley.

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:15.040
That might be before many
of your times, but

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.860
I grew up on that.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.690
Actually, I think it was even
reruns when I was a kid.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.770
So Laplace Transform
of some function.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.170
And here, the convention,
instead of saying f of x,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.590
people say f of t.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.120
And the reason is because in
a lot of the differential

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.190
equations or a lot of
engineering you actually are

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.360
converting from a function
of time to

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.630
a function of frequency.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.300
And don't worry about
that right now.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.180
If it confuses you.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.020
But the Laplace Transform
of a function of t.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.820
It transforms that function into
some other function of s.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.410
and And does it do that?

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.150
Well actually, let me just do
some mathematical notation

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.460
that probably won't
mean much to you.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.800
So what does it transform?

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.630
Well, the way I think of
it is it's kind of

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.870
a function of functions.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.220
A function will take you from
one set of-- well, in what

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.009
we've been dealing with-- one
set of numbers to another set

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.060
of numbers.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.990
A transform will take you from
one set of functions to

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.100
another set of functions.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.140
So let me just define this.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:23.310
The Laplace Transform for our
purposes is defined as the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.510
improper integral.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.790
I know I haven't actually done
improper integrals just yet,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.890
but I'll explain them
in a few seconds.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.430
The improper integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.605
st times f of t-- so whatever's
between the Laplace

00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:49.170
Transform brackets-- dt.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.190
Now that might seem very
daunting to you and very

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.120
confusing, but I'll now do
a couple of examples.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.660
So what is the Laplace
Transform?

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.950
Well let's say that f
of t is equal to 1.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.300
So what is the Laplace
Transform of 1?

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.660
So if f of t is equal to 1--
it's just a constant function

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.280
of time-- well actually, let me
just substitute exactly the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.130
way I wrote it here.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.910
So that's the improper integral
from 0 to infinity of

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.640
e to the minus st
times 1 here.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.000
I don't have to rewrite it here,
but there's a times 1dt.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.270
And I know that infinity is
probably bugging you right

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.480
now, but we'll deal
with that shortly.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.620
Actually, let's deal with
that right now.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.660
This is the same thing
as the limit.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.870
And let's say as A approaches
infinity of the integral from

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:57.400
0 to Ae to the minus st. dt.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.410
Just so you feel a little bit
more comfortable with it, you

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.640
might have guessed that this
is the same thing.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.560
Because obviously you can't
evaluate infinity, but you

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.410
could take the limit as
something approaches infinity.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.880
So anyway, let's take the
anti-derivative and evaluate

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.730
this improper definite
integral, or

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.810
this improper integral.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.300
So what's anti-derivative
of e to the minus st

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.339
with respect to dt?

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:28.625
Well it's equal to minus 1/s
e to the minus st, right?

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:30.640
If you don't believe me, take
the derivative of this.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.070
You'd take minus s times that.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.500
That would all cancel out, and
you'd just be left with e to

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.455
the minus st. Fair enough.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.410
Let me delete this here,
this equal sign.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.890
Because I could actually use
some of that real estate.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.430
We are going to take the limit
as A approaches infinity.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.330
You don't always have to do
this, but this is the first

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.650
time we're dealing with
improper intergrals.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.270
So I figured I might as
well remind you that

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.340
we're taking a limit.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.030
Now we took the anti-derivative.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.960
Now we have to value it at A
minus the anti-derivative

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.050
valued at 0.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.740
And then take the limit of
whatever that ends up being as

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.710
A approaches infinity.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:17.490
So this is equal to the limit
as A approaches infinity.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.750
OK.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.550
If we substitute A in here
first, we get minus 1/s.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.960
Remember we're, dealing
with t.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.220
We took the integral
with respect to t.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.630
e to the minus sA, right?

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.650
That's what happens when
I put A in here.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.970
Now what happens when I put
t equals 0 in here?

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.830
So when t equals 0, it becomes
e to the minus s times 0.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.320
This whole thing becomes 1.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.190
And I'm just left
with minus 1/s.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.450
Fair enough.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.000
And then let me scroll
down a little bit.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.490
I wrote a little bit bigger
than I wanted

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.770
to, but that's OK.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.160
So this is going to be the limit
as A approaches infinity

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:20.640
of minus 1/s e to the
minus sA minus 1/s.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.780
So plus 1/s.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.170
So what's the limit as A
approaches infinity?

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.150
Well what's this term
going to do?

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.350
As A approaches infinity, if
we assume that s is greater

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.810
than 0-- and we'll make that
assumption for now.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.000
Actually, let me write
that down explicitly.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.950
Let's assume that s
is greater than 0.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.320
So if we assume that s is
greater than 0, then as A

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.870
approaches infinity, what's
going to happen?

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.210
Well this term is going to go to
0, right? e to the minus--

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.640
a googol is a very,
very small number.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.520
And an e to the minus googol
is an even smaller number.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.530
So then this e to the minus
infinity approaches 0, so this

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.920
term approaches 0.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.850
This term isn't affected because
it has no A in it, so

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.420
we're just left with 1/s.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.400
So there you go.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.120
This is a significant to
moment in your life.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.190
You have just been exposed to
your first Laplace Transform.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.350
I'll show you in a few videos,
there are whole tables of

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.300
Laplace Transforms, and
eventually we'll

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.570
prove all of them.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.440
But for now, we'll just
work through some of

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.230
the more basic ones.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.180
But this can be our
first entry in our

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.680
Laplace Transform table.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.870
The Laplace Transform of
f of t is equal to

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.030
1 is equal to 1/s.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.430
Notice we went from a function
of t-- although obviously this

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.460
one wasn't really dependent
on t-- to a function of s.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.520
I have about 3 minutes left,
but I don't think that's

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.010
enough time to do another
Laplace Transform.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.040
So I will save that for
the next video.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.660
See you soon.
