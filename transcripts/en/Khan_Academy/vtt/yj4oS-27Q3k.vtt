00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.022
In this video I'm going to talk a little more about points on

00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:07.074
angle bisector but before that I want to at least make sure we

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:09.840
understand what we mean when we talk about the distance

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.923
between a point and a line.

00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:16.524
So say that that is some point, point A

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:19.923
this is some line right over here, we'll call that line,

00:00:19.923 --> 00:00:23.239
BC, so when you're taking the distance between

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.491
a point and another point, it's very obvious,

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:28.291
you just draw a line to that other point,

00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.940
Well I already used B, you just draw a line to that other point

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.307
and you find the length of that line,

00:00:33.307 --> 00:00:35.459
so distance seems very straight foreward between

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:37.441
two points, but what about a point and a line

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:40.041
because there are many points on this line

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:45.358
maybe were going to find this distance, or maybe were going to find this distance, or this distance,

00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:48.091
and these are all going to be different lengths

00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:49.941
so how do we have one unique distance?

00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:52.657
And the way that we think about this, and we're going

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:54.724
to do this in much more depth in future math courses

00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:57.408
especially when you start vectors and linear algebra

00:00:57.408 --> 00:01:00.139
and all the rest, is distance between a point and a line is

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:03.524
really the shortest distance and that shortest distance

00:01:03.524 --> 00:01:05.091
is as if you were to drop a

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:08.925
perpendicular from that point to the line, so this right over here,

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:12.159
this right over here, is what we call the distance

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.692
the distance between the point and the line, and this

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:17.293
is perpendicular right over here, to

00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:20.676
recognize that this is indeed the shortest distance

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:23.859
think about this relative -the distance between this point

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.109
and any other point on this line. so pick another

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.807
point on this line right over here, let's call this

00:01:31.807 --> 00:01:36.126
point E, and think about this --now this is an

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:38.025
arbitrary point I could have drawn E here,

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:39.710
I could have drawn E here, I could have drawn E anywhere,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.676
but regardless of where you draw E, if you

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:44.697
draw a line segment between A and E, you see that

00:01:44.697 --> 00:01:47.710
we've form a right triangle from A to E, to the

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.660
point we had the perpendicular, so let me call this

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.044
point right here F, you're always going to draw

00:01:54.044 --> 00:01:57.659
a right triangle assuming that E is different than F

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.210
and if you will immediately see that you see that D

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.593
has to be shorter than this orange length, because this

00:02:02.593 --> 00:02:05.309
orange length is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:07.943
is always going to be the longest side a triangle

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:10.778
D squared plus whatever length this squared, is

00:02:10.778 --> 00:02:14.044
going to be equal to this length squared. So hopefully

00:02:14.044 --> 00:02:16.894
that at least gives you a decent sense why dropping

00:02:16.894 --> 00:02:20.728
the perpendicular will always give you the shortest

00:02:20.728 --> 00:02:22.978
distance between a point and a line, and that unique

00:02:22.978 --> 00:02:25.978
shortest distance is what we call the distance

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:28.493
between a point and a line. Now with that out of the way,

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:31.393
let's think a little bit about angle bisectors.

00:02:31.393 --> 00:02:38.328
So let me draw an angle here, so let me, draw an angle.

00:02:38.328 --> 00:02:42.462
So lets call this point, let me do it in a different color,

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.759
let's call that point A, lets call this point B,

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.662
and let's call this point C right over here.

00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:50.544
And an angle bisector is essentially line, or a segment,

00:02:50.544 --> 00:02:53.928
or a ray that splits an angle into two equal angles

00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:56.312
and we've talked about this before,

00:02:56.312 --> 00:02:59.545
so for example if we want to bisect angle ABC,

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:01.761
so this angle right over here, we want to split it

00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:05.962
in two, we are going to -I can draw a better version

00:03:05.962 --> 00:03:09.244
of that, we want to split it in two, we want to split it in two

00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:13.394
like, let me draw a little bit better, my drawing

00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:17.846
still doesn't look like, that looks decent, alright,

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:23.345
so lets call this point right over here D,

00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:25.844
and again we could even say that, that's a ray,

00:03:25.844 --> 00:03:27.728
or we could call that a segment, or whatever,

00:03:27.728 --> 00:03:29.830
but the way to think about this, is if now

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.496
angle DBC is equal to angle DBA, so this angle,

00:03:35.496 --> 00:03:43.963
DBC is equal to angle DBA, we can say that DB bisects

00:03:43.963 --> 00:03:49.963
angle ABC, so we can say that DB and now Im talking

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:52.562
about segment DB we could have made it a ray if we

00:03:52.562 --> 00:03:54.895
had -keep going to the right, or a line. DB

00:03:54.895 --> 00:04:02.880
bisects BISECTS angle ABC, ABC

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.247
Fare enough, now, the whole reason why I started

00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:08.814
this video talking about distances between points and lines,

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:10.614
is that I want to show you, that any point that is on

00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:12.780
an angle bisector, is actually going to be

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.352
equidistant from the sides of the angle, and then were

00:04:16.352 --> 00:04:18.362
going to go the other way saying, any point

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:20.998
that is equidistant from the sides of an angle is

00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:24.203
going on the angle bisector. So lets take an

00:04:24.203 --> 00:04:26.570
arbitrary point that sits on this angle bisector

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.903
so let's take this point right over here,

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:33.453
Ill call that arbitrary point F, or actually I havnt used

00:04:33.453 --> 00:04:36.686
E yet, so this is going to be and arbitrary point on our

00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:40.820
angle bisector, and now let's look at the distance between

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.436
E and BC and the distance between E and BA we already

00:04:44.436 --> 00:04:46.922
say that, -we already said that the distance between

00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:49.388
point and a line is if you drop a perpendicular

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:51.788
from a point to that line, which you can always do

00:04:51.788 --> 00:04:54.754
so lets draw a perpendicular right over here,

00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:57.904
this is one distance, and then this is the other distance

00:04:57.904 --> 00:05:04.238
this is, -this orange line right here is the distance between E and BC and this orange line is the distance

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:11.721
between E and BA and what I want to prove is that these distances are equal

00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:17.372
well the first thing to realize, is that we have two right triangles over here, they both share

00:05:17.372 --> 00:05:24.239
th- they both have the same angle, they're not sharing it but angle ABE is congruent

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:29.788
to angle CBE and we know that because DB bisects it so this angle is equal to that angle

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:34.372
they're both right triangles so the actually have 2 angles in common, which actually means

00:05:34.372 --> 00:05:38.605
they actually have 3 angles in common and constrains what this other angle would be and they also have

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:44.039
this side in common, -they have 3 angles are congruent to each other, they are not

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.256
necessarily in common, but it does have this side in common, BE is the hypotenuse

00:05:48.256 --> 00:05:52.240
of both of these right triangles, and so, you can invoke

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.990
using this angle, that angle and this side, this angle,that angle and this side

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.554
you could say that these 2 triangles are going to be congruent to each other

00:06:00.554 --> 00:06:04.855
so we could say that triangle, and let me put some points over here, so let's see

00:06:04.855 --> 00:06:14.007
let's call this F and let's call this G, we can say that triangle EBF is congruent to triangle

00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:23.656
EBG and we can use AAS, by Angle Angle Side congruency or you could say hey if

00:06:23.656 --> 00:06:28.223
two angles, -if corresponding angles are the same then the third angle is also going to be the same

00:06:28.223 --> 00:06:31.925
so this angle right over here could also be the same and

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:35.307
you could use ASA, but either way these two things are going to be congruent

00:06:35.307 --> 00:06:39.290
but if these two things are congruent, then the corresponding sides are going to be congruent

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:47.774
so then, then length of EF, segment EF, is going to be congruent to segment

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:51.191
EF is going to be congruent to segment EG which is the same

00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:57.224
thing as the length of EF is equal to the length of EG, these are really, these are really

00:06:57.224 --> 00:07:02.940
equivalent statements right over there, so the length of EF, the length of EF

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.575
is equal to the length of EG and the length of those two segments are the distances

00:07:06.575 --> 00:07:09.893
between the point and those 2 respective sides.

00:07:09.893 --> 00:07:15.443
We've just proven the first case, if a point lies on an angle bisector, it is

00:07:15.443 --> 00:07:21.608
equidistant from the 2 sides of the angle, now let's go the other way around,

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:29.025
let's say that I have, so let me draw another angle here, so let me draw another angle over here and let's call

00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:40.142
this A, B, and C and let's pick some arbitrary point E, let's point some arbitrary point E

00:07:40.142 --> 00:07:43.929
right over here and let's say we start off with the assumption that E is equidistant

00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:51.793
to BC and BA and what we want to do is prove that E must be on the angle bisector,

00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:55.959
so here, if you're on the angle bisector you're equidistant, over here we're going to show if you're

00:07:55.959 --> 00:08:02.059
equidistant you're on the angle bisector, so if it's equidistant to BC and BA, then this perpendicular

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:06.524
right over here, this perpendicular right over here, is going to be congruent to this

00:08:06.524 --> 00:08:13.909
perpendicular right over there, and let me give these points' labels, so let call this point D, and let's

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:20.909
call this point right over F, and let's just draw segment BE here, let's just draw segment

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:29.577
BE right over here, so once again, we have 2 right triangles, we already know that

00:08:29.577 --> 00:08:32.511
2 of the legs are congruent to each other, they both share the hypotenuse this

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:36.493
hypotenuse is equal to its self, we know from the pythagorean theorm

00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:43.210
if you know 2 sides of a triangle, it determines the third side, so and we know 2 sides of both

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:48.694
of these, so the third sides must be the same, so this side must be equal to that side

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:53.495
so you could invoke SSS, Side Side Side, to show these 2 triangles are congruent

00:08:53.495 --> 00:08:56.944
or you actually didn't need to -have to good there you could have used a special

00:08:56.944 --> 00:09:02.985
case, the RSH case, where if you have a right triangle, so if you have the right triangle

00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:06.012
you have one set of sides that are congruent, and you have the hypotenuse that is congruent

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:11.419
then you're also okay, you could use RSH to prove congruency as well,

00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:21.742
and so either way we know that triangle EBD, triangle EBD, is congruent to triangle EBF

00:09:21.753 --> 00:09:29.135
congruent to triangle EBF, we used Side Side Side here but you could have used RSH, let me write that

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:34.903
RSH, which is -we know that Angle Side Side can be used for any general triangle

00:09:34.903 --> 00:09:38.719
but it can be, -RSH is essentially Angle Side Side for right triangles, if you have

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:49.669
2 sides of a right triangle and- in common, --if 2 sides of a right triangle are congruent then

00:09:49.669 --> 00:09:57.036
the 2 triangles are definitely congruent but once you know that two triangles are congruent, then

00:09:57.036 --> 00:10:01.970
they're corresponding angles have to be congruent, and angle EBD, angle EBD

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:11.636
corresponds to angle EBF so we know that angle EBD must be congruent to angle EBF

00:10:11.636 --> 00:10:21.854
so EBD must be congruent to EBF, well if EBD is congruent to EBF then that means

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:38.086
that segment EB must bisect, must bisect angle CBF, or actually CBA even, it could be called CEF

00:10:38.086 --> 00:10:43.804
angle CBA. So we're done! If over here, we show that if something sits on a bisector is

00:10:43.804 --> 00:10:48.021
equidistant from the sides of the angle, and here we showed if it's equidistant from the sides

00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:54.470
of the angle it sits on the angle bisector, or, or -it could even be the end point of an angle bisector

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.815
but clearly, it sits on it.
