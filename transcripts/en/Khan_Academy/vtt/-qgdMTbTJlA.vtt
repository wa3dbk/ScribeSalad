00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.830
What I want to do in this video
is talk a little bit

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.490
about compounding interest. And
then, have a little bit of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.050
a discussion of a way to
quickly, kind of an

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.530
approximate way to
figure out how

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.890
quickly something compounds.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.340
And then we'll actually see how
good of an approximation

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.490
this really is.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.940
So just as a review, let's say
I'm running some type of a

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.730
bank and I tell you that I am
offering 10% interest that

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.980
compounds annually.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.830
That's usually not the
case in a real bank.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.080
You would probably compound
continuously.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.620
But I'm just going to
keep it a simple

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.040
example, compounding annually.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.430
There are other videos on
compounding continuously.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.110
This makes the math
a little simpler.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.780
And all that means is that,
let's say today you deposit

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.540
$100 in that bank account.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.129
If we wait one year and you
just keep that in the bank

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.280
account, then you'll have
your $100 plus 10%

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.190
on your $100 deposit.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.330
10% of 100 is going
to be another $10.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.200
So after a year, you're
going to have $110.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.550
You can just say I added
10% to the 100.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.930
And after two years, or a year
after that first year, after

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.900
two years, you're going to get
10% not just on the $100.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.500
You're going to get
10% on the $110.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.890
So you get 10% on $110.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.040
You're going to get
another $11.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.870
So 10% of $110 is $11.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.490
So you're going to get $110--
that was, you can imagine,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.960
your deposit entering
your second year.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.950
And then you get plus
10% on that.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.980
Not 10% on your initial
deposit.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.880
That's why we say
it compounds.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.970
You get interest on the interest
from previous years.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.290
So $110 plus now $11.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.380
So every year, the amount of
interest we're getting-- if we

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.639
don't withdraw anything--
goes up.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.950
So now we have $121.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.570
And I could just keep
doing that.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.400
And the general way to figure
out how much you have after

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.170
let's say, n years, is
you multiply it.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.860
I'll use a little bit
of algebra here.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.790
So let's say this
is my original

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.240
deposit, or my principal.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.840
However you want to view it.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.090
After x years, so after 1 year,
you would just multiply

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.570
it to get-- to this number
right here, you

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.260
multiply it by 1.1.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.090
Actually, let me
do it this way.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.040
I don't want to be
too abstract.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.570
So just to get the math here, so
to get to this number right

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.340
here, we just multiplied.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.510
That number right there is
100 times 1 plus 10%.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.780
Or you could say 1.1.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.780
Now this number right here
is going to be this

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.130
110 times 1.1 again.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.370
So it's this.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.170
It's the 100 times 1.1, which
was this number right there.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.400
And now we're going to multiply
that times 1.1 again.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.830
And remember, where does
the 1.1 come from?

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.340
1.1 is the same thing as
100% plus another 10%.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.040
Right?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.780
That's what we're getting.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.800
We have 100% of our original
deposit plus another 10%.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.170
So we're multiplying by 1.1.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.170
Here we're doing that twice.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.620
We multiply by 1.1 twice.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.410
So after three years, how
much money do we have?

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.030
So after three years, we're
going to have 100 times 1.1 to

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.390
the third power.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.320
After n years-- now we're
getting a little abstract

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.430
here-- we're going to have 100
times 1.1 to the nth power.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.100
And now you could imagine, this
is not easy to calculate.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.790
This was all the situation where
we're dealing with 10%.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.280
If we're dealing in a world
where let's say it's 7%.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.700
So let's say this is a different
reality here, where

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.019
we have 7% compounding annual
interest. Then after 1 year,

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.589
we would have 100 times--
instead of 1.1, it'd be 100%

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.940
plus 7% or 1.07.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.380
Let's go to three years.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.390
After three years, I could
do two in between.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.450
It'd be 100 times 1.07
to the third power.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.230
Or 1.07 times itself
three times.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.290
After n years, it'd be 1.07
to the nth power.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.860
So I think you get the sense
here that, although the idea

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.020
is reasonably simple, to
actually calculate compounding

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.950
interest is actually
pretty difficult.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.240
And even more, let's say I were
to ask you, how long does

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:04.790
it take to double your money?

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.110
So if you were to just use this
math right here, you'd

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.660
have to say gee, to double my
money, I would have to start

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.300
with $100 and I'm going to
multiply that times-- let's

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.790
say, whatever.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.880
Let's say it's a 10% interest.
1.1 or 1.10-- depending on how

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.540
you want to view it-- to the x
is equal to-- well I'm going

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.700
to double my money
so it's going to

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.900
have to equal to $200.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.390
And now I'm going to have to
solve for x and I'm going to

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.060
have to do some logarithms
here.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.770
You can divide both
sides by 100.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.490
You get 1.1 to the
x is equal to 2.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.010
I just divided both
sides by 100.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.890
And then you could take the
logarithm of both sides base

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.980
1.1, and you get x.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.060
And I'm showing you that this
is complicated on purpose.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.880
And if any of this is confusing,
there's multiple

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.840
videos on how to solve these.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.780
You get x is equal to
log base 1.1 of 2.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.120
And most of us cannot do
this in our heads.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.360
So although the idea is simple,
how long will it take

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.295
for me to double my money?

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:06.280
To actually solve it, to get
the exact answer, is not an

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.950
easy thing to do.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.730
If you have a simple calculator,
you can kind of

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.370
keep incrementing the number
of years until you get a

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.950
number that's close.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.280
But no straightforward
way to do it.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.500
And this is with 10%.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.050
If we're doing it with
9.3% it just

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.090
becomes even more difficult.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.100
So what I'm going to do in the
next video is I'm going to

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.840
explain something called the
rule of 72, which is an

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.670
approximate way to figure
out how long

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.700
to answer this question.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.650
How long does it take to double
your-- I forgot the

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.340
word, the most important word.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.730
How long does it take to
double your money?

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.540
And we'll see how good of an
approximation it is in that

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.346
next video.
