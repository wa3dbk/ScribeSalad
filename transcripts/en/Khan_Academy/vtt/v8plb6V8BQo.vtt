00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:09.985
If the distance between the plane Ax-2y+z = d and the plane containing the lines,

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:12.585
and they give us two lines here in three-dimensions,

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:18.084
if that distance is square-root of 6, then the absolute value of d is...

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:25.472
So let's think about it for a little bit. They're talking about the distance between this plane and some

00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:28.625
plane that contains these two line.

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:33.331
So in order to talk realistically about the distance between the planes, those planes will have to be

00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:37.928
parallel, because if they're not parallel - if they intersect with each other, the distance is clearly

00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:41.821
zero, and they're telling us here that the distance is square-root of 6.

00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:46.143
So we have a situation so that the planes can't intersect they must be parallel.

00:00:46.143 --> 00:00:53.431
So you have this plane up here, you have this plane up here, you could call this the equation here

00:00:53.431 --> 00:01:01.510
is ax - 2y + z = d, and then you're going to have another plane, that's going to be parallel to it,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.403
maybe it looks something like this. You have the other plane that is parallel, and it's going to contain

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:14.843
both of these lines. So maybe it has this line - so this line is in green, maybe this line looks something

00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:23.045
like this, it's on that blue plane. And then this line, maybe in magenta, is also going to be on the

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:26.912
blue plane. So how can we figure out the distances?

00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:33.996
Well a good starting point would be to try to figure out the equation for this blue plane here.

00:01:33.996 --> 00:01:40.659
And since these planes are parallel, this equation should look very much like this orange equation -

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.597
at least on the left-hand-side, it might just have a different d-value, and that's because it has the

00:01:44.597 --> 00:01:52.338
exact same inclination. And then once we figure out the equation for this plane over here, then we could

00:01:52.338 --> 00:01:58.852
actually probably figure out what 'a' is, then we could find some point on the blue plane and then use

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:05.550
our knowledge of finding the distance points and planes to figure out the actual distance from any point

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.454
to this orange plane.

00:02:07.454 --> 00:02:12.354
So let's figure out the equation of this blue plane first, and a good place to start is just to try to

00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:19.624
figure out two vectors on this blue plane, then we can take the cross-product of those two vectors to

00:02:19.624 --> 00:02:24.707
find out a normal to this blue plane, and then use that information to actually figure out the

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:26.982
equation for the blue plane.

00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:31.047
So let's figure out some points that sit on the blue plane.

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:37.315
So on this green line right over here you have, see if I want all of these to be equal to zero, you'd

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:46.492
have the point x is equal to 1, y is equal to 2, z is equal to 3, so you have the point (1,2,3) - that definitely sits

00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:52.199
on the blue plane. Let's come up with another point. let's see if I want all of these to be equal to

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:59.931
one, I could make this, if I want this to evaluate to two, I'd have the point three, I would have the point,

00:02:59.931 --> 00:03:07.942
if I want this to evaluate to one, I would want five minus two over three, so 3, 5, and then I would want this

00:03:07.942 --> 00:03:16.557
to be seven. Seven minus three over four is also 1, so that's another point, actually both of these points sit on this

00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:24.508
line right over here. 1,2,3 and then 3,5,7. And then let's do the same thing for this - let's find two

00:03:24.508 --> 00:03:29.723
points on this plane, and actually we just need to find one point on this plane, because if you have

00:03:29.723 --> 00:03:35.677
three points that's enough to figure out two different vectors -vectors that aren't scalar multiples

00:03:35.677 --> 00:03:39.638
of each other, which would be enough to figure out the normal to this plane.

00:03:39.638 --> 00:03:44.215
So let's just figure out one more point over here and one more point would be, if we want all of these

00:03:44.215 --> 00:03:47.556
three to be equal to zero, would be the point (2,3,4).

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.667
Because this would be zero, zero, zero. So that's also sitting the plane and that sits on the magenta

00:03:57.667 --> 00:03:59.026
line right over there.

00:03:59.026 --> 00:04:03.461
So let's use these three points to figure out two vectors on the plane that aren't multiples of each

00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:11.333
other, then we can take their cross-product to actually figure out a normal vector to the blue plane.

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:16.788
So let's say the first vector, 'a', that sits on this plane, let's say it's the difference in the position

00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:21.526
vectors that specify these two points, and then we know that will be on the plane.

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:37.362
And so that will be three minus one is 2i plus five minus two is 3j, plus seven minus three is 4k.

00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:44.014
So vector 'a' is actually going to sit on this green line, because both of these points are on this line,

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:48.554
so it's going to sit on that line. If we put it on the plane or if we were to start it at one of those

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.667
points it will sit on that line.

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:55.636
And then we can do another vector, and it's essentially going between a point on the green line and a

00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:59.862
point on the purple line, but that's definitely going to be a vector on our blue plane.

00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:04.718
Let's go between these two points - that looks pretty straight-forward, so let's call vector b,

00:05:07.902 --> 00:05:21.480
so let's call vector b, let's call that, let's see, two minus one is 'i', three minus two is 'j', and then four minus three, that's just 1k.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:29.375
So this vector here is also sitting on the plane. So if I take the cross-product of 'a' and 'b' I am

00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:34.656
going to get a vector that is perpendicular to the plane, or a normal vector to the plane.

00:05:34.656 --> 00:05:43.493
So let's do that. So let's find what 'a' cross 'b' is. 'a' cross 'b' is equal to - and this is how I

00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:49.223
find it easiest - I just write 'i', 'j', 'k', this is really the definition of the cross product, or

00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:56.194
I guess one of them. And we write our first vector, we have 2, 3, 4, and then we have our second vector,

00:05:56.194 --> 00:06:02.968
which is just 1,1,1, and then this is going to be equal to, first we'll look at the 'i' component, so

00:06:02.968 --> 00:06:04.941
cross that row, that column out.

00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:13.029
three times one minus one times four, so that's just three minus four, so it's negative 'i', and then

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:19.089
minus, we're going to have the 'j', so let we write up minus here, minus , let me just swap signs, we

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:23.454
have positive, negative, positive, so 'j' , get rid of that column, that row,

00:06:23.454 --> 00:06:28.725
two times one which is two, minus one times four, so that's minus four, is negative 2,

00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:33.927
so we could have written negative 2 here, but the negatives cancel out, so it becomes plus 2j,

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:39.778
and finally for the 'k', get rid of that row that column, two times one is two, minus one times three,

00:06:39.778 --> 00:06:44.352
is two minus three, which is negative one, so it's negative k.

00:06:44.352 --> 00:06:52.270
So this right here is a normal vector to the plane.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:07:00.389
So if we want to find the equation for that plane, we've done it multiple times, we'd just have to take

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:13.609
the dot product of that normal vector and any arbitrary vector on that that specified that we can specify

00:07:13.609 --> 00:07:17.859
with with an arbitrary x y and z, and we've done this multiple times in multiple videos.

00:07:17.859 --> 00:07:29.097
If this is any point, x, y, z, that sits on the plane, then the vector - let me draw the vector, let's

00:07:29.097 --> 00:07:34.740
say we go to this point right over here, so this vector right over here is going to be

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.639
- let me draw it the other way actually, so this vector right over here, let's say we're going between

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:53.014
this point and x,y,z, this vector right here is going to be x minus three i, plus y minus five j, plus

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:56.369
z minus 7 k.

00:07:56.385 --> 00:08:01.119
That's what this vector is, it sits on the plane, assuming x,y and z sit on the plane.

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:06.458
So if we take the dot product of this and the normal vector that has got to be equal to zero,

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:09.430
because it sits on the plane, and then we'll have our equation.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:23.806
So let's take 'n' dot that over there, so n dot x minus three i, plus y minus five j, plus z minus seven k.

00:08:23.806 --> 00:08:28.540
If any of this is confusing to you, I've gone into a little bit more depth in previous videos,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.348
especially in the linear algebra playlist where I talk about constructing the equation of a plane given

00:08:32.348 --> 00:08:38.177
a point on the plane and a normal vector, and even how you find that normal vector,

00:08:38.177 --> 00:08:40.720
so you might want to watch those if you want some review there.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.698
But these are going to be equal to zero, so when you take the dot product, n, our normal vector is this,

00:08:46.698 --> 00:08:51.087
so we just take the x term, which is negative one, times this x term right over here,

00:08:51.087 --> 00:08:58.749
so negative one times this is just three minus x, and then plus this y component times this y component,

00:08:58.749 --> 00:09:05.785
so it's two times this, so it's plus two y minus ten, and then finally the z component -

00:09:05.785 --> 00:09:15.979
negative one times this. So this is plus seven minus z is equal to zero, and what do we get?

00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:27.496
So we have our negative x, plus two y, minus z, and then is equal to, let's subtract three from both sides

00:09:27.496 --> 00:09:35.251
So if we take it out there it will be minus three. If we add ten to both sides, so then you have

00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:43.401
a plus ten over here, and then we subtract seven from both sides, this becomes a minus seven

00:09:43.401 --> 00:09:50.689
So then on the right-hand-side, negative three plus ten minus seven, well that's just going to be zero!

00:09:50.689 --> 00:10:04.276
And just like that we have the equation for this blue plane over here - the plane that contains these two lines.

00:10:04.276 --> 00:10:08.511
Now remember what we said at the beginning of the video - these two planes are parallel, so the ratio

00:10:08.511 --> 00:10:14.655
of the coefficients on the 'x' terms, the 'y' term and the 'z' term has got to be the same.

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:20.739
So this one has a positive 2, that has a negative 2, this is just to simplify it, so it looks very similar

00:10:20.739 --> 00:10:25.476
to each other. Let's multiple this equation right here, both sides, by negative one. And then we're going

00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:34.698
to get x minus two y plus z is equal to zero; so this is a completely valid, another alternate way of

00:10:34.698 --> 00:10:39.129
expressing the same plane. And what like about this about this is that it looks very similar to this -

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:46.304
at least the ratio of the x, y's and z's, negative two y, negative two y; one z, one z, and remember

00:10:46.304 --> 00:10:47.860
the ratios have to be the same.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.945
So here we have a one-to-one ratio between the z-coefficient and the z-coefficient, the y-coefficient

00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:56.335
and the y-coefficient, so it's also going to be for the x coefficient.

00:10:56.335 --> 00:11:01.885
So here we know if this is going to be parallel to the blue plane we know that 'a' has got to be equal

00:11:01.885 --> 00:11:03.301
to one.

00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:18.342
So this is x minus two y plus z is equal to d. So now let's figure out the actual distance between these

00:11:18.342 --> 00:11:24.942
two planes. So what we can do is we can take a point on this blue plane - and we have several examples

00:11:24.942 --> 00:11:30.469
of points on the blue plane, and find the distance between that point and this plane over here.

00:11:30.469 --> 00:11:35.600
And actually I just finished doing some videos on how to find the distance between a point and a plane,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.780
so I'm just going to use that formula (if you want it to be proved go watch that video - it's actually

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:47.127
pretty interesting proof I think) but the distance between let's say this point, (1,2,3), and this plane

00:11:47.127 --> 00:11:52.179
over here, so this distance right here is going to be in the direction of the normal,

00:11:52.179 --> 00:12:08.364
the distance is going to be, you literally just evaluate this, let me do it this way:

00:12:08.364 --> 00:12:14.331
you literally just put in this point for the x, y and z, and then you subtract the d in the numerator,

00:12:14.331 --> 00:12:20.229
and we saw that as the formula for finding the distance. So it's literally going to be one, one,

00:12:20.229 --> 00:12:23.062
(I'm actually using this point right over here)

00:12:23.062 --> 00:12:27.218
So it's going to be one, one, because we just have one x so it's just going to be one minus two times

00:12:27.218 --> 00:12:39.432
two, one minus four (that's two times two), plus three, minus d, over here the d is just d, so we're

00:12:39.432 --> 00:12:46.235
just going to write minus d, just like that, all of that over what is essentially the magnitude of the

00:12:46.235 --> 00:12:50.601
normal vector, and we saw in several videos that's just the square of the coefficients on each of these

00:12:50.601 --> 00:12:54.409
terms right here, and taking the sum of those, taking the square root,

00:12:54.409 --> 00:13:05.267
so it's going to be equal to: 1 squared, plus negative 2 squared which is four, plus one squared which is one.

00:13:05.413 --> 00:13:13.008
So this is going to simplify to the distance is equal to one minus four plus three is zero.

00:13:13.008 --> 00:13:21.200
So in the numerator we have negative d, all of that over the square root of one plus four plus one,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:30.949
so all over the square root of six. So they say the distance

00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:36.506
between this plane and this plane over here is square root of six. So they're saying the distance is

00:13:36.506 --> 00:13:44.953
equal to the square root of six, that's what this information right over here is, maybe I should do that

00:13:44.953 --> 00:13:47.466
in another colour.

00:13:49.343 --> 00:13:55.431
The distance between the two planes is going to be the square root of six, and so then if we solve for d,

00:13:55.431 --> 00:14:01.352
multiple both sides of this equation times the square root of six, you get six is equal to negative d,

00:14:01.352 --> 00:14:07.203
or d is equal to negative six.

00:14:07.203 --> 00:14:12.079
Now, what they care about is the absolute value of d, or the absolute distance, so this would be kinda

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:15.818
the signed distance - it specifies whether we're above or below the plane.

00:14:15.818 --> 00:14:19.696
Since we're below the plane we got a negative number - I just happened to draw it right, if we above

00:14:19.696 --> 00:14:22.366
the plane we would get a positive number.

00:14:22.366 --> 00:14:27.730
So this distance is negative six, the absolute value of it, the absolute value of d which is the same

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.724
as the absolute value of negative six, is equal to six.

00:14:31.724 --> 00:14:38.759
So take any point on this blue plane and you look for the closest point on the orange plane, and they

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:44.402
will be exactly six apart. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.
