00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.710
In this video, we're going to
start having some experience

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.400
solving radical equations or
equations that involve square

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.610
roots or maybe even higher-power
roots, but we're

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.680
going to also try to understand
an interesting

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.170
phenomena that occurs when
we do these equations.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.840
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.790
Let's say I have the equation
the square root of x is equal

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.900
to 2 times x minus 6.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.710
Now, one of the things you're
going to see whenever we do

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.890
these radical equations is we
want to isolate at least one

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.570
of the radicals.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.610
There's only one of them
in this equation.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.810
And when you isolate one of the
radicals on one side of

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.700
the equation, this one starts
off like that, I have the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.520
square root of x isolated on
the left-hand side, then we

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.480
square both sides
of the equation.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.750
So let us square both sides
of the equation.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.930
So I'll just rewrite it again.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.270
We'll do this one slowly.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.480
I'm going to square that and
that's going to be equal to 2x

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.840
minus 6 squared.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930
And squaring seems like
a valid operation.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.239
If that is equal to that, then
that squared should also be

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.400
equal to that squared.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.560
So we just keep on going.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.550
So when you take the square root
of x and you square it,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.210
that'll just be x.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.280
And we get x is equal to-- this
squared is going to be 2x

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.340
squared, which is 4x squared.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.560
It's 2x squared, the
whole thing.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.030
4x squared, and then you
multiply these two, which is

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.890
negative 12x.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.920
And then it's going to be twice
that, so minus 24x.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.150
And then negative 6 squared
is plus 36.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.240
If you found going from this to
this difficult, you might

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.750
want to review multiplying
polynomial expressions or

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.020
multiplying binomials, or
actually, the special case

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.070
where we square binomials.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.580
But the general view, it's this
squared, which is that.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.740
And then you have minus 2 times
the product of these 2.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.380
The product of those two is
minus 12x or negative 12x.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.800
2 times that is negative 24x,
and then that squared.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.340
So this is what our equation
has I guess we could say

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.930
simplified to, and let's see
what happens if we subtract x

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.710
from both sides of
this equation.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.850
So if you subtract x from both
sides of this equation, the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.710
left-hand side becomes zero
and the right-hand side

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.990
becomes 4x squared minus
25x plus 36.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.800
So this radical equation his
simplified to just a standard

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.670
quadratic equation.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.080
And just for simplicity, not
having to worry how to factor

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.620
it and grouping and all of
that, let's just use the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.230
quadratic formula.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.475
So the quadratic formula tells
us that our solutions to this,

00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:39.900
x can be negative b.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.990
Negative 25.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.540
The negative of negative 25 is
positive 25 plus or minus the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.960
square root of 25 squared.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:59.200
25 squared is 625, minus 4 times
a, which is 4, times c,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.150
which is 36, all of that over 2
times 4, all of that over 8.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.870
So let's get our calculator
out to figure out what

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.435
this is over here.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.490
So let's say so we have 625
minus-- let's see., this is

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.470
going to be 16 times 36.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.280
16 times 36 is equal to 49.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.880
That's nice.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.920
It's a nice perfect square.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.830
We know what the square
root of 49 is.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.826
It's 7.

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:34.780
So let me go back
to the problem.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.060
So this in here simplified
to 49.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.910
So x is equal to 25 plus or
minus the square root of 49,

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.000
which is 7, all of
that over 8.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.960
So our two solutions here, if we
add 7, we get x is equal to

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.870
25 plus 7 is 32, 32/8,
which is equal to 4.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.940
And then our other solution,
let me do that

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.590
in a different color.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.340
x is equal to 25 minus
7, which is 18/8.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.680
8 goes into 18 two times,
remainder 2, so this is equal

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.540
to 2 and 2/8 or 2 and 1/4
or 2.25, just like that.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.850
Now, I'm going to show
you an interesting

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.220
phenomena that occurs.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.480
And maybe you might want to
pause it after I show you this

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.080
conundrum, although I'm going
to tell you why this

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.090
conundrum pops up.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.030
Let's try out to see if our
solutions actually work.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.560
So let's try x is equal to 4.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.680
If x is equal to 4 works, we
get the principal root of 4

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.560
should be equal to 2
times 4 minus 6.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.790
The principal root of
4 is positive 2.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.700
Positive 2 should be equal to 2
times 4, which is 8 minus 6,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.420
which it is.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.670
This is true.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.290
So 4 works.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.420
Now, let's try to do
the same with 2.25.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.380
According to this, we should
be able to take the square

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.593
root, the principal root of
2.2-- let me make my radical a

00:05:05.593 --> 00:05:06.470
little bit bigger.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.840
The principal root of 2.25
should be equal to 2 times

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.620
2.25 minus 6.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.420
Now, you may or may not be able
to do this in your head.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.520
You might know that the square
root of 225 is 15.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.180
And then from that, you might
be able to figure out the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.180
square root of 2.25 is 1.5.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.970
Let me just use the calculator
to verify that for you.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.410
So 2.25, take the square root.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.600
It's 1.5.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.170
The principal root is 1.5.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.770
Another square root
is negative 1.5.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.020
So it's 1.5.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.980
And then, according to this,
this should be equal to 2

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.990
times 2.25 is 4.5 minus 6.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.970
Now, is this true?

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.350
This is telling us that 1.5
is equal to negative 1.5.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.200
This is not true.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.790
2.5 did not work for this
radical equation.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.580
We call this an extraneous
solution.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:13.730
So 2.25 is an extraneous
solution.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.070
Now, here's the conundrum: Why
did we get 2.25 as an answer?

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.310
It looks like we did very valid
things the whole way

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.830
down, and we got a quadratic,
and we got 2.25.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.260
And there's a hint here.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.010
When we substitute 2.25,
we get 1.5 is

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.550
equal to negative 1.5.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.120
So there's something here,
something we did gave us this

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.430
solution that doesn't quite
apply over here.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.720
And I'll give you
another hint.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.090
Let's try it at this step.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.320
If you look at this step, you're
going to see that both

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.300
solutions actually work.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.990
So you could try it
out if you like.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.740
Actually, try it out
on your own time.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.865
Put in 2.25 for x here.

00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:51.520
You're going to see
that it works.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.060
Put in 4 for x here and you see
that they both work here.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.360
So they're both valid
solutions to that.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.330
So something happened when we
squared that made the equation

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.070
a little bit different.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.000
There's something slightly
different about this equation

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.550
than that equation.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.710
And the answer is there's two
ways you could think about it.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.430
To go back from this equation to
that equation, we take the

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.440
square root.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.260
But to be more particular about
it, we are taking the

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.020
principal root of both sides.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.410
Now, you could take the negative
square root as well.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.710
Notice, this is only taking
the principal square root.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.430
Going from this right here--
let me be very clear.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.930
This statement, we already
established that both of these

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.610
solutions, both the valid
solution and the extraneous

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.350
solution to this radical
equation,

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.060
satisfy this right here.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.970
Only the valid one satisfies
the original problem.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.390
So let me write the equation
that both of them satisfy.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.550
Because this is really an
interesting conundrum.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.370
And I think it gives you a
little bit of a nuance and

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.860
kind of tells you what's
happening when we take

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.320
principal roots of things.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.230
And why when you square both
sides, you are, to some

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.660
degree, you could either think
of it as losing or gaining

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.960
some information.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.720
Now, this could be written
as x is equal

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.450
to 2x minus 6 squared.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.090
This is one valid interpretation
of this

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.470
equation right here.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.290
But there's a completely other
legitimate interpretation of

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.220
this equation.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.300
This could also be x is
equal to negative 1

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.400
times 2x minus 6 squared.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.870
And why are these equal
interpretations?

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.010
Because when you square the
negative 1, the negative 1

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.610
will disappear.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.420
These are equivalent
statements.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.500
And another way of writing
this one, another way of

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.630
writing this right here, is
that x is equal to-- you

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.450
multiply negative
1 times that.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:58.080
You get negative 2x plus 6
or 6 minus 2x squared.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.560
This and this are two ways
of writing that.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.760
Now, when we took our square
root or when we-- I guess

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.700
there's two ways you
can think about it.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.170
When we squared it, we're
assuming that this was the

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.800
only interpretation, but
this was the other one.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.460
So we found two solutions to
this, but only 4 satisfies

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.060
this interpretation
right here.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.800
I hope you get what I'm saying
because we're kind of only

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.710
taking-- you can imagine the
positive square root.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.300
We're not considering the
negative square root of this,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.080
because when you take the square
root of both sides to

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.010
get here, we're only taking
the principal root.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.880
Another way to view it--
let me rewrite

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.130
the original equation.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.630
We had the square root of x
is equal to 2x minus 6.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.620
Now, we said 4 is a solution.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.790
2.25 isn't a solution.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.690
2.25 would've been a solution if
we said both of the square

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.800
roots of x is equal
to 2x minus 6.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.220
Now you try it out and
2.25 will have a

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.330
valid solution here.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.050
If you take the negative square
root of 2.25, that is

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.590
equal to 2 times 2.25, so that
is equal to 4.5 minus 6, which

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.230
is negative 1.5.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.430
That is true.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.200
The positive version is where
you get x is equal to 4.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.250
So that's why we got
two solutions.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.900
And if you square this-- maybe
this is an easier way to

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.300
remember it.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.780
If you square this, you actually
get this equation

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.150
that both solutions are valid.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.900
Now, you might have found
that a little bit

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.070
confusing and all of that.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.990
My intention is not
to confuse you.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.490
The simple thing to think about
when you are solving

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.060
radical equations is, look,
isolate radicals, square, keep

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:45.740
on solving.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.460
You might get more
than one answer.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.180
Plug your answers back in.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.170
Answers that don't work, they're
extraneous solutions.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.260
But most of my explanation in
this video is really why does

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.290
that extraneous solution
pop up?

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.900
And hopefully, I gave you some
intuition that our equation is

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.610
the square root of x.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.140
The extraneous solution would
be valid if we took the plus

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.010
or minus square root of x, not
just the principal root.
