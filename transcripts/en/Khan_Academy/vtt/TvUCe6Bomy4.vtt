00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.810
We're told to graph all possible
values for h on the

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.590
number line.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.510
And this is a especially
interesting inequality because

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.060
we also have an absolute
value here.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.150
So the way we're going to do it,
we're going to solve this

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.240
inequality in terms of the
absolute value of h, and from

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.370
there we can solve it for h.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.430
So let's just get the absolute
value of h on

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.890
one side of the equation.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.800
So the easiest way to do this
is to add 19 and 1/2 to both

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.600
sides of this equation.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.159
I often like putting that as an
improper fraction, but 1/2

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.670
is pretty easy to deal with,
so let's add 19 and 1/2 to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.680
both sides of this inequality.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.470
Did I just say equation?

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.150
It's an inequality, not an
equation, it's an inequality

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.600
sign, not an equal sign.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.380
So plus 19 and 1/2.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.210
On the left-hand side, these
guys obviously cancel out,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.290
that was the whole point, and we
are left with the absolute

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.480
value of h on the left-hand
side is less than.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.660
And then if we have 19 and 1/2,
essentially minus 12, 19

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.709
minus 12 is 7, so it's going
to be 7 and 1/2.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.260
So now we have that the absolute
value of h is less

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.050
than 7 and 1/2.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.030
So what does this tell us?

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.470
This means that the distance,
another way to interpret

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.960
this-- remember, absolute value
is the same thing as

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.340
distance from 0-- so another
way to interpret this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:37.210
statement is that the distance
from h to 0 has to be less

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.130
than 7 and 1/2.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.200
So what values of h are going
to have less than a distance

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.510
from 7 and 1/2?

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.120
Well, it could be less than 7
and 1/2 and greater than 0, or

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.765
equal to 0.

00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:53.580
So let me put it this way.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.020
So h could be less
than 7 and 1/2.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.950
But if it gets too far negative,
if it goes to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.240
negative 3, we're cool, negative
4, negative 5,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.420
negative 6, negative 7, we're
still cool, but then at

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.090
negative 8, all of a sudden the
absolute value isn't going

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.180
to be less than this.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.770
So it also has to be greater
than negative 7 and 1/2.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.540
If you give me any number in
this interval, its absolute

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.320
value is going to be less than 7
and 1/2 because all of these

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.650
numbers are less than 7
and 1/2 away from 0.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.550
Let me draw it on the number
line, which they

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.820
want us to do anyway.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:37.540
So if this is the number line
right there, that is 0, and we

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.200
draw some points, let's say
that this is 7, that is 8,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.070
that is negative 7, that
is negative 8.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.120
What numbers are less than
7 and 1/2 away from 0?

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.170
Well, you have everything all
the way up to-- 7 and 1/2 is

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.480
exactly 7 and 1/2 away, so you
can't count that, so 7 and

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.220
1/2, you'll put a circle
around it.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.170
Same thing true for negative 7
and 1/2, the absolute value,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.810
it's exactly 7 and 1/2 away.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.940
We have to be less than 7 and
1/2 away, so neither of those

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.330
points are going to be included,
positive 7 and 1/2

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.060
or negative 7 and 1/2.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.630
Now, everything in between is
less than 7 and 1/2 away from

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.310
0, so everything else counts.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.490
Everything outside of it is
clearly more than 7 and 1/2

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.490
away from 0.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.000
And we're done.
