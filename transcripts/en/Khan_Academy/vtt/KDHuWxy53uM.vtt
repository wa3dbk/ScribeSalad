00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.510
Let's learn a little bit
about the dot product.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.040
The dot product, frankly, out of
the two ways of multiplying

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.410
vectors, I think is
the easier one.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.820
So what does the
dot product do?

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.406
Why don't I give you the
definition, and then I'll give

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:12.080
you an intuition.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:23.960
So if I have two vectors; vector
a dot vector b-- that's

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.660
how I draw my arrows.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.300
I can draw my arrows
like that.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.940
That is equal to the magnitude
of vector a times the

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.610
magnitude of vector b
times cosine of the

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.430
angle between them.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.520
Now where does this come from?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.480
This might seem a little
arbitrary, but I think with a

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.500
visual explanation, it will make
a little bit more sense.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.850
So let me draw, arbitrarily,
these two vectors.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.060
So that is my vector a-- nice
big and fat vector.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.710
It's good for showing
the point.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.810
And let me draw vector
b like that.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.380
Vector b.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.180
And then let me draw the cosine,
or let me, at least,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.650
draw the angle between them.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.090
This is theta.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.650
So there's two ways
of view this.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.600
Let me label them.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.886
This is vector a.

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:17.010
I'm trying to be color
consistent.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.740
This is vector b.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.120
So there's two ways of
viewing this product.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.360
You could view it as vector a--
because multiplication is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.130
associative, you could
switch the order.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.400
So this could also be written
as, the magnitude of vector a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.200
times cosine of theta, times--
and I'll do it in color

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.700
appropriate-- vector b.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.300
And this times, this
is the dot product.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.470
I almost don't have
to write it.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.860
This is just regular
multiplication, because these

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.200
are all scalar quantities.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.300
When you see the dot between
vectors, you're talking about

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.550
the vector dot product.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.640
So if we were to just rearrange
this expression this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.410
way, what does it mean?

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.110
What is a cosine of theta?

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.180
Let me ask you a question.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.970
If I were to drop a right
angle, right here,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.740
perpendicular to b-- so let's
just drop a right angle

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:14.900
there-- cosine of theta
soh-coh-toa so, cah cosine--

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.260
is equal to adjacent of
a hypotenuse, right?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.990
Well, what's the adjacent?

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.540
It's equal to this.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.900
And the hypotenuse is equal to
the magnitude of a, right?

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.740
Let me re-write that.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.230
So cosine of theta-- and this
applies to the a vector.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.270
Cosine of theta of this angle
is equal to ajacent, which

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.800
is-- I don't know what you could
call this-- let's call

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.130
this the projection
of a onto b.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.890
It's like if you were to shine
a light perpendicular to b--

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.080
if there was a light source
here and the light was

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.440
straight down, it would be
the shadow of a onto b.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.110
Or you could almost think of it
as the part of a that goes

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.440
in the same direction of b.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.340
So this projection, they call
it-- at least the way I get

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.050
the intuition of what a
projection is, I kind of view

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.910
it as a shadow.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.480
If you had a light source that
came up perpendicular, what

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.590
would be the shadow of that
vector on to this one?

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.260
So if you think about it, this
shadow right here-- you could

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.240
call that, the projection
of a onto b.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.180
Or, I don't know.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.200
Let's just call it, a sub b.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.240
And it's the magnitude
of it, right?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.520
It's how much of vector a goes
on vector b over-- that's the

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.650
adjacent side-- over
the hypotenuse.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.790
The hypotenuse is just the
magnitude of vector a.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.810
It's just our basic calculus.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.500
Or another way you could view
it, just multiply both sides

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.190
by the magnitude of vector a.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.390
You get the projection of a onto
b, which is just a fancy

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.830
way of saying, this side; the
part of a that goes in the

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.750
same direction as b-- is another
way to say it-- is

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.590
equal to just multiplying both
sides times the magnitude of a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.240
is equal to the magnitude
of a, cosine of theta.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.430
Which is exactly what
we have up here.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.570
And the definition of
the dot product.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.860
So another way of visualizing
the dot product is, you could

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.570
replace this term with the
magnitude of the projection of

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.760
a onto b-- which is just
this-- times the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.870
magnitude of b.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.360
That's interesting.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.410
All the dot product of two
vectors is-- let's just take

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.650
one vector.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.720
Let's figure out how much of
that vector-- what component

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.650
of it's magnitude-- goes in
the same direction as the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.570
other vector, and let's
just multiply them.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.250
And where is that useful?

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.040
Well, think about it.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.020
What about work?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.720
When we learned work
in physics?

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.870
Work is force times distance.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.600
But it's not just
the total force

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.460
times the total distance.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.110
It's the force going
in the same

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.360
direction as the distance.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.320
You should review the physics
playlist if you're watching

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.150
this within the calculus
playlist. Let's say I have a

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.250
10 newton object.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.710
It's sitting on ice, so
there's no friction.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.920
We don't want to worry about
fiction right now.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.915
And let's say I pull on it.

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:20.485
Let's say my force vector--
This is my force vector.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:34.440
Let's say my force vector
is 100 newtons.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.910
I'm making the numbers up.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.250
100 newtons.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.940
And Let's say I slide it to
the right, so my distance

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:54.720
vector is 10 meters parallel
to the ground.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.820
And the angle between them is
equal to 60 degrees, which is

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.080
the same thing is pi over 3.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.125
We'll stick to degrees.

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:07.790
It's a little bit
more intuitive.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.660
It's 60 degrees.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.940
This distance right
here is 10 meters.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.550
So my question is, by pulling on
this rope, or whatever, at

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.360
the 60 degree angle, with a
force of 100 newtons, and

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.980
pulling this block to the right
for 10 meters, how much

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.560
work am I doing?

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.990
Well, work is force times the
distance, but not just the

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.890
total force.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.880
The magnitude of the force in
the direction of the distance.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.150
So what's the magnitude
of the force in the

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.590
direction of the distance?

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.730
It would be the horizontal
component of this force

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.690
vector, right?

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.110
So it would be 100
newtons times the

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.520
cosine of 60 degrees.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.620
It will tell you how
much of that 100

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.180
newtons goes to the right.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.540
Or another way you could
view it if this

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.390
is the force vector.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.110
And this down here is
the distance vector.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.710
You could say that the total
work you performed is equal to

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:10.350
the force vector dot the
distance vector, using the dot

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.940
product-- taking the dot
product, to the force and the

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.650
distance factor.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.930
And we know that the definition
is the magnitude of

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.700
the force vector, which is 100
newtons, times the magnitude

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.880
of the distance vector, which is
10 meters, times the cosine

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.990
of the angle between them.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.030
Cosine of the angle
is 60 degrees.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:32.890
So that's equal to 1,000
newton meters

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.010
times cosine of 60.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.410
Cosine of 60 is what?

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.510
It's square root of 3 over 2.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.040
Square root of 3 over 2, if
I remember correctly.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.750
So times the square
root of 3 over 2.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.290
So the 2 becomes 500.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:56.160
So it becomes 500 square roots
of 3 joules, whatever that is.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.990
I don't know 700 something,
I'm guessing.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.960
Maybe it's 800 something.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.920
I'm not quite sure.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.950
But the important thing to
realize is that the dot

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.010
product is useful.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.880
It applies to work.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.230
It actually calculates what
component of what vector goes

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.280
in the other direction.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.400
Now you could interpret
it the other way.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.190
You could say this is
the magnitude of a

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.500
times b cosine of theta.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.110
And that's completely valid.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.370
And what's b cosine of theta?

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.920
Well, if you took b cosine of
theta, and you could work this

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.370
out as an exercise for yourself,
that's the amount of

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.020
the magnitude of the
b vector that's

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.580
going in the a direction.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.630
So it doesn't matter
what order you go.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.520
So when you take the cross
product, it matters whether

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.680
you do a cross b,
or b cross a.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.980
But when you're doing the dot
product, it doesn't matter

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.740
what order.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.049
So b cosine theta would be the
magnitude of vector b that

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:43.570
goes in the direction of a.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:49.810
So if you were to draw a
perpendicular line here, b

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.455
cosine theta would
be this vector.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.660
That would be b cosine theta.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.590
The magnitude of
b cosine theta.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.090
So you could say how much of
vector b goes in the same

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:03.820
direction as a?

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.730
Then multiply the
two magnitudes.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.460
Or you could say how much of
vector a goes in the same

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.680
direction is vector b?

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.970
And then multiply the
two magnitudes.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.410
And now, this is, I think, a
good time to just make sure

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.590
you understand the difference
between the dot product and

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.240
the cross product.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.200
The dot product ends up
with just a number.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.280
You multiply two vectors and
all you have is a number.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.990
You end up with just
a scalar quantity.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.950
And why is that interesting?

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.610
Well, it tells you how much do
these-- you could almost say--

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.280
these vectors reinforce
each other.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.330
Because you're taking the parts
of their magnitudes that

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.305
go in the same direction
and multiplying them.

00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:42.420
The cross product is actually
almost the opposite.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.110
You're taking their orthogonal
components, right?

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.390
The difference was, this
was a a sine of theta.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.110
I don't want to mess you up
this picture too much.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.460
But you should review the
cross product videos.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.020
And I'll do another video where
I actually compare and

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.880
contrast them.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.240
But the cross product is, you're
saying, let's multiply

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.820
the magnitudes of the vectors
that are perpendicular to each

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.660
other, that aren't going in the
same direction, that are

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.380
actually orthogonal
to each other.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.770
And then, you have to pick a
direction since you're not

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.230
saying, well, the same
direction that

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.570
they're both going in.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.060
So you're picking the direction
that's orthogonal to

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.150
both vectors.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.813
And then, that's why the
orientation matters and you

00:10:14.813 --> 00:10:16.370
have to take the right hand
rule, because there's actually

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.190
two vectors that are
perpendicular to any other two

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.810
vectors in three dimensions.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.380
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.750
I'll continue this, hopefully
not too confusing, discussion

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.330
in the next video.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.730
I'll compare and contrast
the cross

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.260
product and the dot product.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.070
See you in the next video.
