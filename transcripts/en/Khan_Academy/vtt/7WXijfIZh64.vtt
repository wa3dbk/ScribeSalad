00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
We're told that as part of an
experiment about train speed,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.860
4 different train conductors
measured the distance that

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.380
they covered over a certain
amount of time

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.650
during a recent journey.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.300
So these are the 4 trains.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.260
This is how long it took them
to go this many miles.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.460
However, they all use different
time intervals.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.910
Yeah, you see this guy, he
did it over half an hour.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.740
This guy did it over 2 hours.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.890
And they're having a difficult
time comparing their data.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.080
According to the data provided,
were all 4 trains

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.330
moving at the same speed
during the experiment?

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.660
So we just have to figure out
what was the speed of all of

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.790
these 4 trains based on
how far they went in

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.300
this amount of time.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.170
And just to remind us, you might
already know this, but

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.050
you know that distance is equal
to rate times time.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.300
Or if you were to divide both
sides of this equation by

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.610
time, I could do that.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.770
If you divide both sides by
time, the times cancel out and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.295
you get rate is equal to
distance divided by time.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.850
Rate is the same thing as speed,
and it makes sense that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.720
it's distance divided by time.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.400
You've heard miles per hour
or meter per second or

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.440
kilometers per hour.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.660
Rate speed is distance
divided by time.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.100
So we can just use this.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.270
We can just divide the distance
by the time for each

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.250
of these trains and figure
out what their speed was.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.510
So let's do that.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.710
So let's write their speeds.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.160
I'll make another column for
their speed right here.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.260
So what's this first guy?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.650
He went 27.5 miles
in 0.5 hours.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.620
So once again, let's divide the
distance for this train 1.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.815
He went 27.5 miles in 0.5.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:58.470
So if you divide something by
0.5, this is the same thing as

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.810
27.5 times 2.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.790
Let me do it this
way, times 2.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.840
What's 27.5 times 2?

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.920
It is 55, and it is
miles per hour.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.120
So his speed is 55
miles per hour.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.610
Now, this guy, this is pretty
straightforward.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.620
He went 55 miles in
exactly 1 hour.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.380
The distance divided
by time is 55.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.020
So this guy's pretty
straightforward.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.630
He's also 55.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.990
And you can put it
in the formula.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.780
55 is the distance.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.320
The time is 1 hour.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.450
55 over 1.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.440
55 miles per hour.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.600
Now this guy went 82-1/2
miles in 1-1/2 hours.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.840
Let's see what that is.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.210
So he went 82-1/2 miles
in 1.5 hours.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.530
So let's figure out
what this is.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.120
And I'll have to do a little bit
of decimal long division

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.020
to do this.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.950
So we have 1.5 goes into 82.5.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.020
Let's multiply both of these
numbers by 10, essentially

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.810
shift their decimals one
over, so shift that

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.730
decimal over here.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.360
So it becomes 15 goes into
825 how many times?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.000
So 15 doesn't go
into 8 at all.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.540
It goes into 82 five times.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.040
5 times 5 is 25, carry the 2.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.460
5 times 1 is 5, plus 2 is 70.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.590
Subtract 75.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.310
82 minus 75 is just
a 7, right?

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.560
And then you bring
down this 5.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.570
15 goes into 75 five
times exactly.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.680
5 times 15 is 75.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.620
Subtract, no remainder.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.700
So 82.5 miles in an hour
and a half is also

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.620
55 miles per hour.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.280
And then finally, if you do 110
miles 2 hours, 110 divided

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.990
by 2 is 55.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.930
So they did indeed all go, or
they all did move at the same

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.380
speed during the experiment.
