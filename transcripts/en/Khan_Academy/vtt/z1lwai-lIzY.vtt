00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.820
Welcome back.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.820
In the last presentation I
showed you that if I had the

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:13.530
function f of x is equal to x
squared, that the derivative of

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.980
this function, which is denoted
by f-- look at that, my pen

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.835
is already malfunctioning.

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:26.190
The derivative of that
function, f prime of

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.770
x, is equal to 2x.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.050
And I used the limit
definition of a derivative.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.375
I used, let me write
it down here.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.540
This pen is horrible.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.520
I need to really figure out
some other tool to use.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.160
The limit as h approaches 0 --
sometimes you'll see delta x

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.440
instead of h, but it's the same
thing-- of f of x plus

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.900
h minus f of x over h.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.890
And I used this definition of a
derivative, which is really

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.860
just the slope at any given
point along the curve,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.670
to figure this out.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.940
That if f of x is equal
to x squared, that

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.970
the derivative is 2x.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.360
And you could actually
use this to do others.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.940
And I won't do it now,
maybe I'll do it in a

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.710
future presentation.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.176
But it turns out that if you
have f of x is equal to x to

00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:26.630
the third, that the derivative
is f prime of x is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.700
equal to 3x squared.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.310
If f of x is equal to x to
the fourth, well then the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.550
derivative is equal
to 4x to the third.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.840
I think you're starting
to see a pattern here.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.812
If I actually wrote up here
that if f of x -- let me see

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:55.080
if I have space to
write it neatly.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.510
If I wrote f of x -- I hope
you can see this -- f

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.340
of x is equal to x.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.000
Well you know this.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.270
I mean, y equals x, what's
the slope of y equals x?

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.600
That's just 1, right?

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.330
y equals x, that's
a slope of 1.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.820
You didn't need to know
calculus to know that.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.870
f prime of x is
just equal to 1.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.270
And then you can probably
guess what the next one is.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.760
If f of x is equal to x to the
fifth, then the derivative is--

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.230
I think you could guess--
5 x to the fourth.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.730
So in general, for any
expression within a polynomial,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.090
or any degree x to whatever
power-- let's say f of x is

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.000
equal to-- this pen
drives me nuts.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.380
f of x is equal to
x to the n, right?

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.650
Where n could be any exponent.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:02.430
Then f prime of x is equal
to nx to the n minus 1.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.160
And you see this is what
the case was in all

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.700
these situations.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.620
That 1 didn't show up.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.730
n minus 1.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.110
So if n was 25, x to the
25th power, the derivative

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.110
would be 25 x to the 24th.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.826
So I'm going to use this rule
and then I'm going to show

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:19.690
you a couple of other ones.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.920
And then now we can figure out
the derivative of pretty much

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.270
any polynomial function.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.690
So just another
couple of rules.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.180
This might be a little
intuitive for you, and if you

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.830
use that limit definition of a
derivative, you could

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.630
actually prove it.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.170
But if I want to figure out the
derivative of, let's say, the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:51.200
derivative of-- So another way
of-- this is kind of, what is

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.730
the change with respect to x?

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.620
This is another notation.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.530
I think this is what Leibniz
uses to figure out the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.400
derivative operator.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:08.855
So if I wanted to find the
derivative of A f of x, where A

00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:09.910
is just some constant number.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.660
It could be 5 times f of x.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.850
This is the same thing
as saying A times the

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.460
derivative of f of x.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.400
And what does that tell us?

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.880
Well, this tells us that,
let's say I had f of x.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.180
f of x is equal to-- and this
only works with the constants--

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.680
f of x is equal to 5x squared.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.460
Right?

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.590
Well this is the same thing
as 5 times x squared.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.070
I know I'm stating the obvious.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.510
So we can just say that the
derivative of this is just 5

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.970
times the derivative
of x squared.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.690
So f prime of x is equal to
5 times, and what's the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.170
derivative of x squared?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.260
Right, it's 2x.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.300
So it equals 10x.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.970
Right?

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.700
Similarly, let's say I
had g of x, just using

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.910
a different letter.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.000
g of x is equal to-- and my
pen keeps malfunctioning.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:18.090
g of x is equal to, let's
say, 3x to the 12th.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.530
Then g prime of x, or the
derivative of g, is equal

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.490
to 3 times the derivative
of x to the 12th.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.450
Well we know what that is.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.540
It's 12 x to the 11th.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.800
Which you would have seen.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.680
12x to the 11th.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.180
This equals 36x to the 11th.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.190
Pretty straightforward, right?

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.540
You just multiply the
constant times whatever the

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.250
derivative would have been.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.450
I think you get that.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.050
Now one other thing.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.930
If I wanted to apply the
derivative operator-- let me

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.330
change colors just to mix
things up a little bit.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.450
Let's say if I wanted to apply
the derivative of operator-- I

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.650
think this is called
the addition rule.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.650
It might be a little
bit obvious.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:13.020
f of x plus g of x.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:26.060
This is the same thing as the
derivative of f of x plus

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.110
the derivative3 of g of x.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.640
That might seem a little
complicated to you, but all

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.290
it's saying is that you can
find the derivative of each of

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.920
the parts when you're adding
up, and then that's the

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.860
derivative of the whole thing.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.570
I'll do a couple of examples.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.230
So what does this tell us?

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.910
This is also the same
thing, of course.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.630
This is, I believe,
Leibniz's notation.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.000
And then Lagrange's notation
is-- of course these were the

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.530
founding fathers of calculus.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.335
That's the same thing as f
prime of x plus g prime of x.

00:06:57.335 --> 00:06:59.910
And let me apply this, because
whenever you apply it, I think

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.140
it starts to seem a
lot more obvious.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:19.500
So let's say f of x is equal
to 3x squared plus 5x plus 3.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.080
Well, if we just want to figure
out the derivative, we say f

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.445
prime of x, we just find the
derivative of each

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.080
of these terms.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.070
Well, this is 3 times the
derivative of x squared.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.200
The derivative of x squared,
we already figured

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.930
out, is 2x, right?

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.230
So this becomes 6x.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.140
Really you just take the 2,
multiply it by the 3, and

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.580
then decrement the 2 by 1.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.120
So it's really 6x to the first,
which is the same thing as 6x.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.182
Plus the derivative of 5x is 5.

00:07:45.182 --> 00:07:48.440
And you know that because if I
just had a line that's y equals

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.920
5x, the slope is 5, right?

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.950
Plus, what's the derivative
of a constant function?

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.410
What's the derivative of 3?

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.410
Well, I'll give you a hint.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.950
Graph y equals 3 and tell
me what the slope is.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.240
Right, the derivative
of a constant is 0.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.230
I'll show other times why that
might be more intuitive.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.500
Plus 0.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.720
You can just ignore that.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.770
f prime of x is
equal to 6x plus 5.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.480
Let's do some more.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.510
I think the more examples
we do, the better.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.790
And I want to keep switching
notations, so you don't get

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.340
daunted whenever you see
it in a different way.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:39.540
Let's say y equals 10x to
the fifth minus 7x to the

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:46.350
third plus 4x plus 1.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.920
So here we're going to apply
the derivative operator.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:55.760
So we say dy-- this
is I think Leibniz's

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.040
notation-- dy over dx.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.170
And that's just the change
in y over the change in x,

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.960
over very small changes.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.040
That's kind of how I view this
d, like a very small delta.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:17.500
Is equal to 5 times 10 is 50
x to the fourth minus 21 --

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:24.530
right, 3 times 7--
x squared plus 4.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.160
And then the 1, the
derivative of 1 is just 0.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:27.650
So there it is.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.340
We figured out the
derivative of this very

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.210
complicated function.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.510
And it was pretty
straightforward.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.050
I think you'll find that
derivatives of polynomials are

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.570
actually more straightforward
than a lot of concepts that you

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.170
learned a lot earlier
in mathematics.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.160
That's all the time I have
now for this presentation.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.820
In the next couple I'll just do
a bunch of more examples, and

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.100
I'll show you some more rules
for solving even more

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.175
complicated derivatives.

00:09:47.175 --> 00:09:49.300
See you in the next
presentation.
