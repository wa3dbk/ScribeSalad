00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.260
Welcome back.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.360
In the last video, I was
confusing you with compound

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.620
interest, and now I
will continue to do so.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.210
But the general notion is I
threw out this 100% interest

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.550
rate, and that was if we just
say you pay me 100% of what

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.710
you borrow after a year.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.710
And then we talked about what
happens if instead you want

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.800
half the rate for six months,
but then I will compound the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.310
interest over the
next six months.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.020
Then we said what happens if
it's for every month or every

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.780
day, and this was the
case for every day.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.830
And if I charged you 2.7% every
day, but I compound it for 365

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.690
days, it becomes-- I'm
just using Excel here.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.520
Let me clear all of this.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.540
It becomes 1.027 to
the 365th power.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.070
Oh, I'm using my
Excel incorrectly.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.050
Oh, that's not right.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:09.650
Let's see, plus 1.027
to the 365th-- no, I'm

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.400
making a mistake here.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.500
Let me make sure I got
this 1.027 right.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.690
So if I takes 100% and I divide
it by 365, so 100% is the same

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.890
thing as 1 divided by 365,
that is-- oh, it's 0.00.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.330
Sorry.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.120
So I'm not going to
charge you 2% a day.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.820
Yeah, that seems high.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:40.450
I'm going to charge you
1.-- that is 0.00274.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.490
I'm charging you 0.2%, right?

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.910
This would be-- this is the
kind of one percentage

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.410
place, so this is 0.2%.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.860
So I'm charging you
0.274% per day.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.520
I don't know why I put
brackets around that.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.860
So if I were to compound that
over 365 days, you take it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.820
to the 365th power, and
what does that get me?

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.070
Let's see, if I do plus
1.00274 to the 365th

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.500
power, I get 2.7148.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.540
It equals 2-- that's how much
you're going to owe me.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.650
If you just keep the money, you
keep kind of reborrowing it

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.430
every day, you'll owe me
$2.7148 after the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.970
end of one year.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.440
Now, let's say that's not
enough for you because this

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.530
interest rate is so high,
you want the option to

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.800
pay it by the hour.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.285
You want this thing to compound
every hour of the day.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:41.060
So let's see.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.760
Let's first of all figure
out how many hours

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.250
there are in a year.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.390
So let's see.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.550
In a year, there's 365 days
times 24 hours per day, so

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.390
there's 8,760 hours in a year.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.060
And then if we want to divide
100%, which is just 1, divided

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:11.450
by that number, I could charge
you 0.01-- what is that number?

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.200
Yeah, it's 0.0114.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:22.330
So hourly compounding-- I
should've been doing this

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.590
in green since it's money.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.610
Hourly compounding, I will
charge you 100% divided by the

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:42.590
number of hours in a year,
which equals 0.0114% per hour.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.850
So over a year, I would take
it to this power, right?

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.640
So let's say after one hour,
you'll owe me 1.01-- sorry,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.960
it's 01% so it's 1.000114.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.560
That's how much you're going
to owe me after one hour.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.460
So $1 plus a very small
fraction of a cent.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.900
But then after another
hour, you're going to owe

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.520
that times that again.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.010
Because this'll be the new
principal after an hour,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.390
so then you're going to
owe that same fraction

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.010
times it again, right?

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.960
Then after three hours,
you'll multiply it again.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.480
So after the total number of
hours in the year, which is

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:36.660
1.000114, and there's 8,760
hours in a year, let's

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.250
see what you'll owe me.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:58.860
So if I do plus 1.000114 to
the 8,760th power: 2.71443.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.430
So now, at the end of the year
after compounding roughly 8,700

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:11.030
hours, you'll owe me $2.71 and
then some fractions of a penny.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.790
And I know you thought that
these videos were about e and

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.620
you were just learning about
how to take advantage of

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.120
someone in need, but there
should be something interesting

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.050
here that maybe you observed.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.230
When we started compounding, at
first you owed me $2, just when

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.690
I did one period, which
is the whole year.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.300
Then it got to $2.25, and then
it kept getting higher as we

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.000
compounded shorter and shorter
periods, but it seems to be

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.670
approaching some number.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.810
It seems to be
approaching, right?

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.570
When I compounded every day, at
the end of the year, you owed

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.190
me $2.71 and some change.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.520
And then if I compounded every
hour, which is 24 times as

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.570
many compounds, you still owe
me a very similar number.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.370
So it seems like it's
gravitating towards this

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.390
mystical number here, and
that mystical number is e.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.230
So let's kind of formalize what
I've been meandering around

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.590
for a video and a half now.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.500
And I'll switch colors.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.080
So, in general, the amount
of money you owed me at the

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.540
end of the year was the
amount you borrowed.

00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:22.210
Let me do that in blue.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.800
Let's call that the principal.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.340
That's not bright enough.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.640
The principal times 1 plus--
and what was the interest rate?

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.840
It was 100%.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.240
100% divided by the number
of times you wanted to

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.090
compound in the year.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.280
We'll call that n, right?

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.770
And we raise that
to the n power.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.380
So in the case of when there's
only one compounding period,

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.320
where you just borrowed it for
the year, and the principal

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.740
in our example was 1, right?

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.330
So this is just 1 times-- the
principal is just what you

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.200
borrowed-- 1 plus-- 100% is the
same thing as 1, right, or

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.850
1.00, and when there was one
compounding period, we just did

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:11.860
that, and you owed me $2
at the end of the year.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.480
And this is exactly what
I've done in the last

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.030
video and a half.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.780
I'm just formalizing it with
a couple of variables.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.630
When we compounded it every
month, it turned into this: the

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:25.900
principal you borrowed was 1
times 1 plus 100% over 12 to

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.930
the 12th power, which
equaled-- let's see.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.230
I erased the numbers
so I will redo it.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:45.090
So it's 1 plus 1 divided by 12
equals 1 plus-- I'm using Excel

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.070
for those of you who have never
seen it before-- 12

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.300
to the 12th power.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:58.980
That equaled 2.613.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.030
And when I compounded every
day, I got-- the principal you

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:11.210
borrowed was that times 1 plus
1 over 365 to the 365th power,

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.780
and that equaled 2.71 and
then some, some, something.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.410
So as you see, as I make n
larger and larger in this

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:22.270
original equation, I approach
this magical number.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.410
I approach this magical number
2.71 something, something,

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.610
something, and that
magical number is e.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.250
And it amazes me that this--
and it never repeats.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.610
It's one of these
transcendental numbers like pi,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.960
and later on in future videos,
we'll see that it shows up

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.930
all over the place.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.270
It shows up in random
combinatorics, it shows up in

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.570
complex analysis, and as we
see here, and maybe most

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.810
importantly, it shows up
in compound interest.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.980
So, in general, what we
could say is the limit.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.470
And the limit is just
what happens as you

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.270
approach something.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.370
The limit as n
approaches infinity.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.840
And in our example, that's as
we compound over smaller and

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:09.540
smaller periods of time of 1
plus 1 over n to the nth power

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.960
is equal to this magical
number, and I'll do it in a

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.750
bold color-- well, that's not
that bold, but I'll highlight

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.120
with another bold color-- is e.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.290
And that is equal to 2.71.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.150
I forget all the digits.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.600
It keeps going on.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.020
And it's really fun
to experiment.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.610
Put in a crazy, huge-- put
in like a million there.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:29.920
And if you put it there,
you have to put a

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.130
million there, too.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.660
And you'll see that the larger
numbers you get, you just

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.000
get closer and closer and
closer to this number e.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.070
And a fun project would be
to see how many digits

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.450
of e you can get.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.420
But the fact that as you
compound something over smaller

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.970
and smaller periods it
converges to this number, to

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.000
me is pretty interesting.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.470
So with that out of the way, in
the next video I'll show you

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.610
how to figure-- and so, in
the limit, as n approaches

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.800
infinity, what are you doing?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.760
You're actually
compounding continuously.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.610
You're compounding every
zillionth of a second.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.770
And the fact that you can
actually calculate an interest

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.950
rate compounding every
zillionth of a second to me is

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.830
a fairly amazing result.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.240
But anyway, I'll see you
in the next video because

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.810
I've run out of time.
