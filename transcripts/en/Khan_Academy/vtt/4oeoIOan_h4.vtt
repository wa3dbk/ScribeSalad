00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:07.750
Let's say I go to a store and
I have $50 in my pocket.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.070
$50 in my wallet.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.670
And at the store that day
they say it is a 25%

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.680
off marked price sale.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.880
So 25% off marked price means
that if the marked price is

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.670
$100 the price I'm going
to pay is going to be

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.390
25% less than $100.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.830
So my question to you is if I
have $50, what is the highest

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.600
marked price I can afford?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.270
Because I need to know that
before I go finding something

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.270
that I might like.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.920
So let's do a little
bit of algebra.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:05.240
So let x be the highest marked
price that I can afford.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.290
So if the sale is 25% off of x,
we could say that the new

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:20.680
price, the sale price will be x
minus 25% of x is equal

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.790
to the sale price.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.730
And I'm assuming that I'm in
a state without sales tax.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.760
Whatever the sale price is, is
what I have to pay in cash.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.820
So x minus 25% x is equal
to the sale price.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.860
The discount is going
to be 25% of x.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:44.490
But we know that this is the
same thing as x minus 0.25x.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.530
And we know that that's the
same thing as-- well, because

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.600
we know this is 1x, x is
the same thing is 1x.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.910
1x minus 0.25x.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:02:00.050
Well, that means that 0.75x is
equal to the sale price, right?

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:07.180
All I did is I rewrote x minus
25% of x as 1x minus 0.25x.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.300
And that's the same
thing as 0.75x.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.180
Because 1 minus 0.25 is 0.75.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.290
So 0.75x is going to
be the sale price.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.980
Well, what's the sale
price that I can afford?

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.440
Well, the sale price
I can afford is $50.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.725
So 0.75x is going to equal $50.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.820
If x is any larger number than
the number I'm solving for,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.330
then the sale price is going
to be more than $50 and I

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.360
won't be able to afford it.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.520
So that's how we set the--
the highest I can pay is $50

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.950
and that's the sale price.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.170
So going back to how we did
these problems before.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.710
We just divide both
sides by 0.75.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.120
And we say that the highest
marked price that I can afford

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.010
is $50 divided by 0.75.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.410
And let's figure
out what that is.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.490
0.75 goes into 50-- let's
add some 0's in the back.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.815
If I take this decimal
2 to the right.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:15.220
Take this decimal, move it 2 to
the right, goes right there.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.930
So 0.75 goes into 50 the
same number of times

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.950
that 75 goes into 5,000.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.790
So let's do this.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.870
75 goes into 50 zero times.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.710
75 goes into 500-- so let
me think about that.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.065
I think it goes
into it six times.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.110
Because seven times is
going to be too much.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.040
So it goes into it six times.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.840
6 times 5 is 30.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.890
6 times 7 is 42.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.040
Plus 3 is 45.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.150
So the remainder is 50.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.270
I see a pattern.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.640
Bring down the 0.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.640
Well, same thing again.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.620
75 goes into 500 six times.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.670
6 times 75 is going
to be 450 again.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.730
We're going to keep having
that same pattern over

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.600
and over and over again.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.100
It's actually 66.666-- I hope
you don't think I'm an evil

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.500
person because of this number
that happened to show up.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.090
But anyway, so the highest sale
price that I can afford or the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.270
highest marked price I can
afford is $66 dollars.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.420
And if I were to around up,
and $0.67 if I were to

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.070
round to the nearest penny.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.350
If I were to write this kind of
as a repeating decimal, I could

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.800
write this as 66.66 repeating.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.150
Or I also know that 0.6666
going on forever is

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.230
the same thing as 2/3.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.580
So it's 66 and 2/3.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.290
But since we're working with
money and we're working with

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.280
dollars, we should just
round to the nearest penny.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.320
So the highest marked price
that I can afford is $66.67.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.830
So if I go and I see a
nice pair of shoes for

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.360
$55, I can afford it.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.580
If I see a nice tie for $70,
I can't afford it with

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.350
the $50 in my pocket.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.620
So hopefully not only will this
teach you a little bit of math,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.680
but it'll help you do a
little bit of shopping.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.430
So let me ask you
another problem, a very

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.760
interesting problem.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.480
Let's say I start with an
arbitrary-- let's put

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.210
a fixed number on it.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.260
Let's say I start with $100.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.630
And after one year
it grows by 25%.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.000
And then the next year,
let's call that year

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.300
two, it shrinks by 25%.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.100
So this could have happened
in the stock market.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.370
The first year I have a
good year, my portfolio

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.070
grows by 25%.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.990
The second year I have a
bad year and my portfolio

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.730
shrinks by 25%.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.540
So my question is how much
money do I have at the

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.930
end of the two years?

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.070
Well a lot of people might
say, oh, this is easy, Sal.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.270
If I grow by 25% and then I
shrink by 25% I'll end up with

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.320
the same amount of money.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.780
But I'll show you it's actually
not that simple because the 25%

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.520
in either case or in both cases
is actually a different

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.100
amount of money.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.590
So let's figure this out.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:27.100
If I start with $100 and I grow
it by 25%-- 25% of $100 is $25.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.260
So I grew it by $25.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.300
So I go to $125.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.590
So after one year of growing
by 25% I end up with $125.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.670
And now this $125 is
going to shrink by 25$.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.320
So if something shrinks by 25%,
that means it's just going to

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.680
be 0.75 or 75% of what
it was before, right?

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.850
1 minus 25%.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.500
0.75 times $125.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.830
So let's work that out here.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.325
$125 times 0.75.

00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:10.770
And just in case you're
confused, I don't want to

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.800
repeat it too much, but if
something shrinks by 25% it is

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.790
now 75% of its original value.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:23.140
So if $125 shrinks by 25% it's
now 75% of $125 or 0.75.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.440
Let's do the math.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.980
5 times 5 is 25.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.810
2 times 5 is 10 plus 2 is 12.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.800
1 times 5-- 7.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.510
7 times 5 is 35.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.100
7 times 2 is 14.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.750
Plus 3 is 17.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.560
Sorry.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.880
7 times 1 is 7.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.980
Plus 1 is 8.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.800
So it's 5, 7, and then
this is 7 actually.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.130
14.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.490
9.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.260
94.75, right?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.230
Two decimal points.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.410
94.75.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.750
So it's interesting.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:11.390
If I start with $100 and it
grows by 25%, and then it

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:16.450
shrinks by 25% I end up with
less than I started with.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.890
And I want you to think
about why that happens.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:24.400
Because 25% on $100 is the
amount that I'm gaining.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.790
That's a smaller number than
the amount that I'm losing.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:31.330
I'm losing 25% on $125.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.280
That's pretty interesting,
don't you think?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.100
That's actually very
interesting when a lot of

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.480
people compare-- well, actually
I won't go into stock

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.340
returns and things.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.825
But I think that should be a
pretty interesting thing.

00:08:41.825 --> 00:08:43.290
You should try that out
with other examples.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.700
Another interesting thing is
for any percentage gain, you

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.050
should think about how much you
would have to lose-- what

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.260
percentage you would
have to lose to end

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.050
up where you started.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.080
That's another
interesting project.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.700
Maybe I'll do that in a
future presentation.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.430
Anyway, I think you're now
ready to do some of those

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.200
percent madness problems.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.330
Hope you have fun.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.630
Bye.
