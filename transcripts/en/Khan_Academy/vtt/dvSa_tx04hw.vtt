00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.040
In the last couple of videos we
were trying to figure out

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.540
whether there was a meaningful
difference between the

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.480
proportion of men likely to vote
for a candidate and the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.790
proportion of women.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.800
And in the last video, we
actually estimated that using

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.340
a 95% confidence interval for
the difference in the

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.780
proportion of men and the
difference in the

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.850
proportion of women.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.950
What I want to do in this
video is just to ask the

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.990
question more directly.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.760
Or just do a straight up
hypothesis test to see is

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.050
there a difference?

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.585
So we're going to make
our null hypothesis.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.160
No difference.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.330
No difference between how the
men and the women will vote.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.600
Or another way of viewing, it
that the proportion of men who

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.590
will vote for the candidate is
going to be the same as the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.060
proportion of women
who are going to

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.780
vote for the candidate.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.660
Or another way you could say
that, is that the difference

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.510
P1 minus P2, the true proportion
of men voting for

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.830
the candidate minus the true
population proportion of women

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.540
voting for the candidate
is going to be 0.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.170
That's are our null
hypothesis.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.550
Our alternative hypothesis is
that there is a difference.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.200
Or that P1 does not equal P2.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.575
Or that P1 minus P2, the
proportion of men voting minus

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:37.300
the proportion of women voting,
the true population

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.930
proportions, do not equal 0.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.940
And we're going to do the
hypothesis test with a

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.030
significance level of 5%.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.870
And all that means, and we've
done this multiple times, is

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.415
we're going to assume
the null hypothesis.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.930
And then assuming the null
hypothesis is true, we're

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:15.950
going to figure out the
probability of getting the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.810
actual difference of our
sample proportions.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.010
So we're going to figure out
the probability of actually

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.040
getting our actual difference
between our male sample

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.790
proportion and our female
sample proportion.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.540
Given the assumption that our
null hypothesis is correct.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.610
And if this probability is
less than 5%, if this

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.610
probability is less than
our significance level.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.870
So if the odds of getting these
two samples and the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.570
difference between those two
samples, is less than 5%

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.530
percent, then we're going to
reject the null hypothesis.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.390
So how are we going
to do this?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.380
So if we assume the null
hypothesis, what does the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.550
sampling distribution of this
statistic start to look like?

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.640
Well, if we assume that the true
population proportions

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.260
are actually the same between
men and women.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.020
If P1 and P2 are actually the
same, then this right here is

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.270
going to be 0.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.310
So what we can do is, we can
figure out that we got when we

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.520
took the proportion of men and
we subtracted from that the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.660
proportion of women-- So this
is our sample proportion of

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.440
men who, at least in our
poll, said they would

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.510
vote for the candidate.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.750
This is a proportion of women
who said they would vote for

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.590
the candidate.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.740
The difference between
the two was 0.051.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.760
So we can do is figure out
what's the probability?

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.490
Assuming that the true
proportions are equal, that

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.470
the mean of the sampling
distribution of this statistic

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.890
is actually 0, what's the
probability that we get a

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.550
difference of 0.051?

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.519
So what's the likelihood that we
get something that extreme?

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.690
And what we're going to do
here is just figure out a

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.690
Z-score for this.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.440
Essentially figure out how many
standard deviations away

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.340
from the mean this is.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.820
That would be our Z-score.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.450
And then figure out, is the
likelihood of getting a

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.410
standard deviation, or that
extreme of a result, or that

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.920
many standard deviations away
from the mean, is that

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.420
likelihood more or
less than 5%?

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.670
If it is less than 5%, we're
going to reject the null

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.780
hypothesis.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.530
So let's first of all figure
out our Z-score.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.040
So we're assuming the null
hypothesis, P1 is equal to P2.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.120
Our Z-score, the number of
standard deviations that our

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.470
actual result is away from the
mean, the actual difference

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.710
that we sampled in the last few
videos between the men and

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.540
the women was 0.051.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.890
And from that we're going
to subtract the

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.460
assumed that mean.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.280
Remember, we're assuming that
these two things are equal.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.580
So the mean of this sampling
distribution right here is 0.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.460
So we're just going
to subtract 0.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:34.160
And then we have to divide this
by the standard deviation

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:42.410
of the sampling distribution of
the statistic right here.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.380
P1 minus P2.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.940
Now, what's the standard
deviation of the distribution

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.260
going to be?

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.710
In the last video, we figured
out that we could represent it

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.350
by this formula over here.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.980
But with our null hypothesis,
we're assuming that P1 and P2

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.340
are the same value.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.590
Let me rewrite it.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.890
So in our last video, and I
don't want to confuse the

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.860
issue, because in the last
video, I made this

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.090
approximation over here.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.710
So let me write the clean
version down here.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:27.390
We know that the standard
deviation of our sampling

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.450
distribution of this statistic
of the sample mean of P1 minus

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:38.150
the sample proportion, or sample
mean of P2, is equal to

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:48.510
the square root of P1 times 1
minus P1 over 1,000, plus P2

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.530
times 1 minus P2 over 1,000.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.280
We've seen this in
several videos.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:00.460
But in the null hypothesis,
we are assuming that

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.280
P1 is equal to P2.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.550
That's what we do.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.760
We assume the null hypothesis
and see the probability of

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.360
this occuring.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.980
So if P1 is equal to P2, we
can just represent them as

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.375
just some true population
proportion.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.070
So we could write it like this,
the square root of-- we

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:31.180
can literally just factor out
1/1,000 times P times 1 minus

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.790
P, plus P times 1 minus P.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.140
Because they're going to
be the same value.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.530
That's what we're assuming
in the null hypothesis.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.870
And so this is just two
of these over here.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:47.120
So this is going to be equal to
2P times 1 minus P, all of

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.510
that over 1,000.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.470
And we're going to take the
square root of that.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.030
Now this is the standard
deviation, once again, of the

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.830
distribution of this statistic
right over.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.860
The sample proportion for
the men minus the sample

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.470
proportion of the women.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.450
Now, we still don't know this.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.525
We still don't know the
true proportion.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.690
But we can estimate it
using our samples.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.300
And since we're assuming that
the men and women, that

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.050
there's no difference between
them, we can actually view it

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.010
as a sample size of 2,000
to figure out that true

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:32.940
proportion.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:39.309
So we can actually substitute
this with a sample proportion.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:42.010
And we can pretend like our
survey of the men and women is

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.789
just one huge survey.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:48.550
So you have your sample
proportion, we're surveying a

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.130
total of 2,000 people.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.600
1,000 men and 1,000 women.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.050
But we're assuming that
they're no different.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.180
That's what our null hypothesis
is all about,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.750
assuming there's no difference
between men and women.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:03.780
And we got 642 yeses
amongst the men and

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.620
591 amongst the women.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:18.960
So we got a total
of 642 plus 591.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.790
If you viewed it as just one
huge sample of 2,000 people,

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:40.610
we got 642 plus 591 is equal
to 1,233 divided by 2,000

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:49.880
gives us 0.6165.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:56.050
And this is our best estimate of
this consistent population

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.230
proportion that is true
of both men and women.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.920
Because we are assuming that
they are no different.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.680
So we can substitute this value
in for P to estimate the

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.860
standard deviation of the
sampling distribution of this

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.700
statistic right over here.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.940
Assuming that the proportion of
men and women are the same.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.860
Or the proportion that will
vote for the candidate.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.200
So let's do that.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:27.140
It's going to be the square root
of 2 times P, which is

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:37.080
0.6165, times 1 minus
P, 1 minus

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:46.730
0.6165, divided by 1,000.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.660
Let make sure I got it.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.510
2 times 0.6165, that's
that P right there.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.430
Times 1 minus P divided
by 1,000.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.530
We're taking the square root
of the whole thing.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:06.740
And so we get a standard
deviation of 0.0217.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.920
Let me write this over here.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:15.740
So this thing right over
here is 0.0217.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.040
So if we want to figure out
our Z-score, if we want to

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.860
figure out how many standard
deviations the actual sample

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.620
that we got of this statistic
right over here.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.930
If we want to figure out how
many standard deviations that

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.690
is away from our assumed mean,
that there's no difference,

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.080
then we just divide 0.051
by this standard

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.330
deviation right over here.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.630
So let's do that.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:47.130
So we have 0.051 divided by this
standard deviation, and

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.270
that was our answer up here.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.150
So I'll just do divided
by our answer.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:56.900
And we are 2.35 standard
deviations away.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:03.690
So our Z-score is
equal to 2.35.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.540
So just to review what we're
doing, we're assuming the null

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.610
hypothesis, there's
no difference.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:13.530
If we assume there's no
difference, then the sampling

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.740
distribution of this statistic
right here is going to

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.250
have a mean of 0.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:25.460
And the result that we actually
got for the statistic

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:31.350
has a Z-score of 2.34.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:41.630
Or this is equivalent to being
2.34 standard deviations away

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.180
from this mean of 0.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.960
So, in order to reject the null
hypothesis, that has to

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.060
be less probable than our
significance level.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:58.100
And to see that, let's see what
the minimum Z-score we

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.280
need to reject our hypothesis.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.610
So let's think about
that a second.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.430
I'll go back to my Z-table.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:14.770
We want to have a significance
level of 5%.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:19.430
Which means the entire area of
our rejection, in which we

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.850
would reject the null
hypothesis is 5%.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.770
This is a two tail test. An
extreme event on either far

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.750
above the mean or far below
the mean will allow us to

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.280
reject the hypothesis.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.630
So we care about the
area over here.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.870
And over here we would put
2.5% and over here

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.320
we would have 2.5%.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.290
And we would have 95%
in the middle.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.300
So we need to find
this critical

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:53.020
Z-score, critical Z-value.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.580
And if our Z-value is greater
than the positive version of

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:03.080
this critical Z-value, then the
odds of getting something

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.750
so extreme is less than 5%,
assuming the null hypothesis

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.840
is correct.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.100
So then we can reject
the null hypothesis.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.270
So let's see what this
critical Z-value is.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.030
So essentially we want a Z-value
where the entire

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.990
percentage below it is
going to be 97.5%.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.920
Because then you're going
to have 2.5% over here.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.510
And we've actually already
figured that out.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.280
This whole cumulative has to be
97.5%, we did that in the

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.470
last video.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.720
If you look for that, you
get 0.975 right there.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.690
It's a Z-score of 1.96.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:36.980
I even wrote it over there.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.400
So this critical Z-value
is 1.96.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:55.360
So what that tells you is
there is a 5% chance of

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:12.700
sampling a Z-statistic greater
than 1.96, assuming the null

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.790
hypothesis is correct.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:22.910
Now, we just sampled a
Z-statistic of 2.34 assuming

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.800
the null hypothesis correct.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.510
So the probability of sampling
this, given the null

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.720
hypothesis is correct, is going
to be less than 5%.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.780
It is more extreme than this
critical view Z-value.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.480
It's going to be out
here some place.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.580
And because of that, we can
reject the null hypothesis.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.680
I'm sorry for jumping around
so much in this video.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.610
I had already written a lot.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.700
So I just kind of leveraged what
I had already written.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.800
But since the odds of getting
that, assuming the null

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.790
hypothesis, are less than 5%,
and that was our significance

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:59.100
level, we can reject the null
hypothesis and say that there

00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.930
is a difference.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.850
We don't know 100% sure
that there is.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:06.620
But statistically, we are in
favor of the idea that there

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.360
is a difference between the
proportion of men and the

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.800
proportion of women
who are going to

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.590
vote for the candidate.
