00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:02.980
We're on problem 1.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.060
A project scheduled to be
carried out over a single

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.070
fiscal year has a budget
of $12,600.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.820
Divide it into 12 equal
monthly allocations.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.440
So if we divide it by 12
how much are we going

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.180
to spend per month?

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.620
So that's $1,050 per month.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.950
Right?

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.040
12,000 divided by 12 is 1,000.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.550
600 divided by 12 is 50.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.440
So they're going to spend
$1,050 per month.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.340
At the end of the fourth month
of that fiscal year, the total

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.800
amount actually spent on
the project was 4,580.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.680
So 4,580 after four months.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.920
By how much was the project
over its budget?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.120
Well, let's see how much
they should have

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.470
spent after four months.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.670
So after four months
they should have

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.380
spent 1,050 times 4.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.040
That's what?

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.340
That's 4,000.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.390
4 times 50.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.890
200.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.240
That's how much they should have
spent after four months

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.100
if they were on budget.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.330
They ended up spending 4,580.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.430
So let's see how much
they spent too much.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.040
They spent $380 too much.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.770
And that is choice A.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.160
Next question.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.150
Question 2.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.950
For which of the following
values of n is 100 plus n over

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.390
n not an integer?

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.500
We could simplify this.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.730
This is the same thing as 100
over n plus n over n, which is

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.150
equal to 100 over n plus 1.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.760
So in order for this not
to be an integer--

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.000
this is the same thing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.190
1 is clearly an integer,
so this can't

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.370
be an integer, right?

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.850
So we have to pick an n that
is essentially not

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.160
divisible into 100.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.510
So what are their choices?

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.590
So they say 1.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.880
Well 100 is clearly
divisible by 1.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.030
You'll get an integer there.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.380
So it's not 1.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.740
2.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.250
100 is clearly divisible by 2.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.710
100 divided by 2 is 50.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.930
That's not it.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.180
3.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.380
100 divided by 3.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.900
That's 33.333.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.840
That's not an integer.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.940
So choice 3 will not produce
an integer if it's selected

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.635
for n, so we're at C.

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:23.640
The answer is C.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.290
Next question.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.960
3.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.580
Rectangular floors x and
y have equal area.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.520
If floor x is 12 by 18--
let me draw that.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.630
This is floor x.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.840
They say it's 12 by 18.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.360
And floor y is 9 feet wide.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.560
What is the length of
floor y in feet?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.330
OK, I didn't have to
draw this, I think.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.810
So floor y is 9 feet wide.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.250
So they're saying it has the
same area, so essentially

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.660
they're saying that
9 times-- and they

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.105
want to know its length.

00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:08.730
So let's call that l.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.890
So the area of floor y, which is
9l, is equal to the area of

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.825
floor x, which is equal
to 18 soon. times 12.

00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:22.450
And I even multiply this out,
because I don't know off the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.960
top of my head what 18 times 12
is, but we can just divide

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.090
both sides by 9, and we get l is
equal to-- let's divide the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.960
18 by the 9.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.045
2 times 12, which
is equal to 24.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.460
And that's choice E.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.710
Next problem.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.360
Problem 4.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.390
A case contains c cartons.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.410
Each carton contains b boxes and
each box contains c-- OK,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.970
so c cartons.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.715
OK, case is equal
to c cartons.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.845
Carton is equal to b boxes.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:22.210
And then they say a box is
equal to 100 paper clips.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.350
How many paper clips are
contained in 2 cases?

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.620
So we could say 2 cases is equal
to 2c cartons, right?

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.640
So each carton has
how many boxes?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.830
Has b boxes, right?

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.480
So this is going to be
equal to 2 times c.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.700
Right?

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.150
That's how many cartons, and
each carton has b boxes.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.260
So it's going to be equal
to 2cb boxes.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.450
And then each of these boxes
is going to have 100 paper

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.650
clips, so times 100.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:08.450
So that is equal to
200cb paper clips.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.630
And that is choice C.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.770
They wrote bc instead of cb,
but that's the same thing.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.500
So that is choice C.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.460
Next question.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.590
Question 5.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.790
The sum of prime numbers that
are greater than 60, but less

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.640
than 70 is?

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.510
So let's just think of them.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.590
60 is not prime so that
doesn't work.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.290
61 as far as I can
tell is prime.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.740
Right?

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.460
I can't think of any numbers
that go into it, although

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.840
maybe I'm missing a few.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.900
62 isn't prime.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.700
That's even.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.930
63 is 9 times 7.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.660
That's not prime.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.040
64 is 8 times 8.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.050
65.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.280
That's not prime,
divisible by 5.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.910
66?

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.810
Nope.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.860
67.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.650
Is 67 prime?

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.810
Let's see, 67.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.440
I think it is.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.490
I can't think of any numbers
that go into it.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.560
68 is not prime.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.090
It's even.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.540
69 is divisible by 3.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.170
And 70 is clearly not prime.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.020
So if I'm right, these are
the two prime numbers.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.030
Let me make sure 61
is not divisible.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.430
It's not divisible by 3.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.890
It's not divisible by 7.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.400
Yes, 61.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.950
17 times 3 is 51.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:23.780
Yes.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.620
I can't think of anything.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.340
So if we add these two numbers
up, I get 128.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.250
So choice B.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.300
I hope that's right.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.970
Next question.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.900
Question 6. you 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.310
A rainstorm increased the amount
of water stored in

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.840
state J reservoirs from
124 billion gallons

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.500
to 138 billion gallons.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.480
If the storm increased the
amount of water in the

00:06:51.480 --> 00:07:02.980
reservoirs to 82% of total
capacity, approximately how

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.160
many billion gallons of water
were the reservoirs short of

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.090
total capacity prior
to the storm?

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.490
So, let's see.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.610
How many billions prior
to the storm.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.940
So this is 82% of
total capacity.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.820
So capacity is going
to be equal to 138

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.160
divided by 0.82, right?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.510
Well, maybe I skipped a step.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.390
Let me write that.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.810
82% of total capacity
is equal to 138.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.970
So you divide both sides by
82%, or 0.82, and you get

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:46.292
capacity is equal to
138/0.82, right?

00:07:46.292 --> 00:07:50.770
And then they want to know how
many billions of gallons of

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.420
water were the reservoirs short
of total capacity prior

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.090
to the storm.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.650
So it's going to be this
number-- this is total

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:01.620
capacity-- minus what they were
prior to the storm, 124.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.200
So we just have to do a little
bit of mathematics.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.120
I don't know if they allow you
to use a calculator, but I

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.690
think we can do this
on our own.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.550
0.82 goes into 138.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:18.410
And we could take this decimal
point two over, so we can move

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.340
this decimal point
two to the right.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.410
So we get that there.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.330
So it becomes 82 goes into
13,800 how many times.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.930
So 82 goes into 138 1 time.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.080
We get 6.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.230
13 minus 8 is 56.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.429
560.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.490
82 goes into 560--
Well, let's see.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:45.610
80 goes into 56 6 times.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.780
6 times 82 is 12, plus 1.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.100
6 times 8 is 48.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.560
49.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.890
And then we're left
with, let's see.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.751
What is that?

00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:00.040
This becomes a 5.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.230
This becomes 15.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.720
So we're left with 68.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.100
680.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:15.980
82 goes into 680 8 times.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.480
8 times 2 is 16.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.110
8 times 8 is 64.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.940
65.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.720
And you're left with, I don't
know, what is this?

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.880
24.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.810
240.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.720
So after the decimal it keeps
going, but the total capacity

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.390
is about 168.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.580
So how short were they?

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.830
168 minus 124.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.040
So 68 minus 24 is 44 gallons.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.030
And that's choice E.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.765
They give you a little bit of
hairy decimal problems. I

00:09:43.765 --> 00:09:45.970
don't know if calculators
are allowed, but we

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.280
did it without one.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.730
Problem 7.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:49.960
Actually, I'm almost of time.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.320
I'll continue this in
the next video.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.570
