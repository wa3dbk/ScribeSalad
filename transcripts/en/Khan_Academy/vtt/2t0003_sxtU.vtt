00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.730
I've got a matrix A, and
it's an m by n matrix.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.250
It has m rows and n columns.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.220
So I can write it in fairly
general terms like this.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.560
The first row would be a11.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.350
First row, first column.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.120
a12, First row, second column.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.100
All the way to-- I
have n columns.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.450
So a1n, first row,
n-th column.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.640
And then the second row
would look like this.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.540
a second row, first column.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.530
A second row, second column.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.190
All the way to a second
row, n column.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.060
And we'll just keep doing that
all the way down until you get

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.890
to the m-th row.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500
The m row would look
like this.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.780
Each of these are the entries
in each of the rows or

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.400
columns, depending on how
you want to look at it.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.160
So this is going to
be a sub m 1.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.740
mth row, first column.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.110
a sub m 2.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.950
And you go all the
way to a sub m n.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.590
This is our matrix right here.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.500
That is my matrix A.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:24.600
Now, I'm going to define the
transpose of this matrix as a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.740
with this superscript t.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.880
And this is going to be my
definition, it is essentially

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.930
the matrix A with all the rows
and the columns swapped.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.220
So my matrix A transpose is
going to be a n by m matrix.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.560
Notice I said m rows
and n columns.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.440
Now this is going to have
n rows and m columns.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.940
So what is this guy going
to look like?

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.140
What is he going to look like?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.670
Well I'm gonna swap my
rows and my columns.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.440
So my first row becomes
my first column.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.470
So I'm going to have a11.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.680
That entry's still going
to be in that position.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.510
But now this entry is not
going to be right here.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.250
a12.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.289
And my second row I have what
I used to have in my second

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.560
row, first column.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.200
I'm now going to have what
I had in my second

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.630
column, first row.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.410
I'm just going to go down
all the way to a1n.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.150
And that makes--
not a i n, a1n.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.120
And that makes sense because
I'll now have n columns.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.780
Sorry I now have n rows.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.130
I had n columns before.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.620
Now I have n rows.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.540
Now this row, when I transpose
it is going look like this.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.510
a21, a22, all the
way down to a2n.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.370
It might be a little confusing
for you right now to have this

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.590
notation right there because
everything we've done so far.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.250
We've always said, hey this
first number's the row and the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.620
second number is the column.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.380
That's what we did up here.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.170
What I'm doing here, you can
ignore that reference to the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.930
rows and columns.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.490
You can just say whatever we
had here in my first row,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.730
second column, I
now have here.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.370
When you look at this transpose,
don't take these

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.800
subscripts too literally.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.280
Or now you can kind of reverse
your interpretation.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.670
This is now the first
column, second row.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.625
This was the second
row, first column.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.900
I don't want you get too
confused with these

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.820
subscripts.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.370
Just keep in mind, we're
taking all the rows and

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.120
turning them into the columns
to get the transpose.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.920
And then you just
keep doing this.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.110
And then this m-th row will now
become the m-th column.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.780
am1, am2, all the way
down to a m n.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.030
So, this entry is
now that entry.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.890
If you know, this entry
is now that entry.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.890
That entry is now
at that entry.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.330
I think you get the idea.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.870
This is what a transpose is.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.350
And sometimes when you do in
the abstract, it can be a

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.140
little confusing.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.420
And we'll especially appreciate
that once we do

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.650
some of the proofs involving
the transpose.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.390
But actually taking the
transpose of an actual matrix,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.990
with actual numbers, shouldn't
be too difficult.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.290
So, let's start with
the 2 by 2 case.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.720
I'll try to color code
it as best as I can.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.380
So let's say I have
the matrix.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.790
Let's say I defined A.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.760
Let's do B now.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.250
I already defined A.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.110
Let's say B.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:33.510
B is equal to the matrix
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.150
Those colors are pretty close.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.430
But what is B transpose
going to look like?

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.800
B transpose is going to be equal
to-- You switch the rows

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.370
and columns.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.510
So the first row will now
become the first column.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.590
1, 2.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.200
And the second row will
now become the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.300
second column, 3, 4.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.770
Or you could view it
the other way.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.200
The first column now became
the first row.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.110
And the second column now
became the second row.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.970
Let's do an example.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.400
Instead of even doing a 2 by
3-- or a 3 by 3-- let me do

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.910
one that might be a little
bit more challenging.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.340
I think this'll make
things clear.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.055
So let's say I have
the matrix C.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.890
Let me make it a pretty
big matrix.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.540
Let's say it is a 4 by
3 matrix right here.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.120
Let me just throw some
numbers in there.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.060
1, 0, minus 1.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.660
2, 7.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.250
Oh I want to do it in
different colors.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.310
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.120
So then I get 2, 7, minus 5.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.780
Then I get 4 minus 3, 2.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.420
I have to do one
more row here.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.030
So let me just make that
minus 1, 3, and 0.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.280
That is my matrix C.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.300
So what is-- let me do that,
and I like to be

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.210
aesthetically pleasing.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.510
So let me close the bracket
in the same color.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.310
So what is C transpose
going to be?

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.295
So, C transpose.

00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:06.000
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.620
C transpose is now going
to be a 3 by 4 matrix.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.980
And, essentially, it's going
to be the matrix C with all

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.150
the rows swapped for the columns
or all the columns

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.830
swapped for the rows.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.050
So, it's now going to
be a 3 by 4 matrix.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.110
And that first row there
is now going to

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.360
become the first column.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.650
1, 0, minus 1.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.890
The second row here
is now going to

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.180
become the second column.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.760
2, 7, minus 5.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.420
I didn't use the exact same
green, but you get the idea.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.830
This third row will become
the third column.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.420
4, minus 3, 2.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.620
And then, finally, the
fourth row will

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.760
become the fourth column.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.470
Minus 1, 3, and 0.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:07:03.766
All we did is, this guy was in
the second row, third column.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.690
Now, that same guy
is in the what?

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:19.450
He is in the second column
and the third row.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.920
All we did is switch the
rows and the columns.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.370
We could do it with another.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.920
Let's see.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.200
Let's do it with this
one right here.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:32.100
This guy right here is
in the third row.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.980
1, 2, 3.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.230
And the second column.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:43.930
And when you go down here this
guy is now in the third column

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.600
and the second row.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.350
That's all a transpose is.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.670
And, just as a little
interesting thing, what

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.860
happens if we take the transpose
of the transpose?

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.660
So what happens if we
take C transpose and

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.710
then transpose that?

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.650
What is that going
to be equal to?

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.070
Well to go from C to C
transpose, we switched all the

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.150
rows and the columns.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.970
All the entries the
rows and columns.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.880
When you take the transpose
again, remember let's just

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.580
focus on this guy.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.000
This was second row,
third column.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.690
You took the transpose,
it becomes second

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.140
column and third row.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.940
If you were to take the
transpose again of that, he

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.100
would then become the second
row and third column again.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.375
So C transpose, the transpose
of C transpose, is

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:27.740
just equal to C.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.130
You're swapping all
the columns when

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.120
you take the transpose.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.380
And when you take the
transpose again, you

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.730
swap them all back.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.150
That's all that means.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:34.679
Anyway.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.630
Hope you found that useful.
