00:00:00.362 --> 00:00:08.170
In triangle ABC, AB is equal to 13, BC is equal to 14, and AC is equal to 15.

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:14.316
Let me just draw that. It looks like a pretty involved problem

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.332
So it looks something like that

00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:34.381
Let's say this is triangle ABC

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:42.203
They tell us AB is equal to 13, BC is equal to 14 and AC is equal to 15

00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:48.033
and then they tell us point G is the intersection of the medians.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:51.707
If you've watched the video on medians and centroids you might recognize

00:00:51.707 --> 00:00:54.721
that the intersection of the medians is just the centroid.

00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:57.981
Let me just show that here.

00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:05.153
The line from B to the midpoint of AC is a median.

00:01:05.153 --> 00:01:08.871
Let me draw that a little cleaner.

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:10.639
So that is a median.

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:22.239
Now the line from A to the midpoint of BC is also a median.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:33.576
And finally the line from C to the midpoint of AB is a median.

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:38.685
We learned -- if you've watched the video on medians and centroids --

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:42.133
that these three medians always intersect at a point called the centroid.

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:50.364
They even imply that in the question. So that right there is point G.

00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:59.267
Point A', B', and C' are the iamges of A, B, and C after a 180 degree rotation about G.

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:06.600
What is the area of the nion of the two regions enclosed by the triangles ABC and A'B'C'?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.216
Let's draw the second triangle.

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:16.162
What we want to do is rotate each of these about G 180 degrees.

00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:23.221
So if A is here and we rotate it 180 degrees about G,

00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:28.591
it's going to end up just as far from G on that side.

00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:36.672
So A' is going to be right over there.

00:02:36.672 --> 00:02:44.067
B is this far right now, if you rotate it 180 degrees,

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:49.157
B' will then be about that far.

00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:52.896
Same for C. If you rotate it 180 degrees,

00:02:52.896 --> 00:03:02.671
it's going to go about here. So you have C'.

00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:07.733
So if we wanted to draw A'B'C', it's going to look like this.

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:11.295
Here's my best attempt at it.

00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:24.548
This line should be parallel to that line

00:03:24.548 --> 00:03:27.600
since it's been rotated by 180 degrees.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.438
And this line [C'B'] should be parallel to this line [BC],

00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:38.733
and this line [C'A'] should be parallel to that line [AC].

00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:42.888
It seems like it's going to be relevant.

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:48.554
So they're asking, they want the area of the union of the two triangles.

00:03:48.554 --> 00:03:59.667
So it's the area of this star. This slightly skewed or tilted star of David

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:05.179
I'm not doing this in real time; it took me a while before I did this problem

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:06.924
before it jumped out at me.

00:04:06.924 --> 00:04:09.438
Kind of knowing that most of these problems don't require

00:04:09.438 --> 00:04:10.920
really hard mathematics.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.614
A lot of the time you just kind of have to see something

00:04:12.614 --> 00:04:16.667
or rearrange things and the answer jumps out.

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:20.017
It's also the case with this one here.

00:04:20.017 --> 00:04:23.533
And the thing that jumps out (and the motivation for making this video)

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:33.043
I showed you in the last video that if you have the median of a triangle

00:04:33.043 --> 00:04:35.900
and the centroid of the trianlge is over here,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:43.200
this distance [GA] is twice the distance from the centroid to the midpoint [of BC]

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.715
and the same on all 3 sides.

00:04:49.715 --> 00:05:01.229
But this distance [AG] is also the same as this whole entire distance [A'G]

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.701
This distance has been rotated 180 and degrees

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:10.369
and if this distance [G-midpoint of BC] is half of that one [AG]

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:19.133
this is exactly halfway between this point [G] and that point [A']

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:23.895
Another way to think about it:

00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:27.308
we know that this length over here is equal to this length over here,

00:05:27.308 --> 00:05:31.976
which is equal to this length over here, which is equal to this length over here

00:05:31.976 --> 00:05:37.061
And so you start seeing, maybe, some triangles will jump out.

00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:42.634
Let's see if I can draw these triangles.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:49.484
I have this triangle up here.

00:05:49.484 --> 00:05:53.849
This is actually going to be a median of this triangle over here

00:05:53.849 --> 00:06:05.227
It's going to be the same as the median or equivalent line of this triangle over here

00:06:05.227 --> 00:06:10.149
It's actually going to be an altitude -- we're kind of drawing a rhombus

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:15.699
and the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:22.456
So this altitude right here is going to be the same as this altitude over here.

00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:31.442
This side is the exact same thing as this side.

00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:33.857
Let me be careful here.

00:06:33.857 --> 00:06:37.154
We already know that this side is going to be the same thing as this side

00:06:37.154 --> 00:06:41.218
We know these two sides are the same because this is acting as a median of this triangle

00:06:41.218 --> 00:06:48.718
We already know that this yellow side I'll draw two marks is the same thing

00:06:48.718 --> 00:06:51.733
as that yellow side down there.

00:06:51.733 --> 00:06:56.496
If this is the same as this, and this is the same in both triangles,

00:06:56.496 --> 00:07:06.458
we know that this side must be the same thing as this side,

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:16.535
which also must be the same thing as this side and this side over here.

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:20.436
Another way to think about it, this triangle is going to have the exact same area

00:07:20.436 --> 00:07:22.085
as this triangle.

00:07:22.085 --> 00:07:24.639
This triangle is going to have the same exact area as this triangle.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.288
Or, you could view it another way.

00:07:26.288 --> 00:07:35.297
This purple triangle right over here is going to be a congruent triangle to this triangle over here.

00:07:35.297 --> 00:07:39.941
All of its sides are exactly the same. They share one of them.

00:07:39.941 --> 00:07:43.981
We could use the same argument to say that this triangle right over here

00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:54.035
is completely congruent to this triangle right over there.

00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:55.359
They have all of the same sides.

00:07:55.359 --> 00:07:59.520
In fact, we even know that they are congruent to these two up here.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.815
So these are all congruent.

00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:19.949
Let's think about this triangle right over here.

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:27.751
We know that this distance, the distance when started talking about medians,

00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:32.534
from the centroid to the base, that's the exact same distance

00:08:32.534 --> 00:08:39.129
over here , if you were to draw a parallel line.

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:44.631
It's just that this line up here and this line over here are parallel

00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:50.841
If this is parallel to this, and they're intersecting at the same point

00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:54.652
I won't go into the depth of proving they're parallel -- it's not too hard to prove.

00:08:54.652 --> 00:09:01.652
You can show that this distance is the same as this distance.

00:09:01.652 --> 00:09:08.688
We share this magenta side right over here,

00:09:08.688 --> 00:09:13.790
so we know that this side is going to

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.256
be the same as that side

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:19.345
Or we know that this triangle is going to be

00:09:19.345 --> 00:09:21.157
the same thing as that triangle.

00:09:21.157 --> 00:09:26.242
And then we can take the mirror image.

00:09:26.242 --> 00:09:28.355
Using essentially the same argument,

00:09:28.355 --> 00:09:31.048
that's going to be the same thing as this triangle over here.

00:09:31.048 --> 00:09:33.138
And it's a similar argument to show that that's going

00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:35.832
to be the same thing as that triangle over there.

00:09:35.832 --> 00:09:42.124
And then do it on the other side.

00:09:42.124 --> 00:09:44.237
I think you see where this is going!

00:09:44.237 --> 00:09:46.735
All of these triangles are congruent.

00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:04.148
There's actually multiple ways you can make that argument.

00:10:04.148 --> 00:10:07.597
The same argument we made to show that these magenta triangles are congruent,

00:10:07.597 --> 00:10:13.750
we could make to say that this distance is exactly half of this entire distance.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.443
Same argument to tell you that this triangle's congruent

00:10:16.443 --> 00:10:17.790
to that that triangle.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.993
And that one to that one.

00:10:21.993 --> 00:10:23.200
So that entire shape --

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:29.168
and actually I was a little handwavy about it --

00:10:29.168 --> 00:10:33.231
I think you can see it actually wouldn't be hard to do a rigorous proof.

00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:37.202
But this shape, this slanted star of david

00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:48.557
is made up of [counts to 12] congruent triangles.

00:10:48.557 --> 00:10:53.363
12 congruent triangles.

00:10:53.363 --> 00:10:58.611
Now, how many of these congruent triangles originally made up our triangle ABC?

00:10:58.611 --> 00:11:12.729
[counts to 9]

00:11:12.729 --> 00:11:17.976
So we have 12 congruent triangles in the star

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:30.422
we had 9 congruent triangles in ABC,

00:11:30.422 --> 00:11:37.922
so the area of the star is just going to be 12/9 the area of ABC.

00:11:37.922 --> 00:11:41.219
So if we can figure out the area of ABC,

00:11:41.219 --> 00:11:44.401
we know that each triangle will have 1/9 that area.

00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:49.788
Multiplying by 12 we'll get the area of the actual star.

00:11:49.788 --> 00:11:53.990
So let's figure out the area of triangle ABC.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:12:02.814
Let me redraw the triangle.

00:12:02.814 --> 00:12:07.017
There are formulas for figuring out the areas of triangles if you know the sides.

00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:10.918
I always forget them, but I do remember the law of cosines.

00:12:10.918 --> 00:12:15.980
It helps me derive those formulas.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:22.876
Area of a triangle is 1/2 base * height,

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:27.079
so if we could figure out this height,

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:31.421
we could multiply 1/2 and 14, or multiply it by 7 and

00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:34.718
then we would be able to figure out the area of this entire triangle.

00:12:34.718 --> 00:12:36.506
How can we do that?

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:44.421
Let's just break out a little trigonometry.

00:12:44.421 --> 00:12:48.372
Let's take this to be theta over here.

00:12:48.372 --> 00:12:50.926
The law of cosines tells us that

00:12:50.926 --> 00:12:55.732
the opposite side of the angle squared, so 15 squared

00:12:55.732 --> 00:12:59.773
is equal to the sum of the other sides squared

00:12:59.773 --> 00:13:02.327
(13 squared + 14 squared)

00:13:02.327 --> 00:13:07.598
minus 2 times the product of these two sides

00:13:07.598 --> 00:13:10.467
so times 13 times 14

00:13:10.467 --> 00:13:15.957
times the cosine of theta

00:13:15.957 --> 00:13:18.650
Now, what is the cosine of theta?

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:22.528
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:13:22.528 --> 00:13:26.568
so that's this side over our hypotenuse.

00:13:26.568 --> 00:13:36.181
So let's just call this length over here x.

00:13:36.181 --> 00:13:41.545
So cosine of theta is x over 13.

00:13:41.545 --> 00:13:45.911
So if you could solve for x you could then solve for h using the Pythogorean Theorem

00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:52.203
These two characters cancel out, and we are left with

00:13:52.203 --> 00:13:56.708
15 squared is 225, 13 squared is 169

00:13:56.708 --> 00:14:07.203
14 squared -- we have 140 + 40 + 16 = 196

00:14:07.203 --> 00:14:16.840
minus 28 x

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.227
So let's solve for x.

00:14:22.227 --> 00:14:28.960
We'll do a couple of things. We'll subtract 225 from both sides

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:36.878
and I'm going to add 28x to both sides

00:14:36.878 --> 00:14:43.357
On the left hand side we are left with 28 x is equal to

00:14:43.357 --> 00:14:44.703
and we have to do a little bit of math

00:14:44.703 --> 00:15:00.145
[does arithmetic aloud] 365. Did I do that right?

00:15:00.145 --> 00:15:07.204
And from that we want to subtract 225

00:15:07.204 --> 00:15:10.663
It is going to be 140

00:15:10.663 --> 00:15:19.208
so x is going to be 140 divided by 28

00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:25.060
Let's think about it. It goes 5 times. 5 times 20 is 100,

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.659
5 times 8 is 40, so 5 times 28 is 140

00:15:28.659 --> 00:15:33.860
So x in this situation is equal to 5.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.900
So we can use that information to figure out this height.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.969
We know from the pythagorean theorem that

00:15:38.969 --> 00:15:41.221
5 squared plus h squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared.

00:15:41.221 --> 00:15:47.235
It's equal to 169

00:15:47.235 --> 00:15:53.365
or h squared = 169 -25 = 144.

00:15:53.365 --> 00:15:58.032
h is equal to 12

00:15:58.032 --> 00:16:00.865
Now we can figure out the area of the triangle.

00:16:00.865 --> 00:16:06.438
The area sometimes denoted by brackets [ABC] is equal to

00:16:06.438 --> 00:16:13.311
1/2 times 14 times 12

00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:19.302
which is the same as 7 times 12, which is equal to 84

00:16:19.302 --> 00:16:26.802
That's just the area of these 9 congruent triangles.

00:16:26.802 --> 00:16:34.302
We know that the area of the whole thing will be 12/9 of that

00:16:34.302 --> 00:16:50.811
So the area of the star is going to be equal to 12/9 times 84

00:16:50.811 --> 00:17:02.050
12/9, dividing numerator and denominator by 3 is the same as 4/3

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.694
3 does go into 84. How many times? Is it 28?

00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:15.517
Let me make sure. 2*3 = 6, so yup, 28 times.

00:17:15.517 --> 00:17:19.418
So this is equal to 4 times 28

00:17:19.418 --> 00:17:23.598
Which is going to be 80 plus 32

00:17:23.598 --> 00:17:28.079
which is equal to 112.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:32.282
Let me make sure I did that right

00:17:32.282 --> 00:17:37.553
4 times 20 is 80 plus 32 is 112.

00:17:37.553 --> 99:59:59.999
And we are done!
