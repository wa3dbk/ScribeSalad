00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.240
I think a little bit of a review
is in order now and

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.880
maybe just taking a little bit
of a step back to say well,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.210
why does a company even
raise equity?

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.330
And why do the people who buy
the equity even do it in the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.370
first place?

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.950
So the whole idea of what we
were doing in the last several

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:23.180
videos is that a company wants
to raise money to start a

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.790
website, or build a factory, or
do whatever else-- kind of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.770
invest in the world and in its
kind of productive capacity,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.040
so it can build the
things that the

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.380
company is meant to build.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.665
And in every example so far--
we have the example where me

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:37.300
and my buddies, we have
just a business

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.730
plan, that's the asset.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.310
And then we own all
the equity.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.540
We're the board of directors
initially.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.145
So that's all the equity.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:50.570
So let's call this the
assets right now.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.040
This is the equity.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.700
And we could go to a venture
capitalist-- it could have

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.760
been an angel investor.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.340
It could have been-- we
talked about Series A,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.110
Series B, all of that.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.820
And we could say OK, we need
to raise x million dollars.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.430
What percentage of your company
do we have to give

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.010
away for that?

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.520
And it'll say OK, well we'll
value what you have right

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.240
now-- I'll do a different number
than what I did in the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.260
past-- we'll value what you have
right now as $1 million.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.870
And so, if you need another $2
million-- so let's say we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.700
value what you have right
now as $1 million.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.230
Let's say right now you have
one million shares.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.740
So the company's pre-money
valuation is $1 million.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.000
So you are essentially saying
that the company right now is

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.820
worth a dollar per share.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.670
There's $1 million worth of
assets, and there's a million

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.530
shares, so a million divided by
a million is $1 per share.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.250
So they're valuing it
at $1 per share.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.890
And essentially they're saying
that we're willing to give

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.630
you, or we're willing to buy
more shares from you at $1.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.000
So, if we give you-- let me see,
let me do green, I'll do

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.300
a different color, I'll do
purple-- we'll give you-- draw

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.130
the box-- we'll give you, I
don't know, $2 million.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.820
And since we're buying it at
$1 per share, we get two

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.070
million shares for that.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.010
And now all of this
is the equity.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.270
This is what the founders had,
and this is all the equity.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.330
And so now the company has
what we say was worth a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.870
million dollars.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.260
And this is kind of an arbitrary
thing, and we'll

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.370
talk more about how you can
actually value these

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.230
intangible assets and things.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.410
But now they had that, and now
they have another $2 million.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.770
So the post-money valuation--
pre-money was $1 million--

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.180
post-money is now $2 million.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.560
And now, we had one million
shares, now we have three

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.970
million shares.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.050
So essentially, for giving
$2 million, these venture

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.900
capitalists, or whoever-- so
these shares go to some VC or

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.060
angel investor-- they have
now 2/3 of the company.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.580
They have two out of three
million shares, or 66% of the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.400
company for giving
the $2 million.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.850
So that was kind of a private
raise of capital.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.040
And so you've probably heard the
words private company and

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.330
public company.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.860
A private company is one whose
shares are not traded on a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.040
public exchange.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.480
So if this company wants to
raise money by selling equity,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.920
the only place it can do it is
to venture capitalists or to

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.810
private equity firms. And we'll
talk a little bit more

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.250
about kind of the difference.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.450
A venture capitalist really is
a private equity firm because

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.590
it's buying private equity.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.760
But private equity tends to
invest in more established

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.930
business, when people
just talk about

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.990
private equity by itself.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.360
But we'll do several
videos on that.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.680
So this is, essentially, this
company is a private company

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.480
raising private equity.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.290
Now, the example we did in the
last video is, let's say this

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.500
company grows to
a certain size.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.640
Let me just do another company
so it's clean.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.010
Let's say I have another
company, these are its assets.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.920
And this is its-- let
me draw its current

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.530
equity base right there.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.060
They should be the same size,
but you get the idea-- and

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.390
these assets, it could
be it has some cash.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.020
It has some factories or land.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.190
It could have a bunch
of stuff.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.370
It could have some technology,
or we could have some

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.460
intellectual property.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.120
Maybe it's a drug company,
or maybe it's

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.950
a technology company.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.190
It has a bunch of patents
and stuff.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.310
And then it has some
intangibles-- a brand-- who

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.110
knows what it has.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.730
These are the assets
of the firm.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.990
This is the equity
of the firm.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.529
So this company right
now has no debt.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.790
And we'll talk about that
in a second, what it

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.110
means to have debt.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.040
And this is its current
shareholder base, maybe some

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.160
of these are some VCs who
invested in the company when

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.900
it was private.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.370
Maybe the founder has
these shares.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.600
But this is the equity
base right here.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.460
And let's say this company wants
to raise a lot of money,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.690
and as just kind of a review of
the last video, it can do

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.980
an initial public offering.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.850
So right now it's private.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.380
All of these shares right now
that are owned by the VCs and

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.110
the initial founders of the
company, they are not traded

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.020
on a public exchange.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.240
This VC can't go to the NASDAQ
and sell their shares.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.390
They can't go to the broker and
say hey, sell my million

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.130
shares I have in Company X.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.040
They have to just sit on them.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.510
Maybe they can find another
private equity investor to buy

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.940
their shares, or maybe these
founders-- there's no

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.700
liquidity here.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.110
There's no other person they
can sell the shares to.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.440
And also, if this company wants
to raise money right now

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.880
it has to kind of go to a VC and
do the whole process where

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.770
you negotiate what this
value is-- what the

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.800
pre-money value is.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.250
And they have to come up with
all these legal documents, and

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.280
all of these stipulations
around, we'll give you this

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.200
money, but if this happens, then
you have to give us this

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.880
interest rate.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.650
And just all these
type of things.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.140
So, what they might want
to say is, we need to

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.560
raise a lot of money.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.600
All of these guys want a way
for them to be able to sell

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.470
their shares easily
if they need to.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.070
And this company says well, we
need to raise a ton of money.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.130
Let's say we want to
raise $100 million.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.890
And that's hard to raise from
just any one individual

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.070
investor, even if they are
a big institution.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.050
So they'll do an initial public
offering, and that

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.100
really just means and-- the IPO,
and this is review of the

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.050
last one-- is that for the first
time this company is

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.110
going to register its shares
with the SEC, and because it

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.880
does, it's going to list its
shares on an exchange.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.930
It will get a ticker symbol,
it will maybe be company--

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.740
this'll be its ticker, T-I-C-K,
or in the last video

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.400
could be SOCKS, because it's
going to sell socks.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.620
And then people can trade these
shares on that exchange.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.650
It could be on the NASDAQ
or something.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.500
And I think some of you all have
had experience doing that

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.520
where you go on your Charles
Schwab account and you say I'm

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.580
going to sell SOCK.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.425
Well, that company that you're
selling, at some point, did an

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:35.590
initial public offering, and
registered with the SEC, and

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.110
got listed on an exchange.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.590
And the way it really works
is, it's fundamentally the

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.760
same as when you raise
money from a VC.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.060
But now, instead of raising
money from a VC, all the money

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.160
comes from, essentially,
the public.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.670
It goes through these banks
and brokerages, but it's

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.400
coming from a bunch of
small-- I'm just

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.710
divvying it up right here.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.520
It could be coming
from millions

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.730
and millions of people.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.740
But the same process
kind of holds.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.190
In order to see what price these
shares are bought at,

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.760
someone has to say well, what is
the company worth before it

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.330
gets the money?

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.370
What is the company worth before
it gets this money?

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.740
Kind of a pre-money valuation.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.280
That still has to happen,
and that's what the

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.265
investment bank does.

00:07:17.265 --> 00:07:19.905
The investment bank will
essentially do a model and

00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:22.680
they'll say oh, this is worth--
the company beforehand

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.250
was worth $50 million.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.440
They'll kind of go out into the
market to say well, our--

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.820
and let's say the company
right now has

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.830
five million shares.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.180
So that this piece right
here is five million.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.232
So if the banks value the
company at $50 million, and it

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:43.330
has five million shares, they'll
say OK, right now, the

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.070
pre-money valuation
is $10 a share.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.180
And the bank will
go out there.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.990
It'll kind of gauge interest
and say well, does it seem

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.070
like the market's willing
to pay $10 a share for a

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.730
company like this?

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:59.010
Or give this company a $50
million pre-money valuation?

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.880
And if so, they'll move
forth with the IPO.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.640
And, hopefully, the market
actually wants to

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.660
not pay $10 per share.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.720
The market maybe wants
to pay $20 a share.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.540
So all of these guys, let's say
they'll pay $10 a share,

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:18.420
so let's say that they sell 10
million shares at $10 a share.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.670
So the company is able to
raise $100 million.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.330
10 times $10, $100 million.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.590
Then they can do big ads
and all of that.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.880
And what the bank hopes is by
selling these shares at $10 a

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:38.940
share-- so let's say this is
days, and this is price.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.200
Let me change colors-- so what
the investment bank wants to

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.050
hope is that, on day one, you
sell it at $10 a share, and

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.100
then the price moves up.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.210
That the demand was actually
to sell it for much more.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.080
And there's a bit of a balancing
act, because if they

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.980
sell for too little, then the
company won't get as much

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.140
money as it deserves.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.580
But if they sell for too much,
then the stock price goes

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.310
down, then you kind
of have a stigma

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.060
associated with the IPO.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.800
But anyway, this begs the
question of sure, I understand

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.090
why the company is
selling shares.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:04.720
It needs money.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.210
It needs to operate.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.850
It needs to build factories
or put out

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.710
advertising, and all that.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.630
But why are people buying
shares to begin with?

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.340
Why do people buy shares
in the stock market?

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.420
And frankly, there's
two answers.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.740
And one is kind of the obvious
one, because they think the

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.940
shares will go up.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.150
But to some degree, that's
speculation.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.980
If I'm buying a share at $10,
just because I'm hoping that

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.100
there's some other dude out
there who, maybe a few weeks

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.070
later, is going to pay $15,
I'm just speculating.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.880
I'm just saying oh, IPOs
go up so let me buy it.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.500
But, economically, why
was this even worth

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.430
$10 to begin with?

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.250
How do we even think about that
valuation, at a very even

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.270
high level, why is this
even worth $10 a

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.670
share to begin with?

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.490
And the idea is that these
assets-- assets are nothing

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.640
but claims on future
benefits, right?

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.180
A house is an asset because you
get the future benefit of

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.380
getting to live in it, right?

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.310
Or the future benefit of
not having to pay rent.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.510
So, the future benefit of these
is, they'll hopefully,

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.850
at some point in the future,
generate an income stream.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.650
And even more, they'll
generate cash.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.510
And at some point in the future,
and a lot of companies

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.010
don't do it right now,
they'll actually

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.140
dividend out that cash.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:17.210
So there's a couple of things
that will make this equity

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.420
have kind of an economic-- it'll
ground it economically.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.650
And it could be these assets
starting to pump out cash, and

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.030
then each of the shareholders
will get a dividend.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.870
A dividend is just cash that is
given to the shareholders.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.710
So let's say that this is a
stock certificate in SOCK.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.010
So at some point when the assets
of this company start

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.380
generating cash, each of the
shareholders might be getting

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.590
a dividend.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.570
Or maybe a large company, at
some future date, says wow,

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.270
this is an awesome technology.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.900
It'll complement what we
already have. And maybe

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.850
they'll buy out the company.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.650
Maybe they'll pay $300 million
for this company.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.350
And then, essentially, they're
paying $300 million-- and

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.880
there's, what, fifteen
million shares?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.390
So they're paying $20 a share.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.820
So those are the economic kind
of grounding points that why

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.170
these shares even
have a value.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.940
And I'll go into a lot more
detail, I'll do a whole

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.770
playlist on how do you even
think about whether this is

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.960
worth $50 million, or is it
worth $5 million, or is it

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.940
worth $500 million.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.620
And it's kind of an art, more
than a science, because you're

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.730
going to make tons of
assumptions in terms of how

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.490
fast the company grows, what's
the risk free rate of return

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.330
that you could get
on other assets?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.380
Essentially, where else you
could you put your money?

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.210
When does the company dividend
out its-- there's so many

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.810
assumptions, so it's
more of an art.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.670
So it's really kind of you try
to get a handle on things.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.450
But there's no real
right answer.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.190
The real right answer is kind
of what someone's willing to

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.320
pay for it.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.240
But anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
