00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.090
I've talked a lot about the
general idea that in order to

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.010
have a state variable like,
say, U, which is internal

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.440
energy, at any point in this
PV diagram, that state

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.710
variable should be that value.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.660
So for example, if at this
point, U is equal to 5, and I

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.630
go do this whole Carnot cycle,
when I come back to state A, U

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.630
should still be equal to 5.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.990
It should not have changed.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.770
It's not dependent upon what
we did to get there.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.530
So if we did some kind of crazy
path on our PV diagram,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.990
we got back there, U should
always be the same.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.760
That's what it means to
be a state variable.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.000
It's only dependent upon its
position in this PV diagram.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.960
It's only dependent on its
state, not how you got there.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.850
And because of that, heat is
something that we can't really

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.110
use as a state variable.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.100
For example, if I tried to
define some heat-related state

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.980
variable, let's say I call it
heat content, and I defined

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.230
change in heat content as equal
to the amount of heat

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.160
added to the system.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.470
Well, if we go back to our
Carnot cycle here, let's say

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.850
that my heat content
here was 10.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.510
Well, I added some heat here,
in this process here.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.470
Nothing happened, because this
was adiabatic from B to C.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.030
Then from C to D, I took
out some heat.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.990
But I took out less heated
than was added here.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140
And then here, nothing was
done with regard to heat.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.780
So I did add some heat
to the system.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.500
The net heat that I added to
the system as I went around

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.610
the cycle-- in this case, Q
would be equal to Q1 minus Q2.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.930
And we know that this number
is larger than this.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.730
The net amount of heat we added
to the system was the

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.740
amount of work we did on the
system, because the internal

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.260
energy didn't change.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.540
So if this is 0, then the amount
of heat we add to the

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.480
system is the amount
of work we did.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.520
Our internal energy is
definitely 0 as we go all the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.680
way around.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.710
We did this shaded portion of
work-- I showed you that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.850
several videos ago, that the
area inside of our little

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.570
cycle is the amount
of work we did.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.390
And so that's also the
net amount of heat

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.960
added to the system.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.720
So if we added that amount of
heat to the system, if we

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.680
started off at the heat of 10
here, or whatever my heat

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.870
content mystical variable I made
up just now, when we go

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.705
around, it would then
be 10 plus W.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:19.500
If we go around again,
it would be 10 plus

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.990
2W and 10 plus 3W.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.370
So it can't be a legitimate
state variable, because it's

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.330
completely dependent on what
we did to get there.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.350
And if we keep going around the
cycle, we can increase it,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.350
even though we get to
the same point.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.740
So this is an illegitimate state
variable, where I define

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.310
the change in our little made up
heat content to be equal to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.460
the heat added to system.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.280
Not a valid state variable.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.750
Ignore it all.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.030
Now we know that Q1, we added
more heat here than we took

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.680
away, so there was something
net heat added.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.930
But there's something
interesting here.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.980
We added it at a higher
temperature.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.660
And here we took less heat away
at a lower temperature.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.340
So maybe we can define another
state variable that can have

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.230
the result that when we go
around the cycle, we do get

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.085
back to our same value.

00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:10.620
Now let me just-- we're
just experimenting.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.410
Although I know where this
experiment will go.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.540
I wouldn't have been doing
it if I didn't.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.900
So let's say I define a
new state variable S.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.460
And I define a change in S.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.330
So I say, a change in S-- I'm
just making up a definition--

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.140
is equal to the heat added to
the system divided by the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.310
temperature at which it was
added to the system.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.140
Now, I don't know what
this means just yet.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.160
In future videos, maybe we'll
get intuition about what this

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.140
actually means in kind
of our minds.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.730
But let's see if at least this
is a valid state variable.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.980
If, as we go around the Carnot
cycle, whether our change in

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.230
delta S is 0, right?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.430
To be a legitimate state
variable, we have some value

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.130
for S here.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.160
Maybe it's 100.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.520
I don't know.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.920
Once we go back around the
Carnot cycle, it should be 100

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.290
again, or our delta
S should be 0.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.000
So what's the delta S?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.580
So the delta S, as we go around
the whole cycle-- let

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.860
me write delta S-- let
me do another color.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.400
Delta S.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.935
As we are go around, I'll say
c for the Carnot cycle.

00:04:15.935 --> 00:04:19.220
As we go around the Carnot
cycle, is going to be equal

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.190
to-- well, when we went from A
to B, we were at a constant

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.410
temperature, and we added Q1.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.230
So it's Q1, and we were
at temperature T1.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.330
Fair enough.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.150
Then when we went from B
to C, it was adiabatic.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.860
We added or took away no heat.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.580
So this value, Q over
T, would just be 0.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.780
So it's plus 0.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.420
Then we went from C to D.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.000
We were at a new temperature,
we were on a new isotherm.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.840
We were at T2.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.490
And we took away, or I won't put
the sign here, let's just

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.150
say we added Q2 heat.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.240
We're going to actually
solve for it later.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.300
We added Q2 heat.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.260
We'lll see that it's actually
a negative value.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.000
And then finally, when we
went from D to A, it

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.170
was adiabatic again.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.150
So no transfer of heat.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.730
So plus 0, right?

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.730
The 0's are 0's over, you know,
changing temperature,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.270
but this is just 0.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.460
So this thing should be equal to
0 in order for this to be a

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.260
valid state variable.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.510
So let's figure out what
this value is.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.230
What Q1-- so our change in our
mystical new candidate state

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.810
variable, S, as we go around the
Carnot cycle, is equal to

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.240
Q1 over T1, plus Q2 over T2.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.770
And we'll see, Q2 is negative.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.770
So what is Q1?

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.890
Can we calculate Q1?

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.200
Well, as we're on this top
isotherm, our temperature

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.080
doesn't change, our internal
energy doesn't change.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.060
So if your internal energy
does not change, if your

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.820
internal energy is 0, then the
heat added to the system is

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.670
equal to the work done
by the system.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.300
So its the area under
this curve.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.240
Not just the area
in the cycle.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.570
It would be the whole area
under the curve.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.280
So what's the whole area
under the curve?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.930
Well, so let me do a
little aside here.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.240
So Q1 is equal to the work done
as we went from A to B.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.500
And work, remember, can just be
written as pressure times

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.820
change in volume.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.710
We're going to do a little
calculus here, so I'll write

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.605
dV for a small change
in volume.

00:06:33.295 --> 00:06:35.130
And we're going to integrate
it all over the

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.230
little sums, right?

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.220
This dV is this little
change in volume

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.380
right there times pressure.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.710
That makes a little rectangle.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:49.110
And then we sum up all the
rectangles from our initial

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:56.000
volume, which is VA, to our
final volume, which is VB.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.780
And then, what's Q2 going
to be equal to?

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.210
Well, Q2 is going to be
essentially the same thing.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.540
It's going to be the sum of the
work done by our system,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.880
which in this case is going to
be negative, because work was

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.090
done to our system as we
go from here to here.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.430
Right?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.640
That's when Q2 was operating,
the heat was being taken out

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.560
of the system.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.770
So we're going to go from--
where was our starting point?

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.250
VC and we go to VD.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.550
Now, how can we evaluate
these integrals?

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.050
Well, we've done this before
in a previous video.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.250
We use both of these
circumstances-- When we go to

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.140
A to B, and we go from C
to D-- both of these

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.470
circumstances occur on
isotherms, right?

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.000
So the only things that
are changing are

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.060
pressure and volume.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.210
Temperature is not changing.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:55.510
And so if we go back to our
ideal gas equation-- PV is

00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:00.110
equal to nRT-- we can just
rewrite this by dividing both

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:06.940
sides by V, as P is equal
to nRT over V.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.620
And substitute that back in
for P, in both cases.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.410
That is P as a function of V.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.740
We now have the equation
of the curve.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.630
And we're taking the area
under it in both cases.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:24.620
So Q1 is equal to the integral
from VA to VB

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:30.120
of nRT over V, dv.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:40.210
And Q2 is equal to the integral
from VC to VD of nRT

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:46.190
over V, dv I'm going to do two
integrals in parallel, just so

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.280
that you kind of see that we're
essentially solving the

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.640
same thing.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.040
OK.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.900
So how can we solve this?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.520
Well, we know in both of
these cases, we're

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.910
moving along an isotherm.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.320
That our temperatures
are constant.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.470
And actually, we know the
temperatures are.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.820
When we're moving from VA to
VB, our temperature is T1.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.140
It was kept that way
by our reservoir.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.340
When we moved from VC to VD,
our temperature was T2.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.330
It was kept that way by
our reservoir, right?

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.280
T2, when we move from C to D.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.830
And T1, we move from A to B
Those were our temperatures.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.570
And they're constant.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.340
Fair enough.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.320
So we can take-- so
n is constant.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.380
R is definitely a constant.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.810
n is just a number of molecules
we have. And then

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.520
our temperature is also
constant, so we can take it

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.890
out of the integral.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:37.640
So we can rewrite Q1 is equal to
nRT1 over the integral from

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:49.430
VA to VB times 1/V dv, and Q2 we
can write as nRT2 times the

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:56.000
integral from VC
to VD, 1/V dv.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.560
All right.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.900
Now this integral is fairly
straightforward to evaluate.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.660
The antiderivative of 1/V
is the natural log of V.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:11.470
So we get Q1 is equal to nRT1
times the natural log of V

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:16.050
evaluated at VB, minus
it evaluated at VA.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.650
And Q2-- well, let me just
solve this whole equation

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.580
right here.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.320
So this is equal to what?

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.710
This is equal to a natural
log of VB minus the

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.160
natural log of VA.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:33.390
Which is the same thing as the
natural log of VB over VA

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.590
times nRT1.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.850
And all that is equal to Q2.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.690
Now, the same logic, Q2, is
going to be equal to what?

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:48.220
Q2 is going to be
equal to nRT2.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.090
Now the only difference with
this integral is where I had

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.440
VB, now I have VD.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.960
Sorry.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.790
So then it becomes natural
log of VD.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.300
And where I had VA, now
I have VC, So over VC.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.290
All right.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.870
Now what was our original
question that we

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:05.730
were dealing with?

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.020
We said, this is a legitimate
state variable.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.510
If the change in this-- whatever
this value S as we go

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.350
around the cycle-- is
equal to 0, that

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.690
means it didn't change.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.400
So these two things, when you
sum them, have to equal 0.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.800
Q1 over T1, plus Q2 over T2.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.860
So let's add them.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:29.820
So Q1 over T1 is equal
to that over T1.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.150
That cancels out.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.110
Q2 over T2 is equal
to that over T2.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.730
That cancels out.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.360
So our change in our mystical
state variable, as we go

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.340
around the Carnot cycle,
is equal to Q1 over T1,

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.730
plus Q2 over T2.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:56.770
Which is equal to nR times the
natural log of VB over VA.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.760
That's that, right there.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:06.070
And then plus Q2 over T2, which
is just nR times the

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:15.120
natural log of VD over V.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.310
This is VC.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.460
This is a VA here.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.360
All right.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.140
Now let's see what we can do.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.570
This is equal to--
almost there.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.720
Home stretch.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.820
nR.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.930
We can factor out an nR.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:30.130
And then the natural log of A
plus the natural log of B is

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.080
just the same thing as the
natural log of AB.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:40.590
So this is equal to times the
natural log of VB over VA,

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:45.620
times VD over VC.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.440
All right.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.280
So this is our change in our
S, state verbal that we're

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.660
playing with right now.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.910
Now what is this equal to?

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.030
Let me think of the best
way to say this.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.030
So let's divide the numerator
and the denominator by VC.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:10.420
So let me take this expression
here, and divide its numerator

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.590
and its denominator,
essentially, by VC over VD.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.260
Or let me multiply
its numerator and

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.720
denominator VC over VD.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:24.260
So I can rewrite this as the
natural log of VB over VA,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.000
divided by-- right?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.330
Instead of multiplying it times
this, I can divide it by

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.500
this reciprocal, VC over VD.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.980
So I just rewrote it.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.030
I just did a little bit
of fraction math.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.590
That's all it is.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.690
Instead of multiplying it times
this, I divided by its

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.030
reciprocal.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:47.530
Now you see why the previous
video I did was done.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.610
What is this equal to?

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:54.230
On the previous video, I showed
you that VB over VA is

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.340
equal to VC over VD.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.630
We did that big convoluted hairy
proof to prove this.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.190
And now that we proved it, we
can use this to know that this

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.270
quantity is equal to
this quantity.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.920
So if you divide something by
itself, they're equal to each

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.770
other, this is equal to 1.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.570
If that's equal to 1, then
what's the natural log of 1?

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:20.780
So our change in our mystical
S state variable is nR times

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.280
the natural log of 1.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.200
What's the natural log of 1?

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.210
E to the what power
is equal to 1?

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.690
e to the 0 is equal to 1.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.760
n times R times 0-- I don't
care how big or

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.220
whatever-- this is 0.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.990
So it equals 0.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.960
So there we have it.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.260
We've stumbled upon a legitimate
state variable that

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.770
deals with heat.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:49.600
If we define change in S is
equal to the heat added to the

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.810
system, divided by the
temperature at which the heat

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.890
was added to the system,
this is a

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.100
legitimate state variable.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.350
Now, we don't have much
intuition about what it really

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.860
means at kind of a micro
state level.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.230
But at least we've
stumbled upon

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.210
some property of something.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.530
If S is 10 here, and we go
around here, our change in S

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.750
will be 0, S is 10 again.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.270
If S is, I don't know, let's
say S is 15 here, and we go

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.170
around some crazy cycle and we
come back here, our change in

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.860
S is going to be 0 again.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.420
Or sorry, it's going
to be 15 again.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.750
So we didn't have-- our change
in S will be 0, so our s

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.470
itself will be 15 again.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.410
So S is a legitimate state
variable, but we don't have a

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.795
good sense of what it
actually means.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.290
We'll leave that to
a future video.
