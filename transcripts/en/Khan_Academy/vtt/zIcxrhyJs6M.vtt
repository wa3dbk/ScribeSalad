00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.830
Our question asks us, how many
toothpicks will be needed to

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.780
form the 50th figure
in this sequence?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.010
So let's look at
this sequence.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.500
So the first figure in our
sequence-- they look like

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.470
little houses-- how many
toothpicks are here?

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.600
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six toothpicks.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.550
So our first object here, or
our first figure, has six

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.660
toothpicks.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.640
How many do we have in
our second figure?

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.350
Well we're going to have
these six that we had

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.320
in the first, right?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.850
This is the first figure,
right here.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.580
Let me just trace it.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.820
That's the first figure,
right there.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.290
And then how many
new toothpicks

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.380
are we going to have?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.410
We have one, two, three,
four, five.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.830
So we have six plus
another five.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.930
So we have the six in the
original one, plus another

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.670
five, which is equal
to 11 toothpicks.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.440
Now what happens in this third
object, or this third little

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.430
toothpick house looking
drawing thing?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.280
So we have our figure
from the two houses.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.690
So we have those right there.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.630
This is the exact same
thing that we had

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.450
as our second object.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.660
So that's that right there.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.850
And how many more do we have?

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.840
Well it's going to be
the same thing.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.340
We've just added on this other
extension to our house.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.630
You can view it that way.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.060
So we have one, two,
three, four, five.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.810
So it looks like every time we
go down this sequence, or we

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.870
add a new term to the sequence,
or a new object to

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.420
the sequence, we're adding
five toothpicks.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.500
So here, we're going
to have 11 plus 5.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.780
There's 11 toothpicks in this
part of it, and then we

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.420
have another 5.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.680
11 plus 5, which is 16.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.970
Same thing over here.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.840
We have 16 in this part
of the drawing.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.320
That part of the drawing is
going to be 16 toothpicks, if

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.920
you draw all of that.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.680
And then we're going to have
another five right here.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.960
So this is going to be
16 plus 5 or 21.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.340
So how can we figure out how
many toothpicks we're going to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.840
have in the 50th figure?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.840
I mean, we could draw 50 of
them, but it's going to take

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.720
us forever.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.440
So all we have to do is
realize the pattern.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.780
Every one, we're just
going to add 5.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.180
Or, we could even come up with
a formula for the nth figure.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.940
How many toothpicks
in the nth figure?

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.020
So here, in the first figure,
we have-- you could view it

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.140
this way-- in this first figure,
we have 1 plus 5

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.730
toothpicks.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.010
Right?

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.170
We have this 1.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.980
You could imagine that was
always there, and then you

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.140
added 5 right there.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.860
So that's our first term
in our sequence.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.600
Our second term in our sequence,
what do we have?

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.090
We have 6, which is 1 plus 5.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.160
So we have that 1 plus
5, plus another 5.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.510
Plus this 5 right here,
plus another 5.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.810
And then our third term in our
sequence, what do we have?

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.540
We have all of this business
that we had

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.880
in the second term.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.355
So 1 plus 5 plus 5, and then
we have another 5.

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:01.410
Let me do it in green.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.390
We have another 5.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.630
And then, finally, in this
fourth term, what do we have?

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.270
We have-- so the fourth one-- we
have everything that we had

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.840
in the third figure, so 1
plus 5 plus 5 plus 5.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.700
And then we add another 5.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.460
We add a fourth 5.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.930
We add a fourth 5 right there.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.420
So why did I do it this way?

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.060
Because I wrote this first one
as 1 plus 5 instead of just a

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.220
6 because you could say, well
look, I had a 1, and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.280
then I had one 5.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.780
Now I have a 1, and
I have two 5's.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.630
Now I have a 1 and
I have three 5's.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.850
Now I have a 1 and
I have four 5's.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.020
So you might see the pattern.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.790
If I had the nth term, if I had
the nth term right here, I

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.400
will have a 1 plus
n 5's, right?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.620
The first term has one 5.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.780
The second term has two 5's.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.060
Third term has three 5's.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.900
Fourth term has four 5's.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.730
So the nth term, if this is, you
know, if this is 10, it's

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.690
going to be 1 plus 10 5's.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.970
Or if it's n, if I'm kind of
abstracting a little bit, I'm

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.730
going to have 1 plus
10-- sorry-- 1

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.660
plus 5 times n, right?

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.420
And try it out.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.010
If n is equal 1, it's going
to be 5 times 1.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.260
If n is equal to 2, it's
going to be 5 times 2.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.350
If n is equal to 3, it's
going to be 5 times 3.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.520
So that when the 50th term, if
we're talking about the 50th

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.890
term, how many toothpicks
are we going to have?

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.930
Well we're going to have 1 plus
5 times 50, right? n is

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.690
50 here, which is
equal to what?

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.240
5 times 50 is 250.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.390
That's 250 and then we add 1,
we're going to have 251

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.390
toothpicks will be needed
to form the 50th

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.300
figure in this sequence.
