00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
In this video, we're going to
a couple of warm-up solving

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.750
equations problems. And you'll
see these require several

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.855
steps, maybe a little bit more
than the ones that we've done

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:09.710
in the previous video.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.110
And then we'll do a word problem
that applies our

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.030
equation-solving capabilities.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.640
So here we have 7 times w plus
20, minus w, is equal to 5.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.220
Let's see if we can
solve this.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.870
And like all things, there's
multiple ways to solve these.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.210
I'll just solve the way that
seems most natural to me.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.890
So one thing I like to do, is
I like to distribute the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.610
numbers out.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.950
Because if I distribute the
numbers out, I get a 7w, and

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.710
then I can subtract
w from there.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.110
So maybe I can merge the
w terms somehow.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.620
So this 7w plus 20 I can rewrite
as 7w plus 7 times 20.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.080
Remember, distributive
properties.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.140
So plus 140.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.560
And then we have this minus
w is equal to 5.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.070
I just rewrote this
part right here.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.970
I just distributed the 7.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.430
And now, just like I talked
about, we can merge-- We can

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.030
take 7w, and from that,
we can subtract a w.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.940
So if you take those two
terms, you get 6w.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.640
If I have 7 of something, and
I take away 1 of that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.770
something, I have 6
of that something.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.530
So I have 6w plus 140
is equal to 5.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.470
Now, I want get rid
of this 140.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.070
Because then I'll have 6w is
equaling to something, and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920
I'll be able divide by
6, and all of that.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.770
So to get rid of 140, I can
subtract 140 from both sides

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.030
of the equation.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.700
And I'll do it in pink.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.210
Minus 140.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.510
So I'm just subtracting
140 from both

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.150
sides of this equation.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.450
If something equals something,
something minus 140 is going

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.390
to equal something minus 140.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.130
Whatever you do to one side,
you've got to do

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.470
to the other side.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.680
So the whole point here was for
these two to cancel out.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.370
You're left with the left side,
which is 6w is equal to

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.040
5 minus 140.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.160
Well, that's negative 135.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.120
And now we can divide both sides
of this equation by 6,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.330
which is equivalent to
multiplying by 1/6, and you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.820
get w is equal to, let's see,
negative 135 over 6.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.320
Let's see, is there any place
to simplify this anymore?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.580
Let's see.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.850
This isn't divisible by 2,
and it also doesn't look

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.060
divisible by 3.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.000
So this looks like we are
done with the problem.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.030
And you can verify.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.490
Actually let's verify, because
it's kind of a

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.470
strange-looking-- Let's verify
that this is the answer.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.640
So 7 times negative 135 over
6-- that's our solution

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.700
for w --plus 20.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.810
Instead of 20, I'm going to
write plus 120 over 6.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.690
20 is the same thing as
120 over 6, right?

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.940
Minus w.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.360
So w is negative 135 over 6.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.970
So subtracting a negative
becomes

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.630
adding a positive, right?

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.880
So let's see what happens.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.450
This becomes 7 times-- Let's
see, negative 135 plus 120 is

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:32.930
negative 15 over 6
plus 135 over 6.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.700
Let's see what we get here.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.330
So then we get 7 times 15.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.260
So let me go over here.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.830
What is 7 times 15?

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.780
It's 70 plus 35.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:50.200
So it's negative 105 over 6.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.630
That is that right there.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.780
Plus 135 over 6.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.160
What does that become?

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.090
This becomes 30 over 6,
which is equal to 5.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.560
Which is exactly what it
needed to be equal to.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.930
It's equal to 5, so we
got the right answer.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.630
My spider sense was wrong.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.480
We did it correctly, even though
we got this strange

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.230
looking answer.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.900
So now let's do this problem.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.769
So once again, I like to
distribute out the 9.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.156
Actually, we don't have
to distribute it out.

00:04:20.156 --> 00:04:21.220
There's multiple ways
to do this.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.380
Maybe we'll do it both ways.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.200
So the first way I like to do it
is to distribute out the 9,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.020
so I don't have to deal
with fractions.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.040
So you get 9x minus 18. just
distributed the 9.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.770
Is equal to 3x plus 3.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.370
Now we want to get the x-terms
together somehow.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.830
Let's get them together
on the left-hand side.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.000
So let's get rid of this 3x
on the right-hand side.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.960
And the best way to get rid of
it is to subtract 3x from the

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.820
right-hand side.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.100
But if we do it from the
right-hand side, we have to do

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.650
it from the left-hand
side, as well.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.600
So I'm subtracting 3x
from both sides.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.280
The left-hand side, 9x minus 3x
is equal to 6x, and then,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.690
of course, you have your minus
18 is equal to 3x minus 3x.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.800
That just disappears, those
cancel out, and you just have

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.670
the 3 left over.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.920
Now there's multiple ways
you could do this.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.040
I mean, one fun thing-- Well,
let me just do it the most

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.040
traditional way.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.220
We could add 18 to both sides so
that the 18 disappears from

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.460
the left-hand side.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.410
So then you are left with 6x--
these two guys cancel out --is

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.800
equal to 3 plus 18,
which is 21.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.540
Divide both sides by 6, you get
x is equal to 21 over 6,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.030
or if you divide the numerator
and the denominator by 3, you

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.060
get 7 over 2.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.970
And you are done.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.180
Now, I said that there's
multiple

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.380
ways to do this problem.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.460
Let me do it another
way here in orange.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.900
So you have 9 times x minus
2 is equal to 3x plus 3.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.520
Well, I see a 9,
I see some 3's.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.600
What if I just divide both sides
of this equation by 3?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.400
So if I divide that side by 3,
and I divide all of these

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.990
terms by 3.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.200
What do I get?

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.120
This becomes 3 times x minus
2 is equal to x plus 1.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.240
Maybe at this point, if I want,
I could distribute this.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.390
So this becomes 3x minus
6 is equal to x plus 1.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.720
I could subtract x from both
sides of this equation, so I

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.560
get 2x minus 6 is equal to 1.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.570
Remember, I subtracted that
from both sides, so it

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.210
disappeared on the
right-hand side.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.210
I could add 6 to both sides
of this equation.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.350
I get 2x is equal to 1
plus 6, which is 7.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.060
Divide both sides by 2, you get
x is equal to 7 over 2.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.500
I went through this a
little bit faster.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.920
But really, I just wanted to
show you that as long as do

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.650
legitimate operations, you're
going to get the same answer.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.510
And you could check, verify
that this is indeed the

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.500
correct answer, if you like.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.150
Now we have a word problem.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.220
Let's see if we can
tackle this.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.560
Lydia inherited a
sum of money.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.460
She split it into
5 equal chunks.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.850
So let me just say m is the
amount of money she has.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.910
So she split into
5 equal chunks.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:21.670
So let me say, Lydia's money
that she inherited.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.910
She splits it into
5 equal chunks.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.350
She invested 3 parts of the
money in a high interest bank.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.490
So how much did she invest in
the high interest bank?

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.330
She divided it into 5 equal
chunks, and she invested 3 of

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.570
those chunks into a high
interest bank account.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:59.400
So she took her money, divided
it into 5 chunks-- So this is

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.320
each of the 5 chunks.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.770
Then she put 3 of those chunks,
or you could say she

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:11.450
took 3/5 of her money, and she
put it into the high interest

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.470
bank account, which adds
10% to the value.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.630
So that's how much she
originally put into high

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.500
interest banking account.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.830
She placed the rest of her
inheritance plus $500 in the

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.680
stock market.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.930
So how much was that?

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.900
So she placed the rest
of her inheritance.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.659
So she put 3/5 of it in the high
interest bank account.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.140
What's left over?

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.260
What's going to be the 2/5?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.280
2/5 of her money she is
going to invest in the

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.330
stock market, right?

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.540
You combine 3/5 plus 2/5,
you have all of the

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.070
money that she inherited.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.720
But she didn't put
just the 2/5.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.190
She put the rest of her
inheritance, which is the 2/5

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:57.890
m, plus $500, in the stock
market, but lost 20%.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.620
So this is how much she put in,
and this is how much she

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.250
ends up with.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:11.820
So put in is right there,
and then ends up with.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:18.910
So on the checking accounts,
it added 10% of its value.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:24.910
So she started with 3/5 of her
money, and it added another

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.180
10% of that.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:32.690
So plus, let's say, 0.10
times the amount of

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.010
money she put in.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.400
Times 3/5 of her money.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.570
This is how much she
ends up with.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.940
Her original amount that she put
into the account plus 10%

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.750
of the original amount.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.740
It grew by 10%.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.260
It added 10% of the value.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:52.580
Now in the stock market, she
started with 2/5 m plus 500,

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.140
but she lost 20%
on that money.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:07.760
So she loses 0.20 for 20%,
times 2/5 m plus 500.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.630
That's how much she loses
on the market.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.410
She loses 20% of this
amount of money.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.060
Now at the end it says, if the
two accounts end up with the

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.160
exact same amount of
money in them, how

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.950
much did she inherit?

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.760
So this and this are going to
end up being equal, and we'll

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.130
have to solve for m.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.100
So let's do that.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:32.010
We get 3/5 m plus-- Well, let's
see, this is the same

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.840
thing as 1/10, right?

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.010
Let me write that way.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.180
So 1/10 times 3/5 is 3/50.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:46.890
Plus 3/50 m is equal to-- I just
multiplied the 1/10 times

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:52.880
3/5 --is equal to 2/5 m-- I
want to do it in that same

00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:06.110
color, in the orange --is
equal to 2/5 m plus 500.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.520
And then 0.2 is the same
thing as 1/5, right?

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:16.070
0.2-- let me write it over here
--is equal to 20/100,

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.630
which is equal to 1/5.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.620
So we can rewrite this
right here as 1/5.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:27.200
So 2/5 m plus 500 minus
1/5 times 2/5 plus

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.380
5 2/5 m plus 500.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.220
So that's a hairy problem, but
well take it step by step and

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.850
see that it's not so bad.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.600
So right here, let's add
3/5 of something

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.620
plus 3/50 of something.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.290
Well, 3/5 is the same thing
as 30/50, right?

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.630
If I multiply the numerator
and the denominator by 10.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.630
And now we can add this.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:59.950
30/50 plus 3/50 is 33/50 m is
equal to-- and let's just

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.820
simplify this a little
bit --2/5 m plus 500.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:10.360
Distribute the negative 1/5,
so you get negative 2/25 m,

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.630
and then negative 1/5 times
500 is minus 100.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.040
Let's simplify this even more.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:25.090
The left-hand side is still 33
over 50 m is equal to-- And

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.910
now we have we have these
coefficients on our m terms,

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.440
right here.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.410
Those are our m terms.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:38.220
So you could view it as
2/5 minus 2/25 m.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.370
that takes care of that
term and that term.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.190
I just factored the m out.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.190
And then you have the
500 minus 100.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.860
So that's plus 400.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.140
Now, let's see.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.140
2/5, if we multiplied the
numerator and denominator by

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.810
5, this becomes 10/25.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.170
Right?

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:06.130
So our whole equation is now
33/50 m is equal to-- what is

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.350
10 minus 2?

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:13.560
So that's 8/25 m plus 400.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.080
We're getting close!

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.770
We're getting close.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.680
Now let's get both
m terms onto the

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.520
left-hand side of the equation.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.680
So let's subtract 8/25
m from both sides.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.110
Did that, so that the right-hand
side cancels outs.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.710
So our right-hand side
is just equal to 400.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:44.140
And then our left-hand side
is 33/50 minus 8 over 25.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.810
So it's equal to 33 over
50 minus 8 over 25.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.350
That's the same thing as minus
16 over 50, right?

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.190
I just multiply the numerator
and denominator by 2.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.580
m is equal to 400.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.535
We're almost there!

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:01.850
This is a nice, meaty problem.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.440
Almost there.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:11.290
And then 33 minus
16 is 17, right?

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:17.000
So we're left with 17/50
m is equal to 400.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.450
And now we can multiply
both sides times

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.300
the inverse of 17/50.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:28.220
So 50/17 times 50/17.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.460
These cancel out, and you get
m is equal to-- and I'll get

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.310
the calculator out for this.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:42.860
m is equal to 400 times
50 divided by

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:55.380
17 is equal to $1,176.47.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.490
That's how much Lydia
started out with.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.550
Hopefully you found that fun.
