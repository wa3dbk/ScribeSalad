00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.780
This brain teaser in this video
is once again not one

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.620
that I made up.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.370
I actually don't remember the
first time that I heard it.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.330
I think it was in the
back of a magazine.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.280
I want to say Scientific
American.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.110
And me and a bunch of
buddies, we were

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.380
traveling through Europe.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.740
And it kind of became our
pastime to do these brain

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.150
teasers in the back
of magazines.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.480
And just so you know, I think a
lot of you think that these

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.635
type of brain teasers, you can
just read them and solve them.

00:00:23.635 --> 00:00:25.650
And if you can't solve them,
then you're not good at this

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.560
type of thing.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.920
This brain teaser I'm about to
give you, I just kind of sat

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.510
and thought about it, and me
and my buddies, we argued

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.330
about it for literally
about a day.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.910
And then I just slept on it.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.060
And then first thing in the
morning, I woke up all my

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.340
friends, I was like,
I figured it out!

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250
So this isn't some kind
of easy thing.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.650
And I encourage you, just
listen to the statement,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.310
understand it, and then
pause the video.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.290
And then think about
it for 24 hours.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.670
And then come back to it.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.740
One, you'll probably
solve it yourself.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.970
And if you don't, in 24 or 48
hours, then you'll probably

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.570
find the solution that
much more satisfying.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.735
So this is the problem
of the togglers.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.170
Not toddlers.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.750
Togglers.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.780
I have an infant, so words like
toddler are in my brain.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.160
But this is the problem
of the togglers.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.750
So there are five guys
in front of you.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.280
That's one of them.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.440
Two.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.360
Three.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.380
Four.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.690
Five.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.420
They don't have to be guys.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.720
They can be of any gender.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.050
And four of them are what
we call togglers.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.900
So four of them.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.150
Four togglers.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.480
And what a toggler does is, the
first time you ask them a

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.500
question, they're either going
to tell the truth or they're

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.240
going to lie.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.000
So truth or a lie.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.660
But then the second time
that you ask them,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.480
they're going to toggle.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.180
They're going to switch.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.630
So the second time you ask them
a question, if they told

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.090
the truth the first time, then
the next time you ask that

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.900
same person a question,
they're going

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.690
to switch to lying.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.580
But if they lied the first
time you asked them a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.870
question, then they're
going to switch

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.790
to telling the truth.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.350
And then it goes on, and
so on, and so forth.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.289
So if you ask the same person
the third question, if they

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.460
told the truth the first time,
then they'll lie the second

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.450
time you ask them a question,
and then the third time

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.080
they'll tell the truth again.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.790
It's like, if I was a toggler
and you said, hey you,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.170
what is your name?

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.160
And if I said, oh
my name is Bill.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.460
Then clearly I'm lying
that first time.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.760
And then you pointed to
me again, and you say,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.280
what is your name?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.660
And I say, oh my name is Sal.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.350
And if you ask me again,
what is your name?

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.040
I would say, oh, my
name is Susan.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.390
And if you ask me again,
my name is Sal.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.510
So the first time, I just
decided to lie.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.760
But just as easily, I could've
decided to tell the truth the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.110
first time.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.670
You might have said, hey
you, what's your name?

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.470
I would have said, Sal.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.220
And then you ask me, what's
your name again?

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.170
And I would have
said Elizabeth.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.410
And then you ask me, what's
my name again?

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.820
I would say, oh,
my name is Sal.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.420
And then again, what's
your name?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.220
And I would say, you know,
George Washington

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.190
or something arbitrary.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.570
But I think you get the idea.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.590
A toggler-- I don't know
who's a toggler.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.380
Let's say that this
is a toggler.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.090
The first time you ask them a
question, they might lie, they

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.550
might tell the truth.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.290
But if they lie, the next time
you ask the same person a

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.910
question, they're going
to tell the truth.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.550
But the first time you ask them
a question, and they did

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.200
tell the truth, the next time
you ask the same person a

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.850
question, he or she
is going to lie.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.690
So that's a toggler.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.120
So you can already imagine,
this is-- I don't know.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.050
The first time that I read the
problem it kind of made my

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.580
brain hurt.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.780
This notion of a toggler.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.410
It's much easier when there's
a reality where people only

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.690
lie or only tell the truth.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.700
It's much harder when
they toggle.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.990
And not only do they toggle,
but their initial state,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.760
whether they start telling the
truth or they start off lying.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.520
You don't know.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.420
That's arbitrary.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.500
There's no way of predicting
whether this person-- First of

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.440
all, we don't know if this
person is a toggler, because I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.080
said there's only
four togglers.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.730
But even if they are toggler, I
don't even know if the first

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.280
time I ask them a question
whether they're going to tell

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.190
the truth or whether they're
going to lie.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.860
So four of them are togglers.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.790
What's the fifth?

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.940
Well, you probably could guess
because this is how these

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.270
brain teasers go.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.450
The fifth is a truth teller.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.450
And he is much simpler.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.120
Or he or she.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.680
I don't want to give any clues
on who it might be.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.110
Is a truth teller.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.379
And a truth teller always
tells the truth.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.790
So the goal of this brain teaser
is to figure out who is

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.200
the truth teller.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.870
So you want to know which of
these five people is-- So

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.230
let's say, goal.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.790
Who's truth teller?

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.760
And as you can imagine, you
don't have infinite questions

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.870
to do this with.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.160
You have exactly two questions
to do this with.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.410
And you have two questions.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.450
And those two questions, they
can be one question to this

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.890
guy and another question
to this guy.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.380
Both questions could
be to this guy.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.210
Both questions could be to
her right over there.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.380
So the questions don't have
to be to the same person,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.730
although they can be
to the same person.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.880
Or they could be to two
different people.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.330
So you have two questions.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.480
Any question to ask of any
combination of either two

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.100
questions to one person or two
questions to two people.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.670
And by the end of those two
questions, you should know for

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.570
sure who is the truth teller.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.690
And that is the brain
teaser statement.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.320
So pause it now if you don't
want any hints or the

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.660
solution, or anything else.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.190
So I encourage you to pause it
and think about it for at

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.180
least a day.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.230
And sleep on it.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.300
Because a lot of the real math
problems or logic problems

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.560
that are worth solving aren't
the ones that you can solve

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.520
right when you see them.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.120
They're the ones where you kind
of sit and let your brain

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.860
do a little background
processing while you sleep.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.840
So that said, hopefully you've
stopped it and now you've

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.220
resumed it after really
struggling with this for a

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.800
long period.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.260
Not eating and sleeping and
all the things that

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.550
normal people do.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.930
And now you're ready
for the solution.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.500
Or even better, you're ready
to confirm your solution.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.070
So first I'll give you a hint.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.720
I mean, it's a tough question.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.890
I struggled with this at first.
I was like, when you

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.710
ask someone a question
how do you know if

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.380
they're lying or not?

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.860
How do you know if they're
the truth teller?

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.610
How do you know if they're
a toggler?

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.840
You don't have any
information.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.590
So the crux of this problem is,
essentially, it doesn't

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.410
matter who you're asking
the question to

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.430
the first time around.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.320
And actually the solution is
that it doesn't matter who

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.750
you're asking the question to
the second time around.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.640
You want to ask a question so
that no matter what they say,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.650
you know what they're going to
do the second time around.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.000
You know whether they're going
to tell the truth the second

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.270
time around, or you know whether
they're going to lie

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.000
the second time around.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.980
And that's a hint.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.490
And if you just want a hint
and then to keep thinking

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.730
about it, pause it again.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.240
Because I'm about to give
you the solution.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.560
So question one.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.890
And you can pick any of the
five people to ask this

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:06.280
question to.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.900
And that's kind of the nature
of one of these solutions.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.530
There's no reason for you
to pick one of the

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.490
five over the other.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.870
They're all equally likely
to be the truth teller.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.760
So you ask them, are you
the truth teller?

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.090
So let's think about a couple
of-- Well first of all,

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.960
they're either going to answer
to this, yes or no.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.775
So there could be
two situations.

00:07:32.775 --> 00:07:35.350
They're either going to
say yes, or they're

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.160
going to say no.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.240
So if someone says yes to are
they the truth teller, it

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.750
means that either they
are the truth

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.000
teller telling the truth.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.250
Or they are a lying toggler.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.110
If they say that they are not
the truth teller, they clearly

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.330
cannot be the truth teller,
because the truth teller

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.610
cannot lie about not being
the truth teller.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.790
And so they have to
be a toggler.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.340
And they'd be an
honest toggler.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.260
They'd be a toggler who's
telling the truth.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:16.630
Right?

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:23.870
So it would be a truthful
toggler.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.180
Remember, I ask anybody, any
of these five people right

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.710
here, say, are you
the truth teller?

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.289
If they say yes, I immediately
know that they're either the

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.309
truth teller telling
the truth, or

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.070
they're a lying toggler.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.260
If they say no, I know that they
are a truthful toggler.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.210
Now, what's interesting is, in
this scenario, if they say

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.260
yes, what do I know that they're
going to do next?

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.260
So if this is the truth teller,
and they told the

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.970
truth, on the second question,
they're going to tell the

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.550
truth again.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:04.330
They're going to tell the truth
on question number two.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.740
If they're the lying toggler,
what are they going to do when

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.110
you ask them another question?

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.910
Well, they toggle.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.890
If they lie the first time you
ask them, they're going to

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.840
tell the truth the second
time you ask them.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.160
So they're going to tell the
truth on question number two.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.800
So if the person says yes to,
are you the truth teller?

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.850
You immediately know that no
matter who they are, that

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.870
they're going to tell the truth
on question number two.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.580
So if you can know for a fact
that the person's going to

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.630
tell the truth on question
number two, you ask them, who

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.190
is the truth teller?

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.230
So this is number two.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.300
Who is the truth teller?

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:42.960
So it's kind of weird.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.460
You go to someone and say,
are you the truth teller?

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.730
And they'll say yes.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.930
And then you ask them again,
who's the truth teller?

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.400
And then, because they have to
tell the truth, they will

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.020
actually either say, if it was
this case, they'd say I am the

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.820
truth teller.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.160
Or if it's this case, they'd say
no, that dude over there

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.060
is the truth teller.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.060
And then you'll know who
the truth teller is.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.310
Now what happens in
this situation?

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.160
That they're a truthful
toggler?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.800
Well on the second question,
what are they going to do?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.680
They're going to lie.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.360
They're going to lie on the
second question, right?

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.310
On question number two.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.600
So if you know for a fact that
someone's going to lie, how

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.120
can you phrase a question so
you can figure out who the

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.390
truth teller is?

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.530
Well, if they say no to this
first question, and you know

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.430
they're going to lie on the
second one, your second

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.820
question should just be, who
is not the truth teller?

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:41.590
So the only way to lie on this
question-- and this person has

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.780
to lie now-- is to tell you
who the truth teller is.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.750
And so, using the first
question, are

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:50.490
you the truth teller?

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.720
We can immediately predict what
the person's going to do

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.480
on the second question.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.310
And then we can phrase the
second question, depending on

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.290
that response, to definitely
know who the truth teller is.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.520
Anyway, I thought you'd
enjoy that.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:07.550
And hopefully you see why the
liar game show brain teaser

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.750
was a bit of a warm
up for this one.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.680
See you in the next video.
