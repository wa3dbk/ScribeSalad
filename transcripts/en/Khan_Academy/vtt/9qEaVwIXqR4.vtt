[LEBRON JAMES] What muscles do I use when I take a free throw?

00:00:04.886 --> 00:00:08.761
[SAL KHAN] Excellent question, LeBron.

00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:11.344
So you can imagine whenever you're doing anything –

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.927
whenever you stand, or even run – you're using a ton of muscles

00:00:13.927 --> 00:00:16.217
just to to keep your balance – Just to keep your body rigid.

00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:17.744
But what we're going to focus on are

00:00:17.744 --> 00:00:19.271
the muscles that are directly acting on the ball

00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:20.799
to make the ball go in that direction –

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:24.746
to make it accelerate upwards and towards the basket –

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:28.417
which you would hopefully do

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:32.493
when you are taking a free throw.

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:36.250
So, the muscles that are doing that are

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.243
the ones that help your fingers go in that direction,

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:42.236
help the palm of you hand going in that direction,

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:45.230
and help your entire forearm to go in that direction.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.672
Obviously, at the same time, there are many other muscles at work,

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.300
even the muscles that keep your entire arm

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.928
above your head like this –

00:00:50.928 --> 00:00:52.557
the muscles that keep you standing.

00:00:52.557 --> 00:00:55.638
But we're going to just focus on these muscles right over here.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:59.286
So first, the muscles that allow your fingers to go

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:02.934
in the direction that you want the ball to go, and your palm.

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:06.584
And you might be surprised to find that

00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:08.287
those muscles actually sit in the forearm.

00:01:08.287 --> 00:01:09.990
most of those muscles actually do not sit in the hand.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.695
Those muscles are actually here.

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:16.369
So the muscles in the front of your forearm right here,

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.485
they are actually all about flexing the fingers

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:22.601
and the hands in that direction.

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.208
There are a bunch of names for them.

00:01:25.208 --> 00:01:27.815
And I encourage folks to look them up.

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:29.902
But it is a really interesting thing, because we are often used to

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:31.989
muscles being directly where the motion is.

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:34.078
But in this case, these muscles, when they're in action, they contract

00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:37.678
And muscles, when they're in action do contract.

00:01:37.678 --> 00:01:41.278
So they're going to contract and they are going to pull essentially on tendons.

00:01:41.278 --> 00:01:44.880
They're going to pull the whole hand to that way.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.616
You could view as a kind of pulley

00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:52.100
So if this was... If you view your wrist joint as kind of pulley.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:03.706
And if you had a rope that is attached to another block. And that block you can view as your hand and your finger

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:10.899
So that block is your hand. These muscles right over here, they contract this way

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.210
so its ..... pulling on this rope. And were to pull on this rope, what would happen to this block up here?

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.187
Well, this block up here is going to go in that general direction.

00:02:20.187 --> 00:02:23.098
So that what's keep your hand and your fingers going in that way

00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:25.422
But what about the entire forearm?

00:02:25.422 --> 00:02:31.298
So once again. The muscles that get your entire forearm going in that direction aren't in your forearm.

00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:34.018
They are in the back of your upper arm.

00:02:34.018 --> 00:02:38.365
So they are right over here. Often referred to as the triceps.

00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:42.205
The official name are the triceps brachii, but they're right over here

00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:46.970
and it's called triceps because kind of three-headed muscle. There are three muscle bundles that are going on

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.249
And when these muscles over here, your triceps, when they contract

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:59.868
they allow your entire forearm to essentially straighten out on your elbow so it will go in that direction

00:02:59.868 --> 00:03:02.382
In this case, when this muscle, the triceps, contract

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:06.196
your entire forearm is going to .... on your elbow

00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:10.196
And go like that, which will allow the basket to go in the intended direction
