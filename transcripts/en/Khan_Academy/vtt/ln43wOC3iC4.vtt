00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:01.360
- [Voiceover] Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.886
So what I'd like to do
here and in the following

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:05.136
few videos is talk about how you take the

00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:08.529
partial derivative of
vector valued functions.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.448
So the kind of thing I have in mind

00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:12.957
will be a function with
a multi-variable input,

00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:16.333
so this specific example have
a two variable input, p and s.

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.101
You could think of that
as a two-dimensional space

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:21.091
as the input or just two separate numbers.

00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.862
And its output will be three-dimensional.

00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:27.158
The first component, p
squared minus s-squared.

00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:30.575
The y component will be s times t.

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:34.973
And that z component
will be t times s-squared

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:39.140
minus s times t-squared,
minus s times t-squared.

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:42.980
And the way that you
compute a partial derivative

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.548
of a guy like this, is actually
relatively straight-forward.

00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:48.452
If you're to just guess
what it might mean,

00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:50.715
you'll probably guess right.

00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:53.443
It will look like partial
of v with respect to

00:00:53.443 --> 00:00:56.268
one of its input variables,
and I'll choose t

00:00:56.268 --> 00:00:58.258
with respect to t.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.881
And you just do it component-wise,

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:02.572
which means you look at each component

00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:04.209
and you with a partial derivative to that

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.048
'cause each component is just a normal

00:01:06.048 --> 00:01:07.646
scaler valued function.

00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:10.054
So you go up to the top one and you say

00:01:10.054 --> 00:01:11.566
t-squared looks like a variable,

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:15.348
as far t is concerned,
and this derivative is 2t.

00:01:15.348 --> 00:01:16.948
But s-squared looks like a constant,

00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:18.954
so its derivative is zero.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:22.298
S times t, when s looks like a constant

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:23.987
and when t looks like a variable,

00:01:23.987 --> 00:01:26.196
has a derivative of s.

00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:29.487
Then t times s-squared,
when t's the variable

00:01:29.487 --> 00:01:32.322
and s is the constant, just
looks like that constant,

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:35.892
which is s-squared
minus s times t-squared.

00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:38.393
So now a derivative of t-squared is 2t

00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:39.725
and that constant s stays in.

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:42.725
So that two times s times t.

00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:45.895
And that's how you compute it,

00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:47.923
probably relatively straightforward.

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:50.553
The way you do it with
respect to s is very similar,

00:01:50.553 --> 00:01:52.641
but where this gets fun
and where this gets cool

00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:55.271
is how you interpret the
partial derivative, right,

00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:57.697
how you interpret this
value that we just found.

00:01:57.697 --> 00:01:59.349
And what that means
depends a lot on how you

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.290
actually visualize the function.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.204
So what I'll go ahead
and do in the next video

00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:06.341
and in the next few ones, is talk about

00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:07.174
visualizing this function.

00:02:07.174 --> 00:02:08.502
It'll be as a parametric surface

00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:09.776
and three-dimensional space.

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:12.433
That's why I got my
grapher program out here

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.988
and I think you'll find
there's actually a very

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:17.109
satisfying understanding
of what this value means.
