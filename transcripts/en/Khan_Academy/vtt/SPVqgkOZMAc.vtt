00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.190
I've spoken a lot about second
order linear homogeneous

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.376
differential equations in
abstract terms, and how if g

00:00:07.376 --> 00:00:09.320
is a solution, then
some constant

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.740
times g is also a solution.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.770
Or if g and h are solutions,
then g

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.200
plus h is also a solution.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.900
Let's actually do problems,
because I think that will

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.860
actually help you learn,
as opposed to

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.120
help you get confused.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.210
So let's say I have this
differential equation, the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.840
second derivative of y, with
respect to x, plus 5 times the

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.080
first derivative of y, with
respect to x, plus 6 times y

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.160
is equal to 0.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.570
So we need to find a y where 1
times its second derivative,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.890
plus 5 times its first
derivative, plus 6 times

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.760
itself, is equal to 0.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.680
And now, let's just do a little
bit of-- take a step

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.100
back and think about what kind
of function-- if I have the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.010
function and I take its
derivative and then I take its

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.410
second derivative,
most times I get

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.760
something completely different.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:14.770
Like, if y was x squared, then
y prime would be 2x, and y

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.200
prime prime would be 2.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.500
And then to add them together
you'd say, well, how would my

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.770
x terms cancel out so that
you get 0 in the end?

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.140
So draw back into your brain
and think, is there some

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.470
function that when I take its
first and second derivatives,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.630
and third and fourth
derivatives, it essentially

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.730
becomes the same function?

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.010
Maybe the constant in front of
the function changes as I take

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.080
the derivative.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.970
And if you've listened to a
lot of my videos, you'd

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.970
realize that it probably is what
I consider to be the most

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.290
amazing function
in mathematics.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.230
And that is the function
e to the x.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.770
And in particular, maybe e to
the x won't work here-- or you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.010
can even try it out, right?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.550
If you did e to the x,
it won't satisfy

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.850
this equation, right?

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.490
You would get e to the x, plus
5e to the x, plus 6e to the x.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.030
That would not equal to 0.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:25.440
But maybe y is equal to e to
some constant r, times x.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.640
Let's just make the assumption
that y is equal to some

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.510
constant r times x, substitute
it back into this, and then

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.640
see if we can actually solve
for an r that makes this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.140
equation true.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.730
And if we can, we've found the
solution, or maybe we've found

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.580
several solutions.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.360
So let's try it out.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.680
Let's try y is equal to
e to the rx into this

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.520
differential equation.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.260
So what is the first
derivative of

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.600
it, first of all.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.830
So y soon. prime is
equal to what?

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.840
Derivative chain rule.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.846
Derivative of the inside is r.

00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:56.390
And then derivative of
the outside is still

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.660
just e to the rx.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.490
And what's the second
derivative?

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.530
y prime prime is equal to
derivative-- r is just a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.370
constant-- so derivative of the
inside is r, times r on

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.140
the outside, that's r squared,
times e to the rx.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.610
And now we're ready to
substitute back in.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.760
And I will switch colors.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.570
So the second derivative, that's
r squared times e to

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:31.970
the rx, plus 5 times the first
derivative, so that's 5re to

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:40.310
the rx, plus 6 times our
function-- 6 times e to the rx

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.600
is equal to 0.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.760
And something might already be
surfacing to you as something

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.700
we can do this equation
to solve for r.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.820
All of these terms on the left
all have an e to the rx, so

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.840
let's factor that out.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:04.360
So this is equal to e to the rx
times r squared, plus 5r,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.420
plus 6 is equal to 0.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.370
And our goal, remember, was to
solve for the r, or the r's,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.440
that will make this true.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.850
And in order for this side
of the equation to be

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.740
0, what do we know?

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.570
Can e to the rx ever equal 0?

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.010
Can you ever get something to
some exponent and get 0?

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.610
Well, no.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.150
So this cannot equal 0.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.290
So in order for this left-hand
side of the equation to be 0,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.480
this term, this expression
right here, has to be 0.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.980
And I'll do that in
a different color.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.810
So we know, if we want to solve
for r, that this, r

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.110
squared plus 5r, plus
6, that has to be 0.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.630
And this is called the
characteristic equation.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.120
This, the r squared plus 5r,
plus 6, is called the

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.135
characteristic equation.

00:04:56.135 --> 00:04:58.490
And it should be obvious
to you that now this

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.830
is no longer calculus.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.050
This is just factoring
a quadratic.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.480
And this one actually is fairly

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.200
straightforward to factor.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.740
So what is this?

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:17.930
This is r plus 2, times r
plus 3 is equal to 0.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.070
And so the solutions of the
characteristic equation-- or

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.180
actually, the solutions to this
original equation-- are r

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:34.050
is equal to negative 2 and
r is equal to minus 3.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.000
So you say, hey, we found two
solutions, because we found

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.520
two you suitable r's
that make this

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.610
differential equation true.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.770
And what are those?

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.190
Well, the first one is
y is equal to e to

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.460
the minus 2x, right?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.090
We can call that y1.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.560
And then the second solution
we found, y2 is e to the--

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.640
what is this?-- r is minus 3x.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.980
Now my question to you
is, is this the

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.060
most general solution?

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.080
Well, in the last video, in
kind of our introductory

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.710
video, we learned that a
constant times a solution is

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.170
still a solution.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.050
So, if y1 is a solution, we also
know that we can multiply

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.515
y1 times any constant.

00:06:19.515 --> 00:06:20.300
So let's do that.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.340
Let's multiply it by c1.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.750
That's a c1 there.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.120
This is also going
to be a solution.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.180
And now it's a little bit
more general, right?

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.360
It's a whole class
of functions.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.590
The c doesn't have to just be
1, it can be any constant.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.210
And then when you use your
initial values, you actually

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.110
can figure out what
that constant is.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.330
And same for y2.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.160
y2 doesn't have to be 1 times
e to the minus 3x, it has to

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.640
be any constant.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.340
And we learned that in the
last video, that if

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.410
something's a solution,
some constant times

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.700
that is also a solution.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.480
And we also learned that if we
have two different solutions,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.630
that if you add them together,
you also get a solution.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.600
So the most general solution to
this differential equation

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.310
is y-- we could say y of x, just
to hit it home that this

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.930
is definitely a function of x--
y of x is equal to c1e to

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:19.190
the minus 2x, plus c2e
to the minus 3x.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.040
And this is the general
solution of this

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.860
differential equation.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.370
And I won't prove it because the
proof is fairly involved.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.210
I mean, we just tried
out e to the rx.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.380
Maybe there's some other wacko
function that would have

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.150
worked here.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.180
But I'll tell you now, and you
kind of have to take it as a

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.670
leap of faith, that this is
the only general solution.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.990
There isn't some crazy outside
function there that would have

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.210
also worked.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.050
And so the other question that
might be popping in your brain

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.170
is, Sal, when we did first order
differential equations,

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.460
we only had one constant.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.170
And that was OK, because we
had one set of initial

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.410
conditions and we solved
for our constants.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.910
But here, I have
two constants.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.710
So if I wanted a particular
solution, how can I solve for

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.350
two variables if I'm only given
one initial condition?

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.990
And if that's what you actually
thought, your

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.270
intuition would be correct.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.450
You actually need two initial
conditions to solve this

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.840
differential equation.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.070
You would need to know,
at a given value of x,

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.560
what y is equal to.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.960
And, maybe at a given
value of x, what the

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.960
first derivative is.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.260
And that is what we will
do in the next video.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.510
