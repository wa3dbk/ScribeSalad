00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.500
There are two whole Khan
Academy videos on what

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.320
scientific notation is, why
we even worry about it.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.800
And it also goes through
a few examples.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.770
And what I want to do in this
video is just use a ck12.org

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:19.960
Algebra I book to do some more
scientific notation examples.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.460
So let's take some things
that are written

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.690
in scientific notation.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.980
Just as a reminder, scientific
notation is useful because it

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.180
allows us to write really
large, or really small

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.220
numbers, in ways that are easy
for our brains to, one, write

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.120
down, and two, understand.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.800
So let's write down
some numbers.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.900
So let's say I have 3.102
times 10 to the second.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.510
And I want to write it as
just a numerical value.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.720
It's in scientific
notation already.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.840
It's written as a product
with a power of 10.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.310
So how do I write this?

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.750
It's just a numeral.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.520
Well, there's a slow way
and the fast way.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.410
The slow way is to say, well,
this is the same thing as

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:09.540
3.102 times 100, which means if
you multiplied 3.102 times

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.040
100, it'll be 3, 1, 0, 2,
with two 0's behind it.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.670
And then we have 1, 2, 3 numbers
behind the decimal

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.260
point, and that'd be
the right answer.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.230
This is equal to 310.2.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.570
Now, a faster way to do this
is just to say, well, look,

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.510
right now I have only the 3 in
front of the decimal point.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.180
When I take something times 10
to the second power, I'm

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.070
essentially shifting the decimal
point 2 to the right.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.400
So 3.102 times 10 to the second
power is the same thing

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.260
as-- if I shift the decimal
point 1, and then 2, because

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.920
this is 10 to the second
power-- it's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.090
same thing as 310.2.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.920
So this might be a faster
way of doing it.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.490
Every time you multiply it by
10, you shift the decimal to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.840
the right by 1.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.919
Let's do another example.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:14.910
Let's say I had 7.4 times
10 to the fourth.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.030
Well, let's just do
this the fast way.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.560
Let's shift the decimal
4 to the right.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.560
So 7.4 times 10 to the fourth.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.400
Times 10 to the 1, you're
going to get 74.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.050
Then times 10 to the second,
you're going to get 740.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.080
We're going to have to add a
0 there, because we have to

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.500
shift the decimal again.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.710
10 to the third, you're
going to have 7,400.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.390
And then 10 to the fourth,
you're going to have 74,000.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.825
Notice, I just took
this decimal and

00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:49.230
went 1, 2, 3, 4 spaces.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.130
So this is equal to 74,000.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.410
And when I had 74, and I had to
shift the decimal 1 more to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.920
the right, I had to
throw in a 0 here.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.820
I'm multiplying it by 10.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.760
Another way to think about it
is, I need 10 spaces between

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.420
the leading digit
and the decimal.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.250
So right here, I only
have 1 space.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.820
I'll need 4 spaces,
So, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.670
Let's do a few more examples,
because I think the more

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.230
examples, the more you'll
get what's going on.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.590
So I have 1.75 times 10
to the negative 3.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.050
This is in scientific notation,
and I want to just

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.800
write the numerical
value of this.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.360
So when you take something to
the negative times 10 to the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.250
negative power, you shift
the decimal to the left.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.130
So this is 1.75.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.550
So if you do it times 10 to the
negative 1 power, you'll

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.330
go 1 to the left.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.940
But if you do times 10 to the
negative 2 power, you'll go 2

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.570
to the left.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.130
And you'd have to
put a 0 here.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.670
And if you do times 10 to the
negative 3, you'd go 3 to the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.160
left, and you would have
to add another 0.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.860
So you take this decimal and
go 1, 2, 3 to the left.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.440
So our answer would be 0.00175
is the same thing as 1.75

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.560
times 10 to the negative 3.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.519
And another way to check that
you got the right answer is if

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.870
you have a 1 right here, if you
count the 1, 1 including

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.310
the 0's to the right of the
decimal should be the same as

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.880
the negative exponent here.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.150
So you have 1, 2, 3 numbers
behind the decimal.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.520
That's the same thing as to
the negative 3 power.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.030
You're doing 1,000th, so this
is 1,000th right there.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.330
Let's do another example.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.230
Actually let's mix it up.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.710
Let's start with something
that's written as a numeral

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.250
and then write it in scientific
notation.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.860
So let's say I have 120,000.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.430
So that's just its numerical
value, and I want to write it

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.270
in scientific notation.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.490
So this I can write as-- I take
the leading digit-- 1.2

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.910
times 10 to the-- and I just
count how many digits there

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.680
are behind the leading digit.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.760
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.270
So 1.2 times 10 to the fifth.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.650
And if you want to internalize
why that makes sense, 10 to

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.950
the fifth is 10,000.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.390
So 1.2-- 10 to the
fifth is 100,000.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.970
So it's 1.2 times--
1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.900
You have five 0's.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.580
That's 10 to the fifth.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.230
So 1.2 times 100,000 is
going to be a 120,000.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.890
It's going to be 1 and 1/5
times 100,000, so 120.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.400
So hopefully that's
sinking in.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.030
So let's do another one.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.840
Let's say the numerical
value is 1,765,244.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.150
I want to write this in
scientific notation, so I take

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.430
the leading digit, 1,
put a decimal sign.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.050
Everything else goes
behind the decimal.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.530
7, 6, 5, 2, 4, 4.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.460
And then you count how many
digits there were between the

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.920
leading digit, and I guess, you
could imagine, the first

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.640
decimal sign.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.720
Because you could have numbers
that keep going over here.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.370
So between the leading digit
and the decimal sign.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.080
And you have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 digits.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.310
So this is times 10
to the sixth.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.620
And 10 to the sixth
is just 1 million.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.200
So it's 1.765244 times 1
million, which makes sense.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.750
Roughly 1.7 times million
is roughly 1.7 million.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.260
This is a little bit
more than 1.7

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.970
million, so it makes sense.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.360
Let's do another one.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.730
How do I write 12 in scientific
notation?

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.120
Same drill.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.430
It's equal to 1.2 times-- well,
we only have 1 digit

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.875
between the 1 and the decimal
spot, or the decimal point.

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:54.900
So it's 1.2 times 10 to the
first power, or 1.2 times 10,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.540
which is definitely
equal to 12.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.230
Let's do a couple of examples
where we're taking 10 to a

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.530
negative power.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:08.480
So let's say we had 0.00281, and
we want to write this in

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.450
scientific notation.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.850
So what you do, is you just have
to think, well, how many

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.010
digits are there to include
the leading

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.365
numeral in the value?

00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:26.750
So what I mean there
is count, 1, 2, 3.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.980
So what we want to
do is we move the

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.040
decimal 1, 2, 3 spaces.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.710
So one way you could think about
it is, you can multiply.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.220
To move the decimal to the
right 3 spaces, you would

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.200
multiply it by 10
to the third.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.170
But if you're multiplying
something by 10 to the third,

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.340
you're changing its values.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.440
So we also have to multiply
by 10 to the negative 3.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.090
Only this way will you not
change the value, right?

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.920
If I multiply by 10 to the 3,
times 10 to the negative 2-- 3

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.440
minus 3 is 0-- this is just
like multiplying it by 1.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.820
So what is this going
to equal?

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.420
If I take the decimal and I move
it 3 spaces to the right,

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.510
this part right here is going
to be equal to 2.81.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.880
And then we're left with
this one, times 10 to

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.720
the negative 3.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.770
Now, a very quick way to do it
is just to say, look, let me

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.860
count-- including the leading
numeral-- how many spaces I

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.970
have behind the decimal.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.440
1, 2, 3.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.060
So it's going to be 2.81
times 10 to the

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.430
negative 1, 2, 3 power.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.470
Let's do one more like that.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.080
Let me actually scroll
up here.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.520
Let's do one more like that.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:43.240
Let's say I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6-- how many 0's do I have

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.750
in this problem?

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.030
Well, I'll just make
up something.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.240
0, 2, 7.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.830
And you wanted to write that
in scientific notation.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.540
Well, you count all the
digits up to the

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.380
2, behind the decimal.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.610
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.870
So this is going to
be 2.7 times 10 to

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.460
the negative 8 power.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.270
Now let's do another one,
where we start with the

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.840
scientific notation value
and we want to go

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.760
to the numeric value.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.690
Just to mix things up.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.190
So let's say you have
2.9 times 10 to

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.830
the negative fifth.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.360
So one way to think about is,
this leading numeral, plus all

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.110
0's to the left of the
decimal spot, is

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.980
going to be five digits.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.600
So you have a 2 and a 9,
and then you're going

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.170
to have 4 more 0's.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.450
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.140
And then you're going to
have your decimal.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.610
And how did I know 4 0's?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:45.370
Because I'm counting,, this is
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spaces behind

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.510
the decimal, including
the leading numeral.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.600
And so it's 0.000029.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.670
And just to verify, do
the other technique.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.110
How do I write this in
scientific notation?

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:03.310
I count all of the digits, all
of the leading 0's behind the

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.050
decimal, including the leading
non-zero numeral.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.330
So I have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 digits.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.725
So it's 10 to the negative 5.

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:20.590
And so it'll be 2.9 times
10 to the negative 5.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.230
And once again, this isn't
just some type

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.450
of black magic here.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.270
This actually makes
a lot of sense.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.920
If I wanted to get this number
to 2.9, what I would have to

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:37.310
do is move the decimal over 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 spots, like that.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:43.010
And to get the decimal to move
over the right by 5 spots--

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.700
let's just say with
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.670
If I multiply it by 10 to the
fifth, I'm also going to have

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.700
to multiply it by 10
to the negative 5.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.230
So I don't want to change
the number.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.060
This right here is just
multiplying something by 1.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.790
10 to the fifth times 10
to the negative 5 is 1.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:07.910
So this right here is
essentially going to move the

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.850
decimal 5 to the right.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.660
So this will be 2.5, and then
we're going to be left with

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.310
times 10 to the negative 5.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.640
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that scientific

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.980
notation drill useful.
