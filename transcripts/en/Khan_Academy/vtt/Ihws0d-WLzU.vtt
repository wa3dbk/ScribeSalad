00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.050
In the last video,
we did some examples

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.670
where we had one digit
repeating on and on forever,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.750
and we were able to convert
those into fractions.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.540
In this video, we want to tackle
something a little bit more

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.670
interesting, which is
multiple digits repeating

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.150
on and on forever.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.000
So let's say I had
0.36 repeating, which

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.130
is the same thing as 0 point--
since the bar's over the 3

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.920
and the 6, both of
those repeat-- 363636.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.720
And it just keeps going on and
on and on like that forever.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.560
Now the key to doing
this type of problem

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.360
is, so like we did
in the last video,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.800
we set this as equal to x.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.990
And instead of just
multiplying it by 10-- 10

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.070
would only shift
it one over-- we

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.370
want to shift it over enough
so that when we line them up,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.440
the decimal parts will still
line up with each other.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.430
And to do that we,
want to actually shift

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.720
the decimal space
two to the right.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.070
And to shift it
two to the right,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.030
we have to have multiplied by
100 or 10 to the second power.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.460
So 100x is going to
be equal to what?

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.660
We're shifting this two
to the right-- one, two.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.100
So 100x is going to be equal
to-- the decimal is going

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.230
to be there now, so it's
going to be 36.363636

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.850
on and on and on forever.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.350
And then let me
rewrite x over here.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.550
We're going to subtract
that from the 100x.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.690
x is equal to 0.363636
repeating on and on forever.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.315
And notice when we multiplied by
100x, the 3's and the 6's still

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:35.440
line up with each other
when we align the decimals.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.815
And you want to
make sure you get

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:39.402
the decimals lined
up appropriately.

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:40.860
And the reason why
this is valuable

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.350
is now that when we
subtract x from 100x,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.000
the repeating parts
will cancel out.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.840
So let's subtract.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.170
Let us subtract
these two things.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.170
So on the left-hand side,
we have 100x minus x.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.100
So that gives us 99x.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.650
And then we get, on
the right-hand side,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.300
this part cancels
out with that part.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.930
And we're just left with 36.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.900
We can divide both
sides by 99, and we

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.240
are left with x is
equal to 36 over 99.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.110
And both the numerator and the
denominator is divisible by 9,

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.390
so we can reduce this.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.930
If we divide the
numerator by 9, we get 4.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.280
The denominator
by 9-- we get 11.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.760
So 0.363636 forever and
forever repeating is 4/11.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.960
Now let's do another
interesting one.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:48.340
Let's say we have the number
0.714, and the 14 is repeating.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.110
And so this is the same thing.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.160
So notice, the 714
isn't going to repeat.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.250
Just the 14 is going to repeat.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.690
So this is 0.7141414,
on and on and on and on.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.910
So let's set this equal to x.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.330
Now you might be tempted to
multiply this by 1,000x to get

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.556
the decimal all the
way clear of 714.

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:14.180
But you actually
don't want to do that.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.670
You want to shift it just enough
so that the repeating pattern

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.751
can be right under itself
when you do the subtraction.

00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:23.500
So again in this
situation, even though we

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.640
have three numbers
behind the decimal point,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.390
because only two of
them are repeating,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.350
we only want to multiply
by 10 to the second power.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.010
So once again, you want
to multiply by 100.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.250
So you get 100x is equal to--
we're moving the decimal two

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.680
to the right, one,
two-- so it's going

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.360
to be 71.4141, on
and on and on and on.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.810
So it's going to be 71.4141414
and on and on and on.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.770
And then let me rewrite
x right below this.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.380
We have x is equal to 0.7141414.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.340
And notice, now the
141414's, they're

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.040
lined up right below each other.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.190
So it's going to work
out when we subtract.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.170
So let's subtract these things.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.230
100x minus x is 99x.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.750
And this is going to be equal
to-- these 1414's are going

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.600
to cancel with those 1414's.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.800
And we have 71.4 minus 0.7.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.860
And we can do this in our head,
or we can borrow if you like.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.330
This could be a 14.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.620
This is a 0.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.310
So you have 14 minus 7
is 7 and then 70 minus 0.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.260
So you have 99x
is equal to 70.7.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.300
And then we can divide
both sides by 99.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.110
And you could see all of
the sudden something strange

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.985
is happening because we
still have a decimal.

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:46.470
But we can fix
that up at the end.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.145
So let's divide
both sides by 99.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.534
You get x is equal
to 70.7 over 99.

00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:57.200
Now obviously, we
haven't converted this

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.300
into a pure fraction yet.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.190
We still have a decimal
in the numerator.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.840
But that's pretty easy to fix.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.170
You just have to multiply the
numerator and denominator by 10

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.320
to get rid of this decimal.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.270
So let's multiply the numerator
by 10 and the denominator

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.280
by 10.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:19.780
And so we get 707/990.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.640
Let's do one more
example over here.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.810
So let's say we had something
like-- let me write this way--

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:35.710
3.257 repeating, and we want to
convert this into a fraction.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.080
So once again, we
set this equal to x.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.400
And notice, this is
going to be 3.257257257.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.730
The 257 is going to
repeat on and on and on.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.690
Since we have three
digits that are repeating,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.660
we want to think about 1,000x,
10 to the third power times x.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.560
And that'll let us
shift it just right

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.080
so that the repeating
parts can cancel out.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.157
So 1,000x is going
to be equal to what?

00:06:02.157 --> 00:06:03.740
We're going to shift
the decimal three

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.500
to the right-- one, two, three.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.490
So it's going to
be 3,257 point--

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.180
and then the 257
keeps repeating.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.390
257257257 keeps going on
and on and on forever.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.850
And then we're going to
subtract x from that.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.231
So here is x. x is equal to 3.

00:06:23.231 --> 00:06:25.480
You want to make sure you
have your decimals lined up.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:33.060
It's 3.257257257 dot, dot,
dot-- keeps going on forever.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.100
And notice, when we
multiplied it by 1,000,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.690
it allowed us to line up the
257's so that when we subtract,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.790
the repeating part cancels out.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.050
So let's do that subtraction.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.004
On the left-hand side,
1,000 of something

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.420
minus 1 of that
something-- you're

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.590
left with 999 of that something.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.110
This part is going to
cancel out with that part.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.650
It's going to be equal to--
let's see, 7 minus 3 is 4.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.810
And then you have the
5, the 2, and the 3.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:07.240
So you get 999x
is equal to 3,254.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:15.830
And then you can divide
both sides of this by 999.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:23.590
And you are left with x
is equal to 3,254/999.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.590
And so obviously, this
is an improper fraction.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.690
The numerator is larger
than the denominator.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.414
You could convert this to a
proper fraction if you like.

00:07:30.414 --> 00:07:31.830
One way, you could
have just tried

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.820
to figure out what to the 0.257
repeating forever is equal to

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.540
and just had the 3
being the whole number

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.600
part of a mixed fraction.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.460
Or you could just
divide 999 into 3,254.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.690
Actually, we could do that
pretty straightforwardly.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.290
It goes into it three times,
and the remainder-- well,

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.010
let me just do it, just
to go through the motions.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.660
So 999 goes into 3,254.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.400
It'll go into it three times.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.160
And we know that because
this is originally 3.257,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.910
so we're just going
to find the remainder.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.645
So 3 times 9 is 27.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.450
But we have to add
the 2, so it's 29.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.650
3 times 9 is 27.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.040
We have a 2, so it's 29.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.310
And so we are left
with, if we subtract,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.220
if we regroup or borrow or
however we want to call it,

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.860
this could be a 14.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.201
And then this could be a 4.

00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:25.450
Let me do this in a new color.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.490
And then the 4 is still
smaller than this 9,

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.770
so we need to regroup again.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.240
So then this could be a 14,
and then this could be a 1.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.020
But this is smaller
than this 9 right

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.000
over here, so we regroup again.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.780
This would be an 11,
and then this is a 2.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.580
14 minus 7 is 7.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.782
14 minus 9 is 5.

00:08:48.782 --> 00:08:51.740
11 minus 9 is 2.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.520
So we are left with--
did I do that right?

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:03.580
Yep-- so this is going to
be equal to 3 and 257/999.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.520
And we're done.
