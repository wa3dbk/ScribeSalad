00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.010
Everything we've done so far has
been stationary fluids, or

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.440
static fluids, and we've been
dealing with static pressure.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.760
We were trying to figure out
what happens when everything's

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.770
in a steady state.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.460
Now let's work on what
happens when the

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.860
fluid is actually moving.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.260
Let's imagine a pipe.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.500
Let's say one end of the pipe
has a larger area than the

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.260
other end, or at least
a different area.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.830
So this is one end of the pipe,
and this is the other

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.080
end of a pipe.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.600
It's filled with some fluid,
some liquid, actually, in our

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.550
example, so there's just a bunch
of liquid in this fluid.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.980
Let's say this area
at the entrance is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.620
called the area in.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.349
That's the area of the opening
into the pipe, and let's call

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.540
this area out.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.100
It's the area of the opening
coming out of the pipe.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.090
Let's think about what
happens if this

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.200
liquid is actually moving.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.230
Let's say it's moving into the
pipe with the velocity V in.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.920
Let's think about how much
volume moves into the pipe

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.430
after T seconds.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.540
After T seconds, if you
think about it, you'd

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.490
have this much area.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.210
If you think about what was
right here, it will then be

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.130
moved to the right
by how much?

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.820
We could just go back to our
basic kinematic formula:

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.420
distance is equal to
rate times time.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.150
The distance something travels
equals velocity times time, so

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:07.000
after T seconds, whatever fluid
was here, it would have

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.479
an area of about that much.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.800
Whatever fluid was there
would have traveled

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.520
how much to the right?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.660
It would have traveled-- let's
assume that the pipe doesn't

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.670
change too much in diameter or
in radius from here to here.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.046
It would have traveled velocity
times time, so V in

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:30.240
times time.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.920
It could be meters or whatever
our length units are.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.870
After T seconds, essentially
this much water has traveled

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.690
into the pipe.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.870
You could imagine a cylinder
of water here.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.650
Once again, I know I made it
look like it's getting wider

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.610
the whole time, but let's assume
that its width doesn't

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.800
change that much over the T
seconds or whatever units of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.840
time we're looking at.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.640
What is the volume of this
cylinder of water?

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:08.280
The volume-in over the T seconds
is equal to the area,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.610
or the left-hand side
of the cylinder.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.990
Let me draw the cylinder in a
more vibrant color so you can

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.240
figure out the volume.

00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:26.740
So it equals this side, the left
side of the cylinder, the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.040
input area times the length
of the cylinder.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.510
That's the velocity of the
fluid times the time that

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.690
we're measuring, times the input
velocity times time.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.120
That's the amount of volume
that came in.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.270
If that volume came into the
pipe-- once again, we learned

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.050
several videos ago that the
definition of a liquid is a

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.640
fluid that's incompressible.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.900
It's not like no fluid could
come out of the pipe and all

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.020
of the fluid just
gets squeezed.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.560
The same volume of fluid would
have to come out of the pipe,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.680
so that must equal
the volume out.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.950
Whatever comes into the pipe has
to equal the volume coming

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.810
out of the pipe.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.290
One assumption we're assuming in
this fraction of time that

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.160
we're dealing with is also that
there's no friction in

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.770
this liquid or in this fluid,
that it actually is not

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.480
turbulent and it's
not viscous.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.870
A viscous fluid is really just
something that has a lot of

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.340
friction with itself and that
it won't just naturally move

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.970
without any resistance.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.390
When something is not viscous
and has no resistance with

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.670
itself and moves really without
any turbulence, that's

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.950
called laminar flow.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.800
That's just a good word to
know about and it's the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.210
opposite of viscous flow.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.990
Different things have different
viscosities, and

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.260
we'll probably do
more on that.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.870
Like syrup or peanut
butter has a

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.350
very, very high viscosity.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.290
Even glass actually
is a fluid with a

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.725
very, very high viscosity.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.470
I think there's some kinds of
compounds and magnetic fields

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.300
that you could create that have
perfect laminar flow, but

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.970
this is kind of a perfect
situation.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.330
In these circumstances, the
volume in, because the fluid

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.040
can't be compressed, it's
incompressible, has to equal

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.920
the volume out.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.160
What's the volume out over
that period of time?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.040
Similarly, we could draw this
bigger cylinder-- that's the

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.930
area out-- and after
T seconds, how much

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.390
water has come out?

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.700
Whatever water was here at the
beginning of our time period

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:50.570
will have come out and we can
imagine the cylinder here.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.130
What is the width
of the cylinder?

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.840
What's going to be the velocity
that the liquid is

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.570
coming out on the
right-hand side?

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.590
Capital V is volume, and
lowercase v is for velocity,

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.240
so it's going to be the output
velocity-- that's a lowercase

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.640
v-- times the same time.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.580
So what is the volume that has
come out in our time T?

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.160
It's just going to be this area
times this width, so the

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.030
output volume over that same
period of time is equal to the

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.570
output area of this pipe
times the output

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.410
velocity times time.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.650
Once again, I know I keep saying
this, but this is kind

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.020
of the big ah-hah moment, is
in that amount of time, the

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.160
volume in this cylinder
has to equal the

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.190
volume in this cylinder.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.490
Maybe it's not as wide, or
something like that, but their

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.220
volumes are the same.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.610
You can't get more water here
all of a sudden than what's

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.510
going in, and likewise, you
can't put more water into the

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.370
left side than what's coming out
of the right side, because

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.860
it's incompressible

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.190
These two volumes equal each
other, so we know the area of

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.030
the opening onto to the left
hand of the pipe times the

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.160
input velocity times the
duration of time we're talking

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.450
about is equal to the output
area times the output velocity

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.830
times the duration of time
we're talking about.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.000
It's the same time on both sides
of this equation, so we

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.250
could say that the input area
times the input velocity is

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.570
equal to the output area times
the output velocity.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:48.040
This is actually called in fluid
motion the equation of

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.370
continuity, and it leads to
some interesting things.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.300
We'll do some problems
with it in a second.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.560
One thing that I want to
introduce at this point as

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.670
well is what is the
volume per second?

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.000
Because this is also something
we're going to deal with in a

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.390
second, probably in the next
video, because I'm about to

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.590
run out of time.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.630
We said that in T seconds we
have this amount of volume

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.420
coming in and it's the same
coming in as coming out.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.040
So what is the volume
per second?

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.060
It's this big capital Vi
per amount of time, and

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.220
we call that flux.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.430
We'll learn a lot about flux,
especially when we start doing

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.870
vector calculus, but flux is
just how much of something

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.900
crosses a surface in
an amount of time.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.930
It's how much a volume
crosses a surface in

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:29.640
an amount of time.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.890
So in this case, the
surface is the

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:33.840
left-hand side of cylinder.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.020
And we're saying how much
crosses in amount of time?

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.830
We figured out it's that input
volume, which crosses in every

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.820
T seconds, and this
is called flux.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.650
You've probably heard of the
flux capacitor in Back To The

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.040
Future, and maybe we can think
about what they were

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.320
trying to hint at.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:59.970
Let's see if we can use flux
and these ideas to come up

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.965
with some other interesting
equations.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.290
We know that the volume per
time is equal to flux.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.180
This is a big V.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.700
V is equal to flux, and actually
the variable people

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.760
generally use for flux is R.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.640
Of course, it's in meters
cubed per second.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.640
That's its unit.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:33.480
We also know that the input area
times input velocity--

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.820
that's a lowercase v-- is equal
to the output area times

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.810
output velocity, and this is
called the equation of

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.810
continuity.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.150
It holds true whenever
we have laminar flow.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.230
Actually, I'm about to
run out of time.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.330
In the next video, I'm actually
going to use some of

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.580
this information to figure out
how much power is there in a

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.150
system where we have fluid
going through a pipe.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.600
See you soon.
