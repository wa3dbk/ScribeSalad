00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.010
Where I left off in the last
video we saw that if we had a

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.610
magnetic field coming in from
the right and we had this loop

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.900
of-- I guess we call it-- metal
or a circuit, and it's

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.760
carrying a current where the
current is coming in this

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.300
direction--.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.560
You can imagine positive
protons, although we know the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.810
electrons go in the
other direction.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.400
But the current is coming in
this direction and going out

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.990
that direction.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.210
We figured out using the right
hand rule and just this

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.890
formula, that the net force of
the magnetic field coming in

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.850
this direction on this arm
of the wire or the

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.520
circuit is net downwards.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.510
And on this arm, it
was net upwards.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.750
And so it provided a net
torque on this circuit.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.620
Or, as I said in the last
video, a paper clip.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.530
And where this dotted line
is the axis of rotation.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.610
And this is how I showed
you it would rotate.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.700
Where the magnetic field is
essentially pushing up on the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.840
right hand side and pushing down
on the left hand side.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.570
It has no effect over here on
the top and the bottom.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.230
So it would rotate in
this direction.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.610
And then this was kind of what
it looks like after it rotates

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.040
a little bit.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.190
And the whole reason why I did
this, I said, well, this arm--

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.130
which is the same as
this arm-- the net

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.700
force is still upwards.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.160
Out of our screen.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.630
But that upwards direction is
now no longer going to be

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.010
completely perpendicular to
the moment arm distance.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.770
That's the moment
arm distance.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.090
Now the moment arm distance is
kind of coming at an angle out

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.940
of the page.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.540
So only some of this net outward
force for the magnetic

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.600
field is going to
be perpendicular

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.630
to the moment arm.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.300
And so the torque on it will be
less, but it's still going

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.600
to be torque in that
same direction.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.090
Kind of coming out of the page
on the right and into the page

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.580
on the left.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.330
And the same is true of
the left hand side.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.130
And you go all the way to the
point that the coil is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.560
actually vertical.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.580
Where this side, this side
right here, is on top.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.170
And this side is on bottom,
below the plane

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.950
of your video screen.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.320
And at that point, the torque--
actually, there is no

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.890
net torque.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.540
And why is that?

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.810
Because on this top part, when
it's pointing straight out at

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.060
you, when it's right here, the
magnetic field-- the force of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.270
it, the force that's affecting
the circuit-- is pushing

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.160
straight up.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.080
So there's no longer any net
torque because the force is

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.720
pushing straight up and that
moment arm distance-- this

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.460
distance-- is now also
pointing straight up.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.700
And torque is also a cross
product, so you actually care

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.080
about the perpendicular
forces.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.890
So there, at this vertical
point, there's no net torque.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.340
And the same is true at the
bottom of the circuit.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.160
Because at the bottom the
magnetic field force is going

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.940
to be downwards, which is
parallel with the moment arm

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.630
distance, so there's
no net torque.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.240
And I said, well maybe there's
a little bit of angular

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.590
momentum that keeps this
object rotating.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.590
And then it will rotate to--
and this is where it gets

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.360
interesting.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.810
I'll draw it neatly.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.900
Then it'll rotate
to this point.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.340
Once again I want to have
the perspective.

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.200
It'll rotate here.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.820
So let me just make sure
I have all of it.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.980
So here it was rotating in this

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.060
direction and in that direction.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.860
And then here maybe some--
there's no longer any torque

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.070
on it, but it still might on the
top be moving to the left,

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.420
and on the bottom moving
to the right.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.230
Up to a point, then it's going
to get into this configuration

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.160
where soon. this side is-- so
at this point it has rotated

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.310
more than 90 degrees.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.970
So this edge is now this edge.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.110
It had rotated from here all the
way-- it's still pointing

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.440
out of the screen.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.130
But if this edge is the same as
this edge, now the current

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.080
direction is going
to be like this.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.180
Because this edge has
rotated down.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.440
So it's rotated from that
position all the way back to

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.390
this position.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.920
So the current is now coming--
let me make sure, let me draw

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.040
that right.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.050
The current is coming like that,
like that, like that.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.220
Going up here, to the
right, up like that.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.610
So the current now on this left
hand side, although it

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.125
was the former right
hand side.

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:20.380
It's still going in that
upwards direction.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.800
So when you take the cross
product, what is going to be

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.230
the net magnetic
field on that?

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.660
Or the force of the
magnetic field?

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.050
Well, you do the same
right hand rule.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.730
Point your index finger up.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.170
Put your middle finger
in the direction of

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.680
the magnetic field.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.120
This is the palm, this is
your other two fingers.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.300
Let me draw the fingernails,
just so they're painted

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.890
fingernails.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.460
Not that mine are.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.620
Then your thumb points
upwards.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.370
So on this side of the coil we
still have an upwards force.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.350
And if you do the cross product,
or you do the right

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.790
hand rule on the bottom side,
or the behind side, if you

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.450
could imagine it, you're
still going to have a

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.730
net downward force.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.470
So now all of a sudden
you could imagine--

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.580
the thing had rotated.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.020
So it had rotated in the way I
drew it here, where it pops

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.100
out on this side and it
goes in on that side.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.760
And it had done it all the way
to the point where we had

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.800
rotated more than 90 degrees,
but now all of a sudden the

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.560
net force through the magnetic
field was going to reverse.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.610
Because the side that has a
current going upwards is now

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.360
the left hand side.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.830
So now the force from the
magnetic field is out on this

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.660
side and you're going
to want to rotate in

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.160
the opposite direction.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.970
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.850
Just think about what happens.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.380
Visualize this coil rotating.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.190
So what is essentially going to
happen is you're going to

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.610
rotate like I did
here on the top.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.910
Maybe once you get to this level
you're going to have a

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.100
little bit of angular momentum
that'll keep you rotating.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.020
Or rotational inertia that'll
keep you rotating until you're

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.510
in something like this
configuration.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.220
Maybe you go all the way back
to this configuration, where

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.580
it's essentially a complete
180 degree turn.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.260
And then since on this side
the current's going to be

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.360
going up and on this side the
current's going down, because

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.060
you've essentially flipped
this thing over, then the

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.120
effect of the magnetic field is
going to say, well, upwards

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.540
on the left, downwards
on the right.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.900
And so it's going to
turn the other way.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.920
So if you think about it, it's
going to keep oscillating.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.490
Let me draw it from-- well, I
don't want to draw it from

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.830
that angle, because I don't
want to confuse you.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.630
So we have a problem.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.810
If we wanted to turn this into
some type of electric motor

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.840
and keep it spinning, we would
either have to reverse the

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.330
current once you get into this
configuration, or either turn

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.380
off the magnetic field.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.630
Or maybe you could reverse the
magnetic field to get it going

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.510
in the other direction.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.540
And actually you have another
problem, which is a slightly

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.730
lesser problem, is if this was
a circuit and you just kept

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.770
turning over and over the
circuit, the wires would get

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.280
twisted here.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.430
So you couldn't do
it indefinitely.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.373
So the solution here is
something called a commutator.

00:07:03.373 --> 00:07:05.630
you So let me draw
a commutator.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:19.250
I have the same circuit which
I've now drawn messier.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.430
But it has these two leads.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.210
It has these leads that
essentially curve.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.960
You could imagine them curving
out of the page.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.040
And then we have a circuit.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.720
You could imagine
leads here, too.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.030
And this round thing and this
thing are touching each other

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.150
the whole time, so current
could pass through it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.800
Let me draw my battery.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.710
This is positive and
this is negative.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.140
So up here on the circuit the
current's always going to be

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.440
flowing in this direction.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.600
It's always going to be flowing
in this direction,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.460
it's always going to be flowing
up and like this.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.150
Now when you're in this
configuration,

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.720
what's going to happen?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.860
Well, the current is going
to flow down here.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.750
That's going to be I and
that's going to be I.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.720
And when you do your right hand
rule, we have the same

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.320
magnetic field.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.280
I haven't changed the magnetic
field coming in from the left.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.700
So just like we did before I
cleared the screen, you use

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.590
the right hand rule and you'll
figure out, well, the net

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:32.090
force from the magnetic field
is going to be upwards here

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.429
and downwards here.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.250
And that's what's going to
create that net torque.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.429
And you're going to
rotate this part.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.220
So this part of this

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.260
contraption is going to rotate.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.510
You could imagine maybe
there's like

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.870
a little pole here.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.910
Maybe it's a nonconducting pole
so that none of the-- and

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.940
it's connected to an
axle somewhere.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.980
So you can rotate along
that axis, right?

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.895
So the force of the
magnetic field is

00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:56.430
going to create a torque.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.930
We're going to rotate up on this
side, up out of the page

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.030
on that side, and into the
page on that side.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.530
And then behind the page and
then back out of the page.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.620
That's what the net
torque would be.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.660
And then we would get it, and it
would keep doing that until

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.860
you get to the vertical
configuration.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.680
So at the vertical
configuration, the circuit on

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.800
the top stays exactly
the same.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.850
I'm trying my best to
draw this properly.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.190
At the vertical configuration
one of two things can happen,

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.590
and probably the best thing is
that we actually lose contact

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.820
with the two leads.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.600
So maybe the actual current
stops flowing when we're in

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.790
the vertical configuration.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.640
I'll do it in the same color.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.790
So when we're vertical
we just see the top.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.070
We see this.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.960
And then we see it pops
out a little bit.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.030
And then we see this
arm right there.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.560
And then we see that pole that's
maybe holding it or

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.600
that's helping it rotate.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.260
But we're still having
some-- you know,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.270
the current has ceased.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.580
So there's not going to be any
torque, no force through the

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.070
magnetic field, because we've
lost touch at that point.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.630
Because these things
kind of point out.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.920
Hopefully you could visualize
how to build such a thing.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.920
And we're still rotating in this
direction because of some

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.810
type of rotational inertia.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.350
Then this is what the
interesting part is.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.140
What happens when we rotate
more than 90 degrees?

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.555
And I just realized that I'm
pushing over 10 minutes, so

00:10:29.555 --> 00:10:32.860
you can think about that a
little bit while I stop here

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.610
and continue this in
the next video.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.860
