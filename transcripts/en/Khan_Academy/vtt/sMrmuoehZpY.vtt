00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.030
All right.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.000
We're on problem number 9.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.440
At least for the next few, I
don't think I have to copy and

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.020
paste these problems.
I can just write it.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.670
It looks like a little bit of
algebraic long division.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.140
Problem 9: They want us to
divide 2x plus 7 into-- it's

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.310
pretty long so I'll give it some
space-- 2x to the fourth

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:34.110
plus 21x to the third plus 35x
squared minus 37x plus 46.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.670
This might look daunting,
but once you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.560
start, it's not so bad.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.520
So like any long division,
you kind of look

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.560
at the biggest place.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.890
And the largest degreed place,
at least in this polynomial,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.330
is the 2x place.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.290
And that's what we work with.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.820
So we say, how many times does
2x go into 2x to the fourth?

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.160
Well, let's see.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.900
The 2 goes into the 2 one time,
and x goes into x to the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.050
fourth x to the third times.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.415
What's x to the fourth
divided by x?

00:00:57.415 --> 00:00:58.570
It's x to the third.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.570
So we say it goes into it
x to the third times.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.604
And if we were right, when we
multiply, we should get 2x to

00:01:04.604 --> 00:01:04.994
the fourth.

00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:10.630
So x to the third times 2x
is 2x to the fourth.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:18.700
And then x to the third times
7 is plus 7x to the third.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.000
If this was some other-- well,
we'll worry about it when we

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.940
get to it, but you would want
to put it under the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.190
appropriate place
in this number.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.640
It just happened to be that x to
the third was the next one.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.600
Now you subtract just like you
do with regular long division.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.450
These cancel out.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.715
21 minus 7 is 14x
to the third.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.470
And then you could bring down
all of this, but we can worry

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.280
about that in a second.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.940
So how many times does 2x go
into 14x to the third?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.840
Well, 2 goes into 14 seven
times, plus 7, and x goes into

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.480
x to the third x
squared times.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.980
If we're right, when we
multiply, it should work out.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.960
So 7x squared times 2x is equal
to 14x to the third,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.310
like we thought it should.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.090
7x squared times 7 is what?

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.130
That's plus 49x squared.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.870
And now we subtract.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.840
14x to the third minus
14x to the third.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.170
That's 0.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.650
Now we have 35-- we could bring
this down, just because

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.050
it makes it easier.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.490
35x squared.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.580
35x squared minus 49x squared.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.990
Let's see.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.120
So it's minus 14, right?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.810
49 minus 35.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.840
So it's minus 14x squared.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.640
And then 2x goes into
minus 14x squared.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.570
So 2 goes into minus 14 minus 7
times, and then x goes into

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.230
x squared x times.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.690
When you multiply this minus 7x
times 2x, so you get minus

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.262
7 times 2 is minus 14.

00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:00.610
x times x is x squared.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.390
Of course, you have
to multiply it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.690
times both terms, right?

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.430
We're multiplying it times
this whole expression.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.670
Minus 7x times 7 is minus 49x.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.640
Now we're ready to subtract
again and I'm

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.140
running out of space.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.560
These cancel out.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.210
We could bring this minus
37x down, so minus 37x.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.040
Remember, we're subtracting
this, right?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.170
We could almost add
the negative.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.350
Let's make the negative.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.250
So this is minus 37x minus minus
49x is the same thing as

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.220
minus 37x plus 49x.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.360
I made both of those
positive just to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.620
simplify it in my brain.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.900
Oh, whoops.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.880
I didn't want to go
down that much.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.320
OK.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.560
So these cancel out and then
this is equal to 12x.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.320
And 2x plus 7 goes into 12x.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.950
Well, now, let's see.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.010
2 goes into 12 six times, x goes
into x one time, so then

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.530
this is equal to plus 6.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.980
6 times 2x plus 7.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.800
6 times to 2x-- I know you
can't see it-- is 12x.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.029
And then 6 times the 7 is 42.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.709
We have a 46 up there.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.720
I should have written smaller.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.500
So you get this 46.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.390
And now we're ready
to subtract again.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.340
12x minus 12x is 0.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.030
46 minus 42 is 4, so we
have a remainder of 4.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.360
So let's see, our answer
is all of this

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.430
with a remainder 4.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.380
So all of that plus the
remainder over what we're

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.190
using to divide into:
2x plus 7.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.620
So our answer, let's see
what choice it is.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.050
It's x to the third plus 7 x
squared minus 7x plus 6 plus 4

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.750
over 2x plus 7.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.990
We just took our remainder and
said, OK, whatever this is,

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.410
that's also there.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:05.100
So that is choice-- let's see, x
to the third plus 7x squared

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:15.340
minus 7x plus 6 plus
4 over 2x plus 7.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.850
So it's actually choice
d is our answer.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.940
I was just reading choice a.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.300
I should have shown you that.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.360
So choice d is our answer.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.310
Next question.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.530
Problem number 10.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.000
That one took up more space
than I expected.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.510
Problem number 10.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.900
Which polynomial represents-- so
they want us to multiply--

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.330
this how they write it-- 3x
squared plus x minus 4 times

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.230
2x minus 5.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.520
I find that we should just
multiply these the way I would

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.500
multiply any number.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.110
So I would rewrite it as 3x
squared plus x minus 4 times,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.250
and I put the same degree under
the same degree, times

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.560
2x minus 5.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.650
And now let's take the
0th degree place.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.590
I guess you could
view that way.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.470
Minus 5 times minus
4 is plus 20.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.310
Minus 5 times x minus 5x.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:25.370
Minus 5 times 3x squared
is minus 15x squared.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.380
2x times minus 4 is minus 8x.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.800
I'll put it in this place
because that's our x's space.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.400
2x times x is 2x squared.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.110
And then I should have had all
of this-- actually, I think I

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.040
can do that.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.830
Let me see if I can move all
of this to the right.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.740
The magic of computers.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.720
I can move it all to the right,
although I should color

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.300
that back in.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.020
Let's see if I can color that.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.060
Look at that!

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.830
All right, back in business.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.170
All right.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.930
So I did 2x times minus
4 is minus 8x.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.500
2x times x is 2x squared.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:10.950
2x times 3x squared is
6x to the third.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.070
This is a plus.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.390
Now we just add up everything.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:21.672
So we get 6x to the third minus
15 plus 2 minus 13x

00:07:21.672 --> 00:07:28.130
squared minus 13x plus 20.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.550
So 6x to the third minus 13x
squared-- I'm just checking

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.200
all the choices-- minus
13x plus 20.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.880
That's choice b.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.340
Problem 11.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.360
Problem 11.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:49.770
Let's see, they wrote-- this
is problem 11, just so you

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:50.600
know what we're doing.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:08:01.380
Minus 2x squared plus 6x plus
1 minus 2 times 4x squared

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.350
minus 3x plus 1 is equal to--
well now, we just have to

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.590
simplify this.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.590
Let me rewrite this part.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.595
This is minus 2x squared
plus 6x 1.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.940
Let's distribute a minus 2.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:25.250
So minus 2 times 4x squared
is minus 8x squared.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.440
That's that.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:32.200
Minus 2 times minus 3x,
that's plus 6x.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.710
Minus 2 times 1 is minus 2.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.409
And now, let's see.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.730
We can add the like terms up.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.630
Let's see what this
is equal to.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.789
Let's do the x squared term.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:47.250
So first I'll do the minus 2x
squared and minus 8x squared,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:52.120
so that is minus 2 minus 8,
that's minus 10x squared.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.270
Let me do another color
for each of them.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.610
Then I have the x terms. I
have 6x, and then I have

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.930
another 6x.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:04.240
You add them together, you
get 12x, plus 12x.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.960
And then you have your ones
terms or x to the 0th power,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.570
you can view it.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:14.270
You have plus 1 and minus
2, so that's minus 1.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:19.430
And then that is choice-- let's
see, let me scroll down.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:24.130
That is choice d. minus 10x
squared plus 12x minus 1.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.270
Choice d.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.370
Problem number 12.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.570
Problem 12.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.820
We're on a roll.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.645
Problem 12: Which expression
is equivalent to-- so now

00:09:37.645 --> 00:09:39.380
they're multiplying.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:47.950
They write 6y squared minus
2 times 6y plus 2.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.230
You could do this in your head,
and you should practice

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.810
doing it in your head, but if
you never want to make a

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.850
mistake, you just write
it like this.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.900
6y squared.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.680
And I have nothing
in the x's spot.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.470
And I say minus 2.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.590
And then this one is 6y.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.520
I write that in the y spot.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.070
This is y squared, this is y,
this is y to the 0, which is

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.850
just 1, plus 2.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.960
And now I multiply them.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.670
2 times minus 2 is minus 4.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.690
2 times 6y squared
is 12 y squared.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.520
So I write that in that
spot, 12y squared.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.380
Now 6y times minus
2 is minus 12y.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.630
So that'll go here.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.340
And then 6y times 6y squared
is 36y to the third.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.520
So we have our answer.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.747
It is-- you just add them up--
36y to the third plus 12y

00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:48.450
squared minus 12y minus 4.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.270
And that is choice d.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.030
And you could do this in your
head, and that's a good thing

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.660
to practice.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.480
But I just wanted to make sure
it was clean when I did it.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.980
And let's see, should I continue
with the next video

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.340
or should I stop there?

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.230
Because I'm at 11 minutes.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.510
I'll stop there and I'll see
you in the next video.
