00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.430
In this video I want to
introduce you to the idea of a

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.680
polynomial.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.230
It might sound like a really
fancy word, but really all it

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
is is an expression that has a
bunch of variable or constant

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.390
terms in them that are raised
to non-zero exponents.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.510
So that also probably
sounds complicated.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.330
So let me show you an example.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.420
If I were to give you x squared
plus 1, this is a

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.260
polynomial.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.370
This is, in fact, a binomial
because it has two terms. The

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.159
term polynomial is
more general.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.350
It's essentially saying you
have many terms. Poly

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.300
tends to mean many.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.490
This is a binomial.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:45.440
If I were to say 4x to the third
minus 2 squared plus 7.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.200
This is a trinomial.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.970
I have three terms here.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.330
Let me give you just a more
concrete sense of what is and

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.140
is not a polynomial.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.460
For example, if I were to have
x to the negative 1/2 plus 1,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.660
this is not a polynomial.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.720
That doesn't mean that you won't
ever see it while you're

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.240
doing algebra or mathematics.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.840
But we just wouldn't call this
a polynomial because it has a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.610
negative and a fractional
exponent in it.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.670
Or if I were to give you the
expression y times the square

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.630
root of y minus y squared.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.070
Once again, this is not a
polynomial, because it has a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.810
square root in it, which is
essentially raising something

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.030
to the 1/2 power.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.680
So all of the exponents on our
variables are going to have to

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.680
be non-negatives.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.500
Once again, neither of these
are polynomials.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.130
Now, when we're dealing with
polynomials, we're going to

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.380
have some terminology.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.660
And you may or may not already
be familiar with it, so I'll

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.750
expose it to you right now.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.210
The first terminology is the
degree of the polynomial.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.889
And essentially, that's the
highest exponent that we have

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:09.720
in the polynomial.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.150
So for example, that polynomial
right there is a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.910
third degree polynomial.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.450
Now why is that?

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.510
No need to keep writing it.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.910
Why is that a third
degree polynomial?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.020
Because the highest exponent
that we have in there is the x

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.720
to the third term.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.150
So that's where we get it's
a third degree polynomial.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:43.100
This right here is a second
degree polynomial.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.600
And this is the second
degree term.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.750
Now a couple of other
terminologies, or words, that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.190
we need to know regarding
polynomials, are the constant

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.160
versus the variable terms. And
I think you already know,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.120
these are variable
terms right here.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.520
This is a constant term.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.860
That right there is
a constant term.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.390
And then one last part to
dissect the polynomial

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.670
properly is to understand the
coefficients of a polynomial.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.570
So let me write a fifth degree
polynomial here.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.990
And I'm going to write it in
maybe a non-conventional form

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.400
right here.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.690
I'm going to not
do it in order.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.520
So let's just say it's x squared
minus 5x plus 7x to

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.150
the fifth minus 5.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.840
So, once again, this is a
fifth degree polynomial.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.710
Why is that?

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.110
Because the highest exponent
on a variable here is the 5

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.580
right here.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:44.910
So this tells us this is a
fifth degree polynomial.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.870
And you might say, well why do
we even care about that?

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.380
And at least, in my mind, the
reason why I care about the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.590
degree of a polynomial is
because when the numbers get

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.560
large, the highest degree term
is what really dominates all

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.610
of the other terms. It will
grow the fastest, or go

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.160
negative the fastest, depending
on whether there's a

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.240
positive or a negative
in front of it.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.790
But it's going to dominate
everything else.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.470
It really gives you a sense for
how quickly, or how fast

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.269
the whole expression would grow
or decrease in the case

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.339
if it has a negative
coefficient.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.300
Now I just used the
word coefficient.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.850
What does that mean?

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.730
Coefficient.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.900
And I've used it before,
when we were just

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.500
doing linear equations.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.720
And coefficients are just the
constant terms that are

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.460
multiplying the variable
terms.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.360
So for example, the coefficient
on this term right

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.090
here is negative 5.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.140
You have to remember we have
a minus 5, so we consider

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.890
negative 5 to be the
whole coefficient.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.570
The coefficient on
this term is a 7.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.870
There's no coefficient here;
it's just a constant term of

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.940
negative 5.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.170
And then the coefficient on
the x squared term is 1.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.350
The coefficient is 1.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.160
It's implicit.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.090
You're assuming it's
1 times x squared.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.180
Now the last thing I want to
introduce you to is just the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.190
idea of the standard form
of a polynomial.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.710
Now none of this is going to
help you solve a polynomial

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.690
just yet, but when we talk about
solving polynomials, I

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.520
might use some of this
terminology, or your teacher

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.890
might use some of this
terminology.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.070
So it's good to know what
we're talking about.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.640
The standard form of a
polynomial, essentially just

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.770
list the terms in
order of degree.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.800
So this is in a non-standard
form.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.510
If I were to list this
polynomial in standard form, I

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.990
would put this term first. So I
would write 7x to the fifth,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.810
then what's the next
smallest degree?

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.260
Well, they have this
x squared term.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.680
I don't have an x to
the fourth or an x

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.800
to the third here.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.510
So that'll be plus 1--
well I don't have to

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.230
write 1-- plus x squared.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.000
And then I have this
term, minus 5x.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.170
And then I have this last term
right here, minus 5.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.430
This is the standard form of the
polynomial where you have

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.470
it in descending order
of degree.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.280
Now let's do a couple of
operations with polynomials.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.510
And this is going to be a super
useful toolkit later on

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.730
in your algebraic, or really in
your mathematical careers.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.180
So let's just simplify a
bunch of polynomials.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.500
And we've kind of touched on
this in previous videos.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.980
But I think this will give you
a better sense, especially

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.970
when we have these higher
degree terms over here.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.290
So let's say I wanted to
add negative 2x squared

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.000
plus 4x minus 12.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.030
And I'm going to add that
to 7x plus x squared.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.410
Now the important thing to
remember when you simplify

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.430
these polynomials is that you're
going to add the terms

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.830
of the same variable
of like degree.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.870
I'll do another example in a
second where I have multiple

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.750
variables getting involved
in the situation.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.620
But anyway, I have these
parentheses here, but they

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.170
really aren't doing anything.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.220
If I had a subtraction sign
here, I would have to

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.940
distribute the subtraction,
but I don't.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.270
So I really could just write
this as minus 2x squared, plus

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.970
4x, minus 12, plus 7x,
plus x squared.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.870
And now let's simplify it.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.440
So let's add the terms
of like degree.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.000
And when I say like degree,
it has to also

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.120
have the same variable.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.990
But in this example, we only
have the variable x.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.360
So let's add.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.090
Let's see, I have this x squared
term, and I've that x

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.020
squared term, so I can
add them together.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.130
So I have minus 2x squared--
let me just write them

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.640
together first --minus 2x
squared plus x squared.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.560
And then let me get the
x terms, so 4x and 7x.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.490
So this is plus 4x plus 7x.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.560
And then finally, I just
have this constant term

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.650
right here, minus 12.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.710
And if I have negative 2 of
something, and I add 1 of

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.210
something to that,
what do I have?

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.750
Negative 2 plus 1 is negative
1x squared.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.420
I could just write negative
x squared.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.320
But I just want to show you that
I'm just adding negative

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.560
2 to 1 there.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.070
Then I have 4x plus 7x is 11x.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.820
And then I finally have my
constant term, minus 12.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.390
And I end up with a three
term, second degree

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.370
polynomial.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.740
The leading coefficient here,
the coefficient on the highest

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.990
degree term in standard form--
it's already in standard form

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.320
--is negative 1.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.760
The coefficient here is 11.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.280
The constant term
is negative 12.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.870
Let's do another one
of these examples.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.060
I think you're getting
the general idea.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.840
Now let me do a complicated
example.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:09:00.450
So let's say I have 2a squared
b, minus 3ab squared, plus 5a

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:09.880
squared b squared, minus 2a
squared b squared, plus 4a

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.110
squared b, minus 5b squared.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.290
So here, I have a minus sign,
I have multiple variables.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.990
But let's just go through
this step by step.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.220
So the first thing
you want to do is

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.610
distribute this minus sign.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.470
So this first part we can just
write as 2a squared b, minus

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:34.760
3ab squared, plus 5a
squared b squared.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.180
And then we want to distribute
this minus sign, or multiply

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.760
all of these terms by negative
1 because we have

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.040
the minus out here.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:48.150
So minus 2a squared b squared
minus 4a squared b.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:53.300
And a negative times a negative
is plus 5b squared.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.690
And now we want to essentially
add like terms. So I have this

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.050
2a squared b squared term.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.880
So do I have any other terms
that have an a squared b

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.950
squared in them?

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.680
Or sorry, a squared b.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.750
I have to be very
careful here.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.860
Well, that's ab squared, no.
a squared b squared.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.360
Oh!

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.580
Here I have an a squared b.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.860
So let me write those
two down.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:24.240
So I have 2a squared b
minus 4a squared b.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.660
That's those two terms
right there.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.940
Let me go to orange.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.280
So here I have an
ab squared term.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.480
Now do I have any other
ab squared terms here?

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.550
No, no other ab squared,
so I'll just write

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.740
it: minus 3 ab squared.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.580
And then let's see, I have an a
squared b squared term here.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.520
Do I have any other ones?

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.390
Well, yeah sure, the
next term is.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.280
That's an a squared b
squared term, so let

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.500
me just write that.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.810
Plus 5a squared b
squared minus 2a

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.630
squared b squared, right?

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.860
I just wrote those two.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.120
And then finally I have that
last b squared term there,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.770
plus 5b squared.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.390
Now I can add them.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:19.800
So this first group right here
in this purplish color, 2 of

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.230
something minus 4 of something
is going to be negative 2 of

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:23.770
that something.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.130
So it's going to be negative
2a squared b.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.450
And then this term right here,
it's not going to add to

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.020
anything, 3ab squared.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.170
And then we can add these two
terms. If I have 5 of

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.870
something minus 2 of something,
I'm going to have 3

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.200
of that something.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.880
Plus 3a squared b squared.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:51.470
And then finally I have that
last term, plus 5b squared.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.000
We're done.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.170
We've simplified this
polynomial.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.990
Here, putting it in standard
form, you can think of it in

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.050
different ways.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.230
The way I'd like to think of
it is maybe the combined

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.290
degree of the term.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.290
Maybe we could put this one
first, but this is really

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.460
according to your taste.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:13.030
So this is 3a squared
b squared.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.360
And then you could pick whether
you want to put the a

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.680
squared b or the ab squared
terms first. 2a squared b.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.400
And then you have the
minus 3ab squared.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.320
And then we have just the
b squared term there.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.180
Plus 5b squared.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.440
And we're done.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.480
We've simplified this
polynomial.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.210
Now what I want to do next is
do a couple of examples of

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.860
constructing a polynomial.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.610
And really, the idea is to give
you an appreciation for

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.880
why polynomials are useful,
abstract representations.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.570
We're going to be using it all
the time, not only in algebra,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.460
but later in calculus, and
pretty much in everything.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.470
So they're really good things
to get familiar with.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.710
But what I want to do in these
four examples is represent the

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.360
area of each of these figures
with a polynomial.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.690
And I'll try to match the colors
as closely as I can.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.520
So over here, what's the area?

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.420
Well, this blue part right
here, the area

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.315
there is x times y.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.360
And then what's the area here?

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.670
It's going to be x times z.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:22.130
So plus x times z.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:22.930
But we have two of them!

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.370
We have one x times z,
and then we have

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.900
another x times z.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.710
So I could just add
an x times z here.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.390
Or I could just write, say,
plus 2 times x times z.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.350
And here we have a polynomial
that represents the area of

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.210
this figure right there.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.470
Now let's do this next one.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.460
What's the area here?

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.870
Well I have an a times a b.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.430
ab.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.140
This looks like an a times
a b again, plus ab.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:56.390
That looks like an ab
again, plus ab.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.090
I think they've drawn
it actually,

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.460
a little bit strange.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.560
Well, I'm going to ignore
this c right there.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.740
Maybe they're telling us that
this right here is c.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.230
Because that's the information
we would need.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.860
Maybe they're telling us that
this base right there, that

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.240
this right here, is c.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.850
Because that would help us.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.580
But if we assume that this is
another ab here, which I'll

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.890
assume for this purpose
of this video.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.380
And then we have that last ab.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.610
And then we have this
one a times c.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.550
This is the area
of this figure.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.580
And obviously we can add
these four terms.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.780
This is 4ab and then
we have plus ac.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.400
And I made the assumption that
this was a bit of a typo, that

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.310
that c where they were actually
telling us the width

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.240
of this little square
over here.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.210
We don't know if it's a square,
that's only if a and c

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.600
are the same.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.180
Now let's do this one.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.190
So how do we figure out the
area of the pink area?

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.010
Well we could take the area
the whole rectangle, which

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.730
would be 2xy, and then we could
subtract out the area of

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.240
these squares.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.060
So each square has an area of
x times x, or x squared.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.810
And we have two of
these squares, so

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.190
it's minus 2x squared.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.050
And then finally let's do
this one over here.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.430
So that looks like a dividing
line right there.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.250
So the area of this point, of
this area right there, is a

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.130
times b, so it's ab.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:43.680
And then the area over here
looks like it will also be ab.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.320
So plus ab.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.950
And the area over
here is also ab.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.170
So the area here is 3ab.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.700
Anyway, hopefully that gets
us pretty warmed up with

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.950
polynomials.
