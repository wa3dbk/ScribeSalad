00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.300
Before we move on, I just wanted
to make sure that you

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.140
understood that last point that
I made at the end of that

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.440
last video.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.000
We said that the pressure
inputting into this, that we

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.570
could view this cup with a hole
in it as essentially a

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.990
pipe, where the opening on the
top of the cup is the input to

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.200
the pipe, and this little
mini-hole is the output to the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.270
pipe, and we said that
this is a vacuum.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.380
Let's say this is vacuum
all around.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.640
I know when I drew it last time,
I closed it, but we have

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040
a vacuum everywhere.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.440
Since there's a vacuum
everywhere, the pressure at

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.330
this point P1 is
equal to zero.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.390
The point I wanted to make is
because we have a hole here,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.970
the pressure at that point at
P2 is also equal to zero.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.860
You can almost view it as maybe
the atmospheric pressure

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.730
at that point, but since
we're in a vacuum,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.430
that pressure is zero.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.150
That might have been a little
confusing to you, because you

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.680
said, well, wait, I thought at
depth, if I had a point at

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.220
that same height, that I would
actually have a pressure at

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.010
that point of rho gh.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.040
That's true.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.970
That's completely true.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.000
You do have an innate pressure
in the liquid at that point of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.750
rho gh, and actually, that's
what's causing the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.120
liquid to come out.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:20.790
But that's actually taken care
of in the potential energy

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.960
part of the equation.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.740
Let me rewrite Bernoulli's
equation.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:37.560
The input pressure plus rho g h1
plus rho V1 squared over 2

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:46.560
is equal to the output pressure
plus rho g h2 plus

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.360
PV2 squared over 2.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.110
I think you understand that this
term is pretty close to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.330
zero if the rate at which the
surface moves is very slow if

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.290
this surface area is much
bigger than this hole.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.920
It's like if you poked a hole in
Hoover Dam, that whole lake

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.900
is going to move down very, very
slowly, like 1 trillionth

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.110
of the speed at which the
water's coming out at the

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.190
other end, so you could
ignore this term.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.880
We also defined that the hole
was at zero, so the height of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.580
h2 is zero.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.320
It simplified down to the input
pressure, the pressure

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.540
at the top of the pipe, or at
the left side of the pipe,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.070
plus rho gh1.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.790
This isn't potential energy,
but this was kind of the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.560
potential energy term when we
derived Bernoulli's equation,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.750
and that equals the output
pressure, or the pressure at

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.120
the output of the hole, at the
right side of the hole, plus

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.660
the kinetic energy PV2.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.830
It's the kinetic energy term,
because it doesn't actually

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.840
doesn't add up completely to
kinetic energy, because we

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.980
manipulated it.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.780
I just wanted to really
make the point that

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.710
is definitely zero.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.950
I think that is clear
to you, because we

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.450
have a vacuum up here.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.800
The pressure at that point is
zero, so we can ignore that.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.070
The question is what is
the pressure here?

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.220
This pressure is zero, because
we have a vacuum here.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.520
If I were to say that the
pressure over here at this

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:32.470
hole is equal to pgh, then I
would have the situation where

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.810
pgh is equal to pgh plus
PV squared over 2.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.810
What does that mean?

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.930
When I say that that pressure
at the output of the pipe is

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.310
pgh, that means that
I'm applying some

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.750
pressure into that hole.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.800
Essentially, that pressure I'm
applying into the hole is

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.550
exactly just enough offset
to offset the

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.280
pressure at this depth.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.230
Because of that, none of
the water will move.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.170
You could imagine that if this
is the hole, let's say that's

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.760
the opening of the hole, and I
have some water particles, or

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.320
some fluid particles, let's say
that these are the atoms,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.160
we're saying innately at any
point that there is a pressure

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.360
at this point that's equal to
rho gh, but this is P2.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.830
How much pressure
am I exerting on

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.680
this end of the hole?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.300
If I exert rho gh at this end,
then these molecules that were

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.900
just about to exit the hole
aren't going to exit, because

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.940
they're going to get the same
pressure from every direction.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.370
What we said in the last video,
and I really want to--

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.880
because this is a subtle point--
is that the outside

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.270
pressure, being on the outside
part of the hole, is zero, and

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.550
because of that, we end up--
this term is zero, and we

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.410
essentially end up with that
the change in the potential

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.530
energy all becomes kinetic
energy, which is something

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.190
we're familiar with from
just our kinematics

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.520
and our energy equations.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.530
With that out of the way, let
me do another problem.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.260
Actually, I will do that next
problem in the next video,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.360
just so we have a clean
cut between videos.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.870
See you soon.
