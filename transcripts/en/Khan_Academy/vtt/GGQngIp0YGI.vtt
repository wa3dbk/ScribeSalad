00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.440
Welcome back.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.410
Now that we hopefully have a
little bit of an intuition of

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.360
what a limit is, or finding
the limit of a function is,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.150
let's do some problems.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.150
Some of these you might
actually see on your exams or

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.610
when you're actually trying to
solve a general limit problem.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.440
So let's say what is the
limit-- once again, my

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.020
pen is not working.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:31.740
What is the limit as
x approaches-- let's

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.960
say negative 1.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.170
And let me see, what's a good--
let's say my expression is--

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.480
I'll put it in parentheses
so it's cleaner.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:53.490
It's 2x plus 2 over x plus 1.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.070
So the first thing I would
always try to do is just say

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.930
what happens if I just stick x
straight into this expression?

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.810
What happens?

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.360
Well, what's 2x plus 2 when
x is equal to negative 1?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.790
2 times negative 1.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.090
2 times negative 1 plus 2
over negative 1 plus 1.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.030
Well, the numerator is negative
2 plus 2-- that equals 0--

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.540
over-- what's the denominator?

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.930
Negative 1 plus 1.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.150
Over 0.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.510
And do we know
what 0 over 0 is?

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.020
Well, no.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.250
It's undefined, right?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.320
So here's a case, just like
what we saw in that first

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.940
video, where the limit actually
can't equal what the expression

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.770
equals when you substitute x
for the number you're trying to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.560
find the limit of because you
get an undefined answer.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.750
So let's see if, using the
limit, we can come up

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.080
with a better answer for
what it's approaching.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.120
Well, since we're just starting
with these limit problems,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.580
let me draw a graph.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.700
And I think this is going
to give you the intuition

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.090
for what we're doing.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.560
It'll probably give
you the answer.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.180
But then I'll show you how
to solve this analytical.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:06.120
So if I draw a graph,
these are the axes.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.710
Actually, I'll do the
graphical and the analytical

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.130
at the same time.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.450
So I want to rewrite this
expression in a way that

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.020
maybe I can simplify it.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.840
So 2x plus 2.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.805
Isn't that the same thing
as 2 times x plus 1?

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.960
2 times x plus 1, right?

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.250
2x plus 2 is the same thing as
2 times x plus one, and then

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.190
all of that is over x plus 1.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.440
So as long as this expression
and this expression don't equal

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.040
0, it actually turns out that
this function-- let's say

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.260
this is f of x, right?

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.940
This function.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.660
Well, for every value other
than x is equal to negative

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.770
1, you could actually
cancel this and this out.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.360
And so really, we see that f of
x is equal to-- I need to find

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.750
a better tool-- f of x is equal
to 2 when x does not

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.010
equal negative 1.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.510
And we saw when x is equal to
negative 1, it's undefined.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:32.050
So undefined when
equals negative 1.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.470
So how would we graph that?

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.090
We showed that f of x is equal
to 2 when x does not equal

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.240
negative 1 and f of x
is undefined when x

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.630
equals negative 1.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.240
And once again, all I did is
kind of rewrite this exact

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.520
same function, right?

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.380
I showed that I could simplify
and I could divide the

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.930
numerator and denominator by x
plus 1 as long as x does not

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.200
equal negative 1, and that
otherwise, it's undefined.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.310
So let me graph this.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.200
I'm going to get a
different color.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.890
Maybe I'll go with red.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.280
So this is 2.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.660
So we see that x is-- and let
me say this is negative 1.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.080
So for every other value other
than negative 1, the value of

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.910
this, of f of x, is equal to 2.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:22.170
This is 1, this is 2,
this is 3, and so on.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.950
At negative 1, the
graph is undefined.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.160
So there's a hole there.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.940
And then we keep going
to the left-hand side.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.480
So if we're going to do the
limit, we can just visually

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.560
say, well, as x-- let me
do another color now.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.400
As x comes from the left-hand
side, what does f of x equal?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.660
Well, f of x is 2, 2, 2, 2,
2. f of x is equal to 2

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.230
until we get to exactly
negative 1, right?

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.700
And similarly, when we go
from the other hand, it's

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.940
the exact same thing.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.040
f of x is 2, 2, 2 until
we get to negative 1.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.310
So you'll see, and I'll make
sure you see it visually here,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.180
that the limit as approaches
negative 1 of 2x plus 2 over

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.900
x plus 1, it equals 2.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.500
Let me draw a line here
so you don't get messed

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.520
up with all of it.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.090
And I'm not formally, I guess,
proving here that the limit is

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.460
2, but I'm showing you kind of
an analytical way, and this is

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.040
actually how it tends to be
done in algebra class, is that

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.730
you tend to simplify the
expression so that you say, oh,

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.630
if there wasn't a hole here,
what would the f of

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.760
x equal, right?

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.910
And then you'd just
evaluate it at that point.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.790
I think this might give you a
little intuition, but this

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.050
isn't a formal solution.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.710
But unless you're asked to,
you tend not to be asked

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.800
for a formal solution.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.800
You actually just tend to ask
what the limit is, and this is

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.690
the way you could solve it.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.430
And actually another way that
you could-- I mean, I often

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.310
used to check my answers when I
used to do it is you could take

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.620
a calculator and try in-- what
happens when: what is f

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:08.035
of minus 1.001, right?

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:15.730
And you can also try what is
f of negative 0.999, right?

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.210
Because what you want to do is
you want to say, well, what

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.010
does the function equal when I
get really close to negative 1?

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.410
And then you could keep going
closer and closer to negative

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.490
1 and see what the function
approaches, and in this

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.750
case, you'll see that
it approaches 2.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.740
So let's do another problem.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:46.160
Well, let's say, what is
the limit as x approaches

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.570
0 of 1 over x?

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.360
I think here it might be useful
to draw this graph because

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.520
it'll give you a visual reason,
a visual represent-- actually,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.730
let's do it both ways.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.970
Let's say-- let's do it the
picking-numbers method because

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.580
I think that'll give you an
intuition and maybe it'll

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.500
help us draw the graph.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.410
So let's say that
this is f of x.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.580
f of x-- you can tell my
presentation is very

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.690
unplanned-- f of x is
equal to 1 over x.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.520
And we want to find the
limit as x approaches 0.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:26.870
So what is f of-- actually,
let's make a table.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.760
f of x.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.000
So clearly when x is equal
to 0, we don't know.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.310
It's undefined.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.340
1 over 0 is undefined.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:59.170
But what happens when
x equals minus 0.01?

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:04.050
Well, with minus 0.01, 1 over
minus 0.01, that is equal

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.750
to negative 100, right?

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:13.070
What happens when x is equal
to minus 0.001, right?

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.880
So we're getting closer
and closer to 0 from

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.240
the negative direction.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.430
Well, here it equals--
make sure my pen is

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.900
working, color right.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.540
Something's wrong with my tool.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.250
Now my computer's
breaking down.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.740
Let's see what's going on.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.260
I think my computer just froze.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.330
Well, I'm going to try to solve
this, and in the very next

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.730
video, I'm going to continue
on with this problem.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.650
So I'll actually see you in the
next presentation while I

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.770
figure out why my pen isn't
working, and then we'll

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.780
continue with this problem.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.290
See you very soon.
