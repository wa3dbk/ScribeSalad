00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.070
This is the last of the word
problems that Kortaggio had

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.470
sent, and they're all
interesting because they're

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.780
all involving distances
and rates and times.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.960
They all involve you having to
do a little bit of implicit

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.000
algebra without having to
explicitly solve for values of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.320
variables, and that's
why they're fun.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.070
So this one says Ann and
Betty, two cyclists,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.330
start simultaneously.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:28.080
Ann at point A and
Betty at point B.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.510
They travel to each other
at constant speeds.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.730
So let's say that Ann is
traveling with velocity A

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.130
and Betty is traveling
with velocity B.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.710
Constant speeds.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.020
They pass each other
in 30 minutes.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.900
OK, so they're going to
pass each other someplace

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.230
in between A and B.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.300
I'll just arbitrarily
draw that.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.100
They're going to pass
each other there.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.380
And what are these distances?

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.600
It took them 30 minutes to both
to get this point, right?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.620
They pass each other
in 30 minutes.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.740
And Ann, headed from point
B, arrives there in

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.170
another 20 minutes.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.970
OK, so this distance
takes Ann 30 minutes.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.240
So what is the actual distance?

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.900
Well, it's always useful to
write distance is equal

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.540
to rate times time.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.040
So what's the actual
distance she traveled?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.990
Well, the rate is va.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.780
She traveled a rate of va and
her time -- they tell us -- it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.490
took her 30 minutes
to get there.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.830
So va times 30.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.910
Let's say this velocity
is expressed in minutes.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.970
Fair enough.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.055
And then Ann, headed for
point B, arrives there

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:38.950
in another 20 minutes.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.390
So this is going to take
her another 20 minutes.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.670
So this distance
right here is what?

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.366
She's going at the
same velocity, but it

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:47.290
takes her 20 minutes.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.400
So the distance is
velocity times time.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.230
So it's va times 20, 20va.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.610
Fair enough.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.770
How many minutes after Ann
arrives at point B will

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.860
Betty arrive at point A?

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.380
So Betty was going in this
direction, they meet right

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.110
here, and then she keeps
going and hits point A.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.390
So the key realization here is
that this took Ann 30 minutes

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.670
to get here, but it also took
Betty 30 minutes to get here.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.920
So what's this distance in
terms of Betty's velocity?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.980
What's this distance?

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.150
Well, distance is equal
to rate times time.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.970
It took Betty 30 minutes
to go this distance

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.660
at a velocity of vb.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.970
So it took her 30vb meters,
or whatever, actually.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.490
We don't even have to
specify the units.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.890
Whatever the units
the velocity is in.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.580
If it's in meters per
minute, then this is

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.040
the distance in meters.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.320
This distance is 30vb.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.730
Right?

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.860
So essentially, we just have to
figure out how long it takes

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.920
her to travel this remaining
distance and we would

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.850
have solved the problem.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.410
So how can we do that?

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.030
Well, we can already set
up a relationship between

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.660
vb and va, because this
distance is the same.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.370
It doesn't matter how
fast you travel it, the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.750
distance doesn't change.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.880
So we know that 30 times
Betty's velocity is equal to 20

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.830
times Ann's velocity, 20va.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.230
And so if we wanted to express
Ann's velocity in terms of

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.940
Betty's velocity -- let's just
do it that way -- if we divide

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.420
both sides by 20 we get 3/2 of
Betty's velocity is equal

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.730
to Ann's velocity.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.080
Fair enough.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.040
So what is this distance in
terms of Betty's velocity?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.070
We know it in terms
of Ann's velocity.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.630
In terms of Ann's velocity,
it's 30 times Ann's velocity.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.870
Right?

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.280
So what is 30 times Ann's
velocity in terms of

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.770
Betty's velocity?

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.510
Well, if we multiply this times
30, that's 30 times Ann's

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.270
velocity, so we can multiply
both sides of this times 30.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.280
So if you multiply 30 times
here and times thirty,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.980
this is the distance.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.150
This distance right here.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.360
Ann's velocity
times 30 minutes.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.620
It took her 30 minutes
to travel that far.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.620
So this is the same distance
expressed in Betty's velocity.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.600
So 30 times 3 is 90
divided by 2 is 45.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.450
So it's 45vb.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.694
So this distance
up here is 45vb.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.010
So distance is equal to
rate times -- so this

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.490
is rate -- times time.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.730
So this is how many
minutes it took Betty to

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.270
travel this distance.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.190
So what is the
question asking us?

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.230
How many minutes after
Ann reaches point B will

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.970
Betty arrive at point A.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.755
So they both reach right here.

00:04:44.755 --> 00:04:49.270
In another 20 minutes,
Ann gets here.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.990
And in another 45 minutes,
Betty will get over there.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.750
Another 45 minutes.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.820
So it takes Ann 20
minutes to get here.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.520
It takes Betty 45 minutes to
get here, after their meeting

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.630
right at the center.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.000
So it's going to take
Betty another 25 minutes.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.190
Right?

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.110
After 20 minutes Ann is here
and then we have to wait

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.810
another 25 minutes for Betty
to get here, 45 minutes

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.720
after this meeting.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.250
So the answer is 25 minutes.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.430
How many minutes after Ann
arrives at point B will

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.980
Betty arrive at point A.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.060
Yes, 25 minutes.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.580
They could have just asked how
many minutes after the meeting

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.250
will it take Betty
to reach point A.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.965
It would have been 45.

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:30.700
But they want to know
how many more minutes

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.920
after Ann gets there.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.310
Anyway, I thought you would
find that useful and, a final

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.150
time, thanks to Kortaggio
for sending that problem.
