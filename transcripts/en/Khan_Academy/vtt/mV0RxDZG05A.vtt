00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.170
A single postage
stamp costs $0.44.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.145
How much would a roll
of 1,000 stamps cost?

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:09.020
And there's really a
couple of ways to do it.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.450
And I'll do it both ways just
to show you they both work.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.184
One is kind of a
faster way, but I

00:00:13.184 --> 00:00:15.100
want to make sure you
understand why it works.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.340
And then we'll verify
that it actually gives us

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.920
the right answer using maybe
the more traditional way

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.600
of multiplying decimals.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900
So we're starting at $0.44.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.540
I'll just write it as 0.44.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.700
Well, that's one stamp.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.390
So this is 1 stamp.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.010
I'll write it like
this, 1 stamp.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.270
How much would 10 stamps cost?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.900
Well, if 1 stamp is
$0.44, then 10 stamps,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.740
we could move the decimal
to the right one place.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.560
And so it would be--
and now this leading 0

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.040
is not that useful.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.290
So it would now be $4.4.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.420
Or if you want to make it
clear, it would be $4.40.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.310
Now, what happens if you
want to have 100 stamps?

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.250
Well, the same idea
is going to happen.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.070
We're now taking 10
times more, so we're

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.500
going to move the decimal
to the right once.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.962
So 100 stamps are
going to cost $44.

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:08.420
And this should
make sense for you.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.670
If 1 stamp is 44/100
of $1, then 100 stamps

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.124
are going to be 44/100
of $100, or $44.

00:01:19.124 --> 00:01:20.540
Or you could view
it as we've just

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.430
moved the decimal
over one place.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.340
So if we want 1,000 stamps,
we'd move the decimal

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.034
to the right one more time.

00:01:28.034 --> 00:01:29.450
Moving the decimal
to the right is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.330
equivalent to multiplying by 10.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.250
So then it would be $440.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.670
And we could add another
trailing zero just

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.482
to make clear that there's
no cents over here.

00:01:40.482 --> 00:01:42.190
So if you wanted to
do it really quickly,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.020
you could have
started with $0.44.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.510
And you say look, I'm
not multiplying by 10.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.280
I'm not multiplying by 100.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.030
I'm multiplying by 1,000.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.260
So you're going to have to
put another trailing zero

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.070
over here.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.750
And you would move the decimal
from over here to over here.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.100
You've essentially
multiplied this times 10

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.720
times 10 times 10,
which is 1,000.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.150
So then this would become $440.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.705
And let's verify that this works
exactly the same if we multiply

00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:16.730
it the traditional way, the
way we multiply decimals.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.980
So if you have
1,000 times $0.44.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.440
So you start over here.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.560
4 times 0 is 0.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.960
4 times 0 is 0.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.240
4 times 0 is 0.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.970
4 times 1 is 4.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.840
Or, you could just say,
hey, this was 4 times 1,000.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.830
Then we're going to
go one place over.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.830
So we're going to add a 0.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.630
And once again, we're going
to have 4 times 0 is 0.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.270
4 times 0 is 0.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.840
4 times 0 is 0.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.470
4 times 1 is 4.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.740
Or we just did 4 times 1,000.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.400
So that is 4,000 if you
don't include this 0

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.760
that we added here ahead
of time because we're

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.830
going one place to the left.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.160
And then we have nothing left.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.020
I haven't at all thought
about the decimals right now.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.980
So far I really just viewed
it as 1,000 times 44.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.180
I've been ignoring the decimal.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.146
So if it was 1,000 times 44,
we would get 0 plus 0 is 0.

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:11.920
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.820
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.500
4 plus 0 is 4.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.857
4 plus nothing is 4.

00:03:16.857 --> 00:03:19.190
And if you ignore the decimal,
that makes a lot of sense

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.040
because 1,000 times 4 is 4,000.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.290
And 1,000 times 40
would be 40,000.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.100
So you would get 44,000.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.850
But this, of
course, is not a 44.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.490
This is a 44/100.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.930
We have, between the
two numbers, two numbers

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.180
behind the decimal point.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.740
So we need to have
two numbers behind

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.260
or to the right of the
decimal point in our answer,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.640
so one, two right over there.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.440
So once again, we get
$440 for the 1,000 stamps.
