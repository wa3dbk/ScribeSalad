00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.830
Find the perimeter
of this hexagon.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.660
So the perimeter just means
the distance around the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.860
object, or if you add up all of
the lengths of the sides of

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.970
the object, so we're going to
add up all of the lengths of

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.530
sides of this hexagon, and a
hexagon is just a six-sided

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.800
geometrical shape like this.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.180
So to find the perimeter, we
just need to find the distance

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.650
around the hexagon, which is
going to be the sum of all of

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.930
the lengths of the sides.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.800
So the perimeter is going to be
24-- so how many of these

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.950
do we have?

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.670
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six 24's, which makes

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.170
sense, because a hexagon
has six sides.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.400
So we're going to have-- let
me write this a little bit

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:51.320
bigger-- 24 plus 24 plus 24 plus
24 plus 24-- and that's

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.300
five 24's-- plus 24.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450
So let's add them all
at the same time.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.820
We could've done it piece by
piece, but let's just go

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.490
straight ahead.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.680
So let's go first to
the ones place.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:12.360
So 4 plus 4 is 8, 8 plus 4 is
12, 12 plus 4 is 16, 16 plus 4

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.060
is 20, 20 plus 4 is 24.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.050
And now we're in
the tens place.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:30.830
2 plus 2 is 4 plus 2 is 6 plus
2 is 8 plus 2 is 10 plus 2 is

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.480
12 plus 2 is 14.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.650
So the sum of these
six 24's is 144.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.310
That is the perimeter.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.130
And when we learn
multiplication, if you haven't

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.020
learned it already, you could've
down this simpler.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.380
You just say you have six 24's,
so this would actually

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.850
be a multiplication problem
of 6 times 24.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.340
If you don't know how
to do that just yet,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.390
don't worry about it.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.690
You can just add them all up.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.200
You get 144.
