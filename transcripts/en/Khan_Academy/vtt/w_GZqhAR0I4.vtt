00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.640
So in the last couple of videos
we've been looking at

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.670
the balance sheet of what
I called Bank A.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.730
And we said it has
these assets.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.230
And the asset in particular
we're going to focus on is

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.060
this $4 billion in residential
CDOs right here.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.250
But anyway, its total assets
were $26 billion, at least

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.000
it's telling us that its total
assets are $26 billion

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.980
according to its accounting
on its balance sheet.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.900
Its liabilities are
$23 billion.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.610
And so if you just subtract the
$23 from the $26 billion,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.310
you get a book value
of its equity.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.560
If you believe all of the
numbers on the company's

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.640
balance sheet, the company
is worth $3 billion.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.150
That's what the shareholders
own.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.470
They own this equity stake.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.280
And if there are 500 million
shares, that's $6.00 for each

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.120
of those shares.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.330
And in the last video we talked
about if the market is

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.790
actually trading at $12.00 a
share, if people exchanging

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.440
those shares between
themselves.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.460
Remember, the secondary market,
the stock market, most

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.170
of that is between two people
who are unrelated to the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.070
company, trading the
shares of stock.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.780
It's not a transaction
with the company.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.950
There are transactions every now
and then with the company,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.910
and that's why the stock
price is important.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.910
But for the most part what you
see every day when you get a

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.290
quote is just the transaction
between two

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.470
unaffiliated parties.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.790
It could be between
me and you.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.800
I have my E-Trade account, you
have your Charles Schwab

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.130
account, we just traded
the stock.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.220
For that second, we set the
price for whatever, the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.180
value of bank A.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.295
So I said if the value the
market is placing on a share

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:32.640
is $12.00 per share, that's
a $6 billion market cap.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.950
The market, at least for that
moment, or at least the person

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.410
who just transacted or just
traded those shares, is saying

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.760
that, no I don't think that
this company only has $3

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.800
billion of equity, it actually
has $6 billion of equity.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.220
And it might be because they
have some kind of great brand,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.900
the equivalent of charisma and
good looks, that can't be

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.270
quantified on a balance sheet.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.880
Or maybe one of these assets
are worth more.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.120
Maybe they've appreciated since
the the last time to the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.310
bank wrote down their
balance sheet.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.190
Or the last time that the bank
kind of a evaluated the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.570
asset's worth.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.790
And then we had another
situation.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.670
And this is very relevant
to what's going on

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.120
in the world today.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.060
Well what happens if
the market price is

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.389
below the book price?

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.990
So, that was the case where
the stock is trading

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.250
at $3.00 per share.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.450
And $3.00 per share times half
a billion shares, that's a

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.390
$1.5 billion dollar market
value of its equity.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.120
I think that's what I
wanted a write here,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.680
market value of equity.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.380
And what is the market
then saying?

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.660
Or at least the person who's
buying or selling the share

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.740
right at that moment, what
are they saying?

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.330
Well they're saying that, OK
Bank A, that's nice, you say

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.530
that your assets minus your
liabilities are worth $3

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.640
billion, but I don't
think that's true.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.080
I think your assets minus your
liabilities are $1.5 billion.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.780
And let's say, we can't read
anyone's brain, we don't know

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.730
why they think that.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.260
Maybe they think there
are fewer assets.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.980
Maybe they think there
are more liabilities.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.740
But let's say that we do
read someone's brain.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.650
They're like you know where I
think you're doing a little

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.450
bit of shadiness?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.960
I think you're doing it on
this line right here.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.970
I don't think that thing
is worth $4 billion.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.400
I think that thing is
worth $2.5 billion.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.520
And if this is worth $2.5
billion, then your total

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.370
assets are what?

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.090
There are a billion
and a half left.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.850
And so your assets are
$24.5 billion.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.990
I know this is a little
bit messy.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.290
But if the market is saying that
this is a $3.00 stock,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.290
$3.00 per share, then that
says your market

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.060
value is $1.5 billion.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.610
And we don't know why the
market is saying that.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.460
They're saying that because they
think that this thing is

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.190
not worth $4 billion.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.600
They think it is worth
$2.5 billion.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.610
So they think it's worth a
billion and a half less.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.190
If this soon. is worth $2.5
billion, then all of this will

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.960
add up to, if I did my math
right, $24.5 billion, minus

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.140
$23 billion.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.710
And then, that gets you to the
market value the equity.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.090
So let's call that
market equity.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.950
The market value equity
of $1.5 billion.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.880
So this raises a very
interesting question.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.950
How do people decide, or how
do especially the banks

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.769
themselves, decide what some
of these assets are worth?

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.959
And in particular, these CDOs.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.310
Well there's a couple
of ways to do it.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.170
And there are all kinds of
different schools of economic

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.200
philosophy.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.750
You could put here what
you paid for it.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.330
Maybe the bank originally paid
$4 billion back when real

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.720
estate could only go up,
or so people thought.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.960
And all of these CDOs looked
like these great high yielding

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.040
instruments.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.870
Based on those assumptions,
the bank says, I'll pay $4

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.560
billion for it.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.280
They put on the books for $4
billion and they never kind of

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.020
reassessed it.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.200
So they just put the
$4 billion at cost.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.170
And then people would
have every right to

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.240
question that number.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.840
And they'll be like, well
that doesn't make sense.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.230
Since then, we know that housing
prices can go down.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.550
We know that especially since
this was the riskiest slice of

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.730
the CDOs that these could be
completely wiped out, even if

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.570
we only have a small number
of defaults on mortgages.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.240
And we know that you as the CFO
or the CEO of your bank

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.220
have every incentive to not
write the real value here

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.640
because you want to prop up the
stock because you have a

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.120
lot of options in the company.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.100
And you are evaluated
on the stock price.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.300
But anyway, maybe I'll make
another video on incentives.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.590
So that's one way.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.350
My phone is ringing.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.590
I'll answer it later.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.790
I'm too worked up to answer
the phone right now.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.930
I need to channel this
energy into this.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.090
But anyway, so that's one way of
saying it, the cost basis.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.850
And now I'm going to introduce
some words that you might have

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.100
heard on the news.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.580
I was going to say mark-to-model
and then my

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.140
brain was going to say
mark-to-market.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.580
Mark-to-model.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.310
So what this says is I'm going
to mark these assets, I'm

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.070
going to value these assets,
based on a model that I have.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.900
I hired a bunch of PhDs
from the best

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.840
schools in the country.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.540
These are rocket scientists and
some of them actually are.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.700
They can put the man
on the moon.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.750
And they're going to make fancy
computer models with

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.800
some assumptions.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.560
And those are going
to spit out what

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.590
these things are worth.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.130
So they're going to model the
behavior, how many of these

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.920
mortgages are going to
default, all of that.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.810
And those numbers spit out a
number and maybe they say that

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.680
they're worth $3 billion.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.360
And if that happened at any
period, the company would

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.430
actually have to restate this.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.050
They would actually have to
say, oh this wasn't $4

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.020
billion, we're going to
have to restate that.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.380
We're going to take
a write down.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.180
And you've heard this
a lot when banks

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.770
report their earnings.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.920
We took a write down.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.550
We thought we had a
$4 billion asset.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.410
Maybe that's what we paid
for it originally.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.050
We re-ran our model based on
new assumptions, so were

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.650
marking to model, now we have
a $3 billion asset according

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.580
to our new assumptions
in our model.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.310
So we are doing a $1
billion write off.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.460
To go from $4 billion, what we
originally had on the books,

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.880
maybe that was our old
assumptions in our model, to

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.010
our new model.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.510
And immediately, you should
be suspicious of that.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.930
Because once again, you're being
dependent on the banks

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.230
to report on themselves.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.440
Sure, these might be
well intentioned.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.950
But at the end of the day, this
value is being set by a

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.940
model where the assumptions into
that model, and frankly I

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.180
don't care how fancy your model
is, and how many PhDs

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.300
the people who made the model
have. At the end of the day,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.020
you can always rig this
number based on the

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.070
assumptions you make.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.420
And frankly, the market has no
transparency you as far as

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.720
what assumptions you did make.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.200
So it's very hard to believe.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.080
But it's probably a better guess
than the $4 billion.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.180
Especially, when they're
taking it down.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.020
And I'll do a whole video on
this later on, you also have

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.470
to question why they keep
taking write downs.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.080
Why their models keep
having to make

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.560
more pessimistic scenarios.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.410
Maybe they're just
buying time.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.480
Maybe the first time they run
their model, they actually say

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.800
it's worth zero.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.970
In which case they
have zero equity.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.440
Because if this is worth zero,
they only have $22 billion in

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.600
assets and $23 billion in
liabilities, which means they

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.020
have negative assets.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.430
Which means that they
are insolvent.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.710
Which means that they
should go bankrupt.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.720
But they don't want
to do that.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.430
They don't want to be
responsible for running the

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.110
company into the ground.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.210
So they don't want to admit
all at once that these are

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:19.730
worth zero.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.640
Maybe they'll admit it's worth
not four, it's worth three.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.130
But then they'll go to the
market and they'll try to

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:25.730
raise more money.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.910
And I'll explain that
in a little bit.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.550
Because I know that can
get very complicated.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.680
So this is mark-to-model.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.669
You've heard a lot about it.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.780
It's not a fancy concept.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.789
The models might be fancy.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.549
But it's just like, I'm going to
make my own assumptions to

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.630
figure out what they're worth.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.929
And as you can imagine, they
aren't the most credible

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.510
assumptions of the
value of this.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.500
The other idea is
mark-to-market.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.870
And this essentially says, well
if this is an instrument

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.860
that is traded in some market.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.250
Let's say that these CDOs, and
at least they used to be,

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.300
let's say that they are
traded in some market.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.420
That you actually assigned
the market price.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:12.920
So maybe I have a a billion
of these CDOs.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.020
And the market price of those
CDOs is a $1.50 per CDO.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.290
I'm just making up numbers.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.730
In which case, the market
value of them would be a

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.200
billion and a half.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.160
So if you did mark-to-market,
you would have to make this

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.680
into a billion and a half.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.590
Then you would have to do
another write down.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.370
Now, why does doesn't
everyone do that?

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.130
I actually think that's
a very good question.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.880
I'll tell you why the banks
don't want to do that.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.220
Well first of all, some of these
markets, since no one

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.300
wants to buy these things,
because maybe they think

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.220
they're actually worth zero, the
markets have disappeared.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.260
And the few people that are
selling them, they're usually

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.240
selling them when they are
distressed in some way.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.230
So it's a quote unquote
fire sale.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.030
So people are arguing that the
market price is not reflective

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.770
of the true value of
these securities.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.440
They're arguing that the few
people who transacted did it

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.310
out of desperation.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:09.636
So that $1.5 billion value of
these CDOs, the market value

00:10:09.636 --> 00:10:12.000
of these CDOs, is not
truly accurate.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.170
So these companies are saying,
no I cannot admit what the

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.680
market, what capitalism, is
telling me what the price is.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.340
Even though these people are
the same people who've been

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.560
for the last 30 years saying
let the market determine

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.180
everything.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.540
I make $20 million a year
because I'm a capitalist and

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.850
because I have taken risk.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.020
And that I deserve that money.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.050
And these are the same people
now, they're very adamant,

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.540
that says, oh don't believe
the market price.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.440
Because the market
is wrong now.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.250
Our PhDs are correct.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.730
And if you think about
it, it's a very

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.970
communist way of thinking.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.160
Because in communist
governments, they didn't

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.450
believe in markets, they
believed in hiring the

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.350
smartest people that they
could find, i.e.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:57.250
the PhDs of their relative
countries, to essentially

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.890
engineer their markets
to determine

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.110
what things are worth.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.900
Without letting the market
set the price.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.990
Anyway, I'm not going
to vent on.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.330
That is supposed to
instruct you.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.730
As opposed to make you angry.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.540
Although I think just by
learning about this,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.610
you might get angry.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.500
But anyway, that's what
mark-to-market means.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.670
And I just realized I'm out of
time again because of my rant.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.250
So I will see you in
the next video.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.450
And we'll continue to learn
the nuance of everything

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.260
that's going on.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.510
