00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.870
In this video I want to do a
bunch of examples of factoring

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.590
a second degree polynomial,
which is

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.870
often called a quadratic.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.650
Sometimes a quadratic
polynomial, or just a

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.850
quadratic itself, or quadratic
expression, but all it means

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.300
is a second degree polynomial.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.440
So something that's going to
have a variable raised to the

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.080
second power.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.460
In this case, in all of the
examples we'll do, it'll be x.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.740
So let's say I have the
quadratic expression, x

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.280
squared plus 10x, plus 9.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.870
And I want to factor it into the
product of two binomials.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.520
How do we do that?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.440
Well, let's just think about
what happens if we were to

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.690
take x plus a, and multiply
that by x plus b.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.050
If we were to multiply these
two things, what happens?

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.090
Well, we have a little bit
of experience doing this.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.170
This will be x times x, which is
x squared, plus x times b,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:12.690
which is bx, plus a times x,
plus a times b-- plus ab.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.800
Or if we want to add these two
in the middle right here,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.890
because they're both
coefficients of x.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.102
We could right this as x squared
plus-- I can write it

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:29.700
as b plus a, or a plus
b, x, plus ab.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.390
So in general, if we assume that
this is the product of

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.765
two binomials, we see that this
middle coefficient on the

00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:43.250
x term, or you could say the
first degree coefficient

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.040
there, that's going to be
the sum of our a and b.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.360
And then the constant term is
going to be the product

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.520
of our a and b.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.290
Notice, this would map
to this, and this

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.790
would map to this.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.600
And, of course, this is the
same thing as this.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.590
So can we somehow pattern
match this to that?

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:14.060
Is there some a and b where
a plus b is equal to 10?

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.070
And a times b is equal to 9?

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.850
Well, let's just think about
it a little bit.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.470
What are the factors of 9?

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.770
What are the things that a
and b could be equal to?

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.170
And we're assuming that
everything is an integer.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.350
And normally when we're
factoring, especially when

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.950
we're beginning to factor,
we're dealing

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.580
with integer numbers.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.080
So what are the factors of 9?

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.730
They're 1, 3, and 9.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.000
So this could be a 3 and a 3,
or it could be a 1 and a 9.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.630
Now, if it's a 3 and a 3, then
you'll have 3 plus 3-- that

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.840
doesn't equal 10.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.760
But if it's a 1 and a
9, 1 times 9 is 9.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.670
1 plus 9 is 10.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.570
So it does work.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.190
So a could be equal to 1, and
b could be equal to 9.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.920
So we could factor this
as being x plus 1,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.970
times x plus 9.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.850
And if you multiply these two
out, using the skills we

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.970
developed in the last few
videos, you'll see that it is

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.880
indeed x squared plus
10x, plus 9.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.150
So when you see something like
this, when the coefficient on

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.070
the x squared term, or the
leading coefficient on this

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.650
quadratic is a 1, you can just
say, all right, what two

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.530
numbers add up to this
coefficient right here?

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.870
And those same two numbers, when
you take their product,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.660
have to be equal to 9.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.510
And of course, this has to
be in standard form.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.000
Or if it's not in standard form,
you should put it in

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.500
that form, so that you can
always say, OK, whatever's on

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.530
the first degree coefficient,
my a and b

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.300
have to add to that.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.890
Whatever's my constant term, my
a times b, the product has

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.370
to be that.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.150
Let's do several
more examples.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.510
I think the more examples
we do the more

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.630
sense this'll make.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.700
Let's say we had x squared
plus 10x, plus-- well, I

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.100
already did 10x, let's do a
different number-- x squared

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.366
plus 15x, plus 50.

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:17.470
And we want to factor this.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.339
Well, same drill.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.600
We have an x squared term.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.130
We have a first degree term.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.960
This right here should be
the sum of two numbers.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.620
And then this term, the constant
term right here,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.870
should be the product
of two numbers.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.640
So we need to think of two
numbers that, when I multiply

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.220
them I get 50, and when
I add them, I get 15.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.910
And this is going to be a bit of
an art that you're going to

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.530
develop, but the more practice
you do, you're going to see

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.730
that it'll start to
come naturally.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.330
So what could a and b be?

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.975
Let's think about the
factors of 50.

00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:52.230
It could be 1 times 50.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.072
2 times 25.

00:04:55.072 --> 00:04:57.520
Let's see, 4 doesn't
go into 50.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.450
It could be 5 times 10.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.580
I think that's all of them.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.920
Let's try out these numbers,
and see if any of

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.310
these add up to 15.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.630
So 1 plus 50 does not
add up to 15.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.160
2 plus 25 does not
add up to 15.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.260
But 5 plus 10 does
add up to 15.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.280
So this could be 5 plus 10, and
this could be 5 times 10.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.760
So if we were to factor this,
this would be equal to x plus

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.630
5, times x plus 10.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.840
And multiply it out.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.710
I encourage you to multiply this
out, and see that this is

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.660
indeed x squared plus
15x, plus 10.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.320
In fact, let's do it. x
times x, x squared. x

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.800
times 10, plus 10x.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.600
5 times x, plus 5x.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.620
5 times 10, plus 50.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.220
Notice, the 5 times
10 gave us the 50.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.890
The 5x plus the 10x is giving
us the 15x in between.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.560
So it's x squared plus
15x, plus 50.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.440
Let's up the stakes a little
bit, introduce some negative

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.040
signs in here.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.890
Let's say I had x squared
minus 11x, plus 24.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.610
Now, it's the exact
same principle.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.580
I need to think of two numbers,
that when I add them,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.570
need to be equal
to negative 11.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.150
a plus b need to be equal
to negative 11.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:37.900
And a times b need to
be equal to 24.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.290
Now, there's something for
you to think about.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.960
When I multiply both of these
numbers, I'm getting a

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.080
positive number.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.960
I'm getting a 24.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.260
That means that both of these
need to be positive, or both

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.380
of these need to be negative.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.050
That's the only way I'm going to
get a positive number here.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.290
Now, if when I add them, I get
a negative number, if these

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.720
were positive, there's no way I
can add two positive numbers

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.280
and get a negative number, so
the fact that their sum is

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.750
negative, and the fact that
their product is positive,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.420
tells me that both a
and b are negative.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.200
a and b have to be negative.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.730
Remember, one can't be negative
and the other one

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.710
can't be positive, because the
product would be negative.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.687
And they both can't be positive,
because when you add

00:07:22.687 --> 00:07:24.520
them it would get you
a positive number.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.500
So let's just think about
what a and b can be.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.990
So two negative numbers.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.260
So let's think about
the factors of 24.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.140
And we'll kind of have to think
of the negative factors.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:44.670
But let me see, it could be 1
times 24, 2 times 11, 3 times

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.070
8, or 4 times 6.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.220
Now, which of these when I
multiply these-- well,

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.380
obviously when I multiply
1 times 24, I get 24.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.910
When I get 2 times 11-- sorry,
this is 2 times 12.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:07:59.790
I get 24.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.090
So we know that all these,
the products are 24.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.470
But which two of these, which
two factors, when I add them,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.790
should I get 11?

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.880
And then we could say,
let's take the

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.450
negative of both of those.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.470
So when you look at these,
3 and 8 jump out.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.150
3 times 8 is equal to 24.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.810
3 plus 8 is equal to 11.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.680
But that doesn't quite
work out, right?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.510
Because we have a negative
11 here.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.690
But what if we did negative
3 and negative 8?

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:37.789
Negative 3 times negative 8
is equal to positive 24.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:43.580
Negative 3 plus negative 8
is equal to negative 11.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.600
So negative 3 and
negative 8 work.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:53.840
So if we factor this, x squared
minus 11x, plus 24 is

00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:02.940
going to be equal to x minus
3, times x minus 8.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.270
Let's do another
one like that.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.330
Actually, let's mix it
up a little bit.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:19.810
Let's say I had x squared
plus 5x, minus 14.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.770
So here we have a different
situation.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.460
The product of my two numbers is
negative, right? a times b

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.190
is equal to negative 14.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.920
My product is negative.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.930
That tells me that one of them
is positive, and one of them

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:33.910
is negative.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:39.200
And when I add the two, a plus
b, it'd be equal to 5.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.360
So let's think about
the factors of 14.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.300
And what combinations of them,
when I add them, if one is

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.560
positive and one is negative,
or I'm really kind of taking

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.780
the difference of the
two, do I get 5?

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.450
So if I take 1 and 14-- I'm just
going to try out things--

00:09:53.450 --> 00:10:01.820
1 and 14, negative 1 plus
14 is negative 13.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.260
Negative 1 plus 14 is 13.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.430
So let me write all of the
combinations that I could do.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.440
And eventually your brain
will just zone in on it.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.490
So you've got negative 1
plus 14 is equal to 13.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.460
And 1 plus negative 14 is
equal to negative 13.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.380
So those don't work.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.950
That doesn't equal 5.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.860
Now what about 2 and 7?

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.600
If I do negative 2-- let me do
this in a different color-- if

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.290
I do negative 2 plus 7,
that is equal to 5.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:35.750
We're done!

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.670
That worked!

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.440
I mean, we could have tried 2
plus negative 7, but that'd be

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.070
equal to negative 5, so that
wouldn't have worked.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.960
But negative 2 plus 7 works.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.590
And negative 2 times
7 is negative 14.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.600
So there we have it.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.210
We know it's x minus
2, times x plus 7.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.330
That's pretty neat.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.950
Negative 2 times 7
is negative 14.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.880
Negative 2 plus 7
is positive 5.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.680
Let's do several more of these,
just to really get well

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.520
honed this skill.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.360
So let's say we have x squared
minus x, minus 56.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.570
So the product of the two
numbers have to be minus 56,

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.620
have to be negative 56.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.430
And their difference, because
one is going to be positive,

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.280
and one is going to be
negative, right?

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.350
Their difference has
to be negative 1.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.130
And the numbers that immediately
jump out in my

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.900
brain-- and I don't know if they
jump out in your brain,

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.740
we just learned this in
the times tables--

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.480
56 is 8 times 7.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480
I mean, there's other numbers.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.950
It's also 28 times 2.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.140
It's all sorts of things.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.300
But 8 times 7 really jumped
out into my brain, because

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.470
they're very close
to each other.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.730
And we need numbers that are
very close to each other.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.430
And one of these has to be
positive, and one of these has

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.810
to be negative.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.250
Now, the fact that when their
sum is negative, tells me that

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.460
the larger of these two should
probably be negative.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.350
So if we take negative
8 times 7, that's

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.320
equal to negative 56.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.470
And then if we take negative
8 plus 7, that is equal to

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.100
negative 1, which is exactly the
coefficient right there.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.490
So when I factor this, this
is going to be x minus 8,

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.690
times x plus 7.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.695
This is often one of the hardest
concepts people learn

00:12:21.695 --> 00:12:23.920
in algebra, because it
is a bit of an art.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.710
You have to look at all of the
factors here, play with the

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.710
positive and negative signs,
see which of those factors

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.900
when one is positive, one is
negative, add up to the

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.590
coefficient on the x term.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.860
But as you do more and more
practice, you'll see that

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.280
it'll become a bit
of second nature.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.350
Now let's step up the stakes
a little bit more.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.140
Let's say we had negative x
squared-- everything we've

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.040
done so far had a positive
coefficient, a positive 1

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.690
coefficient on the
x squared term.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.590
But let's say we had a
negative x squared

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.440
minus 5x, plus 24.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.910
How do we do this?

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.420
Well, the easiest way I can
think of doing it is factor

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.670
out a negative 1, and then it
becomes just like the problems

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.260
we've been doing before.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.660
So this is the same thing as
negative 1 times positive x

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.990
squared, plus 5x, minus 24.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.300
Right?

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.080
I just factored a
negative 1 out.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.180
You can multiply negative 1
times all of these, and you'll

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.690
see it becomes this.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.555
Or you could factor the negative
1 out and divide all

00:13:23.555 --> 00:13:25.000
of these by negative 1.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.760
And you get that right there.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.360
Now, same game as before.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.510
I need two numbers, that when
I take their product I get

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.690
negative 24.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.125
So one will be positive,
one will be negative.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.770
When I take their sum,
it's going to be 5.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:48.850
So let's think about
24 is 1 and 24.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:55.750
Let's see, if this is negative 1
and 24, it'd be positive 23,

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.540
if it was the other way around,
it'd be negative 23.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.500
Doesn't work.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.210
What about 2 and 12?

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.530
Well, if this is negative--
remember, one of these has to

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.040
be negative.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.570
If the 2 is negative, their
sum would be 10.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.750
If the 12 is negative, their
sum would be negative 10.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.300
Still doesn't work.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.290
3 and 8.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.850
If the 3 is negative,
their sum will be 5.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.910
So it works!

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:24.620
So if we pick negative 3 and
8, negative 3 and 8 work.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.630
Because negative
3 plus 8 is 5.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.510
Negative 3 times 8
is negative 24.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.640
So this is going to be equal
to-- can't forget that

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.230
negative 1 out front, and then
we factor the inside.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:42.990
Negative 1 times x minus
3, times x plus 8.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.800
And if you really wanted to,
you could multiply the

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.450
negative 1 times this,
you would get 3

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.560
minus x if you did.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.810
Or you don't have to.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.220
Let's do one more of these.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.060
The more practice, the
better, I think.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.630
All right, let's say I had
negative x squared

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:06.690
plus 18x, minus 72.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.320
So once again, I like to factor
out the negative 1.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.040
So this is equal to negative
1 times x squared,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.910
minus 18x, plus 72.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.650
Now we just have to think of
two numbers, that when I

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.330
multiply them I get
positive 72.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.480
So they have to be
the same sign.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.930
And that makes it easier in our
head, at least in my head.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.260
When I multiply them,
I get positive 72.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.040
When I add them, I
get negative 18.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.410
So they're the same sign, and
their sum is a negative

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.470
number, they both must
be negative.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.790
And we could go through all
of the factors of 72.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.510
But the one that springs up,
maybe you think of 8 times 9,

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:53.270
but 8 times 9, or negative 8
minus 9, or negative 8 plus

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.210
negative 9, doesn't work.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.060
That turns into 17.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:58.860
That was close.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.560
Let me show you that.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.400
Negative 9 plus negative 8, that
is equal to negative 17.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.140
Close, but no cigar.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:06.990
So what other ones are there?

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.005
We have 6 and 12.

00:16:08.005 --> 00:16:09.705
That actually seems
pretty good.

00:16:09.705 --> 00:16:13.710
If we have negative 6 plus
negative 12, that is equal to

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.360
negative 18.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.590
Notice, it's a bit of an art.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.810
You have to try the different
factors here.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.360
So this will become negative
1-- don't want to forget

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:29.440
that-- times x minus 6,
times x minus 12.
