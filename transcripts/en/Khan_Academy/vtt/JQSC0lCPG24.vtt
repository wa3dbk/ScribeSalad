00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:01.284
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

00:00:01.284 --> 00:00:04.458
So here, I'd like to talk
about harmonic functions.

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:05.803
Now, harmonic functions

00:00:05.803 --> 00:00:06.754
are a very special kind

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:08.864
of multivariable function,

00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:10.710
and they're defined in
terms of the Laplacian,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.610
which I've been talking about

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.969
in the last few videos.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.470
So the Laplacian, which we denote

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.104
with this upper right-side-up triangle,

00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:20.110
is an operator that you might take

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.625
on a multivariable function.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:22.693
So it might have two inputs,

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:24.573
it could have, you know, a hundred inputs,

00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:26.350
just some kind of multivariable function

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.906
with a scalar output.

00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:29.447
And I talked about it
in the last few videos,

00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:30.280
but as a reminder,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.463
it's defined as the divergence

00:00:31.463 --> 00:00:33.213
of the gradient of F,

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:36.631
and it's kind of like
the second derivative.

00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:38.223
It's sort of the way to extend the idea

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:39.581
of the second derivative

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.282
into multiple dimensions.

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:43.102
Now, what a harmonic function is,

00:00:43.102 --> 00:00:46.558
is one where the Laplacian
is equal to zero.

00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:47.391
And it's equal to zero

00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:49.328
at every possible input point.

00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:50.989
And sometimes the way that people

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.311
write this to distinguish it,

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:54.414
they'll make a kind of triple equals sign,

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:56.235
maybe saying like, "Equivalent to zero."

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:58.300
And this is really just
a way of emphasizing

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.719
that it's equal to zero

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.915
at all possible input points.

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:02.352
It's, you know, not an equation

00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:04.149
that you're solving for
the specific X and Y,

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.313
where it equals zero.

00:01:05.313 --> 00:01:07.078
It's a statement about the function.

00:01:07.078 --> 00:01:08.682
And to get our head around this,

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.078
because it's kind of a,

00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:10.932
you know, as you're just starting

00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:12.517
to learn about the Laplacian,

00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:13.359
it's hard to just immediately

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.754
see the intuition for what this means,

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:16.587
let's think about what it means

00:01:16.587 --> 00:01:18.338
for a single variable function.

00:01:18.338 --> 00:01:21.474
If you just have some single
variable function of X,

00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:22.962
and you're looking at
its second derivative,

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:25.417
which is kind of the
analog of the Laplacian,

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:27.498
what does it mean if that's equal to zero?

00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:29.094
Well, we can integrate it,

00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:30.661
we can take the antiderivative,

00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:34.526
and say, that means that
the single derivative of F,

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:35.383
well let's see, what functions

00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:37.372
have a derivative that's zero?

00:01:37.372 --> 00:01:39.173
The only functions are the constant ones,

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:41.564
so C is just gonna mean
some constant here.

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:42.808
And if you integrate that again,

00:01:42.808 --> 00:01:44.164
say what function has,

00:01:44.164 --> 00:01:46.241
as its derivative, a constant,

00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:48.743
well, it's gonna be that constant times X,

00:01:48.743 --> 00:01:50.097
plus some other constant,

00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:51.985
some other constant K.

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:53.663
So basically, linear functions.

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:54.924
So if you're thinking of a graph,

00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:56.972
it's just something that's got a line,

00:01:56.972 --> 00:01:58.566
line passing through it like that.

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.116
And this should kind of make sense

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:01.872
if you think of the
geometric interpretation

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:03.500
for the second derivative.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.658
Because if you're just
looking at a random,

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:06.851
you know, arbitrary function

00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:08.468
that's kind of curving as it does,

00:02:08.468 --> 00:02:11.128
the second derivative is negative

00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:12.762
when this concavity is down.

00:02:12.762 --> 00:02:14.374
So this right here would be a point

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:15.391
where the second derivative,

00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:16.950
it's not zero, it's negative.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.823
And over here, when the concavity is up,

00:02:18.823 --> 00:02:20.780
and it's got a sort of bowl shape,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.177
that's where the second
derivative is positive.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:25.509
So if we're saying that
the second derivative

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.063
has to always be zero,

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:29.437
then it can't curve down
and it can't curve up,

00:02:29.437 --> 00:02:30.997
and it can't do that anywhere,

00:02:30.997 --> 00:02:33.023
so basically there's no curving allowed,

00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:35.294
so whatever direction it starts at,

00:02:35.294 --> 00:02:36.456
it's not allowed to curve,

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:39.295
so it just sticks straight like that.

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:40.850
But once we extend this to the idea

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.567
of a multivariable function,

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:43.901
things can get a lot more interesting

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:45.443
than just a straight line.

00:02:45.443 --> 00:02:46.428
So an example,

00:02:46.428 --> 00:02:47.660
I've got the graph here

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.886
of a multivariable function

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:51.720
that happens to be harmonic.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.813
So the graph that you're looking at,

00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:54.818
this is of a two variable function,

00:02:54.818 --> 00:02:58.248
and the function specifically is

00:02:58.248 --> 00:02:59.081
F of XY,

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:01.622
XY,

00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:04.001
is equal to E to the X

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.362
multiplied by

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:06.195
sine of Y.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.210
And as we're looking at the graph here,

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.427
hopefully it makes a little bit of sense

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:13.033
why this is sort of an E to the X

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:14.790
sine of Y pattern.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.837
'Cause as we're moving in
the positive X direction,

00:03:16.837 --> 00:03:18.485
this here is the positive X direction,

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:20.284
you have this exponential shape,

00:03:20.284 --> 00:03:22.245
and this corresponds with
the fact that over here

00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:23.857
we've got an E to the X,

00:03:23.857 --> 00:03:24.718
so as you move X,

00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:26.170
it kinda looks like E to the X,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.688
and it's being multiplied by something

00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:29.052
that is a function of Y.

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:30.302
So if you're holding Y constant,

00:03:30.302 --> 00:03:31.858
this just looks like a constant.

00:03:31.858 --> 00:03:32.813
But notice, if that was a,

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:33.952
if that was a negative constant,

00:03:33.952 --> 00:03:35.279
if sine of Y at some point

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:36.631
happens to be negative,

00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:38.548
then your whole exponential function

00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:39.796
actually kind of goes down.

00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:41.919
It's sort of like a
negative E to the X look.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.088
But if you imagine moving
in the Y direction,

00:03:44.088 --> 00:03:46.803
so instead of the pure
X direction like that,

00:03:46.803 --> 00:03:49.669
if we imagine ourselves moving

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.155
with the input going along,

00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:51.988
let's see what it would be,

00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:53.110
it would be this way,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.814
positive Y direction,

00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:57.120
you have this sort of sinusoidal shape,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.249
and that should make sense

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:59.635
because you've got this sine of Y.

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:01.401
And depending on what E to the X is,

00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:03.201
the amplitude of that sine wave

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:04.059
is gonna get, you know,

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:05.339
really high at some points here.

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.016
It's going way up and way down.

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:09.249
But if E to the X was
really small, you know,

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.579
it hardly, hardly even looks

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:11.703
like it's wiggling over here.

00:04:11.703 --> 00:04:13.916
It pretty much looks flat.

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:15.824
So that's the graph that we're looking at.

00:04:15.824 --> 00:04:16.657
And I'm telling you right now,

00:04:16.657 --> 00:04:18.105
I claim that this is harmonic.

00:04:18.105 --> 00:04:19.882
This is a function whose Laplacian

00:04:19.882 --> 00:04:21.207
is equal to zero.

00:04:21.207 --> 00:04:23.039
And what that would mean is that

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.790
as we go over here and we say,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.839
we evaluate the Laplacian of F,

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:29.110
which, just to remind you,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.115
there's a different formula

00:04:30.115 --> 00:04:31.984
rather than thinking
divergence of gradient,

00:04:31.984 --> 00:04:33.685
that turns out to be completely the same

00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:35.845
as saying, you take the second derivative

00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:38.434
of that function with respect to X,

00:04:38.434 --> 00:04:39.859
that's its first input,

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:41.324
and you add that,

00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:42.850
let's see, second derivative
with respect to X,

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.111
you add that to the second derivative

00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:46.288
of your function

00:04:46.288 --> 00:04:47.825
with respect to the next variable.

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:48.658
And you keep doing this

00:04:48.658 --> 00:04:49.995
for all of the different
variables that there are,

00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:51.898
but this is just a two variable function,

00:04:51.898 --> 00:04:53.253
so you do this twice.

00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:54.652
The claim is that this

00:04:54.652 --> 00:04:56.010
is always equal to zero.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.352
So I might say, kind of equivalent,

00:04:57.352 --> 00:04:58.867
at every possible input,

00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:00.733
it's equal to zero.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:01.566
And I think I'll leave that

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:03.134
as something for you to compute.

00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:04.255
It might be kind of good practice

00:05:04.255 --> 00:05:05.960
to kind of get a feel for

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.423
computing the Laplacian.

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:08.587
But what I wanna do is interpret

00:05:08.587 --> 00:05:09.992
what does this actually mean, right?

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:11.068
'Cause you can plug it through,

00:05:11.068 --> 00:05:11.901
and you can see, ah yes,

00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:13.801
at all possible inputs, it will be zero.

00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:14.920
But what does that mean?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.004
Because in the single variable context,

00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:18.740
once we started thinking about

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.569
the geometric interpretation

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.882
of a second derivative as this concavity,

00:05:22.882 --> 00:05:23.871
it sort of made sense

00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:25.033
that forcing it to be zero

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.514
will give us a straight line.

00:05:26.514 --> 00:05:27.570
But clearly, that's not the case.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.701
This is much more complicated

00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:30.269
than a straight line.

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:31.102
And for that,

00:05:31.102 --> 00:05:32.651
I want to give a kind of a different

00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:33.933
way that you can think about

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.235
the single variable second derivative.

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:37.476
On the one hand, you can think of,

00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:39.553
let's say, negative second derivative,

00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:40.752
as being this concavity

00:05:40.752 --> 00:05:42.467
where it's kind of frowning down.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.279
But another way you can
maybe think about this

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.586
is saying that all of the
neighbors of your point,

00:05:46.586 --> 00:05:48.339
if you go a little bit to the left, right,

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:49.736
you've got an input point here,

00:05:49.736 --> 00:05:51.195
and if you go a little bit to the left,

00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:52.872
the neighbor is less than it,

00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:54.168
and if you go a little bit to the right,

00:05:54.168 --> 00:05:56.126
that other neighbor is also less than it.

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:57.917
So it's kind of a way of saying,

00:05:57.917 --> 00:06:00.089
hey, if you look at the
neighbors of your input,

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:01.926
so if you, if you happen
to be making the claim

00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:04.906
that F double prime, at
some particular input,

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.192
like X sub O,

00:06:06.192 --> 00:06:07.766
is less than zero,

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:09.281
it's saying that all of the neighbors

00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:10.349
of X sub O,

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:11.631
all of the neighbors of that point,

00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:13.022
are less than it.

00:06:13.022 --> 00:06:13.974
And if you do a similar thing

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:15.873
over at a positive concavity point

00:06:15.873 --> 00:06:17.536
where it's kind of smiling up,

00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:19.286
you say, well its neighbor to the right

00:06:19.286 --> 00:06:20.200
has a greater value,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.376
and its neighbor to the
left has a greater value.

00:06:22.376 --> 00:06:25.035
So at some point, where
the second derivative,

00:06:25.035 --> 00:06:27.004
instead of being less than zero,

00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:28.171
happens to be,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.826
happens to be greater than zero,

00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:32.162
that means that the neighbors

00:06:32.162 --> 00:06:34.376
tend to be greater than the point itself.

00:06:34.376 --> 00:06:35.946
And even if you're
looking at a circumstance

00:06:35.946 --> 00:06:37.572
that isn't this idealized, you know,

00:06:37.572 --> 00:06:39.340
it happens to be a local minimum,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.723
but let's say you're looking at a graph.

00:06:42.723 --> 00:06:44.199
Let's say you're looking at a function

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.248
at a point where it's concave up, right?

00:06:46.248 --> 00:06:49.710
It's concave up, but
it's not this idealized,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.388
local minimum kind of circumstance.

00:06:51.388 --> 00:06:52.371
So instead, you might be looking

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:53.401
at a point like this,

00:06:53.401 --> 00:06:54.284
and if you look at, you know,

00:06:54.284 --> 00:06:55.666
its neighbor to the left,

00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:57.545
that'll have some value
that's actually less

00:06:57.545 --> 00:06:58.697
than your original guy,

00:06:58.697 --> 00:06:59.611
so the neighbor looks like

00:06:59.611 --> 00:07:01.044
it's less than it on the left,

00:07:01.044 --> 00:07:03.151
but if you move that same
distance to the right,

00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:05.076
its neighbor is greater.

00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:06.398
But you would say, on average,

00:07:06.398 --> 00:07:08.669
if you took the average
value of the neighbors,

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:10.565
the neighbor on the
right kind of outbalances

00:07:10.565 --> 00:07:11.672
the neighbor on the left,

00:07:11.672 --> 00:07:13.022
and you would say, on average,

00:07:13.022 --> 00:07:15.815
its neighbors are greater
than the point itself.

00:07:15.815 --> 00:07:17.445
So let's say that input point there

00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:18.679
was like X sub O,

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:20.476
that would mean that the second derivative

00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:22.926
of your function at that point,

00:07:22.926 --> 00:07:24.899
you know, is greater than zero.

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:26.236
So this positive concavity,

00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:27.185
you can also think of it

00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:29.009
as a measure of, on average,

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:31.206
are the neighbors greater
than your original point

00:07:31.206 --> 00:07:32.350
or less than it?

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.205
And the reason I'm saying this

00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:35.186
is because this idea,

00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:36.583
of kind of comparing your neighbors

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:37.705
to the original point

00:07:37.705 --> 00:07:39.958
is a much better way to contemplate

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.360
the Laplacian in the multivariable world.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.833
So if we look at a function like this,

00:07:43.833 --> 00:07:45.114
and let's say we're looking at it

00:07:45.114 --> 00:07:47.687
kind of from a bird's eye view.

00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:49.771
So we've got our XY plane, right?

00:07:49.771 --> 00:07:51.632
This over here is the X-axis,

00:07:51.632 --> 00:07:54.012
and this up here is the Y-axis.

00:07:54.012 --> 00:07:54.845
And let's say that we're looking

00:07:54.845 --> 00:07:57.253
at some specific input point.

00:07:57.253 --> 00:07:58.326
With the Laplacian,

00:07:58.326 --> 00:07:59.508
you wanna start thinking about

00:07:59.508 --> 00:08:00.806
a circle of points around it,

00:08:00.806 --> 00:08:01.827
all of its neighbors,

00:08:01.827 --> 00:08:03.306
and in fact, think of a perfect circle,

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:04.139
so all of the points

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:05.984
that are a specified distance away.

00:08:05.984 --> 00:08:08.151
The question the Laplacian is asking is,

00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:10.582
"Hey, are those neighbor
points, on average,

00:08:10.582 --> 00:08:13.697
"greater than or less
than your original point?"

00:08:13.697 --> 00:08:14.530
And this is actually,

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.081
this is how I introduced the Laplacian

00:08:16.081 --> 00:08:17.886
in the original video where I was giving

00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:20.580
kind of the intuition for the Laplacian,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.536
you're asking, "Do the
points around a given input

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:26.061
"happen to be greater
than it or less than it?"

00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:27.170
And if you're looking at a point

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.902
where the Laplacian of your function

00:08:29.902 --> 00:08:32.930
happens to be greater
than zero at some point,

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.623
that would mean all of the neighbors

00:08:34.623 --> 00:08:37.298
tend to be, on average,
greater than your point.

00:08:37.298 --> 00:08:38.569
Whereas if you're looking at a point

00:08:38.569 --> 00:08:40.108
where the Laplacian of your function

00:08:40.108 --> 00:08:41.435
is less than zero,

00:08:41.435 --> 00:08:43.006
then all of those neighbors, on average,

00:08:43.006 --> 00:08:44.343
would be less than your point.

00:08:44.343 --> 00:08:45.431
So in particular, you know,

00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:47.263
if the Laplacian was less than zero,

00:08:47.263 --> 00:08:50.125
your point might look
like a local maximum.

00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:51.581
Or if the Laplacian was greater than zero,

00:08:51.581 --> 00:08:53.015
it might look like a local minimum,

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:53.848
'cause all of its neighbors

00:08:53.848 --> 00:08:55.531
would be greater than where it is.

00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:56.554
But for harmonic functions,

00:08:56.554 --> 00:08:58.247
what makes them so special

00:08:58.247 --> 00:08:59.716
is that you're saying

00:08:59.716 --> 00:09:01.832
the value of the function itself,

00:09:01.832 --> 00:09:03.816
or the value of the
Laplacian of the function

00:09:03.816 --> 00:09:05.286
at every possible point

00:09:05.286 --> 00:09:06.679
is equal to zero.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.173
So no matter what point you choose,

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:09.451
those neighbors are gonna be,

00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:12.070
on average, the same value as this guy.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.074
So the height of the graph
above those neighbors

00:09:14.074 --> 00:09:15.615
will, on average, be the same.

00:09:15.615 --> 00:09:17.204
So,

00:09:17.204 --> 00:09:18.786
so if we kind of look around the graph,

00:09:18.786 --> 00:09:20.315
what that should mean is,

00:09:20.315 --> 00:09:22.058
let's say you're looking
at an input point,

00:09:22.058 --> 00:09:24.144
you know, the output of this guy.

00:09:24.144 --> 00:09:25.461
And if we looked at all of its,

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:26.460
the circle of its neighbors,

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.711
and kind of projected
them up onto the graph,

00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:29.962
what it should mean is that the height

00:09:29.962 --> 00:09:31.435
of all the points on this circle,

00:09:31.435 --> 00:09:32.954
on average, are the same as that.

00:09:32.954 --> 00:09:34.152
And no matter where you look,

00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:35.877
that should kind of average out.

00:09:35.877 --> 00:09:37.493
And again, I encourage you to

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:38.393
take a look at,

00:09:38.393 --> 00:09:39.309
take a look at this function

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:40.606
and actually evaluate the Laplacian

00:09:40.606 --> 00:09:41.712
to see that it's zero.

00:09:41.712 --> 00:09:44.173
But what's interesting
is it's not at all clear,

00:09:44.173 --> 00:09:45.190
just looking at this E to the X

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.898
times sine of Y formula,

00:09:46.898 --> 00:09:49.895
that the average value of
a circle of input points

00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:51.690
is always gonna kind of equal the value

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.006
of the point at the center.

00:09:53.006 --> 00:09:54.485
That's not something you can easily tell

00:09:54.485 --> 00:09:56.040
just looking at that formula.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.217
But with what's not
that hard a computation,

00:09:58.217 --> 00:09:59.533
you can make this conclusion,

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:00.803
which is pretty far-reaching.

00:10:00.803 --> 00:10:02.816
And this comes up all the time in physics.

00:10:02.816 --> 00:10:04.594
You know, for example, heat is one

00:10:04.594 --> 00:10:05.987
where maybe you wanna describe

00:10:05.987 --> 00:10:08.765
how the heat at a certain point in a room

00:10:08.765 --> 00:10:10.927
is related to the
average value of the heat

00:10:10.927 --> 00:10:12.806
of all of the points kind of around it.

00:10:12.806 --> 00:10:14.856
And in fact, it comes up in
all sorts of circumstances

00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:17.032
where you have some
point in physical space

00:10:17.032 --> 00:10:18.336
and something about that point,

00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:19.599
maybe like the rate at which

00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:21.276
some property of it is changing

00:10:21.276 --> 00:10:23.334
corresponds to the average value

00:10:23.334 --> 00:10:24.643
at points around it.

00:10:24.643 --> 00:10:26.577
So whenever you're sort
of relating neighbors

00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:28.787
to your original point,
the Laplacian comes in,

00:10:28.787 --> 00:10:30.558
and harmonic functions have this tendency

00:10:30.558 --> 00:10:32.670
to correspond to some notion of stability.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.244
And I won't go deeper into that now.

00:10:34.244 --> 00:10:35.531
This is really,

00:10:35.531 --> 00:10:36.742
that really starts to get into the topic

00:10:36.742 --> 00:10:38.651
of partial differential equations.

00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:39.921
But at least in the context of

00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:41.324
just multivariable calculus,

00:10:41.324 --> 00:10:42.660
I wanted to shed some light

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.836
on interpreting this operator,

00:10:44.836 --> 00:10:45.669
and kind of interpreting

00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:48.340
the physical and geometric properties

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.034
that that implies about a function.

00:10:51.034 --> 00:10:52.124
And with that,

00:10:52.124 --> 00:10:54.291
I will see you next video.
