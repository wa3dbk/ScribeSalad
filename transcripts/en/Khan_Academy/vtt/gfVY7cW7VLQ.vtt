00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.290
We learned in the last video
that if I have some matrix--

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.490
let's call it C, Let's say
it's an n by k matrix.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.790
And all of matrix C's columns--
let's say this is

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.500
column 1, column 2, all the way
through column k-- if each

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.955
of these columns vectors form
an orthonormal set-- so, let

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:28.850
me write this-- columns are
orthonormal set, or the set of

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.210
columns are an orthonormal set,
we showed in the last

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.040
video that if I multiply C
transpose times C, I get the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.090
identity matrix.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.440
I get the k by k identity
matrix.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.870
I get the identity matrix of k,
because it's going to be k

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.250
by n, times n by k.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.920
And we saw how everything else
cancels out, except right

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.380
along the diagonal.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.840
And then we were just
multiplying the vectors times

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.040
themselves, and they're
all unit vectors.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.680
So you get the square of their
lengths and you get 1's down

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.150
the diagonal.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.830
We saw that in the last video.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.840
Now what happens if
k is equal to n?

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.980
So what happens if
k is equal to n?

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.345
Well, then this guy is going
to be a square matrix.

00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:19.950
And if he's a square matrix,
what else do we know about it?

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.470
Well, we know that these guys
form an orthonormal set.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.750
We saw, I think it was two or
three videos ago, that that

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.910
means that the columns are
linearly independent.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.420
So we also know that we have
linearly independent columns.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.880
And we've seen this many,
many times before.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.370
If we have a square matrix
with linearly independent

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.000
columns, it means that
C is invertible.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.450
It also means, if we have n of
these, it also means that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.570
these columns, or these column
vectors, if they were in a

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.650
set, then that set would
be a basis for Rn.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.590
So I'll just write that on the
side, just because it, you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.950
know, it also would mean that,
you know, c1, c2, all the way

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.210
through cn, because we're saying
n is equal to k, would

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.540
be a basis for Rn.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.200
But we'll leave that on
the side for now.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.950
It's just worth pointing out.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.230
Now if C is invertible,
what does that mean?

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.180
That means that there's some C
inverse that exists, such that

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.840
C inverse times C is equal to
the n by n identity matrix.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.210
In this case k and n are equal
to the same thing, so let's

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.990
just replace that n,
that k with an n.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.350
Now these two statements
look very similar.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.850
If the columns are an
orthonormal set, and it's an n

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.940
by n matrix, then we learned
in the last video that C

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.700
transpose times C is equal to
the n by n identity matrix.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.350
And we also know, since it's a
square matrix with linearly

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.050
independent columns, that
C is invertible.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:01.140
So, in this situation where you
have n by n matrix whose

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:16.260
columns form an orthonormal
set, then, well, C inverse

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.290
must be equal to C transpose.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.275
I mean, you can just say, look,
something times C is

00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:21.920
equal to the identity matrix.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.380
Something times C is the
identity matrix.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.190
These somethings must
be the same thing.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.800
Then C inverse is equal
to C transpose.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.910
And that is a huge time saver.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.230
If we can assume that these,
this is a square matrix with

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.510
an orthonormal set.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.130
Because finding an inverse
of a matrix is painful,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.870
especially if you get,
you know, beyond, you

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.100
know, n equals 3.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.280
If you have to find the inverse
of a, I don't know, 10

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.130
by 10 matrix, that would
take you forever.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.120
But to find the transpose of a
10 by 10 matrix, a lot easier.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.920
You just swap the rows
and the columns.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.960
So let's see if we can apply
this newly found insight to

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.130
simplify some problems that
we've tackled in the past.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:10.790
So I have up here some
vectors, v1, v2, v3.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.740
And let's say that we-- let me
copy and paste these so I can

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.205
use them below, because
I think that

00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:17.839
might be more useful.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.440
Let me copy them and then let
me paste them and put them

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.690
right down here.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.100
We have these vectors here.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.900
I'll leave it for you to verify
that they all are unit

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.570
vectors, and that taken
together they form an

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.590
orthonormal set, or that
they would be an

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.410
orthonormal basis for R3.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.260
And however you want to view it,
you could verify that on

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.050
your own time.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.730
But what I want to do in this
video is construct an

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.470
interesting linear
transformation in R3.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.560
So let's say I have the plane
formed by v1 and v2.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.300
v1 and v2 are going to
be orthogonal to

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.970
each other as well.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.830
This is an orthonormal set.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.850
So v1 and v2 are orthogonal.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.380
Let's say that this is v1-- and
I'm not drawing what they

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.960
actually are.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.320
I'm just kind of doing a
abstract visual representation

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.150
of it. v1, v2, they're going
to span some plane.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.090
So let me draw the plane
as best as I can.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.650
So if you take all of the linear
combinations of v1 and

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.320
v2, it's going to be
a plane in R3.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.260
So that's my plane, and we
know it goes off in every

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.500
direction infinitely.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.900
But this is what
it looks like.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.230
We're going to have the
0 vector in it.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:33.125
And let me just call my plane,
this plane, let me call it,

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:37.020
it's going to be some subspace V
in R3, which is equal to the

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.590
span of v1 and v2.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.220
Now v3 is orthogonal to
both of these guys.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.160
So let me just draw
v3 here for fun.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.870
So maybe v3 looks something
like this.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.090
It's orthogonal to both of these
vectors, so it's going

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.350
to be orthogonal to
all of the linear

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.960
combinations of these guys.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.430
So if you view that the plane is
V, then the line spanned by

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.970
v3, if you imagine it that way,
would be the orthogonal

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.110
complement of your plane.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.650
But let me just draw v3 here.
v3 would be a member of the

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.895
orthogonal complement, or the
orthogonal complement would be

00:06:12.895 --> 00:06:14.170
the line spanned by v3.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.090
That's all a little
bit of review.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.380
Now let's talk about the linear
transformation that I

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.540
want to construct
in this video.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.540
I want to construct a linear
transformation in R3--

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.520
remember, we're dealing with
R3 right here-- that

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.395
essentially reflects any
vector over this plane.

00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:35.050
So let me draw some indicative
examples.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.653
And I hope we can visualize
this well.

00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:39.220
So let's say I have a vector
that looks like that.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.070
So let's call that vector x.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.130
And let's say, you know,
let's say it looks

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.820
something like this.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.710
It's above the plane.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.490
It kind of jumps out.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.400
It's not in my subspace.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.000
But I want the transformation
of x to be the mirror image

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.610
below this.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.150
So, you know, if you imagine
that this plane is somewhat

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.210
transluscent, it would
be down here.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.000
My vector x would look
something like this.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.030
This would be the transformation
of x that I

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.300
want to generate.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.990
If I have a vector-- let me pick
a color that I haven't

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.770
used before-- if I have a vector
that looks like this.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.700
Then its transformation is going
to go below the plane

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.740
and just be the mirror image.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.060
This is going to be the mirror
image, just like that.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.340
You get the idea.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.860
Now, what would be, just to
understand our transformation

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.870
a little bit better,
what would be the

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.630
transformation of v1?

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.550
Well v1 is in the plane,
so its mirror image

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.340
isn't going to change.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.920
So the transformation of v1
is just going to be v1.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.270
What's the transformation
of v2?

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.390
Well that's also in the plane.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.215
So the transformation of v2
is just going to be v2.

00:07:38.215 --> 00:07:40.100
And what's the transformation
of v3?

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.110
Well v3 is directly orthogonal
to the plane.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.020
It kind of just pops straight
up out of the plane.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.952
So if you want to get its
mirror image, you would

00:07:49.952 --> 00:07:53.270
literally take the
negative of v3.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.845
It would be the negative
of v3.

00:07:54.845 --> 00:07:56.050
And I do it straight up.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.190
We don't know necessarily
whether-- v3 clearly does not

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.790
go straight up.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.160
I just drew it, you know this
plane, I just drew it relative

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.710
to this plane.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.650
This plane might be more tilted
than I've drawn it.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.990
But anyway, so the
transformation of v3 will be

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.400
equal to minus v3.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.130
Now this seems like
a fairly tough

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.600
transformation to construct.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.200
You know, we could try to apply
the transformation to

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.230
our standard basis vectors in
R3 like we've done in the

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.100
past. But that seems really
complicated, a lot of

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.590
trigonometry.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.240
We would have to figure out the
inclination of this plane,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.250
and what we're doing to it.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.070
It would just be hard
to visualize.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.150
So you probably have a sense
that maybe this transformation

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.210
will be much easier
to describe if

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.460
we change our basis.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.460
Let's say this is our
standard basis.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.680
And our standard basis, our
transformation, we would

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.660
multiply it times some matrix
x-- sorry, by some matrix A--

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.260
to get your transformation
of x.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.480
Now, we're saying that this is
hard to find, because it's

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.560
hard to figure out what the
transformation is when you

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.350
apply to just your standard
basis vectors.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.900
So what I'm going to do is try
to construct some basis, so

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:11.080
that when I represent x in that
new basis, if I multiply

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.440
x times the inverse of our
change of basis matrix, then

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.840
I'm going to get x in the
new basis coordinates.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.360
And maybe it'll be easier to
find the D in this new basis,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.980
and then we'll get the B
representation of the

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.950
transformation of x.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.900
And then we can multiply
that times C.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.310
So if we're able to figure out
D, what we can do is, look, we

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:45.150
know that the transformation
of x is going to be

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.710
able to A times x.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.690
We saw that a long time ago,
that any linear transformation

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.330
could be represented as a
matrix vector product.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.450
But let's say that this
is hard to find.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.430
This is hard.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.120
Then we can go the other
way around this.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:06.160
We could say that the
transformation of x is equal

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.720
to you take x, first you
multiply it by C inverse to

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.780
get the B version of x.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.990
So first you multiply
it by C inverse.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.660
Then you multiply it by D, to
get the B version of the

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.360
transformation of x.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.320
So then you multiply it by D.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.390
And then you multiply that by
C to go back to our standard

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.780
basis for the transformation.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.630
So then you go multiply
it by C.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.430
And we've seen this
formula before.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.910
So if we can find a nice basis
where D is easy to figure out,

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.700
then we can multiply it this
way, times the change in basis

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.920
matrix and its inverse,
and we'll get our A.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.510
Because this thing has to be the
same thing as that thing

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.320
right there.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:53.510
And even more, if we pick an
orthonormal basis, if B is an

00:10:53.510 --> 00:11:05.350
orthonormal basis, with three
vectors, right, then C will be

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.090
invertible.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.635
Well, we already know if it's an
orthonormal basis, we know

00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:16.710
that C transpose C is equal
to the identity matrix.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.060
And we also know that C is
invertible, if, you know, C is

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.220
essentially a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.940
C inverse exists.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.870
And in the beginning of this
video, we said, well that

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.210
means that C transpose is
going to be equal to C

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.940
Inverse, because this is
just acting like an

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.180
inverse right there.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:37.950
And then, if C is an n by n
matrix, or in this case we're

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.810
dealing with a 3 by 3 matrix,
we're dealing with R3, then it

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:47.580
simplifies to A will be equal
to C times D, times the C

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.170
transpose, which is much easier
to find, much easier to

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.920
find than trying to invert
a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.560
So let's see if we can
do this effectively.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.290
So what would be a good basis?

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.810
Well I think maybe a natural
one would be to use v1, v2,

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:03.910
and v3, because these basis
vectors, it's very easy to

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.040
figure out what their
transformations are.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.670
So let's write that down.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:14.570
So I'm going to make my basis
that I'm going to change to is

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:20.460
going to be v1, v2, and v3.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:25.340
So just to make sure we
understand what we're doing,

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.080
each of these vectors,
what do they look

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.930
like in my new basis?

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:35.690
Well v1 is equal to 1 times
v1, plus 0 times v2,

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.720
plus 0 times v3.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:45.840
So v1, in my new basis, where v1
is the first basis vector,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.880
is just going to be
equal to 1, 0, 0.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.750
Same argument.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.090
v2, what is it going to be
equal to in my new basis?

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.180
I don't even have to, I think
you get the idea.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.770
Let me just write
it over here.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:04.220
v2 in my new basis is just
going to be 0 times v1--

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.770
remember, these numbers, these
coordinates are just the

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.240
coefficients on my basis
vectors-- it's going to be 0

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:16.210
times v1, plus 1 times
v2, plus 0, times v3.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:24.690
And then finally, v3 in my new
basis is just going to be 0

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:30.080
times v1, plus 0 times v2,
plus 1 times v3, This is

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.840
almost trivially easy.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.030
Now, what is my change of basis
matrix going to be?

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.700
Well I'm going to have, well,
I'll save that for later.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.710
But my change of basis matrix
is just going to be a matrix

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.790
with these guys as
the columns.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.180
And of course its inverse
is going to be the

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.170
transpose of that.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.800
But we'll save that
for a little bit.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.845
Now, how can we figure out D?

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.840
Let's write D.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.200
D is going to have
three columns.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.760
So d1, d2, d3.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.675
It's still a mapping from a
three-dimensional, I guess we

00:14:05.675 --> 00:14:07.690
could call it a
three-dimensional matrix

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.730
vector to a three-dimensional
vector.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.410
Each of these are
members of R3.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:19.420
So what is the transformation
of v1 represented in B

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.580
coordinates?

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:27.990
That's going to be equal to D
times the representation of v1

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:36.950
in B coordinates, which is equal
to d1, d2, d3 times this

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:37.460
guy, right?

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.110
This is the representation
of v1 in B coordinates.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.140
So times 1, 0, 0.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.930
Well that just equals d1.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.120
We've seen this in the past.
So if we want to figure out

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.880
what d1 is, it's just the
transformation of v1 in B

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.070
coordinates.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.680
Now we could use that exact same
argument-- let me shift

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.900
to the left a little bit more.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.770
I was running out of
space on the right.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:04.860
So the transformation of v2 in
B coordinates is equal to D,

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:13.680
which is d1, d2, d3 times the
B version of v2, or v2

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.550
represented in B coordinates.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:20.370
So that is v2 represented in
B coordinates is 0, 1, 0.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.690
So that's going to
be equal to d2.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.550
And finally, let's
just complete it.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.180
The transformation of v3,
represented in B coordinates

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:38.310
is going to be equal to d1, d2,
d3 times v3 represented in

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.280
B coordinates.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.610
So times 0, 0, 1.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.980
So it's going to be 0 times d1,
plus 0 times d2, plus 1

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.320
times d3, is equal to d3.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.880
And this is kind of a re-proving
that we can find

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.650
the columns of D, by essentially
finding the B

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.910
versions of these
transformations.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.620
So D, we can rewrite D is going
to be equal to, with the

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.850
first column it's just
going to be this.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:08.120
So it's the transformation
of v1 in B coordinates.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.470
The second column is this.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.640
All right, d2 is that.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.220
So it's the transformation
of v2 in B coordinates.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:22.140
And third column is that, the
transformation of v3 in B

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:22.710
coordinates.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.480
Just like that.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.680
So let's see if we
can find these.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.780
This, hopefully, shouldn't
be too difficult.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.750
So we saw it up here.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.650
We wrote what the transformation
of

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.740
v1, v2, and v3 are.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.200
Now we just have to find
out what they are in B

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.685
coordinates.

00:16:35.685 --> 00:16:38.770
So let me rewrite, let me copy
and paste this down here,

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.365
because this might be
nice to look at.

00:16:43.365 --> 00:16:46.526
So we already found that.

00:16:46.526 --> 00:16:48.090
I'll paste it down here.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.960
So we have that.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.920
We've already found that.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.780
So we just have to find
the B coordinate

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.640
representation of them.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.290
So the B coordinate
representation of the

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:08.849
transformation of v1-- actually,
I think we, well

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:09.940
I'll write it out.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.359
This becomes a little
bit tedious.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.880
That's equivalent to the B
coordinate representation of

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:20.369
v1, which is just 1, 0, 0.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:21.300
So let me write D here.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.700
D is equal to, the first
column is 1, 0, 0.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.369
Now what the second column?

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:33.270
Well the transformation of v2,
B representation is going to

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:40.520
be just v2's B representation,
or B coordinates, which is

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:50.060
equal to 0, 1, 0 zero, 0,
1, 0, and then one left.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.130
This one's a little
interesting one.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.730
The B representation of the
transformation of v3-- and

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:58.540
remember, v3 was the one that's
not in the plane-- that

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.410
is equal to-- remember, the
transformation is minus v3.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.530
Flip that, because we're taking
the mirror image with

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.010
respect to that plane.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.080
So it would be the B
representation of minus v3.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:16.100
Well minus v3 is just 0 times
v1, plus 0 times v2,

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.510
minus 1 times v3.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.705
Those are out basis vectors, so
our third column is going

00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:24.440
to be 0, 0, minus 1.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.830
So we figured out our
D transformation.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.810
That was pretty straightforward.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.270
D right here is this matrix
that we just figured out.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:38.000
So to figure out A, we can apply
this formula right there

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.080
with our change of
basis matrix.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.690
Actually let me copy
all that stuff.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.540
This'll be useful.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.820
just let me copy all of this.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.730
Copy, then we paste it down
here, now that we have our D.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.380
All right, we have all
of this stuff here.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.860
And so let's figure
out what A.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.570
Is So to do that, first
we have to figure out

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.620
our change of basis.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.510
So I'll just write it
all out like this.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.690
Let me clear this out a little
bit, clean things up.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.000
All I need is this.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.870
I don't need any
of this really.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.750
So let me clean all
of that up.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.890
So let's figure out what A is.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:32.230
A is equal to our change
of basis matrix.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.680
Well our change of basis matrix
is just the matrix with

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.740
these guys as the columns.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.800
Well let me just take
out the 1/3.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:54.430
So C is 1/3, times 2 minus 2,
1, 2, 1 minus 2, and then we

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.935
have 1, 2, 2, right?

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.480
That right there is A, and then
we're going to multiply

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.040
that times-- or this right here
is our change of basis

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.320
matrix, that is C-- and we're
going to multiply that times

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:17.210
D, which is 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,
and then 0, 0, minus 1.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.740
So it almost looks like the
identity matrix, but we

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.780
flipped our third vector,
and that's why we

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.120
got a minus 1 there.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.000
And then we have C inverse,
but because C was a square

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.715
matrix with orthonormal columns,
we know that C

00:20:30.715 --> 00:20:32.935
inverse is the same thing
is C transpose.

00:20:32.935 --> 00:20:34.990
So let me write that here.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.590
So let me write this here.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.860
So it's just going to be the
transpose of this thing.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.370
So I'll write another 1/3 out
here, just to simplify things.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:46.800
So times 1/3, times the
transpose of this character,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.810
so we have 2, 2, 1, so we're
going to have 2, 2, 1.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.870
We have minus 2, 1, 2, so
we have minus 2, 1, 2.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:21:00.680
We have 1 minus 2, 2, so we
have 1 minus 2 and 2.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.320
And this right here, this is C
inverse, which is equal to C

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.750
transpose, because C is an
invertible matrix, or a square

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.960
matrix, with orthonormal
columns.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.380
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.245
Well let's just take, I don't
know, first let's just take--

00:21:16.245 --> 00:21:18.850
let me write this, this was D--
so let's just take this

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.860
product first. We'll worry
about the 1/3's later.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.270
And now I can erase this.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.670
I can use this real estate.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.762
Let me erase that.

00:21:29.762 --> 00:21:31.980
So let me turn my pen
tool back on.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.360
All right.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.710
So let's take this product
right there.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.620
So A is equal to, let's take
the 1/3's, it's going to be

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:44.140
equal to 1/9 times-- now
this is going to be

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.720
another 3 by 3 matrix.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.540
So, we're going to have
2, 2, 1, times 1, 0 0.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.420
Or we're going to dot 2,
2, 1 with 1, 0, 0.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.530
So the only term that's going
to be non-zero is

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.070
the 2 times the 1.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.440
So that's going to be 2.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.740
Then we're going to dot 2, 2, 1
with 0, 1, 0, right, for the

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.030
second column.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.490
The only non-zero term
is going to be the

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:09.590
2, the middle 2.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.470
Then you get 2, 2, 1
dot 0, 0, minus 1.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.080
So that's going to be, the only
non-zero term is this

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.730
last one which is going
to be negated, so it's

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.340
going to be minus 1.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.770
This isn't too bad.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:25.440
I simplified it, but this is
almost the identity matrix.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.070
Then we have this guy.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.360
We have minus 2, 1, 2 dotted
this guy, only this guy kind

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.500
of survived that dot product,
minus 2, then you take this

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.070
guy dot this guy, only
this guy survives.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.000
And then you take this
guy dot that guy.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.995
This guy gets negative.

00:22:40.995 --> 00:22:42.530
And he's the only survivor.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.050
I think you see what's
happening.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.180
These rows stay the same,
but the third

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.560
term becomes negative.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.680
Let's do it again.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.210
So you take this guy.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.680
You take the dot product of this
column, this row vector

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.390
with this column vector.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.680
Only this guy survives.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.640
Then this row with this column,
you have the minus 2.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.880
And then this row with that
column, only the 2 survives,

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.440
but it's times minus 1, so
it becomes a minus 2.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.030
And then we have this
vector out here.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.920
Remember, we took 1/3's,
we multiplied

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.270
them and we got 1/9.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:21.140
And then we have 2 minus
2, 1, 2, 1, minus 2,

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.380
and then 1, 2, 2.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.270
And this'll be a little bit more
painful to multiply, but

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.550
I think we can pull it off.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.190
Because this is the
home stretch.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.860
So A, our transformation matrix
for that, you know,

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.220
strange transformation where
we're reflecting over the

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.770
plane in R3 is going to be
equal to 1/9 times-- it's

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.900
going to be a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.310
So it's going to be 2
times 2, which is 4.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.370
Let me write this down.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.640
Oh, that's going to
be too onerous.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.390
So 2 times 2, which is 4, plus
2 times 2, which is 4, and

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.450
then plus minus 1, right?

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:02.040
So it's going to be 4 plus
4, minus 1, which is 7.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.440
4 plus 4 minus 1 is 7.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.090
So we're going to multiply this
guy times this column.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:14.320
So 2 times minus 2, is minus
4, plus 2, is minus 2.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.550
Minus 2 is minus 4.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:22.150
Then we're going to have 2 times
1 is 2, minus 4, which

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:26.360
is minus 2, and then minus
2, which is minus 4.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.740
Not so painful.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.560
OK, now in the second row, we're
going to have minus 2

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.750
times minus 2, is minus 4,
plus 2, which is minus 2,

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:46.280
minus 2, which is minus 4.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.870
Then we're going to have minus
2 times minus 2, which is 4,

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:52.500
plus 1, which is 5, minus 4.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.350
Let me make sure I
got that right.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:58.290
We're going to have minus 2
times minus 2, which is

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:09.070
positive 4, plus 1, times 1,
which is minus 3, plus minus 2

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:15.610
times minus 2, which is
which is minus 4.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:19.930
And so we are going to get-- and
I'm confusing myself-- I'm

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.500
going to get-- oh no,
this thing is

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.670
going to get very confusing.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:24.370
It's straightforward.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:30.260
Minus 2 times minus 2 is 4,
plus 1 is 5, minus 4 is 1.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:42.380
And then we get minus 2 minus 2,
which is minus 4, minus 4,

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.380
which is minus 8.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.360
Home stretch.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.330
This is the painful part.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:54.290
OK, then you have 2 minus 4,
which is minus 2, minus 2,

00:25:54.290 --> 00:26:01.430
which is minus 4, minus 4-- all
right, now-- minus 2 minus

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:05.300
2, minus 4, and that's
minus 8.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:12.205
And then finally you have 1 plus
4, minus 4, which is 1.

00:26:12.205 --> 00:26:14.990
And if I haven't made any
careless mistakes, we're done.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:18.380
We now know that our
transformation that reflects--

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.320
now that did all this fancy
stuff-- our transformation

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.100
that reflects across this plane
that's spanned by these

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:29.060
characters right there, it can
be represented by this matrix.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.730
So our transformation, applied
to x in standard coordinates,

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.635
is just equal to A times
x, where A is

00:26:35.635 --> 00:26:36.510
equal to this matrix.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.480
We can multiply the 1/9 out,
but that will just make it

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.100
look more confusing.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.760
But this would've been really
hard to figure out on our own,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.430
to figure out that we had to
put a 7 and a minus 4 or to

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.570
even apply the transformation to
the standard basis vectors,

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.580
which you normally do to
figure out this matrix.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.970
Instead, we changed our basis
to kind of a very natural

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:55.390
orthonormal basis.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.940
And the fact that it was
orthonormal made it very easy

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.340
to find the inverse of our
change-of-basis matrix.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.670
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
