00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.045
This triangle that we have right
over here is a right triangle.

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.600
And it's a right triangle
because it has a 90 degree

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.240
angle, or has a
right angle in it.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.520
Now, we call the longest
side of a right triangle,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.599
we call that side,
and you could either

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.140
view it as the longest side of
the right triangle or the side

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.980
opposite the 90 degree angle,
it is called a hypotenuse.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.740
It's a very fancy word
for a fairly simple idea,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.140
just the longest side of a
right triangle or the side

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.542
opposite the 90 degree angle.

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:29.500
And it's just good to
know that because someone

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.090
might say hypotenuse.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.548
You're like, oh, they're just
talking about this side right

00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:36.580
here, the side longest, the side
opposite the 90 degree angle.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.860
Now, what I want
to do in this video

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.167
is prove a relationship, a
very famous relationship.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.750
And you might see
where this is going.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.370
A very famous relationship
between the lengths

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.840
of the sides of
a right triangle.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.210
So let's say that the length of
AC, so uppercase A, uppercase

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.930
C, let's call that
length lowercase a.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.040
Let's call the length of BC
lowercase b right over here.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.420
I'll use uppercases for
points, lowercases for lengths.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.630
And let's call the length of the
hypotenuse, the length of AB,

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.822
let's call that c.

00:01:07.822 --> 00:01:10.030
And let's see if we can come
up with the relationship

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.790
between a, b, and c.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.780
And to do that I'm
first going to construct

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.410
another line or
another segment, I

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.520
should say, between
c and the hypotenuse.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.600
And I'm going to
construct it so that they

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.880
intersect at a right angle.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.006
And you can always do that.

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:27.005
And we'll call this point
right over here we'll.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:28.120
Call this point capital D.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.010
And if you're wondering,
how can you always do that?

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.634
You could imagine rotating
this entire triangle like this.

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:36.050
This isn't a rigorous proof,
but it just kind of gives you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.100
the general idea of
how you can always

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.810
construct a point like this.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.260
So if I've rotated it around.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.750
So now our hypotenuse, we're
now sitting on our hypotenuse.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.414
This is now point
B, this is point A.

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:50.580
So we've rotated the whole
thing all the way around.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.710
This is point C. You
could imagine just

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.820
dropping a rock from point C,
maybe with a string attached,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.460
and it would hit the
hypotenuse at a right angle.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.980
So that's all we did here to
establish segment CD into where

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.570
we put our point D
right over there.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.220
And the reason why
did that is now we

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.289
can do all sorts of
interesting relationships

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.490
between similar triangles.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.180
Because we have
three triangles here.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.604
We have triangle ADC,
we have triangle DBC,

00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:17.520
and then we have the
larger original triangle.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.890
And we can hopefully
establish similarity

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.980
between those triangles.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.590
And first I'll show you that ADC
is similar to the larger one.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.710
Because both of them
have a right angle.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.070
ADC has a right angle
right over here.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.571
Clearly if this
angle is 90 degrees,

00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.653
then this angle is going
to be 90 degrees as well.

00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:36.660
They are supplementary.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.510
They have to add up to 180.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.440
And so they both have
a right angle in them.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.060
So the smaller one
has a right angle.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.590
The larger one clearly
has a right angle.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.840
That's where we started from.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.690
And they also both
share this angle right

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.150
over here, angle
DAC or BAC, however

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.580
you want to refer to it.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.720
So we can actually write
down that triangle.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.290
I'm going to start with
the smaller one, ADC.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.190
And maybe I'll shade
it in right over here.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.023
So this is the triangle
we're talking about.

00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:05.429
Triangle ADC.

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:07.470
And I went from the blue
angle to the right angle

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.620
to the unlabeled angle from the
point of view of triangle ADC.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.860
This right angle isn't applying
to that right over there.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.820
It's applying to
the larger triangle.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:24.820
So we could say triangle
ADC is similar to triangle--

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.130
once again, you want to
start at the blue angle.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.500
A. Then we went to
the right angle.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.220
So we have to go to
the right angle again.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.830
So it's ACB.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.270
And because they're
similar, we can set up

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.220
a relationship between
the ratios of their sides.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.705
For example, we know the
ratio of corresponding sides

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:47.080
are going to do, well, in
general for a similar triangle,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.640
we know the ratio of
the corresponding sides

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.890
are going to be a constant.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.100
So we could take the ratio of
the hypotenuse of the smaller

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.960
triangle.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.350
So the hypotenuse is AC.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.710
So AC over the hypotenuse
over the larger one, which

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:10.480
is a AB, AC over AB is going
to be the same thing as AD

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.180
as one of the legs, AD.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.959
And just to show that, I'm just
taking corresponding points

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.794
on both similar triangles,
this is AD over AC.

00:04:23.794 --> 00:04:25.960
You could look at these
triangles yourself and show,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.930
look, AD, point AD, is
between the blue angle

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.410
and the right angle.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.760
Sorry, side AD is between the
blue angle and the right angle.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.025
Side AC is between the blue
angle and the right angle

00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:39.010
on the larger triangle.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.950
So both of these are
from the larger triangle.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.660
These are the corresponding
sides on the smaller triangle.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.990
And if that is confusing
looking at them visually,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.199
as long as we wrote our
similarity statement correctly,

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.990
you can just find the
corresponding points.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.590
AC corresponds to AB
on the larger triangle,

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.840
AD on the smaller
triangle corresponds

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.330
to AC on the larger triangle.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.920
And we know that AC, we can
rewrite that as lowercase a.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.860
AC is lowercase a.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.810
We don't have any
label for AD or for AB.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.900
Sorry, we do have
a label for AB.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.590
That is c right over here.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.790
We don't have a label for AD.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.840
So AD, let's just
call that lowercase d.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.400
So lowercase d applies to
that part right over there.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.560
c applies to that entire
part right over there.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.905
And then we'll call DB,
let's call that length e.

00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:38.700
That'll just make things a
little bit simpler for us.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.760
So AD we'll just call d.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.850
And so we have a over
c is equal to d over a.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.830
If we cross multiply, you have
a times a, which is a squared,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.791
is equal to c times
d, which is cd.

00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:52.790
So that's a little bit
of an interesting result.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.789
Let's see what we can do
with the other triangle

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:55.930
right over here.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.940
So this triangle
right over here.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.490
So once again, it
has a right angle.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.865
The larger one
has a right angle.

00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:04.270
And they both share this
angle right over here.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.070
So by angle, angle
similarity, the two triangles

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.210
are going to be similar.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.040
So we could say triangle
BDC, we went from pink

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.970
to right to not labeled.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:20.352
So triangle BDC is
similar to triangle.

00:06:20.352 --> 00:06:22.310
Now we're going to look
at the larger triangle,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.430
we're going to start
at the pink angle.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.567
B. Now we're going to
go to the right angle.

00:06:25.567 --> 00:06:26.066
CA.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.680
BCA.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.979
From pink angle to right
angle to non-labeled angle,

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:36.520
at least from the
point of view here.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.420
We labeled it before
with that blue.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.620
So now let's set up some
type of relationship here.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.040
We can say that the ratio on
the smaller triangle, BC, side

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.130
BC over BA, BC over
BA, once again,

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.230
we're taking the
hypotenuses of both of them.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:07:00.593
So BC over BA is going
to be equal to BD.

00:07:00.593 --> 00:07:02.590
Let me do this in another color.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.450
BD.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.890
So this is one of the legs.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:05.570
BD.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.430
The way I drew it
is the shorter legs.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.370
BD over BC.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.770
I'm just taking the
corresponding vertices.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.600
Over BC.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.203
And once again, we know BC is
the same thing as lowercase b.

00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:20.322
BC is lowercase b.

00:07:20.322 --> 00:07:22.926
BA is lowercase c.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.740
And then BD we defined
as lowercase e.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.260
So this is lowercase e.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.210
We can cross
multiply here and we

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.830
get b times b, which, and I've
mentioned this in many videos,

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.310
cross multiplying is really
the same thing as multiplying

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.680
both sides by both denominators.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.960
b times b is b squared
is equal to ce.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.010
And now we can do something
kind of interesting.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.406
We can add these two statements.

00:07:51.406 --> 00:07:53.030
Let me rewrite the
statement down here.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.100
So b squared is equal to ce.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.310
So if we add the
left hand sides,

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.120
we get a squared plus b squared.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:09.420
a squared plus b squared
is equal to cd plus ce.

00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:14.917
And then we have a c
both of these terms,

00:08:14.917 --> 00:08:16.000
so we could factor it out.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.880
So this is going to be equal
to-- we can factor out the c.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.952
It's going to be equal
to c times d plus e.

00:08:22.952 --> 00:08:29.790
c times d plus e and
close the parentheses.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.460
Now what is d plus e?

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.159
d is this length,
e is this length.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.169
So d plus e is actually
going to be c as well.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:38.496
So this is going to be c.

00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:41.039
So you have c times c,
which is just the same thing

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.030
as c squared.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.700
So now we have an
interesting relationship.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:51.150
We have that a squared plus b
squared is equal to c squared.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.580
Let me rewrite that.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.300
a squared.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.623
Well, let me just do
an arbitrary new color.

00:08:58.623 --> 00:09:02.380
I deleted that by accident,
so let me rewrite it.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.390
So we've just established
that a squared plus b squared

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.400
is equal to c squared.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.320
And this is just an
arbitrary right triangle.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.590
This is true for any
two right triangles.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.120
We've just established that
the sum of the squares of each

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.060
of the legs is equal to the
square of the hypotenuse.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.550
And this is probably
what's easily

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.220
one of the most famous
theorem in mathematics, named

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.360
for Pythagoras.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.370
Not clear if he's the first
person to establish this,

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.310
but it's called the
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.469
And it's really the basis of,
well, all not all of geometry,

00:09:41.469 --> 00:09:43.510
but a lot of the geometry
that we're going to do.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.880
And it forms the basis of a
lot of the trigonometry we're

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.230
going to do.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.550
And it's a really
useful way, if you

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.299
know two of the sides
of a right triangle,

00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:51.890
you can always find the third.
