00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.680
Let's figure out the oxidation
states for some more

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.710
constituent atoms
and molecules.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:13.130
So let's say I had
magnesium oxide.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.560
MgO.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.060
I'll do oxygen in a
different color.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.890
So what are going to be their
oxidation states?

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.550
And you might know this already,
but let's look at the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.790
periodic table, because
it never hurts to get

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.480
familiar with it.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.550
So we have magnesium.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.720
Magnesium has two valance
electrons.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.240
It's a Group 2 element.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.560
It would love to lose
those two electrons.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.620
Oxygen, we already know,
is one of the most

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.990
electronegative atoms. It's so
electronegative that oxidized

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.510
has essentially been
named after them.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.630
And we know that oxygen loves
to gain two electrons.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.490
So this is kind of a marriage
made in heaven.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.760
This guy wants to lose two
electrons and this guy wants

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.800
to gain two electrons.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.350
So what's going to happen?

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.630
The magnesium is going to
lose two electrons.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.790
It was neutral.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.510
So it's going to have a plus
2 charge, hypothetically.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.870
And then, the oxygen is going
to have a minus 2 charge,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.490
because it gained the
two electrons.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.710
So in this molecule of magnesium
oxide, the oxidation

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.690
state of magnesium is plus 2.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.410
And the oxidation state of
the oxygen is minus 2.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.090
Now let's do a slightly
harder one.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:35.990
Let's say we had magnesium
hydroxide.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.790
So hydroxide is OH2.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.080
OH2 right there, where there's
two hydroxide groups in this.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.830
So, my temptation would
still be, look.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.840
Magnesium likes to lose its
electrons, its two electrons,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.420
which would make it's charge
positive-- it's hypothetical

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.500
oxidation state positive.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.980
So my temptation is to say,
hey, magnesium here

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.500
would be plus 2.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.330
So let me write that there.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.830
And remember, in order for
everything to work out, if

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.840
it's a neutral compound, all of
the oxidation states in it

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.940
have to add up to 1.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.700
So let's see if that's
going to work out.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.130
Now, oxygen.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.740
My impulse is that its
oxidation state

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.910
tends to be minus 2.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.160
So let me write that down.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.240
And hydrogen, when it's bonded
with an oxygen-- remember.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.050
In this case, the hydrogen is
bonded with the oxygen first.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.490
And then that's bonded
to the magnesium.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.010
So the hydrogen is bonded
to an oxygen.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.790
Hydrogen, if it was bonded to a
magnesium, you might want to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.810
say, hey, maybe it'll take the
electrons and it'll have a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.180
negative oxidation state.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.290
But when hydrogen is bonded
with oxygen, it

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.590
gives up the electrons.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.700
It only has one electron
to give up.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.542
So it has a plus 1
oxidation state.

00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:55.160
So let's see.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.120
At first, you might say,
hey, I'm adding up

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.100
the oxidation states.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.840
Plus 2 minus 2 is 0 plus 1.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.840
I get a plus 1 oxidation
state here.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.880
That doesn't make sense, Sal.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.350
This is a neutral compound.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.700
And what you to remember is oh,
no, but you have two of

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.960
these hydroxides right here.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.570
So what you do is you figure out
the sum of the oxidation

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.390
states of the hydroxide.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.500
So that's minus 2 plus 1.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.150
So for the entire hydroxide
molecule, you

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.820
have a minus 1 sum.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.460
And then you have two of them.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.750
Right?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.900
You have two hydroxide
molecules here.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.250
So the contribution to the
entire compound's oxidation

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.570
state will be minus 1
for each hydroxide.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.500
But then you have two of them.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.960
So it's minus 2 and then plus
2 from the magnesium.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.600
And it all adds up to 0.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.440
So that worked out.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.350
Now, I want to do a little
bit of an aside.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.830
I want to go back to doing
some problems again.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.580
But I want to do a little bit
of an aside on some of my

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.310
terminology.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.630
Because I've kind of used
oxidation state, and oxidized,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.360
and reduced interchangeably,
to a certain degree.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.030
But, we've done so many
problems with water

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.560
autoionizing into-- actually,
let me do 2 moles of water.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:19.839
And it's in equilibrium with 1
mole of H30 plus OH minus.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.650
And obviously, everything is
in an aqueous solution.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.840
Now, let's look at the water.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.620
What are the oxidation states
in this water right here?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.620
Well, we've done this already
in the previous video.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.340
Oxidation state of oxygen is
minus 2, because it's hogging

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.400
the two electrons from
the two hydrogens.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.705
Each hydrogen is giving
up an electron.

00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:39.210
So it has an oxidation
state of plus 1.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.400
And we see this molecule.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.620
Everything adds up.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.700
Because you have two hydrogens
with a plus 1.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.350
So that's plus 2.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.180
Plus 2 minus 2 for that one
oxygen, and you get to 0.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.990
And it's a neutral compound.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.650
Now here, what are the
oxidation states?

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.660
So one of these hydrogens left
one of these water molecules

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.220
and joined the other of the
water molecules without taking

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.420
its electron with it.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.560
So it left the electron
over here.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.930
So that oxygen still has a
minus 2 oxidation state.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.290
And this hydrogen still
has a plus 1.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.190
And that's why you do
minus 2 plus 1.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.300
You get minus 1.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.660
And this time, it works out,
because that's the actual

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.910
charge on this hydroxide ion.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.940
Now, here, what are the
oxidation states?

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.230
Each of the hydrogens have
a plus 1 oxidation state.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.070
And then this oxygen
has a minus 2.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.860
And so if you look at the
charge for the entire

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.730
molecule, plus 1 on three
hydrogens, so that's plus 3.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.610
I just added them up.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.480
Minus 2.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.080
So plus 3 minus 2, I should have
a plus 1 charge on this

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.370
entire molecule, which
is the case.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.260
Now, my question to you is has
any of the oxidation states

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.930
changed for any of the atoms?

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.850
All of the hydrogens here--
and we could call

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.120
this 2 moles of water.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.570
Or maybe I just have two
molecules of water.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.280
But I have four hydrogens
here.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.600
Right?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.890
And all of them had an
oxidation state of 1.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.050
On the right-hand side,
I have four hydrogens.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.050
All of them have an oxidation
state of 1.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.370
So although their oxidation
state is 1, in this reaction--

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.860
and you can pick either
direction of the reaction--

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.720
hydrogen has not
been oxidized.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.715
Its oxidation state
did not change.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.570
Maybe it was oxidized in a
previous reaction where the

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.310
water was formed, but in this
reaction, it was not oxidized.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.160
Likewise, the oxygens-- we have
two oxygen molecules, or

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.040
atoms, here.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.650
Each have a minus 2
oxidation state.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.380
Here, we have two oxygen
molecules.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.630
Each have a minus 2
oxidation state.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.000
Due to this reaction, at least,
no electrons changed

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.140
hands in our oxidation
state world.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.250
So this is not an oxidation
or a reduction reaction.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.250
And I'm going to cover that in
detail in the next video.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.080
And I just want to be clear that
nothing here was oxidized

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.160
or reduced, because
their oxidation

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.180
states stayed the same.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.870
Because sometimes I'll
say, hey, look.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.580
Magnesium has an oxidation
state of plus 2.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.650
And oxygen has an oxidation
state of minus 2.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.310
Magnesium was oxidized.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.220
Two electrons were taken
away from it.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.670
And oxygen was reduced.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.180
Two electrons were
given to it.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.620
And I'll say that implying some
reaction that produced

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.680
it, but that's not
always the case.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.120
You could have a reaction
where that

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.120
necessarily didn't happen.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.760
But the oxidation state
for magnesium is

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.050
definitely plus 2.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.520
And the oxidation state for the
oxygen, or the oxidation

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.380
number, is minus 2.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.960
But I think you know what I'm
talking about when I say it

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.330
was oxidized.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.130
At some point, it went from
a neutral magnesium to a

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.310
positively charged magnesium
by losing two electrons.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.510
So it got oxidized.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.280
Now, let's do some harder
problems. So hydrogen

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.260
peroxide-- I've said multiple
times already that oxygen

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.600
tends to have a minus
2 oxidation state.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.450
This is minus 1.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.910
I think you see the pattern.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.900
These guys are plus 1.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.100
Hydrogen is plus or minus 1.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.450
These guys are plus 2.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.520
I think you see the pattern.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.070
It's whether you want to
lose or gain electrons.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.450
You might say, well see,
water normally

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.590
has a minus 2 oxidation.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.470
So you might be tempted
to do-- OK.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.470
Hydrogen has plus 1, because
it's bonding with water.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.690
And oxygen has a minus 2.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.440
But when you do that, you
immediately have a conundrum.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.240
This is a neutral molecule--
let's see.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.480
Two hydrogens plus 2.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.610
Two oxygens at minus 2.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.290
Minus 4.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.130
So this would end up with
a minus 4 total

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.720
net oxidation state.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.780
And that's not the
case because this

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.300
doesn't have any charge.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.980
So there's a conundrum here.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.390
And the conundrum is because,
if you actually look at the

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.140
structure of hydrogen peroxide,
the oxygens are

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.830
actually bonded to each other.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.120
That's where the peroxide
comes from.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.590
And then each of those are
bonded to a hydrogen.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.670
So in this case, especially in a
first-year chemistry course,

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.190
the peroxide molecules,
especially hydrogen peroxide,

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.110
tends to be that one
special case.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.660
There are others, but this is
the one special case where

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.540
oxygen does not have a minus
2 oxidation state.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.550
Let's look at this and try to
figure out what oxygen's

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.750
oxidation state would be
in hydrogen peroxide.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.735
So in this case, the
hydrogen-oxygen bond, oxygen

00:09:23.735 --> 00:09:26.460
is going to hog the electron
and hydrogen is

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.320
going to lose it.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.780
So it's going to have
a plus 1 there.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.430
Same thing on the side.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.060
Oxygen, at least on this bond,
is going to have a plus 1.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.790
It's going to gain
an electron.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.380
What about from this other bond
with the other oxygen?

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.760
Well, there's no reason why
one oxygen should hog the

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.170
electron from the
other oxygen.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.560
So it's not going to have
any net impact on

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.000
its oxidation state.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.470
So in this case, this oxygen's
oxidation state is plus 1.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.580
This oxygen's oxidation
state is also plus 1.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:59.620
So each of the hydrogens have an
oxidation number of plus 1.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.080
You said the oxygens have an
oxidation number of minus 1.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.930
And so you have a net of 0.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.260
2 times plus 1, plus 2
times minus 1, is 0.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.080
So that's just a special case.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.290
That's a good one to
be familiar with.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.170
Let's do another one.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.970
Iron 3 carbonate.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.410
And now, for the first time--
I remember when we first

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.920
encountered iron 3 carbonate.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.990
You probably thought, hey, why
is it called iron 3 carbonate

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.270
when there are only two
iron molecules, or

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.350
two iron atoms, here?

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.840
And you're about to learn why.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.310
Let's look at the oxidation
numbers.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.850
So oxygen.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.610
Oxygen's oxidation number
tends to be minus 2.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.760
Now, if carbon is bonding with
oxygen-- let's look at the

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.330
periodic table.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.910
We have carbon bonding
with oxygen.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.720
Carbon can go either way.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.120
Carbon, sometimes it likes
to give away electrons.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.040
Sometimes it likes to
gain electrons.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.270
When carbon is bonding with
oxygen, this right here is the

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.810
electron hog.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.160
If we had to say who's
taking the electrons,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.010
it's going to be oxygen.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:03.540
Right?

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.040
So carbon is going to be giving
away its electrons.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.200
But how many electrons
can carbon give away?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:10.936
Well, let's see.

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:14.720
It has 1, 2, 3, 4 valence
electrons.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.240
So the most it can really
do is give away

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.390
four valence electrons.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.670
So let's go back to
the carbonate.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:27.040
So the carbon could at
most give away its

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.930
four valence electrons.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.400
So what will be the net
oxidation number for the

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.770
carbonate molecule?

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.810
For the CO3?

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.430
So this is a plus 4 oxidation,
because it only has

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.270
four to give away.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.260
If it's bonding with oxygen,
it's going to give them away.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.630
Oxygen is more of a hog.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.640
Each oxygen has a minus 2.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.590
So let's think about it.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:54.210
I have plus 4 minus,
3 times minus 2.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:54.700
Right?

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.870
I have 3 oxygen molecules.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.290
So I have 4 minus 6 is
equal to minus 2.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.730
So we can kind of view it as the
oxidation number for the

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.990
entire carbonate molecule
is minus 2.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.210
Now, if this entire carbonate
molecule is minus 2, its

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:16.920
contribution to the oxidation
state for this whole kind of--

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.620
the carbonate part
of the molecule.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.980
We have 3 carbonate molecules.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.710
Each of them is contributing
minus 2.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.740
So I have a minus
6 contribution.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.380
If this is minus 6 and this is a
neutral molecule, then our 2

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.880
irons are also going
to have to have a

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.290
plus 6 oxidation state.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.030
Because it all has
to add up to 0.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:42.400
If both irons combined have
a plus 6 contribution to

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.380
oxidation state, then each
of the irons must

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.460
have a plus 3 oxidation.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.930
Or that, in our hypothetical
world, if this happens, at

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.510
least three electrons are going
to favor the carbonate

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.240
from each of the irons.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.980
So why is it called
iron 3 carbonate?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.340
I think you may have figured
this out by now.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.600
Because this is iron in its
third oxidation state.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.520
Iron-- a lot of the metals,
especially a lot of the

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.790
transition metals-- can have
multiple oxidation states.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.970
When you have iron 3 carbonate,
you're literally

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.130
saying, this is the third
oxidation state.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.120
Or iron's oxidation number
in this molecule

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.780
will be positive 3.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:21.900
Now, let's do another one.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.000
This is interesting.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.010
Acetic acid.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.560
And I think is the first time
that I've actually shown you

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.740
the formula for acetic acid.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.410
I won't go into the whole
organic chemistry of it.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.290
But let's try to figure out
what the different charges

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.835
are, or the different
oxidation states.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.610
Sometimes you'll just see
it written like this.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.430
You'd say, OK.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.530
Oxygens, each of those are
going to have minus 2.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.570
Hydrogens are each going
to have plus 1.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.520
So how are we doing so far?

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.100
So these oxygens are going
to contribute minus 4.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.200
And then the hydrogens--
here you have plus 3.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.260
And then here you have plus 1.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.925
You add these up and
you get to 0.

00:14:10.925 --> 00:14:11.740
And you're like, oh.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.430
So the carbons must have
no oxidation state.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.280
They must have an oxidation
number of 0.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.180
Because we're already at 0, if
we just consider the hydrogens

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.370
and the oxygens.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.230
So let's look at that and see
if that's actually the case.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.360
So when carbon is bonding with
hydrogen, who's going to hog

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.100
the electrons?

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.330
When carbon is bonding
with hydrogen.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.320
Electronegativity-- as
you go to the right.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.330
Carbon is more electronegative.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.590
It likes to keep the electrons,
or hog them, more

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.310
than hydrogen.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.080
So hydrogen is going to lose the
electrons in our oxidation

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.860
state world.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.375
It's actually a covalent bond,
but of course, we know that

00:14:50.375 --> 00:14:52.430
when we're dealing with
oxidation states, we pretend

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.630
that it's ionic.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.030
So in this case, your
hydrogens are

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.100
going to lose electrons.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.920
So they're each going to have an
oxidation state of plus 1.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.400
That's consistent with
what we know so far.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.730
And actually, that's
another thing.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.770
When I did this exercise, right
here, I immediately

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.420
assumed hydrogen has an
oxidation state of plus 1.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.190
I did that because, oh,
everything else in the

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.000
molecule is carbon and oxygen,
which are more electronegative

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.700
than the hydrogen.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.190
So the hydrogen is going to
go into its plus 1 state.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.960
If, over here, I had a bunch of
alkali and alkaline earth

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.740
metals, I wouldn't be so sure.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.090
I'd say, oh, maybe hydrogen
would take

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.910
electrons from them.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.280
But anyway.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.680
So these all gave an electron
to this carbon.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:36.785
So just from these hydrogens,
that carbon would have a minus

00:15:36.785 --> 00:15:39.740
3 oxidation state, right?

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.260
These lost electrons.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.560
This guy gained three electrons,
so his charge

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.430
goes down by 3.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.680
The carbon-carbon bond.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.720
Well, there's no reason one
carbon should take electrons

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.570
from another carbon.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.620
All carbons are created equal.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.920
So there should be
no transfer here.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.160
So this carbon's oxidation
status is 3.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.230
Now what about on this side?

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.560
So we know that this hydrogen
is going to have a plus 1

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.920
oxidation state.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.470
It's going to give its electron
to this oxygen.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.870
This oxygen, like most oxygens,
are going to take up

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:09.640
two electrons.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.980
One from this carbon, and
one from this hydrogen.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.460
So it's going to have a minus
2 oxidation state.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.140
This oxygen is also going
to take two electrons.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.600
In this case, both of
them are going to be

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.370
from this orange carbon.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.870
So it's going to have a minus
2 oxidation state.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.840
So what's the oxidation
state of this carbon?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:33.190
It lost two electrons to this
guy up here, and it lost one

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.450
electron to this oxygen
down here.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.640
Remember, this guy got one
electron from the carbon and

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.050
one from the hydrogen.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.990
So it lost one electron
here, two there.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.770
It lost three electrons.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:49.050
So in that reality, it would
have a plus 3 charge.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.080
So it turns out that the average
oxidation state for

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.930
the carbon in acetic
acid is 0.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.150
Because if you average minus
3 and plus 3, you get to 0.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.270
And that's why I said, oh,
maybe these are a 0.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.730
But if you actually write out
their oxidation numbers, this

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.410
green C has a minus
3 oxidation state.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.660
And this orange C, this
orange carbon, has a

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.880
plus 3 oxidation state.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.500
If you got this one, and I
don't think it's overly

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:22.130
complex, you will be an
oxidation state jock.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.720
So I think you're all set now.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.515
In the next video, we're going
to start exploring oxidation

00:17:26.515 --> 00:17:28.150
reduction reactions.
