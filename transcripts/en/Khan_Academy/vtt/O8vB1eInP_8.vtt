00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.820
Let's say that I'm able to go
out and survey every single

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.650
member of a population, which
we know is not normally

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.830
practical, but I'm
able to do it.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.690
And I ask each of them, what do
you think of the president?

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.620
And I ask them, and there's
only two options, they can

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.230
either have an unfavorable
rating or they could have a

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.480
favorable rating.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.009
And let's say after I survey
every single member of this

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.240
population, 40% have an
unfavorable rating and 60%

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.760
have a favorable rating.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.300
So if I were to draw the
probability distribution, and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.140
it's going to be a discrete one
because there's only two

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.260
values that any person
can take on.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.160
They could either have an
unfavorable view or they could

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.880
have a favorable view.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.900
And 40% have an unfavorable
view, and let me color code

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.460
this a little bit.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.445
So this is the 40% right over
here, so 0.4 or maybe I'll

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:10.620
just write 40% right
over there.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.090
And then 60% have a
favorable view.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.020
Let me color code this.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.730
60% have a favorable view.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.660
And notice these two numbers
add up to 100% because

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.500
everyone had to pick between
these two options.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.450
Now if I were to go and ask you
to pick a random member of

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.040
that population and say what is
the expected favorability

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.870
rating of that member,
what would it be?

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.270
Or another way to think about it
is what is the mean of this

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.740
distribution?

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.980
And for a discrete distribution
like this, your

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.690
mean or you're expected value
is just going to be the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.310
probability weighted sum of the
different values that your

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.960
distribution can take on.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.030
Now the way I've written it
right here, you can't take a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.690
probability weighted sum of u
and f-- you can't say 40%

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.780
times u plus 60% times
f, you won't get

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.830
any type of a number.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.620
So what we're going to do
is define u and f to be

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.930
some type of value.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.350
So let's say that u
is 0 and f is 1.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.330
And now the notion of taking a
probability weighted sum makes

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.020
some sense.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.550
So that mean, or you could say
the mean, I'll say the mean of

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.710
this distribution it's going
to be 0.4-- that's this

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:48.790
probability right here times 0
plus 0.6 times 1, which is

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.870
going to be equal to-- this
is just going to be

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.795
0.6 times 1 is 0.6.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.370
So clearly, no individual can
take on the value of 0.6.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.190
No one can tell you I 60%
am favorable and 40% am

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.840
unfavorable.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.180
Everyone has to pick either
favorable or unfavorable.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.910
So you will never actually find
someone who has a 0.6

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.810
favorability value.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.320
It'll either be a 1 or a 0.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.720
So this is an interesting case
where the mean or the expected

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.825
value is not a value that
the distribution can

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.010
actually take on.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.430
It's a value some place
over here that

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.840
obviously cannot happen.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.820
But this is the mean, this
is the expected value.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.580
And the reason why that makes
sense is if you surveyed 100

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.660
people, you'd multiply 100 times
this number, you would

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.850
expect 60 people to say yes,
or if you'd summed them all

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.110
up, 60 would say yes, and
then 40 would say 0.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.480
You sum them all up, you would
get 60% saying yes, and that's

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.360
exactly what our population
distribution told us.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.690
Now what is the variance?

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.890
What is the variance of this
population right over here?

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.630
So the variance-- let me write
it over here, let me pick a

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.570
new color-- the variance is
just-- you could view it as

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.640
the probability weighted sum of
the squared distances from

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.250
the mean, or the expected value
of the squared distances

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.040
from the mean.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.500
So what's that going to be?

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.230
Well there's two different
values that

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.330
anything can take on.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.000
You can either have a 0 or you
could either have a 1.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.140
The probability that you get a
0 is 0.4-- so there's a 0.4

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.910
probability that you get a 0.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.510
And if you get a 0 what's the
distance from 0 to the mean?

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.570
The distance from 0 to the mean
is 0 minus 0.6, or I can

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.880
even say 0.6 minus 0-- same
thing because we're going to

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.770
square it-- 0 minus 0.6
squared-- remember, the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.030
variance is the weighted sum
of the squared distances.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.540
So this is the difference
between 0 and the mean.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:59.880
And then plus, there's a 0.6
chance that you get a 1.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.430
And the difference between
1 and 0.6, 1 and our

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.060
mean, 0.6, is that.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.780
And then we are also going
to square this over here.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.910
Now what is this value
going to be?

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.140
This is going to be 0.4 times
0.6 squared-- this is 0.4

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.930
times point-- because 0 minus
0.6 is negative 0.6.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.090
If you square it you
get positive 0.36.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.130
So this value right here-- I'm
going to color code it.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.800
This value right here
is times 0.36.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.860
And then this value right
here-- let me do this in

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.720
another-- so then we're going to
have plus 0.6 times 1 minus

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.650
0.6 squared.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.600
Now 1 minus 0.6 is 0.4.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.450
0.4 squared is 0.16.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.790
So let me do this.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.900
So this value right here
is going to be 0.16.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.060
So let me get my calculator
out to actually calculate

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.310
these values.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:22.870
So this is going to be 0.4 times
0.36, plus 0.6 times

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:29.590
0.16, which is equal to 0.24.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:37.250
So our standard deviation of
this distribution is 0.24.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.200
Or if you want to think about
the variance of this

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.610
distribution is 0.24 and the
standard deviation of this

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.190
distribution, which is just the
square root of this, the

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.460
standard deviation of this
distribution is going to be

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.280
the square root of 0.24, and
let's calculate what that is.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.870
That is going to be-- let's take
the square root of 0.24,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:07.330
which is equal to 0.48-- well
I'll just round it up-- 0.49.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.840
So this is equal to 0.49.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.230
So if you were look at this
distribution, the mean of this

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.390
distribution is 0.6.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.250
So 0.6 is the mean.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.720
And the standard deviation
is 0.5.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.290
So the standard deviation is--
so it's actually out here--

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.180
because if you go add one
standard deviation you're

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.740
almost getting to 1.1, so this
is one standard deviation

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.900
above, and then one standard
deviation below gets you right

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.440
about here.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.490
And that kind of makes sense.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.580
It's hard to kind of have a good
intuition for a discrete

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.310
distribution because you really
can't take on those

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.580
values, but it makes sense
that the distribution is

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.390
skewed to the right over here.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.520
Anyway, I did this example
with particular numbers

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.270
because I wanted to
show you why this

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.630
distribution is useful.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.080
In the next video I'll do
these with just general

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.130
numbers where this is going
to be p, where this is the

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:05.510
probability of success and this
is 1 minus p, which is

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.410
the probability of failure.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.820
And then we'll come up with
general formulas for the mean

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.930
and variance and standard
deviation of this

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.120
distribution, which is actually
called the Bernoulli

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.720
Distribution.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.840
It's the simplest case of the
binomial distribution.
