00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.815
Let's say I have three position
vectors here in R2.

00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:06.180
Let me scroll this over
a little bit.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.900
Let's say my first position
vector is x0 and it is equal

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.140
to minus 2, minus 2.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.400
So if I were to graph x0 I would
go minus 2, minus 2.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.430
x0 looks like that.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.420
My next position vector I have
is x1 and I'll say that's

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.002
equal to minus 2, 2.

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:36.130
If I were to graph
here, minus 2, 2.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.740
That's my next position
vector right there.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.180
And this is x1.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.860
And when I say it's a position
vector, they specify a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.510
specific coordinate in R2.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.370
Let me draw a third one
just for fun, x2.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.400
Let's say that that is
equal to 2, minus 2.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.600
So if I were to draw this, 2
minus 2, it goes right here.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.860
So that vector right
there is x2.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.070
Now, what I'm curious
about or, I

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.560
guess, not curious about.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.570
What I want to do here is define
the line segments that

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.900
connect these points.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.820
So let's say I have my
first line segment.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.350
Let me call it L1, or
let me call it L0.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.860
And I want it to be the
line segment that

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.350
connects x0 to x1.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560
How can I construct that?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.650
So I want to construct this line
segment right here, this

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.240
little-- let me do it in a
different color actually.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.390
Let me do it in orange, L0.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.540
So what I want to do is I want
to find the set of all of

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.370
these values right here, all of
the position vectors that

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.490
define points on this
line right there.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.890
Well we could define it as,
we could start off at x0.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.310
We could say that orange line is
x0 plus scaled versions of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.580
the difference of x1 and x0.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.740
If you take x1 minus x0, you get
this vector right there.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.530
That's x1 minus x0.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.470
That orange vector.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.080
I know I wrote it right there
so it's hard to read.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.940
But if you just take x1 minus x0
you get that and that make

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.990
sense. x0 plus this orange
vector is equal

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.270
to that blue factor.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.130
So if you just take different
scaled up versions of this

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.640
guy, you're going to
end up at different

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.810
points in this direction.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.020
We're starting at x0, maybe
I should do that in green.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.340
We're starting at x0 and then
we're going to add up scaled

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.540
up versions of this orange
vector, which is just the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.550
difference of x1 and x0.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.255
Let me write that.

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:39.230
So scaled up versions
of x1 minus x0.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.850
Now, we have to constrict.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.220
If we just want to be in this
line segment, we have to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.200
constrict Rt.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.300
If we said t was a member of
real numbers, if it was any

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.530
real number, then we would
essentially be defining the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.700
set of this entire vertical
line going up and down to

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.990
infinity in the upwards
direction and

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.810
the downwards direction.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.210
But we just want to restrict
it to start here

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.110
and then go up here.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.740
And it doesn't necessarily have
to have any direction.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.900
We could say this is true, our
little line segment here is

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.010
true, for t-- let me
write it this way.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.160
t is greater than
or equal to 0.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.410
So when t equals 0, this term
cancels out and we just have

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.140
this point or this position
right here.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.410
Let me draw it in green.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.070
We just have that
position there.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.140
And then t is going to be
less than or equal to 1.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.060
What happens when
t is equal to 1?

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.960
When t is equal to 1, this
becomes x1 minus x0.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.030
You have an x0 there.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.980
This x0 and that x0 cancel out
and you're just at this point

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.710
right there.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.890
When t is equal to 1/2, just
to make sure this all make

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.030
sense to you, what happens?

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.080
You have x1 minus x0, which is
this orange vector right here.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.320
When t is equal to 1/2 you're
essentially scaling that

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.480
orange vector by half and you
end up right at that point,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.710
which is exactly where
you want to be.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.290
You want halfway along
that line segment.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.810
At t is equal to 0.25, you're
going to be here.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.670
t is equal to 0.75, you're
going to be there.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.890
So at any value for t being any
real number between 0 and

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.800
1, you're going to end up at all
of the points along that

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.520
line segment.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.500
So that's our L0.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.510
It's just a set of vectors.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.260
Now we can do the same exercise
if we wanted to find

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.700
out the line, the equation
of the line, that goes

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.860
between x1 and x2.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.970
If we wanted to find the
equation of that line, we

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.220
could call this L1.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:41.140
And L1 would be equal to x1 plus
t times x2 minus x1 for 0

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.640
is less than or equal to t is
less than or equal to 1.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.740
That's L1.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.140
And then finally, if we want
to make a triangle out of

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.100
this, let's define this
line right here.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.320
Let's define that as L2.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.270
L2 would be equal to the set
of all of vectors where you

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.530
start off at x2.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.860
Set of all of vectors that are
x2 plus some scaled up sum of

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.230
x0 minus x2.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.650
x0 minus x2 is this
vector right here.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:16.020
So x0 minus x2 such that 0 is
less than or equal to t is

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.430
less than or equal to 1.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.900
And so if you take the
combination, if you were to

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.620
define kind of a super set-- I
could have defined my shape

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.070
as-- let's say it's the union
of all of those guys.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.310
Well, let me just write it.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.410
L0, L1, and L2.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.550
Then you'd have a nice
triangle here.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.670
If you take the union of all of
these three sets, you get

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.080
that nice triangle there.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.790
Now, what I want to do in this
video, I think this is all a

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:49.640
bit of review for you.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.510
But it's maybe a different way
of looking at things than

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.550
we've done in the past. Is
I want to understand what

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.240
happens to this set right here
when I take a transformation,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.580
a linear transformation,
of it?

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.630
So let me define a
transformation.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.100
I'll make it a fairly
straightforward

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.690
transformation.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.730
Let me define my transformation
of x, of any x,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:21.630
to be equal to the matrix
1 minus 1, 2, 0 times

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.970
whatever vector x.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.960
So times x1, x2.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.680
And we know that any linear
transformation can actually be

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.010
written as a matrix
and vice versa.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.730
So you might have said, hey,
you know, you're giving an

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.580
example with the matrix, what
about all those other ways to

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.320
write in your transformation?

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.580
You can write all of
those as a matrix.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.580
So let's translate-- let's try
to figure out what this is

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.410
going to look like.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.060
What our triangle is going to
look like when we transform

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.700
every point in it.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.650
Let me take the transformation
first. The transformation of

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:59.710
L0 is equal to the
transformation of this thing.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.050
This is just one of the
particular members.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.730
For a particular t,
this is one of the

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.830
particular members of L0.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:12.900
So it's going to be equal to the
transformation of x0 minus

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.950
the transformation of x1 minus
x0 such that-- sorry.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.130
Minus t times x1 minus x0.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.250
That's a lowercase t, not
the transformation.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.590
Such that 0 is less than or
equal to t is less than or

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.770
equal to 1.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.280
Let me switch colors.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.720
This, just by the properties
of linear transformations,

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.920
this is equal to the
transformation-- let me put

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.730
the brackets out-- of x0 minus
the transformation of our

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:51.000
scalar t times x1 minus x0 for
all t's between 0 and 1.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.750
That part is getting a little
redundant to keep saying it.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.540
And then, what does
this equal to?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.420
If you I take the transformation
of a scaled up

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.710
vector, that's just
the scaled up

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.970
transformation of that vector.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.290
So this is going to be equal
to this part, the

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:10.250
transformation of x0 minus t,
our scalar multiple t, times

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:15.200
the transformation of the
vector x1 minus x0.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.250
And then let me make sure I
get my parentheses right.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.730
Such that 0 is less than or
equal to t is less than or

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.590
equal to 1.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.510
And then the transformation of
the sum of two vectors is

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.370
equal to the sum of their
transformations.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.070
We've all seen this before.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.370
So our transformation of our
first line-- this one right

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:37.669
here-- L0, is equal to the set
where it's the transformation

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:46.830
of x0 minus t times the
transformation of x1 minus the

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.580
transformation of x0.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.420
And we've just done our
first line so far.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.070
I have a parentheses there.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.820
For 0 is less than t is less
than or equal to 1.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.010
Now this is a pretty neat
result and it's going to

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.950
simplify our lives a lot.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:11.220
The transformation of the line
segment that goes from x0 to

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:16.420
x1 ends up just being the line
segment that goes from the

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.450
transformation of x0 to the
transformation of x1.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.170
Let me make this clear.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.750
What is the transformation
of x0?

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.680
Let's calculate these things.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.630
So x0 was minus 2, minus 2.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.030
Let me write out the
transformation of x0.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.500
So the transformation of x0 is
equal to-- let me write it

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.130
out, so I don't make any
careless mistakes.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:45.920
1, 2, minus 1, 0 times minus
2 minus, minus 2.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.990
And so what would this
be equal to?

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.860
1 minus 2 minus-- so it's
1 minus 2 plus minus

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.760
1 times minus 2.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.670
That's going to be plus 2.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.910
So it's minus 2 plus a plus
2, so it's equal to 0.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.200
And then we have 2 times minus
2, which is minus 4.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.280
2 times minus 4.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.000
And then plus 0 times,
so it's minus 4.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.345
So that's the transformation
of x0.

00:10:08.345 --> 00:10:09.940
Let me graph it.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.690
So it's 0 minus 4.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.400
So our x0 vector.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.260
So this is the transformation
of x0.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.480
So the transformation associated
this vector with

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.300
this vector down here, the one
that goes straight down.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.420
Now let me take the
transformation

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.930
of the other guys.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.480
The transformation of x1.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.110
I'll just do it right here.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.660
I'm running out of space.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:39.420
The transformation of x1 is
equal to 1, 2, minus 1, 0

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.685
times minus 2, 2.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.520
So what is this equal to?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.580
This is equal to 1 times minus
2, plus minus 1 times 2.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.460
So that's minus 4.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.520
And then 2 times minus
2 is minus 4.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.190
Plus 0.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.180
So minus 4, minus 4.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.390
So x1 is minus 4, minus 4.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.020
So our x1 looks like this.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:15.290
Our transformation of x1 is this
vector right here in R2.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.250
Our transformation is
going from R2 to R2.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.560
So that's why I'm able to draw
them both on this nice

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.010
Cartesian coordinate plane.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.380
And we have one left.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.490
Let's take our transformation
of x2.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:33.820
So the transformation of x2 is
equal to our transformation

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:41.760
matrix 1, 2, minus 1,
0 times 2, minus 2.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.610
And so this will be equal
to 1 times 2 is 2.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.630
Plus minus 1 times minus 2.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.940
So it's 2 plus 2 is 4.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.440
And then have 2 times 2 is 4.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.770
Plus 0 times minus 2.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.560
So it's 4, 4.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.420
So x2 is 4, 4.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.020
So it's this point right here.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.130
4, 4 right there.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.030
So the transformation of x2 is
that vector right there.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.340
And so, we are able to take the
transformation of each of

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.470
these points of this triangle.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.110
But who knows what the
transformation does to

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.590
everything in between, to all
of these other-- the actual

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.220
sides of the triangle.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.940
We're able to do a little
math and we just

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:25.910
did the first side.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.230
We just did L0 right there
we found, just using the

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.510
properties of a linear
transformation, the definition

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.070
of a linear transformation
actually, we were able to find

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:39.480
that the transformation of L0 of
this vertical line here, it

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.170
just ends up becoming the line
where we can start off at the

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.550
transformation of x0.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.780
The point specified by this
vector right here.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.540
And to that I add up scaled
multiples of the

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.040
transformation of x1 minus
the transformation of x0.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.560
What is this, the transformation
of x1 minus the

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.110
transformation of x0?

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.450
The transformation of x1 is just
this vector right here.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.880
The transformation of x0
is just that vector.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.800
So this whole term right here is
just this vector minus that

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.170
vectors or it's this
vector right there.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.920
It's just that vector
right there.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.960
And so, what we essentially
have, we've defined the same

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.430
way that we did in the first
part of this video.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.900
This is just the same thing as
the line segment that connects

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.870
the point defined here and
the point defined there.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.390
We took the difference of the
two and we have scaled up

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.930
versions of that between
t is equal to 0 and 1.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.480
So the transformation of L0
really just became the

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.040
transformation-- is just
the line between the

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.260
transformations of both of the
endpoints, which is a pretty

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.210
neat result.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.530
It makes our lives simple.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.910
We can do the exact same logic
to say, you know what?

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.880
What's going to be the
transformation of L1?

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.130
Well L1 was between the
points x1 and x2.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.940
It was between that point
and that point.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.060
That was L1.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.020
So using the same logic,
we can do the

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.160
math all over again.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.540
But it applies to any line.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.500
I did it all abstractly here.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.030
The transformation of L1 is
going to be the line that

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.420
connects the transformation
of the two endpoints.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.830
So it's going to be the
line that connects the

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.930
transformation of x1 and the
transformation of x2.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.630
Let me make this right here, is
the transformation of L1.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.850
This right here is the
transformation of L0.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.190
And then finally, what's the
transformation of L2?

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:43.330
L2 connects the points
x2 and x0.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.760
So that is L2 right there.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.590
So the transformation of it
using the same math that we've

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.140
done before is really just
the line connecting the

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.540
transformations of
those two points.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.950
So the transformation of L2 is
going to be equal to the line

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.410
that connects the transformation
of x2 to the

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.920
transformation of x0.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.570
So it's going to be that
line right there.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:11.120
So this is the transformation
of L2, or if we defined our

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.060
whole shape or our whole
triangle as the set of all of

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.160
these, the transformation
of that.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.750
So the transformation of
our whole shape is

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.880
now this skewed triangle.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.900
I think you're now getting a
sense of why this might be

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.020
useful in things like computer
graphics or game development.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.920
Because when you look at things
from different angles,

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.160
you start to skew them
and whatever else.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.920
But taking this transformation,
we were able

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:41.280
to turn this set of vectors or
the positions-- or I guess

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.860
this shape, which is specified
by this set of

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.660
vectors right here.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.945
We were able to change it into
this shape in R2 specified by

00:15:48.945 --> 00:15:50.970
a different set of vectors.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:55.610
But the whole takeaway from this
video is, you don't have

00:15:55.610 --> 00:16:00.280
to individually figure out,
gee, what does this point

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.540
right here translate
into over here?

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.450
All you have to say is what
were my endpoints?

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.450
Figure out their transformations
and then

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.140
connect the dots in
the same order.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.470
That's what is essentially the
big takeaway from here.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.350
And this idea of when you
transform one set into another

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.690
set, they have some terminology

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.100
associated with it.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.760
So let's say the transformation
of L0.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.010
L0 was the set of vectors
that specified

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.240
this line right here.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:37.000
The transformation of L0, which
is this set, is a set of

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.190
vectors-- sorry.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.000
L0 was this set.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.720
It was the set of vectors in our
co-domain that specified

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.000
these points.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:58.780
This is called the image
of L0 under T.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.490
And it kind of makes sense.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.750
Why do they call it the image?

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:08.859
Because t is taking this thing
right here, this L0, and kind

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.780
of distorting it or creating
a new image

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.810
of it in the co-domain.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.540
It's taking a set in the domain
and creating a new

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.939
image of it in the co-domain
right there.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:27.250
We could say that t of the
transformation of our entire

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.400
shape, I defined our entire
shape up here as this whole

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.920
triangle right there.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.440
That's the image and that
turned into this purple

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.630
triangle here.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:43.710
That's the image of s under T.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.060
So hopefully you found that
pretty interesting.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.080
This is actually a super useful
takeaway if you ever

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.740
want to become a 3D programmer
of some type.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.580
In then next video, we'll
explore what happens when s is

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.590
no longer just a subset
of our domain.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.120
Everything we've been dealing
so far-- L0, L1, and L2, or

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.380
our entire triangle, these
were all subsets or Rn.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.040
In the next video we'll talk
about what happens when you

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.660
take the transformation
of all of Rn.
