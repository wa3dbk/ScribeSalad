00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.800
Let's say I have this
bizarre-looking function.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.600
It's just some
arbitrary function.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.970
And we'll call that f of x.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.880
So this function right
there is f of x.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.780
And what we're going to do in
this video is, it's not an

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.700
experiment, but we're going to
play around a little bit, and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.920
we're going to try to
approximate this function

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.720
using a polynomial with
some coefficients.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.840
And this polynomial we're going
to do, we're going to keep

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.670
adding terms to the polynomial,
so that we can better and

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.380
better approximate
this function.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.890
And that's actually
called a power series.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.060
And we'll do more about that
later, but we're going to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.360
specifically try, in this case,
to approximate the function

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.320
around x is equal to 0.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.490
So around this point.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.020
So the easiest way to
approximate it is to say, well,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.000
the simplest polynomial is
just a constant, right?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.590
Let's say this is my
polynomial, let me call

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.100
my polynomial p of x.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.320
The simplest polynomial is just
a constant, and it would just

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.280
be a horizontal line someplace.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.310
So if I just wanted this one
term polynomial, what would be

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.300
my best approximation for this
function, at least

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.290
at this point?

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.850
Well, I could just set p
of x is equal to f of 0.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.130
And in that case, p of x would
just look like a horizontal

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.600
line going through f of 0.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.050
It would just look like that.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.460
I'm going to erase that now,
just so I don't dirty up

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.590
this picture too much.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.540
But that's, you could say,
a very rough approximation

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.050
of f of x, right?

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.860
So that's a start.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.450
Well, what would be one way
to approximate it even more?

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.140
Well, what if not only does p
of x equal f of 0 at x is equal

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:44.900
to 0, so that horizontal line
we did, we got p of 0 is equal

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.450
to f of 0, so we knew that at x
equals 0, at least that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.430
horizontal line is the same
value of f of x, that's a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.920
very rough approximation.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.010
But what if we set it up so
that the derivative of p of 0

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.020
is equal to the derivative
of the function at 0?

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.350
All of a sudden, this could be
a little bit more interesting.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.790
So how could we set
it up like that?

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.350
Well, what if we set p of x,
and I'm doing it very general,

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.180
and we're going to do specific
examples, and actually, the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.160
first example we're going to do
is probably the coolest one.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.460
So what if p of x is equal to,
well, the constant term is f of

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:31.650
0, and then it's plus the
derivative of this function, so

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.110
the slope of this function at
that point, f prime

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.780
of 0 times x.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.020
Let's say I'm defining,
so this is a polynomial.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.040
I just added a first
degree term here.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.270
I had a constant, and now I'm
adding a first degree term.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.630
And let me confirm that this
will have the same derivative.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.990
So let's see.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.800
First of all, let's confirm
that p of 0 is equal to f of 0.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:03.130
Well, p of 0 is equal to f of
0 plus f prime of 0 times 0.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.980
Well, this last term just
goes to, is nothing, right?

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.560
Times 0.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.180
So that checks out.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.500
At x is equal to 0,
the two functions are

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.840
equal to each other.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.190
Now let me confirm that their
derivative, their first

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.990
derivatives are the same.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.450
So what's the first
derivative of p?

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.470
p prime of x is equal to,
well, the derivative of a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.660
constant term is 0, right?

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.850
Plus, and what's the derivative
of a next term, of a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.170
first degree term?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.800
Well, it's just f prime of 0.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.780
So this checks out.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.290
My new polynomial that I've
defined right here is equal to

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.360
the function f at x is equal to
0, and its derivative is equal

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.380
to the function f at
x is equal to 0.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.740
So what would it look like?

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.830
Well, it would intersect, at
x is equal to 0, the two

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.170
functions would overlap.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.460
And also, they would have the
same slope at that point.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.180
So whatever f of x is
doing, that function's

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.640
going to be doing.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.780
So it's going to look something
like, I'm going to try my best

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.650
to, it's going to look
something like that.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.930
And so that is a better
approximation, if we had to use

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.770
a line, that's as good as any,
especially around 0,

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.470
of what f of x is.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.180
f of x might have been some
really crazy weirdo function,

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.350
but we were able to approximate
it reasonably well with this

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.760
very simple linear equation.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.750
Well, that's all good, but
let's approximate it with a

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.490
quadratic equation, with adding
another x squared term.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.910
And we're going to do that way,
but we're going to say, well,

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.050
we said, when at x is equal
to 0, the functions

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.900
equal each other.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.590
That's what we did here.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.570
Then we said, the derivatives
equal each other, and

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.270
so we added this term.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.130
And now I'm going to say, what
happens when their second

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.480
derivatives equal each other?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.050
So what has to happen for
their second derivatives

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.430
to equal each other?

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.610
Well, let's try out this,
and I think you'll start

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.960
to see the intuition here.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.860
Let me define my new p of x,
so let me add another term.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.070
p of x, the first terms
are going to be the same.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.820
They're going to be f of 0.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.100
Remember, this is just
a constant term.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.530
Plus f prime of 0, the
first derivative at 0,

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.050
the slope at 0 times x.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:32.790
Plus f prime prime, the second
derivative of the function at

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.610
0, times x squared over 2.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.500
Now you're probably saying,
why are you multiplying

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.390
it by 1/2 here?

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.300
And you'll see, and maybe
you'll even realize it, when

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.500
you take a second derivative,
what happens, right?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.460
You multiply the expression by
the exponents so you can have a

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.800
2 come down, it's going to
cancel out with the 1/2.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.150
And that's why I
put the 1/2 there.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.390
So that when I take the
derivative, that 2 and the 1/2

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.460
cancel out, and I'm just left
with the second derivative

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.470
of the original function.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.570
So let me confirm that.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:09.670
So p of 0 is equal to f of 0
plus, well when x is equal to

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.290
0, that's 0, this term is 0,
and when x is equal to 0,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.010
that term is 0, right?

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.380
So that checks out.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.790
What's the first
derivative of p?

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.630
The first derivative of p is
going to be, up here, this

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.570
was the first derivative
of p at 0, right?

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.700
So what's the first
derivative of p?

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.720
Well, the constant term becomes
0, plus-- oh, actually, no,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.770
this was actually of x, sorry.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.130
I shouldn't go back on my work,
I know it best when I'm doing

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.080
it the first time around.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.970
Anyway.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.530
The first derivative of p of x,
this is my current p of x, this

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.200
constant term, derivative of 0.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.780
This x term, the derivative
is f prime of 0.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.380
And then, what's the
derivative of this term?

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.990
Well, we take the exponent,
multiply it by the expression.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.650
We have 2 times 1/2,
that cancels out.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.340
So we're just left with
f prime prime of 0 x.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.020
Right?

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.550
You take the exponent, multiply
by the whole thing, and then

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.900
decrement the exponent by 1.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.020
So what is p prime of 0?

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.730
What is the derivative at 0?

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.960
Well, it equals,
this is nothing.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.030
It equals f prime of 0
plus, and, well, this

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.990
term's going to be 0.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.930
So that checks out.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.990
And so what's the
third derivative?

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.380
Let me clean up some of
the stuff on the top.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.780
Since this is our current f
of x anyway, I can clean

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.360
up all of this stuff.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.050
Let me clean up all of this.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.700
So what is the third derivative
of this p that I defined here?

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.540
This is our current p.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.900
Well, the third derivative is
going to be, so p prime prime

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.540
prime of x, we could have also
written p3 of x, is equal

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.900
to the derivative of this.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.360
Oh, sorry, we're not on
the third, we're only on

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.650
the second derivative.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.060
p, and I'll write prime prime,
I was going to write a 2 there.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.750
p prime prime of x.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.000
That equals what?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.990
That's the derivative of this.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.440
So there was a 0 here,
that goes to nothing.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.090
This is now a constant term,
that becomes nothing.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.250
And then we take the
derivative of this term.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.050
Well, we just, it's
a constant times x.

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.040
Remember, this might look like
a function or some variable.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.680
It's just a constant.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.140
Because we evaluated this
curvy function, it's

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.570
second derivative 0, so we
just got a number here.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.900
So this derivative is
just this number.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.650
So it equals f
prime prime of 0.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:54.000
And so our current p of x has
the same value when x is equal

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.080
to 0 as f of x, it has the same
first derivative at xis equal

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.050
to zero as f of x, it has
the same second derivative.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.270
And I don't, this is getting
beyond my visualization

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.360
ability, especially for an
arbitrary function like this,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.140
but I could guess that maybe
it looks something like this.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.620
I don't know.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.940
Maybe it looks, maybe our new
function will curve, and it'll

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.180
approximate it a little
bit better, and then maybe

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.180
it'll come down like that.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.480
I don't know.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.710
I'm just guessing.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.460
But around x is equal to 0,
it's going to be a better

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.560
approximation of f of x.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.170
Well, we could just keep doing
this, and actually, we will

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.540
keep doing this, and you know,
just saying, well, the zeroth

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.430
derivative, or at the value, is
the same the first derivative

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.600
is the same at 0, the second
derivative is the same at 0,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.380
we'll say the third derivative,
the fourth derivative, and

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.520
we'll keep doing that.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.730
And I only have 20 seconds left
in this video, so we will

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.250
continue that in
the next video.
