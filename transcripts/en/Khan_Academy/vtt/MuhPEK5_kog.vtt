00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.990
I think I rushed the end of that
problem just to finish in

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.980
the 10-minute YouTube
time limit.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.690
And I just want to make sure you
understand because I did

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.850
it all over the place.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.460
We said, white to
brown is 2:3.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.510
And then white is equal to
2/3 times the brown.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.420
And we also said, well the total
number of baskets is

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.770
white plus brown.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.230
White is 2/3 of the
number of brown.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.780
So 2/3 brown plus 3/3 brown,
or 1 brown, that equals 5/3

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.300
brown is equal to the total.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.760
Or we can multiply both sides of
this times 3/5 and say that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.490
the brown is equal to
the total times 3/5.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.010
And since we can't have a
fractional number of brown

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.210
eggs, the total has to
be divisible by 5.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.480
And if you look at the choices,
the only number

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.450
that's not divisible by
5, is choice B, is 12.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.460
All the other choices are
divisible by 5, so they could

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.060
have been possible choices.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.849
Let's move on to the next.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.080
And I will do it in green.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.740
Seven.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:24.850
If 18 root 18, 18 times the
square root of 18 is equal to

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.050
r times the square root of t,
where r and t are positive

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.230
integers-- and we also know
that r is greater than t--

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.150
which of the following can be
the value of r times t?

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.550
So this is is interesting.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.020
r can't equal t, otherwise
they would both be 18.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.850
But one interesting thing
that we can try doing.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.460
Well actually I'm not going to
do it that way, because I

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.810
realize that might be a long
way of doing this problem.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.949
Let's see, how can we think
about this problem?

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.320
Well, we know that r and t are
positive integers, so what

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.730
could r and t be?

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.330
18 root 18.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.720
So we could factor this more.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.360
We could say that this is
the same thing as 18

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.710
times 9 times 2.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.370
In which case, this is
the same thing as 18.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.770
The square root of 9 is 3
times 3 times root 2.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.010
What's 3 times 18?

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.250
That's 54 root 2.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.830
So this would satisfy
this format.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.420
So we could say r is 54
and t is 2, in which

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.770
case rt would be 108.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.640
Let's see if that's a choice.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.710
And it's a choice, so we're
done, because that could be

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.510
the value of rt.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.570
Maybe I just stumbled on it.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.880
I don't know if there's
other choices.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.370
I won't think too
hard about it.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.190
But that's the answer.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.750
I just simplified this a little
bit and I said 18 root

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.220
18 is the same thing
is 54 root 2.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.060
And so r is 54, t is 2.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.030
If you multiply them, you get
a 108 and that was choice C.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.100
Problem number 8, which
I will do in yellow.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.870
Problem number 8.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.400
Fancy graph drawn there,
not a graph, a drawing.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.440
See the triangle,
that's one side.

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:36.702
That's one side.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.290
One side.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.250
Then we have another triangle
inside this triangle.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.500
Just a triangle.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.080
Another triangle inside that
triangle and see what they

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.760
wrote in addition to that.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.520
So this angle is b.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.990
This angle is c.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.820
This angle is a.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.230
This angle is b.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.160
This is b, and this is a.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.769
And they want to know, in the
figure above what is the value

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.579
of c in terms of a and b?

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.530
If you've watched my geometry
videos, this to me is the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.450
angle game because we're just
going to try to figure out as

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.520
many angles as we can.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.430
And then eventually we'll
hopefully be able to figure

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.260
out what c is.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.080
So we know this is b, this is
b, and all of these combined

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.200
form this supplementary
angle 180.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.890
So we know that this angle
right here is 180 minus b

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.420
minus b, so it's minus 2b.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.980
That's this angle right there
and then what's this angle

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.600
right here?

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.990
What's this angle?

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.560
Well, this angle is 180.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.530
Well now does that help us?

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.420
Is that going to help me
with this problem?

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.370
This is 180 minus a minus c.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.500
I don't think that helps
us necessarily.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.390
This angle right here,
is going to be 180

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.570
minus a minus b.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.810
I should have drawn
this bigger.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.120
This angle right here is also--
because we have this

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.280
inner triangle right here.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:39.470
That also is going to be
180 minus a minus b.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.240
This angle here is going to be
180 minus this angle minus

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.030
this angle.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:54.190
So it's 180 minus this angle,
which we figured out was 180

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.460
minus a minus b.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.160
And we just figured out
that because that was

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.620
part of this triangle.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:11.770
So it's 180 minus 180 minus a
minus b minus this angle here,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.710
which is also 180
minus a minus b.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.820
I mean it's really minus 2 times
180 minus a minus b.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.390
And if you simplify that, you'll
get 180 minus-- we have

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.020
this twice.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.260
You could just simplify this.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.780
It's 2 times 180 plus
2a plus 2b.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.300
I skipped a couple of steps.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.090
Because the negative
distributes, then you have two

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.530
a's and 2 b's.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.330
Then if we simplify this, we get
180 minus 360, so you get

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.330
2a plus 2b minus 180.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.970
I just simplified this--
is this angle.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.120
And then we also know that
this angle that we just

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:07.640
figured out plus b plus
c is equal to 180.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.170
So let me move up here, I'm
running out of space.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.520
So if we want to solve for c--
and I don't like this, this

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.510
purple is too dark-- we just
subtract everything from the

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.760
other side.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:28.610
So c is going to be equal
to 180 minus 2a

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:34.400
minus 2b plus 180.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.220
Because I'm subtracting this
from the other side or that'll

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:44.650
make it plus 180
minus b again.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:56.230
So if we simplify this, so c is
equal to 360 minus 2a and

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.470
then minus 3b.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.440
Let's see if that's a choice.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.340
Choice E is 360 minus
2a minus 3b.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.020
So I haven't made a silly
error, which I

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.670
thought I had made.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.210
So you figure out this angle
in terms of a and b.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.140
You figure out this angle
in terms of a and b.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.590
Then you figure out this angle
in terms of this angle and

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.650
this angle.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.690
So you just keep using the
angles of a triangle add up to

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.620
180 property of triangles.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.960
Go to the next page.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.390
Oh, and now we're on the
free answer questions.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.580
All right.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.020
I think we have time
for this one.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.289
9.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:46.120
They say, t to the third
is equal to 351.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.140
What is 4t to the third?

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.560
So the slow way of doing
this is to try to

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.890
figure out what t is.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.090
The fast way is, well, 4t to the
third, if t to the third

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.650
is equal to 351, then 4t to the
third, you just multiply

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.290
both sides times 4.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.380
And so 351 times 4,
4 times 1 is 4.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.710
4 times 5 is 20.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.030
3 times 4 is 12.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.790
1404.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.100
That's the answer.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.090
And I have 40 seconds left, so
I'll wait for the next video.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.340
See you soon.
