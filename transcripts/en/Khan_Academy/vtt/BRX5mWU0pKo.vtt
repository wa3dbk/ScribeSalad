00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome back.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.660
Before I move onto the next
problem, sometimes I rush near

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.290
the end of the video just
because I want to get under

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.570
the YouTube 10-minute limit.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.060
But I just want to make sure you
understand the conclusions

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.570
I reached in this problem
because it's kind of

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.820
interesting.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.950
If I have a bunch of numbers and
when I multiply them I get

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.320
a non-zero number, I know none
of these numbers can be 0,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.350
because as you know, if any
one of them was 0 or maybe

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.390
more than one, then this
value would be 0.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.160
So we know none of these
can be 0, rst or v.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.580
And similarly, between stu and
v-- let me re-write that, stu

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.930
and v equals 0-- we know that at
least one of these must be

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.770
0 because when you multiply
it out you get 0.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.990
Maybe all of them are.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.100
Well we know s is not 0 because
it was up here.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.590
We knew t was not 0 and we knew
v were not 0 because they

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.200
were all up on this top one.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.310
And if any of them were
0, this top equation

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.110
would have been 0.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.170
And that's how we reached
that conclusion.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.040
So let's move on.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.970
I hope I'm not confusing you.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.560
I'm doing it with a bit of a
sense of urgency just because,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.600
well I guess one should
when taking the SAT.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.100
All right, number 8.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.060
During a game the blue team
scored 1/6 of its-- so let me

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.430
do the blue team in blue.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.800
The blue team scored
1/6 of its points

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.540
in the first quarter.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.560
So Q1 they scored
1/6 of points.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.580
1/4 in the second quarter.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.370
So in Q2 scored 1/4
of its points.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.620
1/3 in the third quarter.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.310
So in Q3 they scored
1/3 of its points.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.840
1/3 in the third quarter, and
remaining points in the fourth

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.010
quarter, which makes sense.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:11.310
If the total score was 36, how
many points did the blue team

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.830
score in the fourth quarter?

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.440
Well the total points
are 36, right?

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.490
So it says they scored 1/6
in the first quarter.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.660
So 1/6 of 36-- you could do that
in your head or you could

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.915
just multiply fractions.

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:30.070
If you say 1/6 times 36.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.440
That equals 36 over
6, which equals 6.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.010
So they scored 6 points
in the first quarter.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.430
How many did they score
in the second quarter?

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.580
Well what's 1/4 of 36.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.900
So you just multiply 1/4
times 36 and you get 9.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.840
1/3 of 36, well that's 12.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.010
So in the first three quarters
we scored what?

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.720
6 plus 9 is 15.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.750
15 plus 12 is 27.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.880
So we scored 27 in the first
three quarters, right?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.130
And then we scored
the rest in Q4.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.030
So it would be the total points
minus what we scored in

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.430
the first three quarters,
which is 27.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.030
And 36 minus 27 is 9 points.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.070
And if I look at the choices,
that is choice C.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.675
And if I made a mistake it's
because I cannot add, subtract

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:23.870
or multiply fractions.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.910
But that's all there
is to this problem.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.160
Let's move on.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.690
Sometimes I feel like I'm going
too fast, so I want to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.170
make sure I'm not
confusing you.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.970
I like these type because
I don't have to

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:41.990
write a lot or draw.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.420
Well I like the drawing,
it just takes time.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.470
I will switch colors to keep
you from sleeping.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.570
2 to the 2x-- this is
problem number 9.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:05.600
2 to the 2x is equal to
8 to the x minus 1.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.070
They just want to
know, what is x?

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.720
So at first you might
be confused.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.980
But the trick to doing these
kind of exponential-- I guess

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.010
we can call them an exponential
equation-- is to

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.290
get our bases the same.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.390
And once we get the bases the
same then we can set the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.680
exponents equal to each other.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.430
So how do I do that?

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.830
Well can I write 8
as a power of 2?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.840
Well sure, what's 8?

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.790
It's 2 to the third power.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.840
So let's rewrite 8 as 2
to the third power.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.430
So let's figure out
the whole thing.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.460
2 to the 2x is equal to--
instead of 8, I'm going to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.050
write 2 to the third power.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.690
Because that's all 8 is.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.860
And hopefully you can review
the exponent video if you

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.920
don't remember that.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.110
And this 8 is this, and then
that's going to the x minus 1.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.950
And then if you remember your
exponent rules, and you should

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.600
remember your exponent rules
before taking the SAT, you

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.830
know that if you raise something
to a power and then

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.950
raise that to a power,
you can just

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.850
multiply these two exponents.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:12.170
So that gets us to 2 to the 2x
is equal to 2 to the 3 times x

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.780
minus 1, right, and you
distribute the 3.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.040
So it's 2 to the 3x minus 3.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.820
3 times x, 3 times minus 1.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.230
3x minus 3.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.700
Now 2 to the 2x is equal to 2 to
the 3x minus 3, so we know

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.480
that the two exponents must be
equal to each other because we

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.900
have the same base.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.560
Now this becomes a level one
linear equations problem.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.660
2x is equal to 3x minus 3.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.650
We can subtract 3x from both
sides and we get minus x is

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.530
equal to minus 3, or
x is equal to 3.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.650
And we are done.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.900
And this is choice number B.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:05.780
Turning the page, number 10.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.460
If 4 less-- I like these-- If 4
less than 3 times a certain

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.990
number is 2 more than the
number, what is the number?

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.080
So this is literally turning
English into math.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.010
So I'm going to actually
write the whole thing.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.680
Not that you should do this on
the SAT because it'll take you

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.660
too much time.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.210
But you can do this kind of
with their written word.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:55.400
If 4 less than 3 times a certain
number is 2 more than

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.870
the number, what
is the number?

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.540
So instead of a certain number I
like to replace that with x,

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.390
just because I'm going to
have to solve for x.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.135
So I'm going to change
this and I'm going

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:17.100
to say this is x.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.700
What is x-- more than
the number x.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.740
So now we have if 4 less than
3 times x is 2 more than x,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.130
what is the number?

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.795
So what is 4 less
than 3 times x?

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.040
Well 3 times x is what?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.040
It's 3x.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:48.915
3 times x-- so if I took this
part, 3 times x, that's 3x.

00:07:48.915 --> 00:07:57.330
And then 4 less than that
is going to be minus 4.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.240
And that is, and I view is-- you
could view that as equals.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.180
You could have replaced the
word equals with is and it

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.170
wouldn't have changed the
meaning of the sentence.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:12.670
So that equals 2 more than the
number, or in our case, x.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.890
So what is 2 more than x?

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.480
It's x plus 2.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.830
2 more than x, you could just
rewrite in math as x plus 2.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.540
And then we solve
the equation.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.590
So let's see, you could add 4
to both sides, you get 3x is

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.040
equal to x plus 6.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.620
Subtract x from both sides.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.594
You get 2x is equal to 6.

00:08:34.594 --> 00:08:41.130
And divide both sides by 2, and
you get x is equal to 3.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.610
And there we go,
it's choice E.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.470
I will stop this video
here because the next

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.250
one involves drawing.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.020
I don't want to draw
on your time.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.860
I'll see you soon.
