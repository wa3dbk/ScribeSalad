00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:05.000
Problem number 1: at time t, a particle moving in the xy-plane

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.800
is at position (x(t), y(t)), where x(t) and y(t)

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.502
are not explicitly given.

00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:14.141
For t is greater than or equal to 0,

00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:17.390
the derivative of x with respect to t is 4t+1

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.797
the derivative of y with respect to t is sin(t^2)

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:26.240
and at time t=0, x(0)=0 and y(0)=-4

00:00:26.378 --> 00:00:28.800
Fair enough, let's do part a.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.610
Find the speed of the particle at time t=3,

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:37.067
and find the acceleration vector of the particle at

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:40.533
time t is equal to 3 as well.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:45.333
So, the speed is really just the magnitude of the velocity vector.

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.137
So what's the velocity vector?

00:00:47.137 --> 00:00:50.979
Our velocity vector as a function of time

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.890
is going to be equal to the derivative of our x position

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.467
as a function of time, or we could say the velocity in the x-direction

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:06.887
times the i unit vector, plus the velocity in the y-direction times the j unit vector.

00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:08.383
I just wrote this in engineering notation,

00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:12.307
obviously there are many ways that you could specify a vector.

00:01:12.307 --> 00:01:15.800
And, in this case, x'(t), they've already given it to us:

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.000
x'(t) is 4t+1

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.333
they just wrote it as dx/dt.

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:27.005
So this over here is 4t+1 times the i unit vector,

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:31.467
and then this here, this y'(t), they gave it to us

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:33.933
the derivative of y with respect to t is sin(t^2).

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:41.800
So, plus sin(t^2) times the j unit vector.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.502
That is our velocity vector. So what is our velocity-

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:49.134
or this is our velocity vector as a function of time,

00:01:49.134 --> 00:01:53.185
So what is our velocity at time t=3?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.000
Well, we just have to substitute 3 for t, so 4(3)+1 is 13i.

00:02:01.123 --> 00:02:11.216
Plus 3 squared- 3 squared is 9 -sine of 9. Plus sin9j.

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:15.000
Our speed, what they want us to figure out is going to be

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.200
equal to- or maybe I should write it as our speed at time 3

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.400
-our speed is going to be equal to the magnitude of our velocity vector at time 3,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.933
which is equal to the magnitude of 13i+(sin9)j.

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:40.133
And then this we literally, this is, we use essentially the Pythagorean Theorem

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:41.133
to find the magnitude.

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:47.400
This is going to be equal to the square root of 169 (that's 13 squared)

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.746
plus (sin9)^2. So let me get my TI-85 out.

00:02:55.961 --> 00:03:00.048
This part of the exam we are allowed to use calculators.

00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:15.058
So we get the square root of 169+(sin9)^2.

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:18.608
Alright, that's 13 squared plus sin9 squared.

00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:24.133
And, we get- we get 13.00- I'll just round it to 7,

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:27.513
just to show that we didn't get just straight up 13,

00:03:27.513 --> 00:03:30.067
that the sin9 squared did do something.

00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:33.255
So 13.007.

00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:38.384
So this is approximately equal to 13.007.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.381
So we've answered the first part.

00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:45.200
The speed of the particle at time t=3 is 13.007.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.933
Then they want us to find the acceleration vector of the particle at time t=3.

00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:58.214
So the acceleration vector as a function of time is just going to be the second derivative of x

00:03:58.214 --> 00:04:01.733
with respect to t, or you'd say the acceleration in the x-direction

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:06.769
as a function as a function of time times i, plus the acceleration in the y-direction.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.472
So it's the second derivative of y with respect to t in the j-direction.

00:04:11.472 --> 00:04:14.676
And this, of course, is just going to be equal to

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:19.800
the derivative of x of- the derivative of x- the second derivative of x(t) is just the derivative of

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.667
the first derivative. So the first derivative is 4t+1,

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.892
you take the derivative of that, you just get 4.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:34.067
So, we get 4i plus... and then the derivative- the second derivative, or the second derivative of y with respect to t

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:35.733
is just the derivative of the first derivative.

00:04:35.733 --> 00:04:39.963
The derivative- the first derivative is sin(t^2), so

00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:48.554
derivative of that is going to be 2t*cos(t^2), and of course we have our j.

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:52.400
We have our j right over there and I just did this from the chain rule.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.533
The derivative of t^2 with respect to t is 2t,

00:04:58.533 --> 00:05:04.733
derivative of sin(t^2) with respect to t^2 is cos(t^2).

00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:08.440
And so that is the acceleration vector as a function of t

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.400
but they care at time t is equal to 3.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.795
So, 4 still stays 4, then you have 2(3)+cos(9).

00:05:17.795 --> 00:05:21.733
So let me write this, this is going to be our acceleration vector

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:24.667
our acceleration vector at time 3 is going to be

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:32.733
4i plus... and let's just put, if this is 2 times 3, which is 6...

00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:38.547
(6cos9)j.

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:42.575
Let's get the calculator out so we actually get a value there

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:45.242
since they allow us to use or almost want us to use a calculator here.

00:05:45.242 --> 00:05:56.133
So, 6cos9 is negative 5.47, or 5.467 if we want.

00:05:56.133 --> 00:06:02.400
So, plus negative- oh, what was I doing, this is j

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.333
-so plus -5.467j.

00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:09.867
So that is our acceleration vector.

00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:12.410
And once again, I wrote it in engineering notation

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.800
(which I'm sure the advanced placement exam people wouldn't mind)

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.733
but you could also write it in kind-of

00:06:20.102 --> 00:06:23.533
the paramiterized vector notation or your ordered-pair notation as a vector

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:27.733
you could say that the acceleration vector at time 3

00:06:27.733 --> 00:06:29.067
you could write it this way too:

00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:33.369
&lt;4, -5.467&gt;

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:34.933
These are really specifying the same thing.

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:36.133
This is the x-component of the vector,

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:38.000
this is the y-component of the vector.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.221
This is the x-component of the vector,

00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:41.817
this is the y-component of the vector.
