00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.070
Now our probability problems
will get a little bit

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.860
more interesting.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.700
So let's say I have a
bag full of coins.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.360
So this is my bag of coins,
maybe it's a bowl of coins.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.690
From a bunch of coins in there.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.820
I didn't need to draw
it, but I did anyway.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.510
And let's say that I know that
9 of these coins are normal.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.390
So what do I mean my normal?

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.210
Just, you know, let's say
they're quarters and they have

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.580
a heads and a tails, and that
there's a 50% chance of getting

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.260
a heads or 50% chance of
a tails if you flip

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.640
any of those coins.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.090
And then, 1 of the coins
is a two-sided head coin.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.110
So essentially, no matter
what you flip it, it's

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.070
going to be a heads.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.740
So I have this bag, what I'm
going to do is I'm going to

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.820
blindfold myself, stick my
hand in the bag, and

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.380
pick a coin out.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.230
And then I'm going to flip
that coin, I'm going

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.950
to flip it five times.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.590
And my question to you is,
what is the probability that

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.515
I get all 5 to be heads?

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.400
So whenever you see something
unfamiliar it'll always work--

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.620
maybe we'll do a tree or we'll
do a hybrid of a probability

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.500
tree or something else.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.630
But you say, well, at the very
beginning of this experiment

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.720
something happens.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.880
I'm going to pick a
coin out of this bag.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.350
And so you could say that
there's a-- well, how

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.050
many coins are there?

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.630
There's 10 coins and I have an
equal probability of picking

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.355
any one of the coins.

00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:43.690
Let's say I can't feel
whether it's heads or tails.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.250
I'm doing it with gloves
on, so I can't feel out

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.280
the two-sided coin.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.150
Take my word for it, there's
an equal probability to take

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.440
any 1 of these 10 coins.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.370
There's 9 normal, 1 weird
with 2 heads on it.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.320
So what's the probability
that I get a normal coin?

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.530
Well, there are 9 normal
coins out of the 10 equally

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.830
likely coins I could get.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.560
So the probability of a
normal is 9 out of 10.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.755
So there's a 9 out of 10 chance
that this is a normal coin

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:18.890
Let's just call that normal.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.560
And then, what's the
probability that I get

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.930
a-- let's call it a
2s-- two-sided coin.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.080
I'll call it 2s.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.800
Well, that's just 1 out of 10.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.670
I'm either going to
get this or that.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.060
I'm not going to take nothing
out of the bag I assume.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.630
OK, so this is a 1/10 chance
that I get a two-sided coin.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.280
And then whichever coin
I get I'm going to flip

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.620
it five times in a row.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.010
And I'm not going to do
the tree here because

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.720
to drew a tree I'd have
32 nodes on each side.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.450
But given this, given
the normal, what is

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.220
now the probability of
getting 5 in a row?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.110
The way I'm going to write that
is the probability of 5 heads--

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.690
or I could have written 5
out of 5 heads, whatever.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.120
And then this upper line, this
means given-- given that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.370
I have a normal coin.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.620
So if I can assume that I had a
normal coin, what are the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.180
probabilities that my next 5--
so I'll say this is

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.330
5 out of 5 heads.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.380
Well, we figure that out.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.900
Each time there's a 1/2
probability and I'm going

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.520
to do it 5 in a row.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.800
So it's 1/2 to the fifth,
which equals 1/32.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.440
So the probability that I get
5 out of 5 heads given a

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.280
normal coin is 1 out of 32.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.570
Fair enough.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:47.520
Well, what's the probability
of 5 out of 5 heads,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.890
given the two-sided coin?

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.750
And now just is this random
notation I'm coming

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.370
with the two-sided.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.960
But this upwards and downwards
line, this vertical

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.310
line, that means given.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.490
I mean I could flip this coin
a million times and all of

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.830
them are going to be heads.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.630
So the probability
here is 1 out of 1.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.380
I'm definitely going
to get a heads here.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.770
So all I asked initially is,
what is the probability that

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.190
I get 5 out of 5 heads?

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.730
Well, this is going to be equal
to-- and I'll switch colors

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.510
arbitrarily here just to
keep things interesting.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.230
This is going to be equal to
the probability that you get 5

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:44.400
out of 5 heads given-- let's
call that a normal coin-- given

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.170
a normal coin times the
probability that you had a

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.110
normal coin times
the probability of

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.740
let's say normal.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.090
Plus-- and I'm running a little
out of space-- the probability

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:06.390
that you get 5 out of 5 heads
given the two-sided coin times

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.660
the probability that you had
the two-sided sided coin.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.710
Hopefully that makes sense and
you kind of think of it in this

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.140
way, what is the probability
of getting to this outcome?

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.510
It is the probability that you
picked a normal coin and then,

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.780
given the normal coin,
there's a 1 in 32 chance

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.630
that you got there.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.670
So it'd be 1 out of 32
times the chance you've

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.520
got the normal coin.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.340
So 9 out of 10.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.820
And what's the probability
of getting here?

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.700
What's the probability you had
to-- and, in general, in a

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.390
tree, you just have to multiply
all of the nodes to get to that

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.400
point to figure out what's the
probability of getting there.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.000
And I think if you watched
the first few videos it make

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.690
sense why that happens.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.090
So what's the
probability of this?

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.490
Well, there's a 1/10 chance
that you picked the

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.670
two-sided coin.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.410
And then of course, you're
guaranteed to get all heads.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.870
This is 1 times 1/10.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.550
And all I did here and
here is the same thing

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.440
that I wrote up here.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.990
Let me switch colors.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.720
So what is this, the
probability of 5 out of 5 heads

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.290
given a normal coin times the
probability of a normal coin?

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.320
Well, that's just this.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.620
This is the probability of 5
out of 5 heads given the normal

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.260
coin times the probability
of a normal coin.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.340
And this is equal to what?

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.590
9/320.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.230
And then this, the probability
of 5 out of 5 heads given the

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.810
two-sided coin times the
probability of the

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.980
two-sided coin.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.970
Well, this is the probability
of 5 out of 5 heads given

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.400
the two-sided coin, you're
guaranteed to get 5 out of 5.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.260
And the probability of
getting a two-sided

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.560
coin is 1 out of 10.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.620
This is this.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.850
So this is equal to 1/10.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.070
So my probability of just
putting my hand in the bag,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.630
taking out a random coin and
then flipping it five times and

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:57.270
getting all 5 heads, is going
to be equal to this plus this.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.100
So it's 9/320.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.180
plus 1/10.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.433
But let's make
that so it's 320.

00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:12.320
That's 32/320.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.790
So 9 plus 32 is 41/320.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.560
So that's interesting.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.390
But now let me ask you even a
more interesting question.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.390
This is why I think what we've
learned so far is useful.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.120
Let's say that I do
get 5 out of 5 heads.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.370
So I know that I got
5 out of 5 heads.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.910
So let me clear this up a
little bit just because I think

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.540
it's getting over-- So let's
say that I do get

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.980
5 out of 5 heads.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.140
What is the probability that
I picked the two-sided coin?

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.570
So what we're asking is, what
is the probability that I

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.080
picked the two-sided coin,
given that I got 5

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.990
out of 5 heads?

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.290
And I hope you understand
what I mean here.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.380
Before we said, oh, for
example, I hope you see the

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.660
difference between this and
what is the probability of

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:15.840
getting 5 out of 5 heads,
given the two-sided coin.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.210
If I know I have a two-sided
coin, I know that the

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.500
probability is equal to 1.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.710
I know that I'm guaranteed
to get 5 heads.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.430
But this is a little
bit more interesting.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.650
If I flip a coin five times in
a row and I get a bunch of

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.600
heads, I'll say, well, I either
got maybe really lucky with a

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.350
normal coin or I picked
the two-sided coin.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.110
And I don't know which
one happened, so

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.030
there's a probability.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.430
And of course, the more times
you get a heads, just

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.820
intuitively, if I got 100 heads
in a row I'll say, well, I

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.340
probably picked the two-sided
coin without actually just

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.140
looking at the coin.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.000
We're assuming that
that's not acceptable.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.680
And if I got a million heads in
a row we'd be really, really

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.370
sure that we picked the
two-sided coin, but we're

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.380
not completely sure.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.940
There's some probability that I
picked the fair coin and it

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.690
just happened to get heads
a million times in a row.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.170
So how do we think about this?

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.500
Well, I'll do it analytically
and I'll draw it out, and

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.400
hopefully, both of them
will make sense to you.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.950
And I'll probably have to
do it in the next video.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.672
I'll see you soon.
