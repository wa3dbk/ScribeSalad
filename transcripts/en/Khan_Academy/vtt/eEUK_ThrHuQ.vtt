00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.980
I've got a 2 by 2 matrix here.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.430
Let's say A is equal
to a, b, c, d.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.990
So I'm going to keep
it really general.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.570
So this is really any
2 by 2 matrix.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.070
What I want to do is use our
technique for finding an

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.920
inverse of this matrix to
essentially find a formula for

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.610
the inverse of a
2 by 2 matrix.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.170
So I want to essentially find a
inverse, and I want to do it

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.390
just using a formula that it
just applies to this matrix

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.960
right here.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.020
So how can I do that?

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.300
Well, we know a technique.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.690
We just create an augmented
matrix.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.330
So let's just create an
augmented matrix right here.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.110
So we have a, b, c, d, and then
we augment it with the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.920
identity in R2, so 1, 0, 0, 1.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.410
And we know if we perform a
series of row operations on

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.680
this augmented matrix to get the
left-hand side in reduced

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.880
row echelon form.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.500
The right-hand side, if the
reduced row echelon form here

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.790
gets to the identity, then the
right-hand side is going to be

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.710
the inverse.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.780
So let's do it in this general
case, not dealing with

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.310
particular numbers here.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.990
So the first thing I want to do,
or I would like to do, is

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.050
I would like to zero
this guy out.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.060
What we want to do is we want
to zero that out, zero that

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.860
out, and then these two terms
have to become equal to 1.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.810
So the best way to zero this
out, let's perform a little

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.470
transformation here.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.790
So if I perform the
transformation on the columns,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.560
C1, so those are the entries
of a column-- this would be

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.780
one column right here, that
would be another column right

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.440
there, that's the third column,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.210
that's the fourth column.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.170
But the transformation I'm going
to perform on each of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.940
these columns, and we know this
is equivalent to a row

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.800
operation, is going to be equal
to-- since I want to

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.580
zero this one out, I'm going to
keep my first row the same,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.000
so it's going to be C1, and I'm
going to replace my second

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.430
row with a times my second row
minus c times my first row.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.790
Now why am I doing that?

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.240
Because a times c minus c times
a is going to be 0.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.820
So this guy's going to be 0.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.890
That's the row operation
I'm going to perform.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.259
And I'm doing this so we can
kind of keep track, account

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.110
for what we're doing because
the algebra's going to get

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.305
hairy in a little bit.

00:02:13.305 --> 00:02:15.920
So let me perform
this operation.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.920
So if I perform that operation
on our matrix, what do we

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.950
have.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.320
So our first row's going
to be the same.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.010
Let me start with our second
row because that's a little

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.570
bit more complicated.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.030
So I'm going to replace c with
a times c minus c times a.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.710
That's ac-- so let me put it
this way-- so that's going to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.930
be 0 right there.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:45.820
I'm going to replace d with d
times a or a times d minus c

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.200
times C1 in this
column vector.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.360
So minus c times b.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.940
Let me write this as bc.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.220
And then let me augment it.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.830
And then this guy's going to be
a times 0, because he's C2

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.480
minus c times C1.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.580
So it's going to be minus c.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.340
And then finally, this guy right
here is going to be a

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.450
times 1-- a times this 1 right
here-- minus c times 0.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.870
So that's just going
to be an a.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.330
And then the first row is
pretty straightforward.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.980
We know that the first row or
the first entries in our

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.820
column vectors just stay
the same through this

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.450
transformation.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.790
So it's a, b, 1, 0.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.000
And just to make sure you're
clear what we're doing, when

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.400
you perform this transformation
on this column

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.100
vector right here, you
got this column

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.550
vector right there.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.450
When you perform the
transformation on this column

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.490
vector right there, you
get this column

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.560
vector right there.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.020
Now I just want to make that
clear because I did all of the

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.200
second entries of all of the
column vectors at once because

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.080
we all were essentially
performing the same row

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.800
operation, so that just helped
me simplify at least my

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.570
thinking a little bit.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.460
Let me stay in this mode.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.180
So let's continue to get this
in reduced row echelon form.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.020
The next thing we want to do
is, let's make another

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.020
transformation, we'll
call this T1.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.780
That was our first
transformation.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.180
Let's do another
transformation.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.350
T2, or another set of
row operations.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.490
So if I start with the column
vector C1, C2, what I want to

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.790
do now is I want to keep my
second row the same and I want

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.019
to zero out this character
right here.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.760
I want to zero him out.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.490
I know I'm going to keep my
second row the same, so C2 is

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.680
just going to still be C2.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.470
But in order to zero this out,
what I can do is I can replace

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.000
the first row with this scaling
factor times the first

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.250
row minus this scaling factor
times the second row.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.970
So it'll be ad minus bc times
your first entry in your

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.260
column vector minus b times
your second entry.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.000
And the whole reason why I'm
doing that is so that this guy

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.820
zeroes out.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.730
So if we apply that to this
matrix up here-- let's do the

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.610
first row first.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.680
So this first entry right here
is going to be ad minus bc

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.725
times a, because that's C1--
let me write that down.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:20.330
So it's ad minus bc times a
minus b times C2 minus 0.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.210
So it's just going to be--
that second term

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.050
just becomes 0.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.020
Fair enough.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.310
Now what is this guy
going to be?

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.800
He's going to be-- I'll
write it out.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:40.440
He's going to be ad minus bc
times b minus b times your C2

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.330
in this column vector, minus
b times ad minus bc.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.070
And you can see immediately that
these two guys are going

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.370
to cancel out and you're
going to get a 0 there.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.340
And then we've got
to augment it.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.140
I want to make sure I don't run
out of space, I should've

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.050
started to the left
a little bit more.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.640
So what's this guy
going to be?

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.316
Well I'm going to have this guy
times ad minus bc-- I'll

00:06:03.316 --> 00:06:07.940
do it in pink-- so you're going
to have ad minus bc

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.950
times 1, which is just ad minus
bc minus b times C2, so

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.810
minus b times minus c.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.060
So that's plus bc.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.350
So 1 times ad minus bc
minus b times minus

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.620
c is equal to that.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.460
And you can immediately see
that these two guys will

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.990
cancel out.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.570
You're just [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.590
ad.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.660
And then this guy over here,
you're going to have 0 times

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.440
ad minus bc, which is just
a 0, minus b times a.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.070
So you have minus ab-- just
squeeze it in there.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.240
And we know that our second
row just stays the same.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.680
Our second row just stays the
same in this transformation.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.580
So we had a 0 here, we're
still going to have a 0.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.740
We had an ad minus bc.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.880
We'll still have
an ad minus bc.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.950
We had a minus c.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.300
Then we had an a.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.470
Just like that.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.640
Now let me re-write this matrix
just so it gets cleaned

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.430
up a little bit.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.100
So let me re-write
it right here.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.150
I'll do it in my orange--
well, let me

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.910
do it in this yellow.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:21.310
So I have ad minus bc times a.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.490
And then this term right
here just became a 0.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.200
This term right here is a 0.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.010
This term right here
is an ad minus bc.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.800
And then our augmented part,
this part was just an ad.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.860
This was a minus ab.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.660
This is a minus c.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.310
And then this is an a.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.460
Now we're almost at reduced row
echelon form right here.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.550
These two things just have to be
equal to 1 in order to get

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.850
reduced row echelon form.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.190
So let's define a transformation
that'll make

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.910
both of these equal to 1.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.680
So if this was T2 let me define
my transformation T3.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.170
You give it a column
vector, C1, C2.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.740
And it's just going to scale
each of the column vectors.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.650
So what I want to do is I want
to divide my first entries by

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.990
this scaling factor right here
so that this becomes a 1.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:25.450
So I'm essentially going to
multiply 1 over ad minus bc

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.870
times a, so 1 over ad, bc, a
times my first entry in each

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.020
of my column vectors.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.809
And then my second one I
want to divide by this.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.600
So that this guy becomes a 1.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.120
So I'm doing two scalar
divisions in one

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.020
transformation.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:47.700
So this one's going to be 1
over ad minus bc times C2.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.810
So I'm just scaling everything
by these two scaling factors.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.840
So if you apply this
transformation to that right

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.820
there, what do we get?

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.960
We get a matrix.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.920
And this guy, I'm going to
divide him by ad minus bc

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.010
times a, so I'm dividing
it by itself, so that

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.810
guy's going to be 1.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.340
I'm going to divide 0 by
this, but 0 divided by

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.360
anything is just 0.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.940
Then we're in an
augmented part.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.340
ad divided by-- so let me
write it like this.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.120
So ad-- I'm going to divide by
this-- so it's going to be ad

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.060
minus bc times a-- you
immediately see that the a's

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.450
cancel out.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:34.180
This is going to be minus
ab divided by ad

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.640
minus bc times a.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.900
Once again, the a's
cancel out.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.150
And then in my second row are my
second entries in my column

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.940
vectors, 0 divided
by anything is 0.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.290
So 0 divided by this thing is
going to be 0, assuming we can

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.020
divide by that, and we're
going to talk

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.050
about that in a second.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.840
This guy divided by this guy,
we're just dividing by

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.180
himself, so it's going
to be equal to 1.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:06.190
Now we have minus c divided
by this, or ad minus bc.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.470
And then we have an a.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.370
a divided by ad, ad minus bc.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.280
And we're done.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.740
We put the left-hand side of
our augmented matrix into

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.410
reduced row echelon form.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.080
And now this is going
to be our inverse.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.260
So let me clean it
up a little bit.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.270
So, so far we started off with
a matrix-- I'll do it in

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.830
purple-- we started off
with a matrix a is

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.830
equal to a, b, c, d.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.510
And now just using our technique
we figured out that

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.740
a inverse is equal to this
thing right here.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.020
And just to simplify-- well let
me just write it the way I

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.705
have it there, because I don't
want to skip any steps-- this

00:10:46.705 --> 00:10:52.920
is equal to d over
ad minus bc.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.670
Right, this guy and that
guy canceled out.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:02.290
And then we have a minus b over
ad minus bc because that

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.110
guy and that guy canceled out.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:09.080
Then you have a minus
c over ad minus bc.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.100
And then finally you have
an a over ad minus bc,

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.430
which is our inverse.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.460
But one thing might just pop out
at you immediately is that

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.760
everything in our inverse is
being divided by this.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.640
So maybe an easier way
to write our inverse.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.290
We could also write our
inverse like this.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:31.950
We could just write it as 1
over ad minus bc times the

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:38.800
matrix d minus b
minus c and a.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.550
And just like that we have come
up with a formula for the

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.290
inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.320
You give me any real numbers
here and I'm going to give you

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.970
its inverse.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.280
That straightforward.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.510
Now one thing you might be
saying, hey, but not all 2 by

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.620
2 matrices are invertible.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.390
How can this be the case
for all of them.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.740
And I'll give you a question,
when will this thing right

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.940
here not be defined?

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.520
When is this thing
not defined?

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.710
Every operation I did, I can do
with any real numbers, and

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.930
this applies to any
real numbers.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.240
But when is this thing
not defined?

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.160
Well it's not defined
when I divide by 0.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.900
And when would I divide by 0?

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.650
Everything else you can multiply
and subtract and add

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.330
a zero to anything, but you
just can't divide by 0.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.980
We've never defined what it
means when you divide

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.000
something by 0.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.060
So it's not defined if ad
minus bc is equal to 0.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.530
So this is an interesting
thing.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:44.470
I can always find the inverse of
a 2 by 2 matrix as long as

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.590
ad minus bc is not equal to 0.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.510
We came up with all of these
fancy things for

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.120
invertability, you've got to
put it into reduced row

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.410
echelon form, and before
that we talked being

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.150
on 2 and 1 to 1.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.870
For at least a 2 by
2 matrix we've

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.440
really simplified things.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:07.220
As long as ad minus bc does not
equal 0, we can use this

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.960
formula and then we know that
a-- and it goes both ways-- a

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.470
is invertible.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.930
And not only is it invertible,
but we can just apply this

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.200
formula to it.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.900
So immediately something
interesting might-- you might

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.000
say hey, this is an interesting
number.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.990
We should come up with
some name for it.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.620
And lucky for us, we have come
up with a name for it.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.870
This is called the
determinant.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.650
Let me write it in pink.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.900
Determinant.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:45.670
So the determinant of a, and
it's also written like this

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.580
with these little straight lines
around a, and you could

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.700
also write it like
this, a, b, c, d.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.040
But most people kind of think
this is redundant to have

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.830
brackets and these lines.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.070
So then they just write it like
this, this is equal to

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.650
just, they just write the
lines, a, b, c, d.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.670
I want to make this
very clear.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.250
If you have the brackets you're
dealing with a matrix.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.410
If you have just these straight
lines you're talking

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.740
about the determinant
of the matrix.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.930
But this is defined for
the 2 by 2 case to be

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.920
equal to ad minus bc.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:28.050
This is a definition
of the determinant.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.100
So we can re-write, if we have
some matrix here, we have some

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:37.730
matrix a which is equal
to a, b, c, d.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:43.690
We can now write its inverse,
a inverse is equal to 1 over

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.920
this thing, which we've defined
as the determinant of

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:54.570
a times-- and let's just
see a good way of kind

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.500
of memorizing this.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.940
We're swapping these two
guys, right, the a

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.000
and the d get swapped.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.390
So you get a d and an a.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.050
And then these two guys
stay the same,

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.130
they just become negative.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.800
So minus b and minus c.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.890
So that's the general
formula for the

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.600
determinant of a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.350
Let's try to do a couple.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:20.500
Let's try to find the
determinant of the

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:26.270
matrix 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.190
Easy enough.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.750
So the determinant of-- let's
say this is the matrix B.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.040
So the determinant of B, or we
could write it like that,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.270
that's equal to the
determinant of B.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.320
That is just equal to-- that's
this thing right here-- 1

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:49.300
times 4 minus 3 times 2, which
is equal to 4 minus 6, which

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.480
is equal to minus 2.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.760
So the determinant is minus
2, so this is invertible.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.810
Not only is it invertible, but
it's very easy to find its

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:58.330
inverse now.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.990
We can apply this formula.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.020
The inverse of B in this case--
let me do it in this

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.635
color-- B inverse is equal to
1 over the determinant, so

00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:12.650
it's 1 over minus 2 times the
matrix where we swap-- well,

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.725
this is the determinant of B.

00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:15.720
I want to be careful.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.980
B is the same thing,
but with brackets.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.190
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.410
So B inverse is going to be 1
over the determinant of B,

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.510
which is equal to minus 2.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.880
So 1 over minus 2.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.430
We swap these two guys, so they
get a 4 and a 1, and then

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.150
these two guys become
negative-- minus 2

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.970
and then minus 3.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.010
And then if we were to multiply
this out it would be

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.920
equal to minus 1/2 times
4 is minus 2.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.980
Minus 1/2 times minus 2 is 1.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.220
Minus 1/2 times minus
3 is 3/2, minus 1/2

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.610
times 1 is minus 1/2.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.010
So that there is the
inverse of B.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.780
Now let's say we have
another matrix.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.060
Let's say we have the
matrix C, and C is

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:05.400
equal to 1, 2, 3, 6.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.390
What is the determinant of C?

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.710
It is equal to-- we could write
this way-- 1, 2, 3, 6.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:21.280
And it is equal to 1 times 6
minus 3 times 2, which is

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.079
equal to 6 minus 6, which
is equal to 0.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:29.110
And there you see it's equal to
0, so you cannot find-- so

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.360
this is not invertible.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.170
So we can't find its inverse
because if we would try to

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.550
apply this formula right here
you'd have a 1 over 0.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.180
But we know this formula just
comes out-- that attempt to

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.570
put it into reduced row echelon
form, and in that last

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.600
step we just had to essentially
divide everything

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.540
by these terms. So these terms
would be 0 in this matrix C

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.430
that I just constructed
for you.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.510
And the reason why I knew-- I
just pulled this out of my

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.810
brain-- I knew this wasn't going
to be invertible because

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.410
I constructed a situation where
I have columns that are

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.820
linear combinations
of each other.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.950
I have 1, 3-- you multiply that
by 2 you get 2 and 6.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.900
So I knew that these aren't
linearly independent columns.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.250
So you know that its rank wasn't
going to be equal to,

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.800
so I knew it wasn't going to be
invertible, but we see that

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.640
here by just computing
its determinant.
