00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.550
We've been doing a lot of
rotating around the x-axis, so

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.870
let's start rotating around the
y-axis and see what we can do.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.620
Or at least attempt to.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.150
Let's me draw my axes.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.740
That's y-axis.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.770
That's my x-axis.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.173
Well let's just do it with an
example, but we'll call it f

00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:24.460
of x too because it'll
be generalizable.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.635
Let's just draw y
equals x squared.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.450
Let me just draw the positive
because we're going to rotate

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.900
it around the y-axis and it's
symmetric anyway, so that's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.160
y equals x squared.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.650
This is y-axis.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.870
This is x-axis.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.840
Actually, no I'm going to keep
it general, then we'll actually

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.660
solve it particularly.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.820
So we'll call this f of
x, but clearly this is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.990
y equals x squared.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.900
This is f of x.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.830
And we know how to take the
volume if I were to rotate

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.770
this around the x-axis.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.720
But what if I wanted to say-- I
guess we could call it the area

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.030
between 0 and-- I'm trying to
determine how general to be.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.400
Well let's just say
between 0 and 1.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.120
I think the boundaries
might make sense to you.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.360
Roughly this area, and
I'm going to rotate it

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.240
around the y-axis now.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.460
So what's that final figure
going to look like?

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.870
The base of it-- let me see
how well I can draw it.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.390
Nope that's not what
I wanted to do.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.790
The base is going to
look something like a

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.750
cylinder like that.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.830
And then the top of it is also
going to be-- no, that's

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.620
not what I wanted to do.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.560
Let me draw the side lines.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.110
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.790
And then the top of it
looks something like that.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.440
But it's not just going
to be cylinder, right?

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.200
If I was doing this entire
block it would be a cylinder.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.630
But the inside of it is going
to be kind of hollowed out.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.530
Let me see how effective
I am at drawing that.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.340
I'll do it in a
different color.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.790
So the inside is going
to be hollowed out.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.350
I don't know if that
makes sense to you that.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.540
It's kind of like on the inside
it'll look like a bowl.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.310
On the outside it'll look
like a cylinder or a can.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.990
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.800
You take this and you
rotate this around.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.660
And the curve that specifies
the inside would be y

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.060
is equal to x squared.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.890
It would rotate all
the way around.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.730
I think that makes sense.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.340
The drawing is the
hardest part.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.780
So how do we do it?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.900
Well even the shape
might give you an idea.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.910
We can't use that disk method,
what we were doing before when

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.090
we were rotating the x-axis,
that was the disk method,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.600
because we were essentially
imagining each of these

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.140
particular disks and
then summing them up.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.510
Now we're going to do something
called the shell method.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.460
So what's the shell method?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.460
Instead of taking a bunch of
disks and figuring out their

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.180
combined volumes, we're going
to take a bunch of shells.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.430
So what's a shell?

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.570
So imagine a rectangle
right here.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.280
Hope you can see
it right there.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.710
Let's say it's at
the point x,1.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.300
What's its height going to be?

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.645
Its height going
to be f of x,1.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.990
That's its height.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.150
Now imagine taking that
sliver and rotating

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.810
it around the y-axis.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.650
What's it going to look like?

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.550
Well, it's going to look like a
shell, it's going to look like

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.910
a cylinder, just like the
outside of a cylinder.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.120
It's going to look not too
different then that but I want

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.950
to draw it well because
intuition is the most important

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.720
thing that, not getting
the problem right.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.810
Let me see if I can
draw this respectably.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.230
And then we're going to have
the bottom of the shell, it'll

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.520
look something like that.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.910
Let me finish these lines up.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.400
I think you get the point.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.000
OK.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.700
So it's going to look
like a shell like that.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.385
The outside of the shell
is going to be solid.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.450
And it'll have some width,
but the inside is hollow.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.390
Let me do a different color.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.395
Maybe a darker color to show
that that's the inside.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.610
You know it's like a
ring essentially.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.980
And so what's the
height of this ring?

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.310
The height is going
to be f of x,1.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.070
So let me do a brighter color
so you know what I'm saying.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.470
The height of this
ring is f of x,1.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.530
f of x evaluated at that
arbitrary point we picked up.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.430
What is going to be the
surface area of this ring?

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.300
You know, this outside.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.970
Well let's think about it.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.880
It'll be the circumference of
this ring times it's height.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.530
So what's the circumference
of this ring?

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.560
Let's go back to our
basic geometry.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.280
Circumference is equal to
2 pi times the radius.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.790
So if we know the radius of it,
we know the circumference.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:29.790
Well what's the radius?

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.750
Well the radius is how far
we went from the axis of

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.510
rotation to that point.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.395
So that's the radius.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.880
So in our particular
example the radius is x,1.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.610
It's that x point that
we're evaluating it at.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.330
So circumference is going to be
equal to 2 pi times that point

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.680
that we're evaluating at.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.640
And so the surface area-- this
magenta thing that I filled

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.060
in-- that's going to be equal
to the circumference times this

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.740
height, which we already
said is f of x,1.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.900
Let's call it area surface.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.610
Surface area is equal to
circumference times height,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:21.830
which is equal to 2 pi
x,1 times f of x,1.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.640
We figured out the
surface are of this.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.705
Now how do we figure
out the volume?

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.840
Well what's the width of it?

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.040
How thick is this ring?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.630
What's this thickness
right here?

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.005
It's a very small thickness.

00:06:35.005 --> 00:06:38.250
But we took this sliver, and
this sliver as we learned in

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.770
previous calculus, the width of
this little rectangle is dx.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.270
And you know when we take the
integral, it's going to get

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.670
infinitely smaller and smaller
and we'll have infinitely

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.740
more and more of them.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.870
So the width of this is dx.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.990
Let me draw it big, not
so horrible looking.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:59.880
So if this is a sliver,
it's width is dx.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.980
It's height is f of x,1.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.840
x,1 will be right
in the center.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.600
And then it's distance from
the center is of course x,1.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.980
Hopefully that make sense.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.260
So what's the volume
of this shell?

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.450
So the volume of the shell--
this shell, not this one-- the

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.570
volume of the shell is going to
be equal to the surface area

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.020
of the shell times how
wide that surface is.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.490
And that width is dx, so it's
going to equal this times dx.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.480
So the volume of that
shell is 2 pi x,1 times

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.350
f of x,1 times dx.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.350
I think you see where I'm
going with this now.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.170
So what would be the volume
of the entire rotated

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.400
figure, this thing here?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.060
Well I'm just going to sum
up each of these shells.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.920
I have one shell there, then
here I'll have a slightly less

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.880
high shell, and up here I would
have a much bigger shell,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.040
and I'll add them up.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.100
Here's one shell
that goes around.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.200
Then they'll be another shell
here, and I'll add them all up.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.810
And that's taking the integral.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.820
So the total volume of the
figure when I rotate it around

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:12.020
the y-axis is going to be-- and
my boundary is from 0 to 1-- 2

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.110
pi-- this one I just told you a
particular x,1 but we're going

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.560
to sum them over
all of the x's.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.550
So it's going to be
2 pi x f of x dx.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.160
This is just a constant,
so you could call it

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.110
2 pi times x f of x.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.550
So let's take a
particular example.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.290
Let's do it for x squared.

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.370
Let's say the function
is x squared.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.786
So in this case the volume is
going to equal-- let's take the

00:08:37.786 --> 00:08:44.500
2 pi out-- 2 pi integral 0 to 1
x times f of x-- f of x in our

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:50.650
case is x squared, which I drew
earlier-- dx equals 2 pi.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.840
This is just x to
the third, right?

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.720
x to the third.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.080
So it's going to be 2 pi
times the antiderivative

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.290
of x to the third.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.940
Well that's x to
the fourth over 4.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.280
Evaluate it at 1 minus
evaluate it at 0.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.630
Well that equals 2 pi times
1 to the fourth is 1, so

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:16.220
1/4 and then minus 0.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.690
So it's 2 pi times 1/4.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.140
So that's pi over 2.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.990
That's the volume, and we just
rotated it around the y-axis.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.360
I will see you in
the next video.
