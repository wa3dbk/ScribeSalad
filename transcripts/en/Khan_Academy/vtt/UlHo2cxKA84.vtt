00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.840
We're on problem 7.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.100
And they drew this graph, so I
guess I'll draw it as well.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.920
That's the x-axis.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.170
That's the y-axis.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.010
Let's see, they draw 1, 2,
and they draw 1, 2, 3.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.640
And then the graph goes through
here and then curves

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.530
up like that and actually
goes through

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.060
this point right there.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.320
It goes through y is equal
to 3, at least the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.340
way they drew it.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.630
On the graph before, when x
equals 1/2, y is equal to 2.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.380
So they're saying that
this point right here

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.510
is 1/2 comma 2.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.760
Fair enough.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.260
And when x is equal to
1, y is equal to 1.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.480
So they're saying that this
point right here-- I'll do it

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.560
in a different color, just to
not make it too confusing--

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.830
that point right there is
the point 1 comma 1.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.180
The graph is symmetrical with
respect to the vertical line

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.270
at x equals 2.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.410
So that means that it's a
mirror image around that

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.340
vertical line.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.910
According to the graph when
x is equal to 3, y

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.480
should be equal to?

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.850
So when x is equal to 3, we are
1 away from the line x is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.010
equal to 2, or what the line is
a mirror image of, right?

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.750
So when we were 1 to the
left of it, that's when

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.360
x is equal to 1.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.400
And we learned y
is equal to 1.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.160
So for 1 to the right-- and this
is symmetric around this

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.430
line-- then we're going to have
the same height, right?

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.100
So when we were 1 to the
left, the height was 1.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.350
When we're 1 to the right, the
height should also be 1.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.710
So this should be the
point 3 comma 1.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.350
So the choice is E.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.010
All that other information was
kind of a waste of time.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.470
Next problem.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.250
Problem 8.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.880
When 1/10% of 5,000--
I always like to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.820
get these into decimals.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.710
1/10% that equals this divided
by 100, so it's 1/1,000.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.420
So it's 0.001.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.840
So 0.001 times 5,000 is
subtracted from 1/10 of 5,000.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.310
The difference is-- OK.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:30.820
So they're saying 1/10 of 5,000
minus 1/1,000 of 5,000.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.020
Right?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.570
That's 1/10 of a percent
is 1,000.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.430
So you get 500 minus 5, right?

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.400
That's 495, which is choice D.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.080
Problem 9.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.520
Which of the following is the
value of the square root of

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.990
the cube root.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.200
So let's see.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.420
How many 0's do they have?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.250
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.340
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 4.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.710
OK.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.870
So there's-- how many
total numbers are

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.480
behind the decimal point?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.630
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.320
So it's a cube root.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.550
So some number times itself 3
times is equal to 0.0064.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.590
And you know whenever you
multiply decimals, you add up

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.280
the number of spots behind
the decimal point.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.170
If I have two numbers that have
two numbers to the right

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.495
of the decimal point and
I multiply them,

00:03:31.495 --> 00:03:32.950
I end up with 4.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.150
So if you just wanted to eyeball
this, you'd say, well,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.520
first of all, what number
to the third

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.320
power is equal to 64?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.000
Well 4 to the third power
is equal to 64, right?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.640
It's equal to 16 times 4,
which is equal to 64.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.900
So this should have a
4 some place in it.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.890
It should look like a 4.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.570
It's going to be a decimal
number because obviously the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.270
number has gotten smaller
when I took the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.650
exponent of this number.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.050
And the clue is how
many places are

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.980
there behind the decimal?

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.610
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.430
And I'm multiplying whatever
this number is

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.330
times itself 3 times.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.210
So in order to get 6 digits
behind the decimal point, that

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.440
original number probably
has two digits

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.760
behind the decimal point.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.495
So my initial kind of
estimation is going

00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:19.470
to have a 4 in it.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.800
And it's going to be 0.04.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.770
And I'm pretty sure
I'm right here.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.040
Well, you could try it out for
yourself, but 0.04 times 0.04.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.100
You say, oh, 4 times 4 is 16.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.220
But I'm going to have now 1,
2, 3, 4 spaces behind the

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.020
decimal point.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.960
And then if you multiply that
times 0.04, 4 times 16 is 64.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.150
And now I'm going to have 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 spaces behind

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.850
the decimal point.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.930
And I get 0.000064, which
is exactly there.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.400
So the problem now boils down
to square root of 0.04.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.030
And you use the exact
same logic.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.820
That is equal to 0.2.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.120
And try to square 0.2, you'll
get 0.04 right?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.770
0.2 times 0.2.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.510
You say 2 times 2 is 4.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.930
And I have 1, 2 spaces behind
the decimal point.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.690
0.04, and that's D.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.350
Problem 10.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.920
Raffle tickets numbered
consecutively from 101 through

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.480
350 are placed in a box.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.800
What is the probability that a
ticket selected at random will

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.020
have a number with a hundreds
digit of 2?

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.290
So we're essentially saying,
out of this collection how

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.140
many of them have a hundreds
digit of 2.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:55.940
So essentially it's going to be
anything from 200 to 299.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.040
Well that's essentially
100 digits, right?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.850
Those are 100 numbers
that have a

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.460
hundreds digit of 2, right?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.800
Think about it.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.020
200 by itself would be 1.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.770
From 200 to 1 would be 2.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.000
So 200 to anything would be
that anything plus 1.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.550
So there's 100 numbers
that satisfy it.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.000
And then how many numbers
are we picking from?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Well, if it was from 100 to
350 it be 250 numbers.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.570
But since it's from 101 to 350,
we're picking from a pool

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:37.750
of 249 numbers.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.120
Right?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.200
Although let me think
about that.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.450
Let me think about that.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.170
Right, we're picking from
a pool of-- I just

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.540
want to make sure.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:07:01.370
If it was 101 to 102, we would
be picking from a pool of--

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.570
Right, we're picking from a pool
of 249 numbers, so the

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.510
odds of having a number with a
2 in the hundreds digit will

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:16.220
be 100/249.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.210
So that is choice E.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.530
I'm just making sure that I
haven't made a-- Actually no,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.690
I'm going to take that back.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.420
If I said from 300 to 350,
that's 51 digits.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.625
If I say 101 to 350, that's
not 249 digits.

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.770
I made a mistake.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.040
Because we're including
101, right?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.600
So it would actually
be 250 digits.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.020
Sorry, it's 250 numbers.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.360
We're picking from a
bag of 250 numbers.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.140
Think about it.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.230
If it was from 101-- you have
to make sure you get your

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.730
boundaries right on these-- if
we said from 101 to 105, how

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.340
many are this?

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:03.490
This would be 101, 102,
103, 104, and 105.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.260
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.950
It's 5 digits.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.960
So it's 105 minus 101 plus 1.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.040
So similarly, the bag, the
number of digits we can pick

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.400
from, is going to be 350
minus 101 plus 1,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.430
which is equal to 250.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.840
So anyway, out of the bag of
250, 100 numbers satisfy it.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.820
So we're going to have 100 in
250 chance of picking the

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.840
right number.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.240
And if we divide the top and the
bottom by 50-- that's the

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.789
greatest common divisor--
we get 2/5.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:40.200
And that is choice A.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.909
And I got a little cautious
because I saw that they had

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.860
all these choices that were
really close to each other.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.720
And they all seemed to test,
like choices D and E, they all

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.970
seemed to test whether you got
the boundaries right, whether

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.180
you really counted the
pool correctly.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.700
And whether you really
counted the

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.750
number of digits correctly.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.810
And I always have to go through
the exercise of let me

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.430
make sure whether or not I need
to count 101, whether I

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.810
can just subtract them,
or whether it's the

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.890
fractions plus 1.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.450
I always have to clarify
that in my own brain.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.490
Maybe that was easier for you.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.710
Question 11.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.990
On Monday, a person mailed 8
packages weighing an average

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:21.560
of 12 and 3/8 pounds.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.420
And on Tuesday, 4 packages.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.100
So this is 8.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.830
Weighed that much.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:32.200
And on Tuesday, 4 packages
weighing an average of 15 and

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.160
1/4 pounds.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.380
What was the average weight in
pounds of all packages the

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.400
person mailed on both days?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.420
So essentially you have to take
the sum of the weights of

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.220
all of them and divide
by the total, right?

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.260
So what's the sum of the
weights of all of them?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.490
So the sum of the weights of
these 8 packages-- we know

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.000
their average.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.590
So the sum of the weights is
going to be 8 times 12 and

00:09:52.590 --> 00:10:01.100
3/8-- that's the sum of all of
these-- plus 4 times the

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.810
weight of these.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:06.060
Plus 4 times 15 and 1/4.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.350
And we're going to divide
that by the

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.490
total number of packages.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.330
Divided by 12.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.370
So this is equal
to, let's see.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.110
What's 8 times 12?

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.230
8 times 12 is 96.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.040
And what's 8 times 3/8?

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.980
So it's 96 plus 3.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.170
You could view 12 and
3/8 as 12 plus 3/8.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.170
So I kind of just did a
distributive property there.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.330
You could turn this
into an improper

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.150
fraction, if that's easier.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.730
And then plus-- what's
4 times 15?

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.410
It's 60, right?

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.100
And then 4 times 1/4 is 1.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.830
All of that over 12.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:47.420
And so we have 99 plus 61.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.770
All of that over 12.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.760
Which is equal to 160/12.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.150
Let's see.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.650
Does 12 go into 160?

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.210
12 times 12 is 144.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.150
Let me think about this.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.030
So let me just divide
top and bottom by 4.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:11.020
So you get 40/3.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.330
And let's see.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.650
All of the answers they have
it in terms of fractions.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.150
So 3 goes into 40
how many times?

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.760
It goes into 13, right?

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.950
13 times 3 is 39.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.580
So it's 13 with remainder 1.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.420
So 13 and 1/3 times,
so A is the answer.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.860
So the average of all of the
packages on both days are 13

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.310
and 1/3 pounds.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.130
See you in the next video.
