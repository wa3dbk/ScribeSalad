00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.182
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:06.631
is think about different ways
to represent how position

00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:08.381
can change over time.

00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:11.210
So one of the more basic ways

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.793
is through a table.

00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:16.463
For example right over
here in the left column

00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:18.920
I have time, maybe it's in seconds,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.170
and in the right column I have position

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.810
and this could be in some
units, let's say it's in meters.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.831
So at time zero we're at three,

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:30.150
after one second, we are still at three,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.546
after two seconds we're at negative one

00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:34.458
then after three seconds, we're at zero,

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:36.147
after four seconds we're at zero,

00:00:36.147 --> 00:00:40.215
still at zero, after five
seconds we are at two,

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:41.992
maybe two meters.

00:00:41.992 --> 00:00:44.650
Now this is somewhat useful,
but it's a little bit

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.567
difficult to visualize.

00:00:47.434 --> 00:00:49.501
And it also doesn't
tell us what's happening

00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.398
in between these moments, what's happening

00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:54.481
at time half of a second.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:57.976
Did we just not move, did
our position just not change,

00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:00.745
or did it change and
then it got back to where

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:02.972
it originally was after one second?

00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:05.990
We don't know when we
look at a table like this.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.834
But another way to think about it would be

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.219
some type of animation.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.873
For example, let's say
we have our number line,

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:17.355
and let's say the object
that's moving is a lemon.

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:20.541
And so at time zero, it
starts at position three,

00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:22.997
so that's where it is
right now, and let's see

00:01:22.997 --> 00:01:24.199
if we can animate it.

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:26.002
I'm just gonna try to
count off five seconds

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.529
and move the lemon
accordingly to what we see

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:33.696
on this position timetable
or time position table.

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:35.490
Zero

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:37.929
one

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:38.762
two

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.100
three

00:01:43.098 --> 00:01:43.931
four

00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:45.734
five.

00:01:47.688 --> 00:01:50.857
So that was somewhat useful,
but maybe even more useful

00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:53.243
thing would be to graph this somehow

00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:54.861
so that we don't have to keep looking

00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:56.699
at animation so that we can just look at

00:01:56.699 --> 00:02:00.574
with our eyes what happens over time.

00:02:00.574 --> 00:02:02.796
So for that, we can construct what's known

00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:04.879
as a position time graph.

00:02:06.438 --> 00:02:09.798
Typically, time is on your horizontal axis

00:02:09.798 --> 00:02:12.912
and position is on your vertical axis.

00:02:12.912 --> 00:02:15.345
So let's think about this a little bit.

00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:18.982
So at time equals zero,
our position is at three.

00:02:18.982 --> 00:02:22.558
So at time zero, our position is at three,

00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:26.641
and then at time equal
one, we're at three again,

00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:30.821
at time two, we are at negative one,

00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:35.546
at time two, our position is negative one,

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:38.546
at time three, our position is zero,

00:02:40.232 --> 00:02:41.388
so our position is zero.

00:02:41.388 --> 00:02:42.968
Remember, even though we're thinking about

00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:46.815
left right here, here position is up down.

00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:51.115
So here our position
is zero at time three,

00:02:51.115 --> 00:02:55.785
and then at time four, our
position is still zero,

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:59.618
and then at time five,
our position is at two.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.956
Our position is at two.

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:08.554
So for the first second,
I don't have a change

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.515
in position or at least
that's what I assumed

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:14.328
when I animated the
lemon, and then as I go

00:03:14.328 --> 00:03:17.575
from the first second
to the second second,

00:03:17.575 --> 00:03:20.044
my position went from
three to negative one,

00:03:20.044 --> 00:03:22.293
from three to negative
one, and if we do that

00:03:22.293 --> 00:03:24.764
at a constant rate we would have a line

00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:27.113
that looks something
like this, I'm trying,

00:03:27.113 --> 00:03:29.343
that's supposed to be a straight line,

00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:32.636
and then from time two to
three, we go from position

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:37.239
negative one to zero,
from negative one to zero.

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.895
Here, it would've been
going from negative one

00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:43.737
to zero moving one to
the right, but over here,

00:03:43.737 --> 00:03:46.343
since we're plotting our
position on the vertical axis,

00:03:46.343 --> 00:03:48.702
it looks like we went up
but this is just really

00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:52.342
going from position negative
one to position zero

00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:55.470
from time two seconds to three seconds.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.503
Now from three to four, at
least the way I depicted it,

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.604
our position does not change,
and then from time four

00:04:00.604 --> 00:04:04.271
to five, our position
goes from zero to two,

00:04:05.272 --> 00:04:06.689
from zero to two.

00:04:08.052 --> 00:04:10.166
And so what I have
constructed here is known

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.858
as a position time graph, and from this,

00:04:12.858 --> 00:04:15.549
without an animation, you can immediately

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.163
get an understanding of
how the thing's position

00:04:18.163 --> 00:04:20.142
has changed over time.

00:04:20.142 --> 00:04:22.359
So let's do the animation one more time,

00:04:22.359 --> 00:04:25.275
and just try to follow along
on the position time graph,

00:04:25.275 --> 00:04:27.669
and maybe I'll slow it down a little bit.

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.769
So for the first second
we're gonna be stationary,

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:33.186
so we can just count off one Mississippi.

00:04:35.186 --> 00:04:39.090
And then we go to, our
position goes to negative one

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.257
over the next second, so then
we would go two Mississippi.

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:49.378
And then we would go three Mississippi,

00:04:49.378 --> 00:04:53.045
four Mississippi, and
then five Mississippi.

00:04:56.117 --> 00:04:57.117
But hopefully you get an appreciation

00:04:57.117 --> 00:04:59.335
that this is just the way
of immediately glancing

00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:00.393
and seeing what's happening.
