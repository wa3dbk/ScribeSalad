00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.300
Let's do some more
nonhomogeneous equations.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.660
So let's take the same problem,
but we'll change the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.360
right-hand side.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.200
Because I think you know how
to solve the-- essentially,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.300
the homogeneous version.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.810
So the same problem as we
did in the last video.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.380
The second derivative of y
minus 3 times the first

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.750
derivative y minus 4
times the function.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.940
And now in the last example,
the nonhomogeneous part

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.200
was 3e to the 2x.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.390
But we're tired of dealing with
exponent functions, so

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.880
let's make it a trigonometric
function.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.350
So let's say it equals
2 sin of x.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.740
So the first step you do is
what we've been doing.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.510
You essentially solve the
homogeneous equation.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.890
So this left-hand side
is equal to 0.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.150
You do that by getting the
characteristic equation r

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.160
squared minus 3r minus
4 is equal to 0.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.360
You get the solutions, r is
equal equal to 4, r is equal

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.840
to minus 1, and then you get
that general solution.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.080
We did this in the last video.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.600
You get the general solution
of the homogeneous.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.129
Maybe we'll call this the
homogeneous solution.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.580
y homogeneous.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.840
We've got the C1 e to the 4x
plus C2e to the minus x.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.480
And that's all and good, but
in order to get the general

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.410
solution of this nonhomogeneous
equation, I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.590
have to take the solution of the
nonhomogeneous equation,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.280
if this were equal to 0, and
then add that to a particular

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.050
solution that satisfies
this equation.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.300
That satisfies-- when you take
the second derivative minus 3

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.400
times the first minus 4 times
the function, I actually

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.470
get 2 sin of x.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.130
And here once again we'll use
undetermined coefficients.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.170
And undetermined coefficients,
just think to yourself.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.650
What function, when I take its
second and first derivatives

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.530
and add and subtract multiples
of them to each other, will I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.980
get sine of x?

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.835
Well, two functions end up with
sine of x when you take

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:55.230
the first and second
derivatives.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.050
And the sine and cosine of x.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.960
So it's a good guess.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.630
And that's really what you're
doing it the method of

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.970
undetermined coefficients.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.360
You take a guess of a particular
solution and then

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.400
you solve for the undetermined
coefficients.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:15.710
So let's say that our guess is
y is equal to-- I don't know,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.930
some coefficient times
sine of x.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.020
And if this was sine
of 2x, I'd put A

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.920
times sine of 2x here.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.170
Just because I still want-- no
matter what happens here-- the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.690
sine of 2x's or maybe cosine
of 2x's to still exist. If

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.730
this was a sine of 2x, there's
nothing I could do to a sine

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.920
of x, or nothing at least
trivial that I could do

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.640
to the sine of x.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.340
It would end up with
a sine of 2x.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.900
So whatever's here,
I want here.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.780
Plus B, some undetermined
coefficient times cosine of x.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.290
And once again, this
was sine of 2x.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.740
I'd want a cosine of 2x here.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.030
So let's figure out its first
and second derivatives.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:05.756
So the first derivative of this
y prime is equal to A

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:08.680
cosine of x.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.170
Cosine derivative is minus sine,
so minus B sine of x.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.510
And then the second
derivitive--

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.930
I'll write down here.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.960
The second derivative
is equal to what?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.640
Derivative of cosine is minus
sine, so minus A sine of x

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.510
minus B cosine of x.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.330
 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.420
I think you're starting to see
that the hardest thing in most

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.270
differential equations problems
is not making

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.040
careless mistakes.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.480
It's a lot of algebra and a lot
of fairly basic calculus.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.250
And the real trick is to not
make careless mistakes.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.930
Every time I say that,
I tend to make one.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.240
So I'm going to focus
extra right now.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.930
So anyway, let's take these and
substitute them back into

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.110
this nonhomogeneous equation.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.820
Let's see if I can solve
for A and B.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.033
So the second derivative
is that.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.560
 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.310
Let me just rewrite it,
just so that you

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.450
see what I'm doing.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.866
So I'm going to take the second
derivative, y prime

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:17.690
prime, so that's minus A sine
of x minus B cosine of x.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.360
I'm going to add minus 3 times
the first derivative to that.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.960
And I'm going to write the sines
under the sines and the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.090
cosines under the consines.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.390
So minus 3 times this.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.640
So the sine is, let's see.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:39.370
It's plus 3B sine of x
minus 3 times this.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:49.190
So minus 3A cosine of x.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.160
And then minus 4 times our
original function.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.650
So minus 4A sine of x.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.050
Right?

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.250
Minus 4 times that.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.270
Minus 4 times this.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.332
Minus 4B cosine of x.

00:05:09.332 --> 00:05:15.585
And when I take the sum of all
of those-- that's essentially

00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:17.920
the left-hand side to this
equation-- when I take the sum

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.870
of all of that, that is
equal to 2 sine of x.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.740
I could have written them out
in a line, but it would have

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.215
just been more confusing.

00:05:25.215 --> 00:05:28.840
And now this makes it easy to
add up the sine of x's and the

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.540
cosine of x's.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.960
So if I add up all the
coefficients on the sine of x,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.980
I get minus A plus
3B minus 4A.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:46.290
So that looks like minus 5A plus
3B sine of x plus-- and

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.620
now what are the coefficients
here?

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.150
 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.380
I have minus B and then I have
another minus 4B, so minus 5B

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.760
and then minus 3A.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:05.890
So minus 3A minus
5B cosine of x.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.520
The cosine of x should
go right here.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.970
So anyway, how do I
solve for A and B?

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.710
Well, I have the minus 5A
3B is equal to whatever

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.430
coefficients in front
of sine of x here.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.090
So minus 5A plus 3B must
be equal to 2.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.610
And then minus 3A minus 5B is
the coefficient on cosine of

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.320
x, although I kind of
squeezed in the

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.320
cosine of x here, right?

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.040
So this must be equal to
whatever the coefficient on

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.320
cosine of x is on the
right-hand side.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.160
Well the coefficient of
cosine of x on the

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.940
right-hand side is 0.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.480
So that sets up a system of two

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.840
unknowns with two equations.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.500
A linear system.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:57.720
So we get minus 5A plus
3B is equal to 2.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:07.326
And we get minus 3A minus
5B is equal to 0.

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:10.680
 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.170
And let's see if I can simplify
this a little bit.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.790
Let's see.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.920
This is a system of two
unknowns, two equations.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.530
If I multiply the top equation
by 5 1/3s, right?

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.410
Actually, let me multiply the
top equation by 5 1/3s.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:41.630
I get minus 25/3 A plus 5B is
equal to 5 1/3s times this.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.670
5 1/3s times 2 is 10 1/3s.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.990
And the bottom equation
is minus 3A minus

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.320
5B is equal to 0.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.310
Let's add the two equations.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.250
I get 10 1/3s is equal to--
these cancel out.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:17.570
That's minus 25/3 minus 9/3
A is equal to 10 1/3s.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.260
This is getting a little bit
messier than I like, but we'll

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.000
soldier on.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.230
So minus 25 minus 9.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.960
What's minus 25 minus 9?

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.120
So that is 34.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:41.600
So we get 34 over 3A
is equal to 10/3.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.059
We can multiply both
sides by 3.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.770
Divide both sides by 34.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:52.360
A is equal to 10/34, which
is equal to 5/17.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.830
Nice ugly number.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.000
5/17 and now we can
solve for B.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.340
So let's see.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:05.800
Minus 3 times A minus
3 times A.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:12.530
5/17 minus 5B is equal to 0.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.430
So that's what?

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:21.130
Minus 15/17 is equal
to plus 5B.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.270
I just took this and put it
on the right-hand side.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:28.430
And then divide both
sides by 5.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.180
 

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:31.990
Oh, you know what?

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.330
I realized I made a careless
mistake here.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.990
Minus 25 minus 9.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.160
That's the minus 34 over 3.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.530
so minus 34A is equal to 10.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.510
A is equal to minus 10/34
or minus 5/17.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.310
So minus 3 times minus 5/17.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:55.980
So 5/17 is equal to
plus 5B, right?

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:01.050
And then we get B is
equal to 3/17.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.050
That was hairy.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.870
And notice, the hard
part was not losing

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.100
your negative sines.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.710
But anyway, we now have our
particular solution to this.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.030
 

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.140
let me try to write in a
non-nauseating color, although

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.150
I think I picked a
nauseating one.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:27.480
The particular solution is A
minus 5/17 sine of x-- right?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:33.160
That was a coefficient on sine
of x-- plus B plus 3/17 times

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.240
cosine of x.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.300
And if we look at our original
problem, the general solution

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.310
out of this nonhomogeneous
equation would be this-- which

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.010
is the general solution to the
homogeneous equation, which

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.950
we've done many videos on--
plus now our particular

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.690
solution that we solved using
the method of undetermined

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.330
coefficient.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.420
