00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.120
How many cups are in
3 and 1/2 gallons?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.870
So before even addressing this
question, let's just think

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.640
about how large a cup is.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.990
Actually, I'll give you a little
bit of overview of how

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.800
many cups there are in a pint,
how many pints in a quart, and

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.870
how many quarts in a gallon.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.610
Let me just draw a cube here,
and let's imagine

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.860
that this is a gallon.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.000
The most common time we see
a gallon is when you see a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.460
gallon of milk.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.340
So let's say that that whole
thing is a gallon.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.740
You can imagine if it had a
handle, it would be kind of a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.130
big gallon of milk.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.290
Now, there are 4 quarts
per gallon.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.160
Let me write this over here.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.730
There are 4 quarts per gallon.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.690
So if I were to draw the quarts
here, I could divide

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.600
this gallon into 4 quarts, and
then each of these sections

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.660
would be a quart.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.860
So you would have 4 quarts.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.350
So this right here that I've
just drawn in blue would be

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.820
exactly 1 quart.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.880
And obviously, there's 4 of them
in this entire gallon.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.330
Now, you can divide the
quarts into pints.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.670
You have 2 pints per quart.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.120
So this quart that I drew here,
I can divide it into 2,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.380
like that, and this little
section that I'm highlighting

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.550
in magenta is a pint.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.910
That is a pint right
over there.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.996
And then finally, there
are 2 cups per pint.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.190
So this pint right here, I can
divide it into 2, and each of

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.370
these will be a cup.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.310
So this section right
here will be a cup.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.640
Now, we can go straight and
figure out exactly how many

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.820
cups there are per gallon.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.300
Actually, that might be
an interesting way

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.710
to think about it.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.940
If you have 4 quarts-- let's
multiply it right here.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:12.080
So you have 4 quarts per gallon

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.705
times 2 pints per quart.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.750
What does this give you?

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.160
This gives you 4 times
2 is equal to 8.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.720
And then the quarts cancel
out, and you

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.730
have 8 pints per gallon.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.020
And that makes complete sense
because we had 4 quarts in

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.120
this gallon, and then
each of those quarts

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.700
have 2 pints in them.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.120
So 4 times 2.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.510
So 8 pints per gallon.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.790
And then we can multiply that
times 2 cups per pint.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.780
So I could just copy and
paste this right here.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.040
Actually, I should've
cut and paste.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.110
Let me select it again.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.190
I want to do that so I get
that real estate back.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.420
So edit, cut, edit, paste.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.250
There you go.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.660
So now you multiply this
times 2 cups per pint.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.710
And the reason why this will
work is because you have pints

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.315
in the numerator.

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:15.480
It cancels out with the pints
in the denominator.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.480
And you will be left with-- I'll
go back to the yellow-- 8

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.120
times 2 is 16.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.790
In the numerator, we have
cups per gallon.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.410
Now, we just figured how many
cups there are per gallon.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.050
That makes sense.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.780
This section right here is
exactly 1/16 of this entire

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.210
cube, this entire gallon.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.570
But we haven't even answered
our question.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.990
We want to figure out how
many cups there are

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.160
in 3 and 1/2 gallons.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.240
So let's write it over here.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.840
So we're concerned with
3 and 1/2 gallons.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.900
I don't like working
with mixed numbers.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.150
I like to turn them into
improper fractions.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.200
3 and 1/2 is the same thing as
2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.440
This is the same thing as 7/2.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.000
If you divided 7 by 2, you would
get 3 with a remainder

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.010
of 1, or this would be
3 and 1/2, so this is

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.740
the exact same thing.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.140
So we want to know how many
cups are in 7/2 gallons.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.060
So what we want to do is end up
with cups, and we want the

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.640
gallons to cancel out.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.450
So we have gallons in the
numerator right here.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.100
It's definitely not in
the denominator.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.180
And so we want to divide
by gallons.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.940
And then we're going to
have a numerator.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.700
We have cups in the numerator.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.490
And how many cups are
there per gallon?

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.530
Well, we just figured
that out.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.310
There are 16 cups per gallon.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.080
When you multiply these two
quantities, the gallons will

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.250
cancel out, and you'll just be
left with cups, and that's

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.220
what we wanted.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.940
So it's going to be
7/2 times 16.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:51.040
So this is going to be
7 times 16/2 cups.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.900
You could divide 16
by 2 to get 8.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.140
2 divided by 2 is 1.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.580
So it just becomes 7 times 8
divided by 1, or just 7 times

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.120
8, which is 56.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.200
So this is equal to 56 cups.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.700
And this should make sense.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.360
This should be a much larger
number because cups are a much

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.710
smaller unit.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.820
So if you have 3 and 1/2
gallons, you will have many,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.400
many, many more cups in that
3 and 1/2 gallons,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.660
so this makes sense.
