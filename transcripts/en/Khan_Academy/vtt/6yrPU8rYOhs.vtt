00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.550
Let's say I have some
transformation from R2 to R2.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.280
And it's essentially just a
multiplication times a matrix.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.220
And we know that all linear
transformations can be

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.260
expressed as a multiplication
of a matrix, but this one is

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:25.940
equal to the matrix 1, 3, 2, 6
times whatever vector you give

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.170
me in my domain.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.590
Times x1, x2.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.030
Now let's say I have some
subset in my codomain.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.550
So let me draw this
right here.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.350
So my domain looks like that.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.310
It's R2.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.840
And of course my function or
my transformation maps

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.340
elements of R2 into elements
of its codomain which also

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.100
happens to be R2.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310
I could show it mapping into
itself, but for the sake of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.150
simplicity let's draw
my codomain here.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.590
And our transformation of course
maps, for any element

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.215
here, the transformation of that
will be an association or

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:03.560
a mapping into R2.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.970
Now what if we take some subset
of R2, and let's just

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.650
say it's a set of two vectors,
the zero vector in R2, and the

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.800
vector 1, 2.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.840
So it's literally, let's
say it's this point.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.070
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.110
Let's say this is my
zero vector in R2.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.920
I'm not plotting them.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.350
I'm just showing that they're
in this, they're in R2.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.430
That's my zero vector,
and let's say the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.170
vector 1,2 is here.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.370
1,2.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.050
What I want to know is, what are
all of the vectors in my

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.570
domain whose transformations
map to this subset?

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.670
Map to this point?

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.780
So I want to know, I'm
essentially, I want to know

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.840
the preimage of S.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.730
So the preimage of S, let
me be careful, the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:04.450
preimage of S under T.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.160
And I said be careful because
when you say preimage of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.360
something without saying under
something else, it implies

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.930
that you're taking.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.580
Well when you say image of
something, it implies you're

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.520
taking the image of an entire
transformation like I showed

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.370
you, I think, two videos ago.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.720
But when you're taking the image
or preimage of a set,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.270
you make sure you say under
what transformation.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.630
So we want to know the preimage
of this subset of our

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.940
codomain under the
transformation T.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.650
Let me write this as
T inverse of S.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.680
And we saw in the last video
this is all of the x, all of

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:46.240
the elements in our domain where
the transformation of

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.890
those x's is a member of the
subset of our codomain that

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.760
we're trying to find
the preimage of.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.330
Right?

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.850
Now what is another way
of writing this?

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.170
Well this is, you can write this
as, we're trying to look

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.050
for all of the x's in our domain
such that this, let's

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.930
call this A, that matrix A.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.600
Such that A times x
is a member of S.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.300
So that means A times x has to
be equal to this or has to be

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.060
equal to that.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.810
So that means A times our vector
x has to be equal to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.030
the zero vector.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.660
Or A times our vector x has to
be equal to this vector 1,2.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.240
This is the exact same
statement as

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.020
this one right here.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.690
I just made it a little bit more
explicit in terms of our

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.210
actual transformation,
A times x.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.710
And in terms of what
our actual set is.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.170
Our set is just two vectors.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.920
So if we want to determine
the preimage of S.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.050
So we write that the preimage
of S under T.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.080
That set there.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.460
We essentially have to just
find all of the x's that

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.780
satisfy these two equations
right there.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.080
So this equation, so we have
to find all of the x's that

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.280
satisfy, the first one right
here is the matrix 1, 3, 2, 6

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.589
times x1, x2 is equal
to the zero vector.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.380
That's this equation
right there.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.240
We need to find all of the
solutions to that.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.790
And you might already
recognize it.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.540
All of the solutions to this,
all of the x's that satisfy

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.750
this, is the null space
of this matrix.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.210
I just thought I'd point
that out on the side.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.530
Now, that's not the only one.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.270
We also have to solve
this guy over here.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.690
I'll do that in blue.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.080
So the preimage of S under
T is going to be all the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.280
solutions to this plus all of
the solutions to 1, 3, 2, 6

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.300
times x1, x2 is equal to 1, 2.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.280
Now we can just solve this
with an augmented matrix.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.230
So my augmented matrix would
look like 1, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.160
And here my augmented matrix
would be 1, 3, 2, 6, 1, 2.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.960
Let's put this in reduced
row echelon form.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.580
So let's replace our second row
with our second row minus

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.880
2 times the first row.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.450
So what do we get?

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.930
Our first row stays the same.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.960
1, 3, 0.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.110
Let me do them simultaneously.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.590
Let me solve these systems
in parallel.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.880
So my first system stays, first
row stays the same.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.710
1, 3, 1.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.490
And in both cases, because I
just want to get the left hand

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.660
side of my augmented matrix into
reduced row echelon form,

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.840
I can apply the same
row operation.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.680
So I'm replacing my second row
with 2 times my first row.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.040
So 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.400
6 minus 2 times 3 is 0.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.650
And of course 0 minus
2 times 0 is 0.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.860
Here 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.420
6 minus 2 times 3 is 0.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.950
And 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.080
So we get all these zeroes,
and we're actually done.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.100
We have both of these augmented
matrices in reduced

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.420
row echelon form.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.330
And how do we go back to solve
all of the x1's and x2's that

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.100
satisfy these?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.250
Well you recognize that our
first columns right here are

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.080
pivot columns.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.340
And these are associated with
our variable x1, so we know

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.330
that x1 is a pivot variable.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.380
And we know that the second
column is a non pivot column.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.180
Because it has no 1's in it.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.880
And so it's associated
with x2.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.380
And since x2 isn't a pivot
column, we know that x2 is a

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.630
free variable.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.110
Which essentially means we can
set x2 to be anything.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.700
So let's just set x2.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.570
x2 is equal to t, where t is
a member of the reals.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.300
In this case what is x1
going to be equal to?

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.580
So here this top equation
says, let me write it.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.370
If we just kind of go back to
this world right here, this

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:12.570
means that x1 plus 3x2 is
equal to this 0 here.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:20.000
This top line right here says
x1 plus 3x2 is equal to 1.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.970
And so if we say x2 is equal to
t, this equation becomes x1

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.650
plus 3t is equal to 0.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.510
Subtract 3t from both
sides, you get x1 is

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.660
equal to minus 3t.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.670
And then this equation, you
get x1 is equal to, if we

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:47.400
substitute x2 with t, is x1
is equal to 1 minus 3t.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.590
Now if we wanted to write the
solution sets in kind of

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.540
vector notation.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.420
The solution set for this guy
right here, for this first

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:03.530
equation right there, is going
to be x1, x2 is equal to what?

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:12.540
It's going to be equal to, you
have your, well, x2 is just

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.320
going to be equal to t times.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.670
It's just going to
be equal to t.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.920
So let me just write it there.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.620
x2 is just t times 1.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.470
It's just equal to t.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.780
I made that definition
up here.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.340
And then what's x1 equal to?

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.390
It's equal to minus 3 times t.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.550
If I put a t out here as
a scalar, it's just

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.409
minus 3 times t.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.500
So this is a solution for
this first equation.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.280
Some, where t is a member of the
reals, So it's just scalar

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.100
multiples of the vector
minus 3, 1.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.100
And if we think of this position
vector, this'll be a

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.180
line in R2.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.590
And I'll draw that
in a second.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.830
So that's a solution for
this first equation.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:55.900
And then the solution for the
second equation, how can we

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.740
set this up?

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:05.630
It's going to be, make sure you
can see it, It is x1, x2,

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.560
and let's see.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.670
x2 once again is
just t times 1.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.770
Let me just write
it like this.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.310
So it's t times 1.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.920
That's x2.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.320
Now what's x1?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.000
x1 is equal to 1 minus
3 times t.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.450
So if we do a minus 3 that give
us our minus 3 times t.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.740
But we need to do
1 minus that.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.490
Or 1 plus minus 3 times t.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.660
So what we can do is, we could
say that all the solution set

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:40.290
here is equal to the vector 1,
here, so now we have 1 plus

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.700
minus 3 times t for x1.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.330
And here we could say is 0.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.030
x2 is equal 0 plus t.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.470
Or x2 is equal to t.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:52.510
So this is the solution set
for the second equation.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.530
So our preimage of S.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.940
Remember S was just these two
points in our codomain.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:05.560
The preimage of S under T is
essentially all of the x's

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.720
that satisfy these
two equations.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.830
And let's actually
graphs those.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.190
Let me turn on my graphs.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.670
That makes it look a little
bit messy, but let me

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.340
graph it down here.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.635
Let me copy and paste
my two results.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.750
Then I want to paste it.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.070
So those are my two results.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.250
Put my pen back on.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.530
And now what I can do is I
can graph it right here.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.040
So let's see.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.360
The solution set for that first
equation is all the

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.390
multiples of the vector
minus 3, 1.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:46.390
So the vector minus 3,
1 looks like this.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.800
Looks like that.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.610
That's the vector minus 3, 1.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.280
But my solution set
is all the scalar

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.770
multiples of minus 3, 1.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.400
This is a comma right here.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:00.690
Right?

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.330
So if I just take all the scalar
multiples of minus 3,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.240
1, it's going to
look like this.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.010
So if you take 2 times
it, you're going to

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.670
have minus 6, 2.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.840
So you're going to
get like that.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.090
So it's going to be all of
these points right here.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.000
I wish I could draw a little
bit neater, but I think you

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.735
get the idea.

00:11:18.735 --> 00:11:21.410
It's going to be a
line like that.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.650
That is that solution
set right there.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.130
And then what is this solution
set right here?

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.230
It's the vector 1, 0.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.750
So we go out 1 and 0,
so that's there.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.590
Plus scalar multiples
of minus 3, 1.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.310
So plus scalar multiples
of this.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.900
So if we just had 1 scalar
multiple of minus 3, 1 we'll

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.880
end up right there.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.740
But we want to put all the
scalar multiples of it,

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.330
because we have this
t right here.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.620
So we're going to end up with
another line with the same

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.460
slope essentially, that's just
shifted a little bit.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.825
It's shifted 1 to the right.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.130
Now what why did we
do all of this?

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.670
Remember what we wanted to find
out is, what were all of

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:16.190
the vectors, let me turn off the
graph paper, in our domain

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:21.170
that when we apply the
transformation, map to vectors

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.060
within our subset
of our codomain.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.720
Map to either 0, 0 or
the vector 1, 2.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.320
And we've figured all of those
vectors out by solving these

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.230
two equations.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.630
And we are able to see that
these two lines, so when I

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.710
turn my graph paper on, they
map to the points.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.430
So when these guys, when you
apply the transformation, I'll

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.530
draw it all on the same graph.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.760
They map, when you apply the
transformation, to the point

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.520
0, 0 and to the point 1, 2.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.350
Which was right here.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.760
So all of these points, when you
apply the transformation,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.050
and actually all the ones in
the blue, they map to 0, 0.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.630
Because we solved this
top equation.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.080
And all the ones in orange,
when you apply the

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.680
transformation, map
to the point 1, 2.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.370
Now this blue line right here.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.370
This has a special
name for it.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.050
And I actually touched on is it
a little bit before, right?

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.420
Everything in this
blue line, right?

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.113
If I call this set right here,
I don't know, let's

00:13:24.113 --> 00:13:25.140
call it B for blue.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.570
This is the blue line.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.940
That's this set of vectors
right here.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.560
Everything there, when I apply
my transformation of those

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.990
blue vectors, or if I take the
image of my blue set under T,

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:43.410
it all maps to the
zero vector.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.150
It equals the set of the zero
vector right there.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.050
We saw that right there.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.730
And I remember when, well
earlier in the video I pointed

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.110
out that, look , this
set right here.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.750
This is equivalent to the
null space, right?

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:04.100
The null space of a matrix is
all the vectors that if you

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.990
multiply it by that
matrix, you get 0.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.340
So this is a similar
idea here.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.890
This transformation is
defined by a matrix.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.040
And we're saying, what are all
of the x's that when you

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:20.750
transform them you get
the zero vector?

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.810
And so this idea, this blue
thing right here, it's called

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:30.570
the kernel of T.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.880
Sometimes it's written just
shorthand K-E-R of T.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.450
And this literally is all of the
vectors that if you apply

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.630
the transformation, let
me write it this way.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:46.850
It's all of the vectors in our
domain, which was R2, such

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:52.940
that the transformation of those
vectors is equal to the

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.620
zero vector.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.540
There this is the definition
of the kernel.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:03.580
And if the transformation is
equal to some matrix times

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.670
some vector, and we know that
any linear transformation can

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:12.460
be written as a matrix vector
product, then the kernel of T

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.790
is the same thing as the
null space of A.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.600
And we saw that earlier
in the video.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.150
Anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably useful.
