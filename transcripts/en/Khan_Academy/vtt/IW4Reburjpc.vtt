00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
 

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.180
In this video, I'm going to
introduce you to the concept

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.950
of the convolution, one of the
first times a mathematician's

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.810
actually named something
similar to what

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.590
it's actually doing.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.590
You're actually convoluting
the functions.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.970
And in this video, I'm not
going to dive into the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.830
intuition of the convolution,
because there's a lot of

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.770
different ways you
can look at it.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.430
It has a lot of different
applications, and if you

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.320
become an engineer really of any
kind, you're going to see

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.950
the convolution in kind of a
discrete form and a continuous

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.620
form, and a bunch of
different ways.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.620
But in this video I just want
to make you comfortable with

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.100
the idea of a convolution,
especially in the context of

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.290
taking Laplace transforms.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.760
So the convolution theorem--
well, actually, before I even

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970
go to the convolution theorem,
let me define what a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.470
convolution is.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.100
So let's say that I have
some function f of t.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.983
So if I convolute f with g-- so
this means that I'm going

00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:02.250
to take the convolution of f and
g, and this is going to be

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.220
a function of t.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.610
And so far, nothing I've written
should make any sense

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.790
to you, because I haven't
defined what this means.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.100
This is like those SAT problems
where they say, like,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.060
you know, a triangle b means a
plus b over 3, while you're

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.840
standing on one leg or
something like that.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.000
So I need to define this
in some similar way.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.455
So let me undo this silliness
that I just wrote there.

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:28.960
And the definition of a
convolution, we're going to do

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.200
it over a-- well, there's
several definitions you'll

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.140
see, but the definition we're
going to use in this, context

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.150
there's actually one other
definition you'll see in the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:45.290
continuous case, is the integral
from 0 to t of f of t

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:56.195
minus tau, times g of t-- let me
just write it-- sorry, it's

00:01:56.195 --> 00:02:00.400
times g of tau d tau.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.970
Now, this might seem like a very
bizarro thing to do, and

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.560
you're like, Sal, how
do I even compute

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.520
one of these things?

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.300
And to kind of give you that
comfort, let's actually

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.550
compute a convolution.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.790
 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.090
Actually, it was hard to find
some functions that are very

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.345
easy to analytically compute,
and you're going to find that

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:23.790
we're going to go into a lot of
trig identities to actually

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.860
compute this.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.680
But if I say that f of t, if I
define f of t to be equal to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.980
the sine of t, and I define
cosine of t-- let me do it in

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.810
orange-- or I define g of t to
be equal to the cosine of t.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.930
Now let's convolute
the two functions.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.310
So the convolution of f with g,
and this is going to be a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.000
function of t, it equals this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.490
I'm just going to show you how
to apply this integral.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.040
So it equals the integral--
I'll do it in purple-- the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.120
integral from 0 to t of
f of t minus tau.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.090
This is my f of t.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.810
So it's is going to be sine of
t minus tau times g of tau.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.500
Well, this is my g of t, so
g of tau is cosine of tau,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.700
cosine of tau d tau.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.660
So that's the integral, and
now to evaluate it, we're

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.000
going to have to break out
some trigonometry.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.760
So let's do that.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.100
This almost is just a very
good trigonometry and

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.510
integration review.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.510
So let's evaluate this.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.470
But I wanted to evaluate this
in this video because I want

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.360
to show you that this isn't some
abstract thing, that you

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.730
can actually evaluate
these functions.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.835
So the first thing I want to
do-- I mean, I don't know what

00:03:47.835 --> 00:03:49.150
the antiderivative of this is.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.450
It's tempting, you see a sine
and a cosine, maybe they're

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.800
the derivatives of each
other, but this is the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.830
sine of t minus tau.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.980
So let me rewrite that sine of
t minus tau, and we'll just

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.210
use the trig identity, that
the sine of t minus tau is

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:15.010
just equal to the sine of t
times the cosine of tau minus

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.990
the sine of tau times
the cosine of t.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.709
And actually, I just made a
video where I go through all

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.000
of these trig identities really
just to review them for

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.560
myself and actually to make a
video in better quality on

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.420
them as well.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.560
So if we make this subsitution,
this you'll find

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.390
on the inside cover of any
trigonometry or calculus book,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.175
you get the convolution of f and
g is equal to-- I'll just

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:42.730
write that f-star g; I'll just
write it with that-- is equal

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.660
to the integral from 0 to t of,
instead of sine of t minus

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.780
tau, I'm going to write this
thing right there.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.970
So I'm going to write the sine
of t times the cosine of tau

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.420
minus the sine of tau times the
cosine of t, and then all

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.355
of that's times the
cosine of tau.

00:05:06.355 --> 00:05:09.450
 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.970
I have to be careful with my
taus and t's, and let's see, t

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.770
and tau, tau and t.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.490
Everything's working so far.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.810
So let's see, so
then that's dt.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.860
Oh, sorry, d tau.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.950
Let me be very careful here.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.460
Now let's distribute this
cosine of tau out,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.880
and what do we get?

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.640
We get this is equal to-- so f
convoluted with g, I guess we

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.710
call it f-star g, is equal to
the integral from 0 to t of

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.560
sine of t times cosine of
tau times cosine of tau.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.620
I'm just distributing
this cosine of tau.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.450
So it's cosine squared of tau,
and then minus-- let's rewrite

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.870
the cosine of t first, and I'm
doing that because we're

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.680
integrating with
respect to tau.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.910
So I'm just going to write my
cosine of t first. So cosine

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:09.950
of t times sine of tau times
the cosine of tau d tau.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.420
And now, since we're taking
the integral of really two

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.530
things subtracting from each
other, let's just turn this

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.860
into two separate integrals.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:24.500
So this is equal to the integral
from 0 to t, of sine

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:32.010
of t, times the cosine squared
of tau d tau minus the

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:40.710
integral from 0 to t of cosine
of t times sine of tau cosine

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.910
of tau d tau.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.390
Now, what can we do?

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.550
Well, to simplify it more,
remember, we're integrating

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.330
with respect to-- let
me be careful here.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.500
We're integrating with
respect to tau.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.700
I wrote a t there.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.320
We're integrating with
respect to tau.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.580
So all of these, this
cosine of t right

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.480
here, that's a constant.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.650
The sine of t is a constant.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.320
For all I know, t could
be equal to 5.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.190
It doesn't matter that one
of the boundaries of our

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.520
integration is also a t.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.610
That t would be a 5,
in which case these

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.730
are all just constants.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.730
We're integrating only with
respect to the tau, so if

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.500
cosine of 5, that's a constant,
we can take it out

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.960
of the integral.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:27.260
So this is equal to sine of t
times the integral from 0 to t

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:38.360
of cosine squared of tau d tau
and then minus cosine of t--

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.500
that's just a constant; I'm
bringing it out-- times the

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:52.870
integral from 0 to t of sine
of tau cosine of tau d tau.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.270
Now, this antiderivative is
pretty straightforward.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.230
You could do u substitution.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.470
Let me do it here, instead
of doing it in our heads.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.960
This is a complicated
problem, so we don't

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.260
want to skip steps.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:10.260
If we said u is equal to sine of
tau, then du d tau is equal

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.320
to the cosine of tau, just
the derivative of sine.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.180
Or we could write that
du is equal to the

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:23.170
cosine of tau d tau.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:28.440
 

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.120
We'll undo the substitution
before we evaluate the

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.150
endpoints here.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.520
But this was a little bit
more of a conundrum.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.370
I don't know how to take the
antiderivative of cosine

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.360
squared of tau.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.270
It's not obvious what that is.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.740
So to do this, we're going
to break out some more

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.600
trigonometric identities.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.250
And in a video I just recorded,
it might not be the

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:57.830
last video in the playlist, I
showed that the cosine squared

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:02.960
of tau-- I'm just using tau as
an example-- is equal to 1/2

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:12.660
times 1 plus the cosine
of 2 tau.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.690
And once again, this is just a
trig identity that you'll find

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.250
really in the inside cover of
probably your calculus book.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.870
So we can make this substitution
here, make this

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.350
substitution right there, and
then let's see what our

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.930
integrals become.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.280
So the first one over here,
let me just write it here.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:42.520
We get sine of t times the
integral from 0 to t of this

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.060
thing here.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.055
Let me just take the 1/2 out,
to keep things simple.

00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:51.800
So I'll put the 1/2 out here.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.980
That's this 1/2.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:10:00.080
So 1 plus cosine of 2 tau and
all of that is d tau.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.610
 

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.530
That's this integral
right there.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:11.560
And then we have this integral
right here, minus cosine of t

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.930
times the integral from--
let me be very clear.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:25.600
This is tau is equal to 0
to tau is equal to t.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.960
And then this thing right
here, I did some u

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.510
subsitution.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.180
If u is equal to sine of
t, then this becomes u.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.710
And we showed that du is equal
to cosine-- sorry, u is equal

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.060
to sine of tau.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.930
And then we showed that du is
equal to cosine tau d tau, so

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.010
this thing right here
is equal to du.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:53.290
So it's u du, and let's see if
we can do anything useful now.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:11:01.210
So this integral right here, the
antiderivative of this is

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.305
pretty straightforward, so
what are we going to get?

00:11:03.305 --> 00:11:05.110
Let me write this
outside part.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:10.060
So we have 1/2 times
the sine of t.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.220
And now let me take the
antiderivative of this.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.400
This is going to be tau plus
the antiderivative of this.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.465
It's going to be 1/2
sine of 2 tau.

00:11:20.465 --> 00:11:24.870
 

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.550
I mean, we could have done
the u substitution.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.720
we could have said u is equal to
2 tau and all of that, but

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.460
I think you could do that from
recognition, and if you don't

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.720
believe me, you just have to
take the derivative of this.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.230
1/2 sine of 2 tau is the
derivative of this.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.550
You multiply, you take the
derivative of the inside, so

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.840
that's 2, so the 2 and the 1/2
cancel out, and the derivative

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.450
of the outside, so
cosine of 2 tau.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.910
And you're going to evaluate
that from 0 to t.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:58.550
And then we have minus
cosine of t.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.550
When we take the antiderivative
of this-- let

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.690
me do this on the side.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:07.540
So the integral of u du,
that's trivially easy.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.320
That's 1/2 u squared.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.940
Now, that's 1/2 u squared, but
what was u to begin with?

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.610
It was sine of tau.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.970
So the antiderivative of this
thing right here is 1/2 u

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.290
squared, but u is sine of tau.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:33.490
So it's going to be 1/2u, which
is sine of tau squared.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:39.130
And we're going to evaluate
that from 0 to t.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.120
And we didn't even have to do
all this u substitution.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.600
The way I often do it in my
head, I see the sine of tau,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.790
cosine of tau.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.370
if I have a function and I have
its derivative, I can

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.140
treat that function just like
as if I had an x there, so

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.690
it'd be sine squared of tau over
2, which is exactly what

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.980
we have there.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.896
So it looks like we're
in the home stretch.

00:12:56.896 --> 00:12:59.810
 

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.790
We're taking the convolution of
sine of t with cosine of t.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:09.880
And so we get 1/2 sine of t.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.520
Now, if I evaluate this thing
at t, what do I get?

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:18.230
I get t plus 1/2 sine
of 2t, that's when I

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.800
evaluated it at t.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.160
And then from that I need to
subtract it evaluated at 0, so

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:30.720
minus 0 minus 1/2 sine of
2 times 0, which is

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.170
just sine of 0.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.930
So this part right here, this
whole thing right there, what

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.460
does that simplify to?

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.910
Well this is 0, sine of 0
is 0, so this is all 0.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:47.940
So this first integral right
there simplifies to 1/2 sine

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:56.010
of t times t plus
1/2 sine of 2t.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.740
 

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.280
All right, now what does this
one simplify to over here?

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:12.191
Well, this one over here, you
have minus cosine of t.

00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:14.900
And we're going to evaluate this
whole thing at t, so you

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:23.200
get 1/2 sine squared of t
minus 1/2 the sine of 0

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.680
squared, which is just 0,
so that's just minus 0.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:32.180
So far, everything that we have
written simplifies to--

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.550
let me multiply it all out.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:41.810
So I have 1/2-- let me just pick
a good color-- 1/2t sine

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:50.580
of t-- I'm just multiplying
those out-- plus 1/4 sine of t

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.110
sine of 2t.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:15:02.210
And then over here I have minus
1/2 sine squared t times

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.640
cosine of t.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.910
I just took the minus cosine t
and multiplied it through here

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.420
and I got that.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.200
Now, this is a valid answer,
but I suspect that we can

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.000
simplify this more, maybe using
some more trigonometric

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.160
identities.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.720
And this guy right there
looks ripe to simplify.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.530
And we know that the sine of
2t-- another trig identity

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.790
you'll find in the inside cover
of any of your books--

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:34.890
is 2 times the sine of t
times the cosine of t.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.930
So if you substitute that there,
what does our whole

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.480
expression equal?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.705
You get this first term.

00:15:40.705 --> 00:15:42.890
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:54.280
You get 1/2t times the sine of
t plus 1/4 sine of t times

00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:01.640
this thing in here, so times
2 sine of t cosine of t.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.230
Just a trig identity, nothing
more than that.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:09.870
And then finally I have this
minus 1/2 sine squared t

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.520
cosine of t.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.590
No one ever said this was
going to be easy, but

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.610
hopefully it's instructive
on some level.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.940
At least it shows you that you
didn't memorize your trig

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.230
identities for nothing.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.190
So let me rewrite the whole
thing, or let me just

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.420
rewrite this part.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.100
So this is equal to 1/4.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.810
Now, I have-- well let
me see, 1/4 times 2.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.040
1/4 times 2 is 1/2.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.450
And then sine squared
of t, right?

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.490
This sine times this sine is
sine squared of t cosine of t.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:45.180
And then this one over here is
minus 1/2 sine squared of t

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.930
cosine of t.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.920
And luckily for us, or lucky
for us, these cancel out.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.900
And, of course, we had this
guy out in the front.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:58.640
We had this 1/2t sine
t out in front.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.900
Now, this guy cancels with this
guy, and all we're left

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.450
with, through this whole hairy
problem, and this is pretty

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:11.180
satisfying, is 1/2t sine of t.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:16.450
So we just showed you that the
convolution-- if I define--

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:17.869
let me write our result.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:23.260
I feel like writing this
in stone because

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.119
this was so much work.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:32.800
But if we write that f of t is
equal to sine of t, and g of t

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.870
is equal to cosine of t, I
just showed you that the

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:41.040
convolution of f with g, which
is a function of t, which is

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:48.950
defined as the integral from 0
to t of f of t minus tau times

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:54.180
g of tau d tau, which was equal
to-- and I'll switch

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.400
colors here-- which was equal to
the integral from 0 to t of

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:08.470
sine of t minus tau times g of
tau d tau, that all of this

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.180
mess, all of this convolution,
it all equals-- and this is

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:21.230
pretty satisfying-- it all
equals 1/2t sine of t.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.400
And the whole reason why I went
through all of this mess

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.680
and kind of bringing out the
neurons that had the trig

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.280
identities memorized or having
to reproof them or whatever

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.310
else is to just show you that
this convolution, it is

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.740
convoluted and it seems a little
bit bizarre, but you

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.100
really can take the convolutions
of actual

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.390
functions and get an
actual answer.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.250
So the convolution of sine
of t with cosine of t is

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.660
1/2t sine of t.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.060
So, hopefully, you have a little
of intuition of-- well,

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.370
not intuition, but you at least
have a little bit of

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:56.620
hands-on understanding of how
the convolution can be

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.870
calculated.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.370
