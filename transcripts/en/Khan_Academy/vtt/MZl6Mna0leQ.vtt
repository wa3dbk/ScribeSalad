00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.720
We're told to factor 4x to the
fourth y, minus 8x to the

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.230
third y, minus 2x squared.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.160
So to factor this, we need to
figure out what the greatest

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.190
common factor of each
of these terms are.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.030
So let me rewrite it.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.790
So we have 4x to the fourth y,
and we have minus 8x to the

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.390
third y, and then we have
minus 2x squared.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.790
So in the other videos, we
looked at it in terms of

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.630
breaking it down to its simplest
parts, but I think we

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.830
have enough practice now to be
able to do a little bit more

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.420
of it in our heads.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.460
So what is the largest
number that

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.940
divides into all of these?

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.700
When I say number I'm talking
about the actual, I guess,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.320
coefficients.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.840
We have a 4, an 8, a 2.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.950
We don't have to worry about the
negative signs just yet.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.290
And we say, well, the largest,
of, the largest common factor

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.400
of 2, 8 and 4 is 2.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.180
2 goes into all of them, and
obviously that's the largest

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.120
number that can go into 2.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.860
So that is the largest number
that's going to be part of the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.110
greatest common factor.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.460
So let's write that down.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.090
So it's going to be 2.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.490
And then what's the greatest,
I guess, factor, what's the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640
greatest degree of x that's
divisible into

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.290
all three of these?

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.820
Well, x squared goes into all
three of these, and obviously

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.590
that's the greatest degree of
x that can be divided into

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.830
this last term.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.550
So x squared is going to be the
greatest common x degree

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.450
in all of them.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.450
2x squared.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.630
And then what's the largest
degree of y that's divisible

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.080
into all of them?

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.050
Well, these two guys are
divisible by y, but this guy

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.130
isn't, so there is no
degree of y that's

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.560
divisible into all of them.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.520
So the greatest common factor
of all three of these guys

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.480
right here is 2x squared.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.020
So what we can do now is we can
think about each of these

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.320
terms as the product of the 2x
squared and something else.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.610
And to figure that something
else we can literally

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.500
undistribute the 2x squared, say
this is the same thing, or

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.020
even before we undistribute the
2x squared, we could say

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.840
look, 4x to the fourth y is the
same thing as 2x squared,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.740
times 4x to the fourth
y, over 2x squared.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.060
Right?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.810
If you just multiply this
out, you get 4xy.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.910
Similarly, you could say that
8x to the third y-- I'll put

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.530
the negative out front-- is the
same thing as 2x squared,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.510
our greatest common factor,
times 8x to the third y, over

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.340
2x squared.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.120
And then finally, 2x squared
is the same thing as if we

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.560
factor out 2x squared-- so we
have that negative sign out

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.140
front-- if we factor out 2x
squared, it's the same thing

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.450
as 2x squared, times 2x squared,
over 2x squared.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.670
This is almost silly what I'm
doing here, but I'm just

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.330
showing you that I'm just
multiplying and dividing both

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.970
of these terms by 2x squared.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.030
Multiplying and dividing.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.420
Here it's trivially simple.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.500
This just simplifies to 2x
squared right there, or this

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.510
2x squared times 1.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.920
That simplifies to 1, maybe
I should write it below.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.560
But what do these simplify to?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.220
So this first term over here,
this simplifies to 2x squared

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.860
times-- now you get 4 divided
by 2 is 2, x to the fourth

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.080
divided by x squared
is x squared.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.140
And then y divided by 1 is
just going to be a y.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.420
So it's 2x squared times 2x
squared y, and then you have

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.382
minus 2x squared times,
8 divided by 2 is 4.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:38.880
x to the third divided
by x squared is x.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.400
And y divided by 1, you can
imagine, is just y.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.010
And then finally, of course,
you have minus 2x squared

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.080
time-- this right here
simplifies to 1-- times 1.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.260
Now, if you were to undistribute
2x squared out of

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.840
the expression, you'd
essentially get 2x squared

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.250
times this term, minus this
term, minus this term.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.140
Right, if you distribute this
out, if you take that out of

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.520
each of the terms, you're going
to get 2x squared times

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:27.160
this 2x squared y, minus 4xy,
and then you have minus 1,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.130
minus 1, and we're done.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.760
We've factored the problem.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.220
Now, it looks like we
did a lot of steps.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.310
And the reason why I kind of of
went through great pains to

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.820
show you exactly what we're
doing is so you know exactly

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.770
what we're doing.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.660
In the future, you might
be able to do this

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.490
a little bit quicker.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.190
You might be able to do many
of the steps in your head.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.190
You might say OK, let me
look at each of these.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.690
Well, the biggest coefficient
that divides all of these is a

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.060
2, so let me put that 2,
let me factor 2 out.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.690
Well, all of these are divisible
by x squared.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.960
That's the largest
degree of x.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.130
Let me factor an
x squared out.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.360
And this guy doesn't have a y,
so I can't factor a y out.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.700
So let's see, it's going to be
2x squared times-- and what's

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.480
this guy divided
by 2x squared?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.815
Well 4 divided by 2 is 2.

00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:12.450
x to the fourth divided by
x squared is x squared.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.720
y divided by 1, there's no
other y degree that we

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.830
factored out, so it's just
going to be a y.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.540
And then you have minus
8 divided by 2 is 4.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.740
x to the third divided
by x squared is x.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.960
And then you have y divided
by say, 1, is just y.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.720
And then you have minus
2 divided by 2 is 1.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.170
x squared divided by x squared
1, so 2x squared divided by 2x

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.570
squared is just 1.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.815
So in the future, you'll do it
more like this, where you kind

00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:41.280
of just factor it out in your
head, but I really want you to

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.480
understand what we did here.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.370
There is no magic.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.840
And to realize that there's no
magic, you could just use the

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.450
distributive property to
multiply this out again, to

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.070
multiply it out again, and
you're going to see that you

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.710
get exactly this.
