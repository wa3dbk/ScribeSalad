00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
By this point in the biology
playlist, you're probably

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.590
wondering a very natural
question, how is gender

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.380
determined in an organism?

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.840
And it's not an obvious answer,
because throughout the

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.210
animal kingdom, it's actually
determined in different ways.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.280
In some creatures, especially
some types of reptiles, it's

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.920
environmental.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.300
Not all reptiles, but
certain cases of it.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.750
It could be maybe the
temperature in which the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.320
embryo develops will dictate
whether it turns into a male

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.480
or female or other environmental
factors.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.140
And in other types of animals,
especially mammals, of which

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.950
we are one example, it's
a genetic basis.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.180
And so your next question is,
hey, Sal, so-- let me write

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:57.880
this down, in mammals it's
genetic-- so, OK, maybe

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.300
they're different alleles, a
male or a female allele.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.470
But then you're like, hey, but
there's so many different

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.460
characteristics that
differentiate

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.050
a man from a woman.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.210
Maybe it would have to be a
whole set of genes that have

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.320
to work together.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.050
And to some degree,
your second answer

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.300
would be more correct.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.690
It's even more than just
a set of genes.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.410
It's actually whole chromosomes
determine it.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.360
So let me draw a nucleus.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.540
That's going to be my nucleus.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.590
And this is going to be
the nucleus for a man.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.750
So 22 of the pairs of
chromosomes are just regular

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.670
non-sex-determining
chromosomes.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.050
So I could just do, that's one
of the homologous, 2, 4, 6, 8,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.380
10, 12, 14.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.340
I can just keep going.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.590
And eventually you
have 22 pairs.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.230
So these 22 pairs right there,
they're called autosomal.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.080
And those are just our standard
pairs of chromosomes

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.340
that code for different
things.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.850
Each of these right here is a
homologous pair, homologous,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.830
which we learned before
you get one from

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.560
each of your parents.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.410
They don't necessarily code for
the same thing, for the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.210
same versions of the genes,
but they code

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.210
for the same genes.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.450
If eye color is on this gene,
it's also on that gene, on the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.640
other gene of the
homologous pair.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.100
Although you might have
different versions of eye

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.670
color on either one and that
determines what you display.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.170
But these are just kind of the
standard genes that have

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.460
nothing to do with our gender.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.030
And then you have these two
other special chromosomes.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.460
I'll do this one.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.600
It'll be a long brown one, and
then I'll do a short blue one.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.160
And the first thing you'll
notice is that they don't look

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.990
homologous.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.025
How could they code for the same
thing when the blue one

00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:44.180
is short and the brown
one's long?

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.860
And that's true.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.480
They aren't homologous.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.225
And these we'll call our
sex-determining chromosomes.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.680
And the long one right here,
it's been the convention to

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.050
call that the x chromosome.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.240
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.630
And the blue one right there,
we refer to that as the y

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.350
chromosome.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.730
And to figure out whether
something is a male or a

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.840
female, it's a pretty
simple system.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.900
If you've got a y chromosome,
you are a male.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.840
So let me write that down.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.820
So this nucleus that I drew
just here-- obviously you

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.180
could have the whole broader
cell all around here-- this is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.030
the nucleus for a man.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.960
So if you have an x chromosome--
and we'll talk

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.660
about in a second why you can
only get that from your mom--

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.990
an x chromosome from your mom
and a y chromosome from your

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.290
dad, you will be a male.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.110
If you get an x chromosome
from your mom and an x

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.590
chromosome from your dad, you're
going to be a female.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.100
And so we could actually even
draw a Punnett square.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.720
This is almost a trivially easy
Punnett square, but it

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.310
kind of shows what all of the
different possibilities are.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.860
So let's say this is your
mom's genotype for her

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.340
sex-determining chromosome.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.140
She's got two x's.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.920
That's what makes her your
mom and not your dad.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.980
And then your dad has an x and
a y-- I should do it in

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.990
capital-- and has
a Y chromosome.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.850
And we can do a Punnett
square.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.300
What are all the different
combinations of offspring?

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.450
Well, your mom could give this
X chromosome, in conjunction

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.420
with this X chromosome
from your dad.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.580
This would produce a female.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.620
Your mom could give this other
X chromosome with that X

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.780
chromosome.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.540
That would be a female
as well.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.490
Well, your mom's always going
to be donating an X

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.340
chromosome.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.180
And then your dad is going to
donate either the X or the Y.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.510
So in this case, it'll
be the Y chromosome.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.900
So these would be female,
and those would be male.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.140
And it works out nicely
that half are female

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.590
and half are male.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.450
But a very interesting and
somewhat ironic fact might pop

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.850
out at you when you see this.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.270
Who determines whether their
offspring are male or female?

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.380
Is it the mom or the dad?

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.840
Well, the mom always donates an
X chromosome, so in no way

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.060
does what the haploid genetic
makeup of the mom's eggs, of

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.520
the gamete from the female, in
no way does that determine the

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.030
gender of the offspring.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.970
It's all determined by whether--
let me just draw a

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.950
bunch of-- dad's got a lot of
sperm, and they're all racing

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.000
towards the egg.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.390
And some of them have an X
chromosome in them and some of

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.010
them have a Y chromosome
in them.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.610
And obviously they
have others.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.530
And obviously if this guy
up here wins the race.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.340
Or maybe I should
say this girl.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.640
If she wins the race, then the
fertilized egg will develop

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.800
into a female.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.200
If this sperm wins the race,
then the fertilized egg will

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.020
develop into a male.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.880
And the reason why I said it's
ironic is throughout history,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.650
and probably the most famous
example of this

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.350
is Henry the VIII.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.490
I mean it's not just the
case with kings.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.950
It's probably true, because most
of our civilization is

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.080
male dominated, that you've had
these men who are obsessed

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.720
with producing a male
heir to kind of take

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.840
over the family name.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.740
And, in the case of Henry the
VIII, take over a country.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.220
And they become very
disappointed and they tend to

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.360
blame their wives when the wives
keep producing females,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.140
but it's all their fault.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.230
Henry the VIII, I mean
the most famous case

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.480
was with Ann Boleyn.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.630
I'm not an expert here, but the
general notion is that he

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.240
became upset with her that she
wasn't producing a male heir.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.060
And then he found a reason
to get her essentially

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.135
decapitated, even though
it was all his fault.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.320
He was maybe producing a lot
more sperm that looked like

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.030
that than was looking
like this.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.670
He eventually does produce a
male heir so he was-- and if

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.640
we assume that it was his
child-- then obviously he was

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.280
producing some of these, but for
the most part, it was all

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.320
Henry the VIII's fault.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.350
So that's why I say there's a
little bit of irony here.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.790
Is that the people doing the
blame are the people to blame

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.890
for the lack of a male heir.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.770
Now one question that might
immediately pop up in your

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.280
head is, Sal, is everything on
these chromosomes related to

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.970
just our sex-determining traits
or are there other

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.510
stuff on them?

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.400
So let me draw some
chromosomes.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.930
So let's say that's an X
chromosome and this is a Y

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.720
chromosome.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.010
Now the X chromosome, it does
code for a lot more things,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.760
although it is kind of
famously gene poor.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.720
It codes for on the order
of 1,500 genes.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.640
And the Y chromosome, it's the
most gene poor of all the

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.690
chromosomes.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.400
It only codes for on the
order of 78 genes.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.160
I just looked this up, but who
knows if it's exactly 78.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.030
But what it tells you is it does
very little other than

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.700
determining what
the gender is.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.650
And the way it determines that,
it does have one gene on

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.960
it called the SRY gene.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.930
You don't have to know that.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:32.950
SRY, that plays a role in the
development of testes or the

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.750
male sexual organ.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.320
So if you have this around, this
gene right here can start

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.669
coding for things that will
eventually lead to the

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.179
development of the testicles.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.110
And if you don't have that
around, that won't happen, so

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.760
you'll end up with a female.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.500
And I'm making gross
oversimplifications here.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.710
But everything I've dealt with
so far, OK, this clearly plays

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:53.890
a role in determining sex.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.390
But you do have other traits
on these genes.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:02.920
And the famous cases all deal
with specific disorders.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.560
So, for example, color
blindness.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.530
The genes, or the mutations
I should say.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:15.550
So the mutations that cause
color blindness.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:21.000
Red-green color blindness, which
I did in green, which is

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.250
maybe a little bit
inappropriate.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.240
Color blindness and
also hemophilia.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.960
This is an inability of
your blood to clot.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.840
Actually, there's several
types of hemophilia.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.060
But hemophilia is an
inability for your

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.830
blood to clot properly.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.935
And both of these are mutations
on the X chromosome.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.115
And they're recessive
mutations.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.150
So what does that mean?

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.360
It means both of your X
chromosomes have to have--

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.120
let's take the case for
hemophilia-- both of your X

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.460
chromosomes have to have the
hemophilia mutation in order

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.180
for you to show the phenotype
of having hemophilia.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.080
So, for example, if there's a
woman, and let's say this is

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.360
her genotype.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.610
She has one regular X chromosome
and then she has

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.200
one X chromosome that has
the-- I'll put a little

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.580
superscript there for
hemophilia-- she has the

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.510
hemophilia mutation.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.870
She's just going to
be a carrier.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.480
Her phenotype right here is
going to be no hemophilia.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.460
She'll have no problem
clotting her blood.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.040
The only way that a woman could
be a hemophiliac is if

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.910
she gets two versions of
this, because this

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.160
is a recessive mutation.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:49.510
Now this individual will
have hemophilia.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:54.660
Now men, they only have
one X chromosome.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.990
So for a man to exhibit
hemophilia, to have this

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.630
phenotype, he just needs
it only on the one X

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.530
chromosome he has.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.040
And then the other one's
a Y chromosome.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.150
So this man will have
hemophilia.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.510
So a natural question should be
arising is, hey, you know

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.120
this guy-- let's just say that
this is a relatively

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.210
infrequent mutation that arises
on an X chromosome--

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.960
the question is who's more
likely to have hemophilia?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.020
A male or a female?

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.620
All else equal, who's more
likely to have it?

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.490
Well if this is a relatively
infrequent allele, a female,

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.640
in order to display it, has
to get two versions of it.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.400
So let's say that the frequency
of it-- and I looked

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.360
it up before this video--
roughly they say between 1 in

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.460
5,000 to 10,000 men exhibit
hemophilia.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.020
So let's say that the allele
frequency of this is 1 in

00:11:51.020 --> 00:12:00.130
7,000, the frequency of Xh, the
hemophilia version of the

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.100
X chromosome.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.490
And that's why 1 in 7,000 men
display it, because it's

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.190
completely determined whether--
there's a 1 in 7,000

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.810
chance that this X chromosome
they get is

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.250
the hemophilia version.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.120
Who cares what the Y chromosome
they get is, cause

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.130
that essentially doesn't code at
all for the blood clotting

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.700
factors and all of the things
that drive hemophilia.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.870
Now, for a woman to get

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.140
hemophilia, what has to happen?

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.120
She has to have two X
chromosomes with the mutation.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.020
Well the probability of each of
them having the mutation is

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.630
1 in 7,000.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:38.110
So the probability of her having
hemophilia is 1 in

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:46.150
7,000 times 1 in 7,000, or
that's 1 in what, 49 million.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.790
So as you can imagine, the
incidence of hemophilia in

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.880
women is much lower than
the incidence of

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.220
hemophilia in men.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.600
And in general for any
sex-linked trait, if it's

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.990
recessive, if it's a recessive
sex-linked trait, which means

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.530
men, if they have it, they're
going to show it, because they

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.740
don't have another X chromosome
to dominate it.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.640
Or for women to show
it, she has to have

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.870
both versions of it.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:18.150
The incidence in men is going to
be, so let's say that m is

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.060
the incidence in men.

00:13:23.725 --> 00:13:24.975
I'm spelling badly.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.330
Then the incidence in
women will be what?

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.040
You could view this as the
allele frequency of that

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.000
mutation on the X chromosome.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.110
So women have to get
two versions of it.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.680
So the woman's frequency
is m squared.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.680
And you might say, hey, that
looks like a bigger number.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.280
I'm squaring it.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.610
But you have to remember that
these numbers, the frequency

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.250
is less than 1, so in the
case of hemophilia,

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.200
that was 1 in 7,000.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.680
So if you square 1 in 7,000,
you get 1 in 49 million.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.240
Anyway, hopefully you found that
interesting and now you

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.210
know how we all become
men and women.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:11.470
And even better you know whom to
blame when some of these, I

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:16.340
guess, male-focused parents
are having trouble

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.590
getting their son.
