00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.280
I've done a bunch of videos
already on respiration.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.440
I think even before those
videos, you had a sense that

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.510
we need oxygen and that
we release CO2.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.190
And if you watched the videos on
respiration, you know that

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.490
we need the oxygen in order to
metabolize our food, in order

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.980
to turn our food into ATPs
that can then drive other

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.300
types of cellular functions--
or anything that we have to

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.030
do; move, or breathe, or think,
or everything that we

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.480
have to do.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.830
And that through the process of
respiration, we break down

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.210
those sugars and we release
carbon dioxide.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.980
So in this video, what I want to
do is take a big step back

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.770
and think about how we actually
get our oxygen into

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.480
our body and how we release it
back out into the atmosphere.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.620
Another way to think about it is
how we ventilate ourselves.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.020
How do we get the oxygen in, and
how do we get the carbon

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.200
dioxide out?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.560
And I think any of us could at
least start off this video.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.030
It starts off in either
our nose or our mouth.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.830
I always have a clogged sinus
so I often have to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.720
deal with my mouth.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.110
I sleep with my mouth often.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.350
But it always starts in our
nose or our mouths.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.850
Let me draw someone with
a nose and a mouth.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.850
So let's say that this
is my person.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.865
Maybe his mouth will be open
so that he can breathe.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.380
His eyes aren't important,
but just so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.800
you know it's a person.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.610
So this is my test subject
or the person I'm

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.900
going to use to diagram.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.340
That's his ear.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.485
Maybe he has a bit of a-- let's
give him some hair.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.790
All of that is irrelevant,
but this is our guy.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.200
This is the guy that's going to
show us how we take air in

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.120
and how we take air
out of the body.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.910
So let's go inside
of this guy.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.680
I can draw his outside
first. Let me see how

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.510
well I can do this.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.390
So this is outside the guy.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.440
That doesn't look right.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.419
Let's say the guy looks
something like this and he's

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.900
got-- this is his shoulders.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.010
That's our guy.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.900
All right.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.200
So in our mouth, we have our
oral cavity right there, which

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.650
is just the space that
our mouth creates.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.770
We have our oral cavity.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.960
I could draw our tongue and all
of that and maybe I will.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.055
Maybe I'll draw the tongue.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.780
But you have this space inside
of the mouth-- call that the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.030
oral cavity.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.340
Oral for mouth, cavity for
space, or hole, or opening.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.700
And then also you have your
nostrils and they open up into

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.950
a nasal cavity.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.310
So that's another big space
just like this.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.800
And we know that they connect at
the back of our nose or the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.020
back of our mouth.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.880
And this passage right here
where they connect is called

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.130
the pharynx.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.640
When your air goes through your
nose-- they say breathing

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.680
through your nose is better,
probably because it gets

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.820
filtered by your nose hairs and
it gets warmed up and and

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.180
what not, but you can breathe
through either side.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.900
The air goes in through either
your nasal cavity or your oral

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.420
cavity and then comes back
through your pharynx and then

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.220
the pharynx splits
into two pipes.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.140
One for-- well, one, air can
go down either one, but the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.660
other one is for food.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.700
So your pharynx gets split.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.720
In the back you have your
esophagus-- and we'll talk

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.290
more about the esophagus
in a future video.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.540
In the back you have your
esophagus and in the front--

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.030
let me draw a little dividing
line there.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.370
In the front, maybe this-- let
me make it connect like that.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.320
I was using yellow.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.870
I'm going to use yellow to
continue and I'm going to use

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.730
green for the air.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.526
So it divides just like that.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.550
So behind your air pipe, you
have your esophagus.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.720
Let me make that
another color.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.030
And then right here
is your larynx.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.460
And I'm going to concern
ourselves with the larynx.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.440
Esophagus is where your
food goes down.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.910
We know that we eat food
with our mouth as well.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.710
So this is where we
want our food to

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.310
go-- down the esophagus.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.700
But the focus of this video
is our ventilation.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.600
What do we do with our air?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.260
So I'm going to focus as the air
goes through our larynx.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.030
And the larynx is also
our voicebox.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.460
So as you hear me talking right
now, there are these

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.360
little things right about here
that are vibrating at just the

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.900
right frequencies and I'm able
to shape the sound with my

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.330
mouth to make this video.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.340
So that's also your voicebox,
but I won't focus

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.180
on that right now.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.770
It's called a voicebox because
of this whole anatomical

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.580
structure that looks something
like that.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.610
But then after the air passes
through the larynx-- this is

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:31.580
on the way in-- it goes to the
trachea, which is essentially

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.830
just the pipe for air.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.170
The esophagus is the
pipe for food.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.420
Let me write this down.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.280
And then from the trachea-- and
the trachea is actually a

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.590
reasonably rigid structure.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.780
It has cartilage around
it and it makes

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.970
sense that it has cartilage.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.290
You don't want-- you can imagine
a hose-- if it bent a

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.240
lot, you wouldn't be able to get
a lot of water through it,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.310
or a lot of air through it.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.530
So you don't want this
thing to bend a lot.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.630
So that's why it needs to have
some rigidity-- so that's why

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.930
it has cartilage around it.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.090
And then it splits into two
tubes-- and I think you know

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.270
where these two tubes
are going to.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.590
And I'm not drawing this
in super detail.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.410
I just want you to get the idea
of them, but these two

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.770
tubes are the bronchi-- or
each one is a bronchus.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.550
And they also have cartilage,
so they're fairly rigid, but

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.480
the bronchi keep splitting.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.140
They keep splitting into smaller
and smaller tubes just

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.320
like that and at some point,
they stop having cartilage.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.690
They stop being reasonably
rigid, but they

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.290
keep splitting off.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.030
So I'll just draw them as
these little lines.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.530
At some point they become
such thin things.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.170
They just keep splitting off.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.560
So the air just keeps splitting
off and spread and

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.100
goes down the different paths.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.400
And when the bronchi no longer
have cartilage around them,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.490
they're no longer rigid.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.690
The first of those are called--
or actually all the

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.480
tubes after that point are
called bronchioles.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.630
These are bronchioles.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.630
So for example, that we could
call a bronchiole.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.225
And there's nothing
fancy here.

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:07.380
It's just a pipe that
just gets thinner

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.110
and thinner and thinner.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.920
We've labeled the different
parts of the pipes different

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.380
things, but the idea is, let's
take it through our mouth or

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.020
our nose and we just keep
dividing and keep dividing

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.310
this main division into two
different paths that takes us

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.550
into each of our lungs.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.010
Let me draw this guy's
lungs here.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.590
And these bronchi-- or the
bronchi split into the lungs--

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.720
the bronchioles are in the
lungs and eventually the

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.660
bronchioles terminate.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.020
And this is where it
gets interesting.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.500
They keep dividing smaller and
smaller, thinner and thinner

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:52.110
and thinner, into these little
air sacs, just like that.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.770
At the end of every super small
bronchiole are these

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.500
little air sacs-- super small
air sacs-- and I'm going to

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.060
talk about these air
sacs in a second.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.310
And these are called alveoli.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.700
So I've used a lot of
fancy words, but the

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.860
general idea is simple.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.050
Air comes in through a pipe.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.020
The pipe gets thinner and
thinner and thinner and they

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.760
end up at these little
air sacs.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.450
And you're saying, well,
how does that get the

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.930
oxygen into my system?

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.460
Well, the key here is that these
air sacs are super small

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.950
and have very, very, very
thin walls-- or

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.059
I guess thin membranes.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.700
So let me zoom in.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.740
So if I were to zoom in on one
of these alveoli-- and just to

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.950
give you an idea, these are
super duper duper small.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.799
I've drawn them fairly large
here, but each alveoli-- let

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.930
me draw a little bit bigger.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.780
Let me draw these air sacs.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.840
So you have these air
sacs like this.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.290
And then you have a
bronchiole that's

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.600
terminating in that air sac.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.320
Maybe a bronchiole is
terminating in another air sac

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.820
just like that-- another set
of air sacs just like that.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:10.300
Each of these are only 200 to
300 microns in diameter.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.530
So that distance right there--
let me switch colors-- that

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.720
distance right there is
200 to 300 microns.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.050
And in case you don't know what
a micron is, a micron is

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.200
a millionth of a meter--
or you can view it as a

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.820
thousandth of a millimeter.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.340
So this is 200 thousandths
of a millimeter.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.890
Or you can think of them as--
and this is actually a very

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:38.730
easy way to visualize it-- this
is about one fifth of a

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.920
millimeter.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.790
So if I actually try to draw it
on the screen-- if you made

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.600
this full screen, a millimeter
is about that far.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.690
Maybe a little farther
than that.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.130
Maybe about that far.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.530
So imagine a fifth of that and
that's what we're talking

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.580
about the diameter of
one of these things.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.470
And just to put it in the
whole scheme relative to

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.330
cells, the average
cell in the human

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.760
body is about 10 microns.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.450
So this is only about 20 or 30
cells in diameter or relative

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.600
to the average cell
in the human body.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.360
So these have a super
thin membrane.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.480
If you view them as balloons,
the balloon is very thin--

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.260
pretty much one cell thick and
they're connected to the

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.410
bloodflow-- or actually, a
better way to think about is

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.540
that our circulatory system
passes right next to each of

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.100
these things.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.580
So you have blood vessels that
come from the heart and they

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.860
want to be oxygenated.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.810
In general, the blood vessels
that don't have oxygen-- and

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.900
I'm going to do this in a lot
more detail when I make the

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.250
videos about the heart and our
circulation system-- the blood

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.570
vessels that don't have oxygen--
de-oxygenated blood

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.420
is a little bit darker.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.770
It looks a little
bit purplish.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.400
So I'll draw it as blue.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.890
So these are vessels that are
coming from the heart.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.060
So this blood right here has no
oxygen in it or it's been

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.650
de-oxygenated or it has very
little oxygen in it.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.520
And the word for the blood
vessels that comes from the

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.010
heart are arteries.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.760
Let me write that down.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.290
I'll review that again when
we cover it in the heart.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:21.590
So arteries are blood vessels
from the heart.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.770
And you've probably
heard of arteries.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.190
Vessels that go to the heart
are called veins.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.160
This is really important to keep
in mind because later on,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.270
you're going to see that
arteries don't always carry

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.100
oxygen or they're always not
de-oxygenated and veins always

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.900
aren't one way or the other.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.520
We're going to go into a lot
more detail when we actually

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.780
cover the heart and the
circulatory system, but just

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.630
remember, arteries go away.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.510
Veins go to the heart.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:58.610
So here, these are arteries
going away from the heart to

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:03.020
the lungs, to the alveoli
because they want the blood

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.310
that's traveling in them
to get oxygen.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:09.720
So what's going to happen is
that the air is flowing

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:16.060
through the bronchioles and
circulating around the

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.650
alveoli, filling the alveoli--
and as they fill the alveoli,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:27.680
the little molecules of oxygen
are allowed to cross the

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.220
membrane of the alveoli
and essentially be

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.530
absorbed into the blood.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.850
I'll do a lot more on that when
we talk about hemoglobin

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.740
and red blood cells, but you
just have to realize that

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.920
there's just a lot
of capillaries.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.810
Capillaries are just super small
blood vessels that allow

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.850
air to pass-- essentially oxygen
and carbon dioxide

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.560
molecules to pass
between them.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.580
These have a lot of capillaries
on them that allow

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.450
the exchange of gases.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:56.470
So the oxygen can go into this
blood and so once the oxygen--

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.310
so this is the vessel that's
coming from the heart and then

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.100
it's just a tube.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.710
So then once it gets the oxygen,
it's going to go back

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:04.960
to the heart.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.790
And so essentially this is the
point where this vessel, this

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.840
pipe, part of our circulatory
system, goes from being an

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.745
artery-- because it's coming
from the heart-- to a vein

00:13:19.745 --> 00:13:22.320
because it's going back
to the heart.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.010
And there's a special word for
these arteries and veins.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.900
They're called pulmonary
arteries and veins.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:34.980
So going away from the heart to
the lungs, to the alveoli,

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:40.840
these are the pulmonary
arteries.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.775
And going back to the heart
are the pulmonary veins.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.090
Now you're saying, Sal, what
does pulmonary mean?

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.920
Well, pulmo comes from the
Latin for the lungs.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.090
It literally means the arteries
that are of the lungs

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.380
or that go to the lungs
and the veins that

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.300
come from the lungs.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.840
So anytime people talk about
pulmonary anything, they're

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.200
talking about our lungs-- or
maybe something related to how

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.770
we breathe.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.200
So it's a good word to know.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:19.300
So anyway, you have your oxygen
coming in through your

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.670
mouth or your nose, through the
pharynx-- it could fill

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.200
your stomach.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.550
We can blow up our stomach
like a balloon, but that

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:29.150
doesn't help us actually get
oxygen to our blood stream.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.990
But the oxygen will come through
our larynx, into our

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.270
trachea, through the bronchi,
eventually in bronchioles,

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.120
ending up in alveoli and being
able to be absorbed into what

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.570
where the arteries, but then
we're going to go back and

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.490
then essentially oxygenate
the blood.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:50.140
The red blood cells become red
once the hemoglobin becomes

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.980
very red or scarlet once it
actually has the oxygen and

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.300
then we go back.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.140
But at the same time, this
isn't just about getting

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.850
oxygen into our arteries
or onto the hemoglobin.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.110
It's also about releasing
carbon dioxide.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:10.610
So these blue arteries coming
from the lungs are also going

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.730
to release carbon dioxide
into the alveoli.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.560
And these will be exhaled.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.360
So we have oxygen coming in.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.110
Other things will be coming in,
but the O2 is what gets

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.790
absorbed in the alveoli.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.680
And then when we breathe out,
we're going to have carbon

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.850
dioxide that was in our blood,
but then it gets absorbed into

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.840
the alveoli and they
get squeezed out.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.685
I'm going to tell you in a
second how it gets squeezed.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.120
It's actually that squeezing out
that actually-- when the

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.160
air goes back out, it can
vibrate my vocal cords and

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.210
it'll allow me to talk, but I'm
not going to go into too

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.620
much detail about that.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.200
So the last thing to consider
about this whole pulmonary

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.360
system or about our lungs is,
how does it force the air in

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.690
and how does it force
the air out?

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.660
And the way it's done is really
kind of like a-- you

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.700
could imagine it's kind of a
pump or a balloon-- is that we

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.680
have this huge layer
of flat muscles.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.170
Let me pick a good color here.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.400
Right below the lungs--
and this is

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.650
called a thoracic diaphragm.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.280
And so when it's relaxed, it
kind of has this arch shape,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.700
and so the lungs are kind
of squeezed in.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.440
They don't have a
lot of volume.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.380
But when I essentially breathe
in, what's happening is this

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.170
thoracic diaphragm is contracted
and when it's

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.950
contracted, it gets shorter, but
more importantly, it opens

00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:00.440
up the space where
my lungs are.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.330
So my lungs can fill
up that space.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.920
So what it does is, it
essentially-- it's like

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.420
pulling a balloon larger,
making the

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.064
volume of my lungs larger.

00:17:10.064 --> 00:17:13.310
And when you make the volume of
something larger-- so the

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.000
lungs will become larger as
my thoracic diaphragm is

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.630
contracted and it kind of arches
down, creates more

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.150
space-- and as the volume of
something becomes larger, the

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.140
pressure inside of
them goes down.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.420
If you remember from physics,
the pressure

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.720
times volume is a constant.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:39.050
So when we breathe in, our brain
is essentially telling

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.300
our diaphragm to contract.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.125
We have more space
around our lungs.

00:17:51.125 --> 00:17:56.390
Our lungs expand to
fill the space.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.870
We have less pressure here than
we have outside-- or you

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.540
can view it as negative
pressure.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.440
So air always wants to go from
high pressure to low pressure

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.060
and so air is going to
flow into our lungs.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.710
And hopefully there'll be some
oxygen there that can then

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.530
essentially go into our alveoli
and end up in our

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.190
arteries and then go back in the
veins as oxygen attached

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.820
to hemoglobin.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.530
I'll talk more about
that in detail.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.960
And then when we stop
contracting the diaphragm, it

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.980
goes back to this
arched position.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.020
It contracts.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.550
It's kind of like
a rubber band.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.480
It contracts back the lungs and
it essentially expels the

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.780
air back and now that air's
going to have a lot more

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.120
carbon dioxide.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:39.130
And just to get a sense of-- I
can look at my lungs-- I can't

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.130
look at them, but they
don't seem too large.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.350
How do I get enough oxygen in
them-- and the key is, is that

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:52.090
because of this branching
process and the alveoli, the

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.920
inside surface area of the lungs
are actually much larger

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.310
than you can imagine-- or
actually than I could have

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.830
imagined had someone
not told me.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.090
So it actually turns out-- I
looked it up-- the internal

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:08.650
surface area of your alveoli--
so the total surface area

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.470
where the oxygen can be absorbed
in or the carbon

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.950
dioxide can be absorbed out from
the blood-- it's actually

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:18.610
75 square meters.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.910
That's meters, not feet.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.730
If you think about it, that's
like a-- imagine some type of

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.310
a tarp or a field.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.930
That's almost nine
by nine meters.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:36.340
That's almost 27 by
27 square feet.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.530
That's the size of some
people's backyards.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.140
That's how much surface air you
have inside of your lungs.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.240
It's all folded up.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.310
That's how it gets jammed into
what look like relatively

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.220
small lungs.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.410
But that's what gives us enough
surface area for enough

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.680
of the air, enough of the
oxygen, to cross the alveoli

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.980
membrane into our blood system
and enough of the carbon

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.560
dioxide to go back in.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.370
And just to have a sense of how
many alveoli we had-- I

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.240
told you that they're very
small-- we actually have 300

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.410
million in each lung.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:09.350
In each lung, we have
300 million alveoli.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.020
So anyway, hopefully that gives
you a decent sense of

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.230
how we at least get oxygen
into our blood system and

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.640
carbon dioxide out of it.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.200
In the next video, I'll talk
more about our actual

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:26.520
circulatory system and how we
get the oxygen from the lungs

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.240
to the rest of the body and
how do we get the carbon
