00:00:00.053 --> 00:00:11.204
So that it's less likely that we get shown up by talking birds in the future, we've set a little bit of exercise for solving systems of equations with substitution.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.864
And so this is the first exercise or the first problem that they give us.

00:00:14.887 --> 00:00:19.294
-3x-4y=-2 and y=2x-5

00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:23.924
So let me get out my little scratch pad and let me rewrite the problem.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:32.177
So this is -3x-4y=-2

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.429
and then they tell us y=2x-5.

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.942
So, what's neat about this is that they've already solved the second equation.

00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:46.264
They've already made it explicitly solved for y

00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:50.969
which makes it very easy to substitute for. We can take this constraint, the constraint on y

00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:53.854
in terms of x and substitute it for y

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:58.342
in this first blue equation and then solve for x.

00:00:58.342 --> 00:00:59.824
So let's try it out.

00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:01.985
So this first blue equation would then become

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:07.353
-3x-4 but instead of putting a y there

00:01:07.353 --> 00:01:11.742
the second constraint tells us that y needs to be equal to 2x-5.

00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:22.963
So it's 4(2x-5) and all of that is going to be equal to -2.

00:01:22.963 --> 00:01:26.198
So now we get just one equation with one unknown.

00:01:26.198 --> 00:01:28.313
and now we just have to solve for x.

00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:30.259
So, let's see if we can do that.

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.891
So, it's -3x and then this part right over here

00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:39.266
we have a -4, be careful, we have a -4 we want to distribute.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:45.530
We are going to multiply -4*2x which is -8x

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.767
and -4*-5 is positive 20 and thats going to equal -2.

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:55.802
And now we can combine all the x terms

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:02.992
so -3x-8x, that's going to be -11x

00:02:02.992 --> 00:02:09.965
and then we have -11x+20=-2.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:13.704
Now to solve for x, we'll subtract 20 from both sides

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:18.945
to get rid of the 20 on the left hand side.

00:02:18.963 --> 00:02:21.244
On the left hand side, we're just left with

00:02:21.252 --> 00:02:30.938
the -11x and then on the right hand side we are left with -22.

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:37.410
Now we can divide both sides by -11.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:47.646
And we are left with x is equal to 22 divided by 11 is 2, and the negatives cancel out. x = 2.

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:51.024
So we are not quite done yet. We've done, I guess you can say

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.856
the hard part, we have solved for x but now we have to solve for y.

00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:59.279
We could take this x value to either one of these equations and solve for y.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:03.319
But this second one has already explicitly solved for y

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.337
so let's use that one, so it says y = 2 times

00:03:07.337 --> 00:03:10.895
and instead of x, we now know that the x value

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:14.564
where these two intersect, you could view it that way

00:03:14.564 --> 00:03:19.825
is going to be equal to 2, so 2 * 2 - 5

00:03:19.856 --> 00:03:25.062
let's figure out the corresponding y value.

00:03:25.984 --> 00:03:37.898
So you get y=2(2)-5 and y = 4 - 5 so y = -1.

00:03:37.898 --> 00:03:40.767
And you can verify that it'll work in this top equation

00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:50.435
If y = -1 and x=2, this top equation becomes -3(2) which is -6-4(-1)

00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:56.292
which would be plus 4. And -6+4 is indeed -2.

00:03:56.292 --> 00:03:59.100
So it satisfies both of these equations and now

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.029
we can type it in to verify that we got it right,

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.167
although, we know that we did, so x=2 and y=-1.

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:14.071
So, let's type it in... x=2 and y=-1.

00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:18.071
Excellent, now we're much less likely to be embarassed by talking birds.
