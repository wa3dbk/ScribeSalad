00:00:00.353 --> 00:00:04.328
Greece and the crisis in the European Union has been in the news for some time now,

00:00:04.328 --> 00:00:07.471
so it's long past due that I did a video on it

00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:12.141
and just so we have a time context that you might be watching this video far in the future.

00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:14.622
This video is being done in May, 2012.

00:00:14.622 --> 00:00:17.241
So we really don't know how all this is going to play out,

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:23.845
but I hope over the next few videos to lay out the potential scenarios and what might be the risks and drawbacks,

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:26.355
uh, drawbacks of each of them.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:29.998
So this right over here, that is Greece.

00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:33.372
And so let's just think about it on a very high level,

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:36.672
what the situation that they find themselves in.

00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:38.386
So when you look at this chart right over here

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:41.752
the most obvious thing and it actually pops out from this top line right here,

00:00:41.752 --> 00:00:44.821
their public debt is growing at a dramatic level

00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:47.664
and their debt to GDP...this is actually the more relevant thing

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:49.586
because you might have a huge amount of debt

00:00:49.586 --> 00:00:52.295
but if your GDP, if the productivity of the country is high,

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:54.163
that might not be that big of a problem.

00:00:54.163 --> 00:00:58.400
What matters is how much you owe relative to how much that you can actually produce.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.534
And we see right over here the debt to GDP ratio is a percentage

00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:05.620
so this debt is a percentage of GDP , it's well over 100%.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.165
It is well over 100% for Greece.

00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:11.835
And you can see a large part of that is because

00:01:11.835 --> 00:01:14.902
the public revenue, the taxes that the Greek government gets

00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:18.272
is consistently lower than their public expenditures.

00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:19.772
So let me write this down.

00:01:19.772 --> 00:01:26.903
So you have taxes. Taxes are less than spending

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:31.721
which lead to deficits...deficit is how much you couldn't afford,

00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:36.044
or how much, how much spending you have above and beyond your revenues in a given year.

00:01:36.044 --> 00:01:40.822
And so they have deficit spending on a year by year basis which increases their debt.

00:01:40.822 --> 00:01:43.386
The debt is the total amount of money that they owe,

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:45.517
that's this top line right over here.

00:01:45.517 --> 00:01:53.259
So this leads to increasing debt, increasing debt right over here.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.039
But that's not the only problem.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.520
Because as their debt keeps increasing,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.856
people start to become more and more suspicious of

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:05.245
whether the government is actually good for their I.O.U.'s,

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:07.730
whether the government will actually pay back that debt.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.643
And so as the government's debt becomes riskier and riskier,

00:02:11.643 --> 00:02:14.738
people start demanding higher and higher interest rate.

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:17.523
So the debt goes up. And as the debt goes up,

00:02:17.523 --> 00:02:20.791
people think that they're not a good borrower.

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:25.374
So they want higher interest, interest goes up.

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:27.348
But now that makes things even worse,

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:29.299
because we were already running deficits,

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.855
we were already spending more than we were bringing in taxes,

00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:35.488
now we have to spend even more on the interest on our debt.

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:38.398
So if you were spending 10% on your interest in one year,

00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:41.904
so if you had $100 billion dollars, you just spend $10 billion,

00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:45.611
now if the interest rates go to 15%, you have to spend$15 billion on that.

00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:48.108
So that's going to make your spending on interest go up,

00:02:48.108 --> 00:02:51.115
so that's going to make the debt go up even more.

00:02:51.115 --> 00:02:54.477
So Greece finds itself in a situation like this.

00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:56.144
So you might immediately say "well, you know

00:02:56.144 --> 00:02:59.231
there's seems to be a fairly straight forward solution here.

00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:04.728
Why don't they do some combination of increasing taxes?"

00:03:04.728 --> 00:03:08.594
So why don't they increase taxes?

00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:11.934
"And maybe even more importantly, why don't they decrease spending? "

00:03:11.934 --> 00:03:17.831
Why don't they decrease spending?

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.290
Now the first cut is a political situation.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.489
Because this spending right over here,

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.857
these are for the most part, these are promises to people,

00:03:24.857 --> 00:03:27.870
these might be government obligations, these might be pensions,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.529
there might be retirees that are dependent on this,

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.866
there could be other types of government programs.

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:34.593
So if you decrease that spending,

00:03:34.593 --> 00:03:38.593
the people who are losing out on those entitlements,

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.278
they are not going to be too pleased with you.

00:03:40.278 --> 00:03:42.700
So politically that's probably not the best thing to do.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.247
But there might be a brave Greek leader that say

00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:48.408
"well no, this is what we have to do to save the country,

00:03:48.408 --> 00:03:50.238
we're willing to cut that spending."

00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:52.914
But that by itself, even if someone was willing to do it,

00:03:52.914 --> 00:03:54.980
it still isn't clear whether it's a good idea.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.775
Because you might have noticed this other line right over here.

00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:01.017
This other line, "Real GDP Growth" .

00:04:01.017 --> 00:04:05.782
Greece right over here is in a fairly severe recession.

00:04:05.782 --> 00:04:07.097
They have a lot of unemployment,

00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:11.693
clearly factories aren't producing at the levels that they could actually produce.

00:04:11.693 --> 00:04:15.863
So if you either do some combination of increasing your taxes,

00:04:15.863 --> 00:04:18.660
increasing the government revenue, and decreasing spending,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.940
that actually will suck air out of the economy.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.063
So this combination of things, and you've probably heard this word a lot,

00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:27.895
this combination of things,

00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:32.128
and it tends to focus on the decreasing spending in a very significant way,

00:04:32.128 --> 00:04:37.041
this is referred to as "Austerity."

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:40.418
The word "Austere" just generally means someone who doesn't have a lot of frills,

00:04:40.418 --> 00:04:43.435
they just deal with the most bare necessities

00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:45.671
they really kind of cut things to the bone.

00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:49.129
And so when a lot of people say "Hey Greece you have to do Austerity measures"

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.926
--and there's actually already been a couple of rounds of austerity measures.

00:04:51.926 --> 00:04:54.510
"you need to decrease your spending in a big way."

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.488
But the problem is Austerity sucks money out of the economy,

00:04:58.488 --> 00:05:07.068
and so Austerity leads to the economy slowing further,

00:05:07.068 --> 00:05:10.829
and if the economy slows further, that actually going to hurt your taxes.

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:19.847
So the economy slowing makes your taxes, your actual revenue that you're getting, go down,

00:05:19.847 --> 00:05:24.608
and that can actually make your deficits even worse!

00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:27.256
Because now people say "oh my God, their economy is bad,

00:05:27.256 --> 00:05:28.586
they're even less likely to be able to pay."

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:33.039
Interest rates go up, and since the tax revenue goes down,

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.090
and a lot of the spending isn't tied to the economy,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.297
a lot of the spending actually goes up with the economy.

00:05:37.297 --> 00:05:41.135
It might be unemployment insurance, it might be people retiring, pensions,

00:05:41.135 --> 00:05:42.953
and so that can actually make things worse.

00:05:42.953 --> 00:05:46.005
And that's actually what has happened over the last few years.

00:05:46.005 --> 00:05:48.311
Because, and we'll talk more about this,

00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:53.469
the Greek's were given some help from the rest of the European Union.

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.720
In exchange, the rest of the European Union said

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.566
"well, if we're going to help you, you gotta take some pain.

00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:03.579
And the pain that you had to take were these Austerity measures right over here."

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:07.348
But these Austerity measures actually made the economy do even worse,

00:06:07.348 --> 00:06:10.980
which made debt as a percentage of GDP even higher,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.685
because now the GDP itself was shrinking at a even larger and larger rate.

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:20.202
So if you think, just all of these aspects, there was no obvious answer here.

00:06:20.202 --> 00:06:24.999
You do Austerity, it's kind of a bad situation because that's going to hurt the economy,

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:28.698
you're going to become even less productive, at least in the short term.

00:06:28.698 --> 00:06:32.840
And on top of that it's hugely politically unpopular,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.115
to the point to where we have such high unemployment that it's becoming politically unstable.

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:41.399
So I'll leave you there, I'll let you mull over this situation,

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:46.067
and in the next video I'll talk about what a normal, independent country,

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:49.784
truly independent, both fiscally and monetarily independent country,

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:53.440
would do in a situation like this, given Greece's situation.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.447
And then we'll talk about why Greece kind of can't do it in its current context.
