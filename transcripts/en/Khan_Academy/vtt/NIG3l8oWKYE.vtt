00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.830
So now we have this graph
of this-- what was

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:04.865
clearly a trig function.

00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:09.300
And our task is to figure
out what the function is.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.040
So let's look at this.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.210
The first thing I do when I
look at something like this,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.460
I want to figure out its
period and its amplitude.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.380
So what's its amplitude?

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.410
That's always an easy one.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.230
So the amplitude.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.240
Well, that's just how much does
it move up and down above

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.390
and below the x-axis?

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.760
Well, the amplitude here is how
much it moves up the x-axis.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.750
Well, it moves up 1/2 above
and below the x-axis.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.400
So the amplitude is 1/2.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.980
And keep in mind, the amplitude
is not this whole distance.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.830
It's not this.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.370
It's just how much it moves
above or below the x-axis.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.860
So in this case, the
amplitude is 1/2.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.040
And then we have to figure
out what the period is.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.510
The period is, how long does it
take-- how many radians does

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.040
it go through for it to go
through 1 complete cycle?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.890
Well, if we start here, and we
were to follow the graph, it

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.780
doesn't take until right here
until we complete

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.430
1 cycle, right?

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.900
Because here, we're still
going down, and now

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.470
we're going below.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.450
So we're not repeating yet.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.370
And here's where we
start repeating again.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.240
And then we start
repeating again here.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.130
So every pi radians, we
start the cycle over again.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.010
It happens the same if you
go backwards into the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.540
negative radians.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.685
So the period is pi, right?

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:30.420
The period is pi.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.650
And you could start
from any point.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.760
You could start
from this point.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.350
And if you go, follow the
graph, and then come back to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.070
the same point again, we
see once again that the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.540
period is pi radians.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.215
Now we have to figure out
if this is a sine or

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:46.335
a cosine function.

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:50.680
And for now, we'll not
think about shifting.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.930
So let's think about what
happens when-- you know,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.900
we want to know what
this function is.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.010
f of x is equal to
question mark.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.116
Well, we see that f of 0 is 0.

00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:08.800
f of 0 is equal to 0.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.880
What does that tell us?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.830
Is this a sine or a
cosine function?

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.510
Well, what's cosine of 0?

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.620
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.630
And what's sine of 0?

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.390
Well, sine of 0 is 0.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.290
And this function is 0.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.100
So we know that this
is a sine function.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.050
So we know the formula is going
to take the form f of x, it's

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.110
going to equal the amplitude
times sine of 2 pi

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.900
over the period x.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.440
And if we just substitute these
numbers we just figured out, we

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:56.155
know that f of x is equal to
1/2 sine of 2 pi over pi x.

00:02:56.155 --> 00:03:03.650
The pi's cancel out and
you get f of x is equal

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.270
to 1/2 sine of 2x.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.020
Let's define another function.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.980
Let's define g of x is
equal to 1/2 cosine of 2x.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.370
What would have
this looked like?

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.900
Or what would have-- yeah.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.083
The grammar's a
little difficult.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.660
I picked the wrong color,
because f of x is

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.170
actually the pink one.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.080
This is the one we have now.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.470
So actually, let
me circle that.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.100
This is f of x.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.770
f of x is this one right here.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.500
And now, g of x,
I'm going to do--.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.910
So when x is 0, what is g of 0?

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.800
Let's put 0 in here.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.230
So this whole term
will become 0.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.360
What's cosine of 0?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.000
It's 1.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And 1 times 1/2.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.300
So g of 0 is 1/2.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.180
So we would start here, and
then we would have-- just

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.220
like the sine function-- we
would have a period of pi.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.500
Because it has the same
coefficient here.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.070
So this'll just look like this.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.185
I think you get the point.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.150
It's just like the sine
function was just shifted

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.000
to the left of it.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.920
Well, I'm getting confused
on this-- ignore this.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.120
But if you look at this side,
the important thing to realize

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.610
is that it intersects the
y-axis at not 1, but 1/2.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.950
And the reason why it doesn't
intersect it at 1, even

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.120
though cosine of 0 is 1, is
because we have this 1/2

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.420
coefficient right here.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.610
I guess you can't call
that a coefficient.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.430
I guess it's a 1/2 times
the cosine function.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.760
Hopefully that gives you a
little bit more of a sense of,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.980
if you just looked at a graph,
being able to figure

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.850
out its equation.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.590
And I'll actually do one more
video where we'll actually use

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.900
the Khan Academy trig
graphing module to figure

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.360
out a couple more.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.900
See you soon.
