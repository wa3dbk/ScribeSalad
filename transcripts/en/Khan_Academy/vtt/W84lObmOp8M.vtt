00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.040
Let's think about what
functions really do, and then

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.590
we'll think about the idea of
an inverse of a function.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.450
So let's start with a pretty
straightforward function.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.510
Let's say f of x is
equal to 2x plus 4.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:20.340
And so if I take f of 2, f of 2
is going to be equal to 2 times

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.560
2 plus 4, which is 4
plus 4, which is 8.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.470
I could take f of 3, which
is 2 times 3 plus 4,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.920
which is equal to 10.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.960
6 plus 4.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.280
So let's think about it
in a little bit more

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.800
of an abstract sense.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.990
So there's a set of things that
I can input into this function.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.700
You might already be
familiar with that notion.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.050
It's the domain.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.760
The set of all of the things
that I can input into that

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.760
function, that is the domain.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.290
And in that domain, 2 is
sitting there, you have 3 over

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.700
there, pretty much you could
input any real number

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.850
into this function.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.810
So this is going to be all
real, but we're making it a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.150
nice contained set here just
to help you visualize it.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.830
Now, when you apply the
function, let's think about

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.000
it means to take f of 2.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.900
We're inputting a number, 2,
and then the function is

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.790
outputting the number 8.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.270
It is mapping us from 2 to 8.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.490
So let's make another set here
of all of the possible values

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.930
that my function can take on.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.300
And we can call that the range.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.320
There are more formal ways to
talk about this, and there's a

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.640
much more rigorous discussion
of this later on, especially in

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.060
the linear algebra playlist,
but this is all the different

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.200
values I can take on.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.550
So if I take the number 2 from
our domain, I input it into the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.270
function, we're getting
mapped to the number 8.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.260
So let's let me draw that out.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.210
So we're going from 2 to
the number 8 right there.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.060
And it's being done
by the function.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.210
The function is
doing that mapping.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.190
That function is mapping
us from 2 to 8.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.180
This right here, that
is equal to f of 2.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.080
Same idea.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.810
You start with 3, 3 is being
mapped by the function to 10.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.480
It's creating an association.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.320
The function is mapping
us from 3 to 10.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.400
Now, this raises an
interesting question.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.840
Is there a way to get back from
8 to the 2, or is there a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.220
way to go back from
the 10 to the 3?

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.340
Or is there some
other function?

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.870
Is there some other function,
we can call that the inverse

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.660
of f, that'll take us back?

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.260
Is there some other
function that'll take

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.200
us from 10 back to 3?

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.970
We'll call that the inverse
of f, and we'll use that as

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.790
notation, and it'll take
us back from 10 to 3.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.360
Is there a way to do that?

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.070
Will that same inverse of f,
will it take us back from--

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.290
if we apply 8 to it-- will
that take us back to 2?

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.760
Now, all this seems very
abstract and difficult.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.990
What you'll find is it's
actually very easy to solve for

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.030
this inverse of f, and I think
once we solve for it, it'll

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.540
make it clear what
I'm talking about.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.820
That the function takes you
from 2 to 8, the inverse will

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.360
take us back from 8 to 2.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.470
So to think about that, let's
just define-- let's just

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.790
say y is equal to f of x.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.510
So y is equal to f of x,
is equal to 2x plus 4.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.110
So I can write just y is equal
to 2x plus 4, and this once

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.420
again, this is our function.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.470
You give me an x,
it'll give me a y.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.990
But we want to go the
other way around.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.760
We want to give you
a y and get an x.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.490
So all we have to do is
solve for x in terms of y.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.160
So let's do that.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.460
If we subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation-- let me

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.350
switch colors-- if we subtract
4 from both sides of this

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.310
equation, we get y minus 4 is
equal to 2x, and then if we

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.270
divide both sides of this
equation by 2, we get y over 2

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.750
minus 2-- 4 divided by 2
is 2-- is equal to x.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.160
Or if we just want to write it
that way, we can just swap the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.100
sides, we get x is equal to
1/2y-- same thing as

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.190
y over 2-- minus 2.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.270
So what we have here is
a function of y that

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.750
gives us an x, which is
exactly what we wanted.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.510
We want a function of these
values that map back to an x.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.100
So we can call this-- we could
say that this is equal to--

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.840
I'll do it in the same color--
this is equal to f inverse

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.570
as a function of y.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.080
Or let me just write it
a little bit cleaner.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.050
We could say f inverse as a
function of y-- so we can have

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.650
10 or 8-- so now the range is
now the domain for f inverse.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.120
f inverse as a function of y
is equal to 1/2y minus 2.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.570
So all we did is we started
with our original function, y

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.300
is equal to 2x plus 4, we
solved for-- over here, we've

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.870
solved for y in terms of x--
then we just do a little bit of

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.250
algebra, solve for x in terms
of y, and we say that that is

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.580
our inverse as a function of y.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.370
Which is right over here.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.570
And then, if we, you know, you
can say this is-- you could

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.640
replace the y with an a, a b,
an x, whatever you want to do,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.240
so then we can just
rename the y as x.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.000
So if you put an x into this
function, you would get f

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.660
inverse of x is equal
to 1/2x minus 2.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.340
So all you do, you solve for x,
and then you swap the y and the

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.720
x, if you want to
do it that way.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.240
That's the easiest way
to think about it.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.110
And one thing I want to point
out is what happens when you

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.255
graph the function
and the inverse.

00:05:46.255 --> 00:05:48.420
So let me just do a
little quick and dirty

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.160
graph right here.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.190
And then I'll do a bunch of
examples of actually solving

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.580
for inverses, but I really
just wanted to give

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.030
you the general idea.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.010
Function takes you from the
domain to the range, the

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.570
inverse will take you from that
point back to the original

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.810
value, if it exists.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.500
So if I were to graph these--
just let me draw a little

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.790
coordinate axis right here,
draw a little bit of a

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.040
coordinate axis right there.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.630
This first function, 2x plus 4,
its y intercept is going to be

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:24.520
1, 2, 3, 4, just like that, and
then its slope will

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.610
look like this.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.470
It has a slope of 2, so it will
look something like-- its graph

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.870
will look-- let me make it a
little bit neater than that--

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.400
it'll look something like that.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.450
That's what that
function looks like.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.390
What does this
function look like?

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.680
What does the inverse function
look like, as a function of x?

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.980
Remember we solved for x,
and then we swapped the x

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.900
and the y, essentially.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.570
We could say now that y is
equal to f inverse of x.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.400
So we have a y-intercept
of negative 2, 1, 2, and

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.150
now the slope is 1/2.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.230
The slope looks like this.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.120
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.510
The slope looks-- or the line
looks something like that.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.170
And what's the
relationship here?

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.060
I mean, you know, these look
kind of related, it looks

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.080
like they're reflected
about something.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.990
It'll be a little bit more
clear what they're reflected

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.530
about if we draw the
line y is equal to x.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.250
So the line y equals
x looks like that.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.420
I'll do it as a dotted line.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.620
And you could see, you have
the function and its inverse,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.780
they're reflected about
the line y is equal to x.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.100
And hopefully, that
makes sense here.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.330
Because over here, on
this line, let's take

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.530
an easy example.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:49.610
Our function, when you take
0-- so f of 0 is equal to 4.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.130
Our function is mapping 0 to 4.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:08:00.050
The inverse function, if
you take f inverse of 4, f

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.920
inverse of 4 is equal to 0.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.120
Or the inverse function is
mapping us from 4 to 0.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.210
Which is exactly
what we expected.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.720
The function takes us from the
x to the y world, and then we

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.240
swap it, we were swapping
the x and the y.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.060
We would take the inverse.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.055
And that's why it's reflected
around y equals x.

00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:24.030
So this example that I just
showed you right here, function

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:30.070
takes you from 0 to 4-- maybe I
should do that in the function

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:35.810
color-- so the function takes
you from 0 to 4, that's the

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.680
function f of 0 is 4, you see
that right there, so it goes

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.550
from 0 to 4, and then
the inverse takes us

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.830
back from 4 to 0.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.380
So f inverse takes us
back from 4 to 0.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.430
You saw that right there.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.750
When you evaluate 4 here,
1/2 times 4 minus 2 is 0.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.730
The next couple of videos we'll
do a bunch of examples so you

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.180
really understand how to solve
these and are able to do

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.010
the exercises on our
application for this.
