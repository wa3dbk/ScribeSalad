00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.950
So one of the the YouTube
viewers asked me to

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:04.610
do this problem.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.970
And it looked like a
pretty good problem.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.350
So I thought I would record
a quick video on it.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.136
So the problem's this: f of g
of x -- hope I get this right

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:23.790
-- is equal to 2 times the
square root of x squared plus

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:32.650
1 minus 1, all of that
over the square root of x

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.760
squared plus 1 plus 1.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:47.970
And f of x is equal to 2x
minus 1 over x plus 1.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.890
And the question is, if we know
that f of g of x is equal to

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.560
this fairly complex-looking
expression, and that f of x is

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.980
equal to this, than
what is g of x?

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.530
Well, we could actually
do this problem by kind

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.850
of just looking at it.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.840
Because f of g of x, what we do
is, we took -- everywhere we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.220
see an x, we replace
it with g of x.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.750
So, f of g of x would
look like this.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.230
And I'll do it in
another color.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.400
So, let's see. f of g of x.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.690
And let's say we don't
know what g of x is.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.360
Would be like this.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.500
Everywhere where we saw an x,
we replace it with g of x.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.610
Because -- so it would
be 2 times g of x.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.250
Minus 1 over g of x plus 1.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.250
And we also know that f of g
of x is equal to this thing.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.870
Right?

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.450
Here we just took the g of x
and put it in of f of x, and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.320
we wrote the g of x
in the expression.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.120
But we know that that is equal
to this expression up here.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.910
So that is also equal to 2
times the square root of x

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.870
squared plus 1, minus
1, all of that over x

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.900
squared plus 1 plus 1.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.340
And I think, now, at this
point, you can kind

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.965
of pattern match.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:13.430
And you can see what g of x is.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.600
2 times something
minus 1, right?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.410
2 times something minus 1.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.670
2 times something minus 1 in
the numerator, and that's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.840
something plus 1 in
the denominator.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.460
And that's something plus
1 in the denominator.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.690
So in either case, we have g
of x is equal to the square

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.130
root of x squared plus 1.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.240
And, actually, in the example
he sent me, there was

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.110
a bunch of choices.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.610
And if you were given the
choices, then all you have to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.140
really do is take each of the
choices for g of x and replace

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.000
them in for x in
this expression.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.200
And then see which of those
choices for g of x ends

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.710
up with this expression.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.450
Actually, we can do it.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.160
I mean, he gave the choice
-- well, let me see.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.620
Let me delete some of this.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.390
I want to do it, let's
see if I can do it in

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.270
-- oh, there we go.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.060
Better.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.660
All right.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.930
So, I wanted you to see that
you could do the problem

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.590
even if you weren't
given any choices.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.110
But if you are given choices,
the problem actually even

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.120
becomes a little bit
more straightforward.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.390
So the choices were --
actually, I erased some of it.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.730
It was given that f of x is
2x minus 1 over x plus 1.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.000
And then they said, which of
the following is g of x.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.640
So, g of x is equal to.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.130
And they give these choices.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:59.850
a), square root of x, b),
square root of x squared plus

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.830
1, which we just figured out
was actually the answer.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.740
c), x, d), x squared.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.360
And then e), x squared plus 1.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.710
And the way you would do this
problem if, you, just by

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.670
looking at it you didn't -- the
method we just saw, saw that if

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.540
you just replaced x with square
root of x squared plus 1

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.500
everywhere, then you'd
get f of g of x.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.440
The other option is, you just
take each of these and say well

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.430
what is f of -- if you replaced
x with this term everywhere,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.990
what do you get?

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.230
Well, then you'd get 2 times
square root of x minus 1 over

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.050
the square root of x plus 1.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.090
And that's not what
we have up here.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.670
Then if you took this and you
replaced for x everywhere -- so

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.690
if you took this expression,
you replaced it for x

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.900
everywhere, then you would
get this expression.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.630
So you would know that
this would be the answer.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.680
If you just replaced x with x,
you would just get -- you would

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.820
just get this over again,
which does not equal this.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.260
So that doesn't work.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.810
If g of x was this, then f of g
of x would be -- let's see,

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.660
everywhere we see an x, you'd
put an x squared, so it

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.320
would be 2x squared minus 1
over x squared plus 1.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.980
Which does not equal this.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.530
And similarly, if g of x was
this term right here, then f of

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:32.600
g of x would be would be 2
times x squared plus 1 minus 1

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.070
over x squared plus 1 plus 1.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.150
Which you can simplify
a bit, but that still

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.600
doesn't equal this.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.890
And so this, once again, if
you're given the choices,

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.780
you just try this out.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.200
And if you replace this
expression everywhere,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.920
where you see an x, right?

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.840
Everywhere where you see an
x, and you replace it this

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.200
expression, you get these and
that's what the question,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.000
essentially, was asking us.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So, hopefully I didn't
confuse everyone too much.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.730
And hopefully this was
helpful for the viewer

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.080
who asked me to do this.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.940
I'll see you all later.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.240
Bye.
