00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.190
Write 5 and 1/4 as an
improper fraction.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.770
An improper fraction is just
a pure fraction where the

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.510
numerator is greater than
the denominator.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.270
This right here, it's
not a pure fraction.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.079
We have a whole number mixed
with a fraction, so we call

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.720
this a mixed number.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.720
So let's think about what 5 and
1/4 represents, and let me

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.400
rewrite it.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.780
So if we're talking about 5 and
1/4, and you can literally

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.860
think of this as 5 and 1/4 or 5
plus 1/4, that's what 5 and

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.760
1/4 represents.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.750
So let's think about 5.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.250
Five is 5 wholes, or if you're
thinking of pie, we could draw

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.710
literally five pies.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.250
Let me just cut up the pies
from the get go into four

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.330
pieces since we're dealing
with fourths.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.750
So let me just cut up the
pies right over here.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.050
So that's one pie right
over there.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.090
Let me copy and paste this.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.900
Copy and paste.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.040
So I have two pies, and then I
have three pies, and then I

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.990
have four pies, and then
I have five pies.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.230
So this is what the
5 represents.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.570
5 literally represents--
so let me

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.780
circle all of this together.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.110
That is the 5 part
right there.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.680
That is what 5 literally
represents.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.265
It represents five whole pies.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.170
Now, I have cut up the pies into
four pieces, so you can

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.940
imagine each piece represents
a fourth.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.700
Now, how many pieces do I
have in these five pies?

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.930
Well, I have four
pieces per pie.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.790
Let me just right it here.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:05.380
4 pieces per pie times 5 pies
is equal to 20 pieces.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.100
Or another way to think of it,
since each piece is a fourth,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.580
this is also equal to 20 times
1/4, or you could just write

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.750
this as being equal to 20/4.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.640
So we have 5 whole pies is
equal to 20 fourths.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.830
Let me write it like that.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.460
20 fourths.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.230
Or we could write it as 20/4.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.700
I've kind of done the
same thing twice.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.020
So that's what the five
pies represent.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.160
20/4 or 20 pieces, where
each piece is 1/4.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.790
Now, the 1/4 right here
represents literally one more

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.270
fourth of a pie or one more
piece of a pie, so let me draw

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.520
another pie here.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.090
So that is another pie.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.670
Cut it into four pieces.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.080
But this 1/4 only represents
one of these pieces, right?

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.750
This is one of the
four pieces.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.080
The denominator tells
us how many pieces.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.140
The 1 tells us how many of those
pieces we're dealing

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.180
with, so it's just this
one piece over here.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.550
That right there is the 1/4.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.100
Now, if we write 5 and 1/4,
we just saw that the 5

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.290
right here is 20/4.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.690
So we could rewrite this.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.440
Let me write it like this.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:44.560
5 and 1/4 can be rewritten as
the same thing as 5 plus 1/4,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.450
which is the same thing as--
we just saw that five whole

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.960
pies is the same
thing as 20/4.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.650
And to see that these are the
same thing, you literally just

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.120
divide 4 into 20.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.700
You get 5, and nothing
is left over.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.300
So 5 is the same thing as 20/4,
and then this plus 1/4

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.050
is the same thing as plus 1/4.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.350
So if I have 20 fourths and I
add one more fourth to it, how

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.380
many fourths do I have?

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.640
Well, I have 21.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.120
I have 21 fourths.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.740
Or another way of thinking about
it, this 5 is-- so this

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:27.990
right here is 20
pieces of pie.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.770
You can even count it.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.470
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.640
18, 19, 20.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.570
But a quicker way is to say,
well, we have five pies.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.960
Each of them have four pieces.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.820
5 times 4 is 20.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.020
This 1/4 right here represents
one piece plus one piece, so

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.060
total we're going to
have 21 pieces.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.150
So we have 21 pieces, where each
piece is 1/4, so we could

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.030
say we have 21 times 1/4 or
21 fourths pieces of pie.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.270
However you want to
think of it, but

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.490
we've solved the problem.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.330
We're at an improper fraction.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.850
We've written 5 and 1/4 as
an improper fraction.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.490
Now, I've gone through great
pains to give you the

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.410
intuition of what 5 and 1/4
means, but there is a fairly

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.710
straightforward process for
getting straight to the

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.960
improper fraction.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.970
Let me color code it.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:35.150
So if you have 5 and 1 over 4,
to convert it into an improper

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.020
fraction, you're going to keep
the same denominator, so

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.680
you're going to have
the over 4 there.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.220
But your numerator is going to
be your numerator of the

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.370
fraction part before.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.510
So it's going to be 1 plus your
whole number times your

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.820
denominator.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.620
So 1 plus-- or actually, let
me do it the way I tend to

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.290
think of it.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.240
What I do is I take 4 times 5.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.700
So let me write that down and
I want to color code it.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:12.830
4 times 5, and then to that,
I add this numerator.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.560
So I literally do 4 times 5 plus
1, which is-- so this is

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.530
equal to 4 times 5 is 20, plus
1 is 21, and then that's over

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.680
4, so it's 21/4.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.410
And all of this is kind of
a fast way to do it.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.910
We're literally doing the exact
same thing that we did

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.420
here in kind of a slower way.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.550
We're saying, OK, 5 wholes is
the same thing as 20 fourths,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.220
so you take 5, and I figure that
out, 5 times 4, and then

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.870
I have one more fourth there, so
4 times 5 plus 1 gives 21.
