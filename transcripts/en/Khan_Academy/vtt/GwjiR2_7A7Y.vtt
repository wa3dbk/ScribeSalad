00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.570
We're told, solve the absolute
value of 3x minus 9 is equal

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.490
to 0, and graph the solution
on a number line.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.460
So let's just rewrite the
absolute value equation.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.880
They told us that the absolute
value of 3x minus

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.950
9 is equal to 0.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.010
So we're told that the
absolute value of the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.730
something-- in this case the
something is 3x minus 9-- is

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.840
equal to 0.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.660
If I told you that the absolute
value of something is

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.580
equal to 0, I'm telling you
that something has to be

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.900
exactly 0 away from 0, or 0 away
from the origin on the

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.750
number line.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.850
So the only thing that that
something could be is 0.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.040
If I told you that the absolute
value of x is equal

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.800
to 0, you know that x has
to be equal to 0.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.720
That's the only value whose
absolute value is 0.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.480
So if I told you that the
absolute value of 3x minus 9

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.820
is 0, than we know that 3x minus
9 has to be equal to 0,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.810
and that's kind of unique about
the 0 is that, it's the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.060
only number the has a unique,
that's only the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.800
absolute value of 0.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.980
If you had, say, a 1 here, you
could say, oh well, then this

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.420
thing could be a 1
or a negative 1.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.130
But here, if you have a 0,
this thing can only be 0.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.632
So solving this equation is
fairly straightforward.

00:01:18.632 --> 00:01:22.330
If we want to isolate the 3x,
get rid of the negative 9 on

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.180
the left-hand side, we add 9 to
both sides of the equation.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.140
Add 9 to both sides
of the equation,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.460
these 9's cancel out.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.560
That's the whole point.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.460
On the left-hand side, you're
just left with 3x, and on the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.350
right-hand side, you are
just left with 9.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.230
Now we want to solve for x,
so we have 3 times x.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.390
Let's divide it by 3, because 3
times x divided by 3 is just

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.450
going to be x.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.990
But if we divide the left side
by 3, we have to divide the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.600
right side by 3.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.232
So we are left with-- these
guys cancel out.

00:01:56.232 --> 00:02:00.355
x is equal to 9 over
3, which is 3.

00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:02.210
And that's our solution.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.920
Now let's try out.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.760
Let's make sure that this
actually works.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.870
Let's substitute it back into
our original equation.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.490
So we have the absolute
value of 3 times x.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.490
Instead of x, I'll just put in
our actual answer that we got,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.670
3 times 3 minus 9 has got
to be equal to 0.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.860
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.390
3 times 3 is 9.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.020
So it's the absolute value of
9 minus 9, which is the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.130
absolute value of 0, which
is, indeed, 0.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.730
So it does, indeed, equal
0, and we are done.
