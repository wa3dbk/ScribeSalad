Good morning or evening or
whatever it is where you are,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.340
wherever you're happening
to watch this movie.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.810
Anyway, I've been requested to
do a playlist on probability,

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.630
and I think that's an excellent
idea, so I will start doing

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.670
a playlist on probability.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.110
So let's do a playlist
on probability.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.070
It's a good place to
start probability.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.870
I don't do videos on spelling.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.100
Probability: so what is it?

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.870
And I think all of us
have kind of a sense of

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.560
it, very informally.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.260
And as far as I can tell there
actually isn't a formal

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.920
definition of what
a probability is.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
There are several almost
formal competing definitions.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.370
So just in our everyday life,
you know if the weather man

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.810
says there's a 50% percent
chance of rain the next

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.490
day, he's essentially
giving a probability.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.650
He's saying that-- well,
there's a couple of ways

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.800
that you could interpret
the 50% probability.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.130
It could be that if 100% was
that he is sure there's rain

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.000
tomorrow and 0% is that he is
not sure that there's is rain

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.970
tomorrow, that 50% kind of
means well, he's kind of

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.680
neutral between those
two possibilities.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.330
So one definition could be
how strongly you believe.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.150
Actually, there's a whole
school of probability where

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.510
they view probability like
this, and it's called the

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.080
Baysian, and we'll
go into that more.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.060
Actually, when we do easy
problems, all of these things

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.330
kind of are the same thing.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.140
But later on we'll see
what the difference is.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.390
Another way of interpreting
this and this is kind of the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.360
frequentist school of thought,
is if I were to have the data

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.200
that this-- or if the weather
man had this data that he has

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.240
right now as far as where the
clouds are and what the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.910
barometer reads and where the
moon is and all of the data.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.240
Given all of the data that he
has, when he has that same

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.290
exact data hundred times,
fifty times or 50% of those

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.240
times there will be rain.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.230
So you can almost view it as,
given the data that he has, if

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.570
you had that data a hundred
times or if you were able to

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.860
run this experiment a hundred
times-- although that's very

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.820
unlikely that you would have
that exact same number

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.760
of data points.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.200
You know, whether Mars is
in the right place and the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.610
sun is flaring and all.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.840
It's very unlikely you have
those exact same-- you know,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.650
the butterfly effect.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.500
One butterfly can effect the
wind patterns across the ocean.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.120
So it's very unlikely that you
could perform that experiment a

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.130
hundred times, but what the
weather man could be saying is

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.430
well, if I did have data
identical to this, a hundred

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.410
times, 50 of those times or
50% of the time we would

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.700
have rain the next day.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:03:01.010
That's 50% of experiments with
same-- I guess you could say

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.650
measurable initial conditions--
I'm kind of doing this on the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.920
fly so don't take
this as gospel.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.670
But it I think it'll
give you the sense.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.700
With same initial conditions,
would result in rain.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.360
They're almost the same thing,
but we'll see later that this

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.700
frequentist-- I tend to view
the world kind of like this,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.310
but there are a lot of
circumstances where you

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.940
really-- it's hard to say that
you could perform that same

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.490
exact experiment over again.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.470
For example, if someone said in
2003 there's a 50% chance or

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.660
there's an 80% chance that
Saddam Hussein has weapons of

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.970
mass destruction, that I think
would-- and that would

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.520
be a probability.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.770
You know, you'd have these CIA
analysts who aren't being

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.790
influenced by their bosses
saying hey, after all the data

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.590
we see, we can't be sure, but
we think there's an 80% chance.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.650
They would be in
this camp, right?

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.870
Because you really couldn't
perform that experiment

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.610
a hundred times.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.870
There haven't been a hundred
times or a thousand times or a

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.430
large number of times where you
had that exact same set of

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.330
circumstances where you a guy
with the big mustache in the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.710
Middle East kind of giving
the run around for

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.660
weapons inspectors.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.790
Anyway, so let's move on.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.770
This is very subtle, but it
gives you the difference

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.110
between these two things.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.090
It's quite subtle, but I think
it gives you nice frame work

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.060
for what probability is.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.450
So let's just do a
little bit of notation.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.940
I actually looked it up on
Wikipedia and they had one

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.320
definition-- maybe it
wasn't Wikipedia, it was

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.290
maybe another website.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.210
And actually, I think you
do see this definition of

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.490
lot where they say the
probability-- sometimes it's

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.090
written as probability of a.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.430
Sometimes it's just
written as P of a.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.480
So the probability of a
occurring is equal to the

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:06.810
events in which a is true
over total number of events.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.130
And this, for the most part,
can be a good definition, but

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.630
I'll show you one place where
I think it's a little

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.450
bit more squirmy.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.270
So if I told you that I'm
going to flip a coin and--

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.990
actually, even better.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.930
Let's say, let's roll a dice.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.640
And let's say I say the
probability-- I'm going

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.730
straight to more
difficult things.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.670
So say the probability
of an even number.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.040
Well, let's use this
definition that they gave.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.630
Well, what's the probability
that this event is true?

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.290
Well, let's see, what are all
the numbers I could get?

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.110
I could get a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.030
This is just a normal die, it's
not one of those Dungeons

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.800
and Dragon's dice.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.850
So what are the number of
events where we get an even

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.640
number, where this is
true, where even is true?

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.390
Let's see.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.490
2, 4, 6.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.250
Those are all the situations
where we get even as true.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.070
So there are 3 where
even is true.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.110
And then, what is the
total number of events?

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.860
Well, we could get 1 of 6
numbers, so there are 6 total.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.440
And that equals 1/2.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.300
And that also
equals 50%, right?

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.770
We know how to convert
fractions to percentages.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.970
And this is right, this
is completely right.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.700
But the only time where you can
really apply this and most of

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.980
what you'll do in school and
things you can apply this, but

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.760
this assumes that all of the
events are equally

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.640
likely to occur.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.400
You could have had a dice or
a die-- I forgot how to say

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.280
the plural or the singular.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.410
You could have that situation
where maybe the six-sided is

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.340
weighted a little bit more.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.220
You know, someone's handed
it down so it's more likely

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.340
to have a 3 or something.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.780
And in that case, you wouldn't
be able to use this definition.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.520
So I'm going to modify
this definition, although

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.830
I don't know if it's
traditionally modified.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.620
This is one possible, events
in which a is true divided

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.210
by-- well, let's say,
equally probable.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.090
Equally probable events in
which a is true divided by

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:11.580
equally probable total events.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.300
So in order for this to hold
true each of these six

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.260
circumstances have to have
exact equal chance

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.110
of occurring.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.370
And we're going to do maybe
in this video, actually

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.250
probably not in this, I
only have 3 minutes left.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.830
But in this series I'll show
you situations where you we'll

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:32.160
have an unfair dice or die
or we'll have a set of

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.180
circumstances where all of--
each of the total number events

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.410
they're not equally probable.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.790
So that's why I want you
become a little bit

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.900
weary of this situation.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.800
So with that said, let's do a
couple of probability problems

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.520
that maybe give you a little
bit more intuition for--

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.460
whoops-- for what's going on
here in the world

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.900
of probability.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.070
So if I'm flipping a dice and
I said, well, what's the

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.620
probability of heads?

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.300
That's pretty easy.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.080
We could use that definition
and it's a completely

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.560
fair dice.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.330
We could use that definition
and say, well, what are the

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.800
total number of events where
I could get heads

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.680
or tails, right?

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.190
So there's 2 total events.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.490
And the probability the
getting heads, that's

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.105
one of the events.

00:08:12.105 --> 00:08:14.210
So there's a 1/2 probability.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.260
The way I like to think of it
so we don't have to use that

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.970
previous definition is, if I
were to conduct this experiment

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.260
a hundred times, what
percentage of those times am

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.410
I likely to get heads?

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.340
And then I would say, well,
there's 50% of the time

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.290
I would get heads.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.020
And the reason why, you know, I
could make a symmetry argument

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.650
that it's just as likely to go
on heads as it is to tails.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.330
There's no reason why I
would expect 51 heads or

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.224
49 nine tails, although
that could happen.

00:08:43.224 --> 00:08:44.720
But there's no reason
I could expect it.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.580
Heads and tails are
equally likely.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.670
They're just different words
for different sides of a

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.970
coin that's equally likely
to fall on either side.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:58.050
Anyway, let's say I'm going
to now flip a coin twice.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:58.790
And it's the same coin.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.040
So I'm going to flip it, and
then I'm going to pick it up,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.050
and I'm going to flip it again.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.960
And so what's the probability
that I get-- I'll

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.970
call it heads, heads.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.950
So that's the probability that
I get heads on the first flip

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.550
and then heads on
the second flip.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.870
Well, look at it this way.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.010
If on the first flip we already
know that we have a 5% chance

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.210
or 1/2 chance on the
first flip, right?

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.300
So let's think of it of the
frequentist philosophy.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.840
So if I were to do this a
hundred times, 50 of the

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.690
times I would get heads.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.340
Let's call that on
the first flip.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.790
Then of course, 50 of the
times I would get tails

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.970
on the first flip, right?

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.010
Now we're at this state of the
universe and now we do the

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.480
experiment over again.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:49.880
So of these 50 times, what
percentage of the times is

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.320
the next flip going
to be heads again?

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.850
Well, we could say it's going
to be another 50% chance, or

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.780
you could say, well, in 50
tries the first one was heads,

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.510
and then of those 50, 50%
are going to be heads again.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.270
So we get 25%.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.080
I just multiplied
these two numbers.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.910
And of course, to get heads and
then tails would be 25% chance.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.230
Heads Heads, heads tails,
and then this is tails

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.546
heads, tails heads.

00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:21.540
I'm getting confused.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.360
Tail heads is 25%.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.710
And then tails tails is 25%.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.365
Anyway, I'm rushing it
because I'm 25 seconds over.

00:10:27.365 --> 00:10:29.660
I'll continue this
in the next video.
