00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
 

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.930
What I want to do in this video
is differentiate between

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:13.520
the ideas of nucleophilicity or
how strong of a nucleophile

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.100
something is, and basicity.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.170
 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.720
The difference is at one level
subtle, but it's actually a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.800
very big difference.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.770
And I'll show you why it's kind
of confusing the first

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.780
time you learn it.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.860
When we studied Sn2 reactions,
you have a nucleophile that

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.030
has an extra electron
right here.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.200
It has a negative charge.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.510
And maybe you have
a methyl carbon.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.600
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.200
Let me draw it.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.430
Maybe you have a hydrogen
coming out.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.740
You have a hydrogen behind it.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.980
You have a hydrogen up top.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.850
Then you have a leaving group
right over there.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.570
In an Sn2 reaction, the
nucleophile will give this

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.300
electron to the carbon.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.090
The carbon has a partial
positive charge.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.460
Let me draw that.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.260
The leaving group has a partial
negative charge

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.630
because it tends to be or will
be more electronegative.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.370
So this electron is given to
this carbon right when the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.960
carbon gets that, or
simultaneously with it, this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.090
electronegative leaving group
is able to completely take

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.830
this electron away
from the carbon.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.370
Then after you are done,
it looks like this.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.910
We have our methyl carbon so the
hydrogen is in the back,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.330
hydrogen in the front,
hydrogen on top.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.150
The leaving group has left.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
It had this electron right
there, but now it also took

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.910
that magenta electron so it now
has a negative charge and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.650
the nucleophile has given this
electron right over here and

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.060
so now it is bonded
to the carbon.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.450
The whole reason I did this is
because this is acting as a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.100
nucleophile.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.139
It loves nucleuses.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.420
It's giving away its extra
electron, but it is also

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.695
acting as a Lewis base.

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:17.450
 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.620
This is a bit of a refresher.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.830
A Lewis base, which is really
the most general, or I guess

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.630
it covers the most examples of
what it means to be a base.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.410
a Lewis base means you are
an electron donor.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.370
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.700
That's exactly what's
happening here.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.170
This nucleophile is donating
an electron to the carbon.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.760
So, it's acting like
a Lewis base.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.460
So for the first time you see
that, you're like, well, why

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.310
did chemists even go through the
pain of defining something

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.220
like a nucleophile?

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.840
Why don't they just
call it a base?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.120
Why are there two different
concepts of nucleophilicity

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.100
and basicity?

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.000
The difference is that
nucleophilicity is a kinetic

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.470
concept, which means how
good is it at reacting?

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.900
How fast is it at reacting?

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.870
How little extra energy
does it need to react?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.890
When something has good
nucleophilicity,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.140
it is good it reacting.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.520
 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.830
It doesn't tell you anything
about how stable or unstable

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.680
the reactants before and after
are, It just tells you they're

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.880
good at reacting with
each other.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.435
Basicity is a thermodynamic
concept.

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:30.320
 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.910
It's telling you how stable
the reactants or

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:35.880
the products are.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:44.876
It tells you how badly something
would like to react.

00:03:44.876 --> 00:03:52.520
 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.800
For example, we saw the
situation of fluorine.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.580
Let's think about this.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.760
We saw the situation-- actually,
I should say

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.170
fluoride, so fluoride
looks like this.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.380
Seven valence electrons for
fluorine and then it swiped

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.650
one extra electron away.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.710
You get fluoride.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.470
So fluoride is reasonably
basic.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.649
It is more basic than iodide.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:28.550
 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.490
But in a protic solution--
let me write it here.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:46.080
But less nucleophilic
in protic solution.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.960
And a protic solution,
once again, has

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.290
hydrogen protons around.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.840
And the reason why this is, is
fluoride, it wants to bond

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.910
with a carbon or something else
more badly, or maybe even

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.910
a hydrogen proton.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.370
It wants to bond with it more
badly than an iodide anion.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.050
If it did, it actually will be
a stronger bond than the

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.250
iodide anion will form, that the
fluoride anion is actually

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.270
less stable in this form
than the iodide is.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.970
If it were to be able to get a
proton or give its electron

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.440
away, it will be happier, but
it's less nucleophilic.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.820
It's less good at reacting
in a protic solution.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.060
The whole reason it's less
nucleophilic is because there

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.330
are other things that are
keeping it from reacting.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.145
We saw in the video on what
makes a good nucleophile, and

00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:36.280
in the case of fluoride,
it's because it's

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.015
a very small atom.

00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:43.140
It's actually a very small ion
so it's very closely held.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.250
The electron cloud is very
tight, and so what it allows

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.570
is the hydrogens from the water
to form a very tight

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.300
shell around.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.860
These all have partial positive
charges so they're

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.790
attracted to the
negative anion.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.420
They form a very tight shell
protecting the fluoride anion,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.100
which makes it harder for it to
react in a protic solution,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.020
so it doesn't react as well.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.680
 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.180
If it was able to react, it
actually will form a stronger

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.570
bond than the iodide anion.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.760
So that's the big difference,
just so we see the

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.020
difference in trends.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.310
So basicity, it does not
matter what your actual

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.040
solvent is.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.390
It is a thermodynamic property
of the molecule or

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.250
the atom of the anion.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:44.050
So if you looked at pure
basicity, the strongest base

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.070
you see-- and I'll just
write hydroxide here.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.720
It's normally something like
sodium hydroxide or potassium

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.150
hydroxide, but when you dissolve
it in something like

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.130
water the sodium and the
hydroxide separates, and it's

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.700
really the hydroxide that acting
as a base, something

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.540
that wants to donate
electrons.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.150
So hydroxide is a much stronger
base than fluoride,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.350
which is a stronger base than
chloride, which is a stronger

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:15.850
base than bromide, which is a
stronger base than iodide.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.880
Now, if you were to look at
nucleophilicity just to see

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.220
the difference, we saw that what
the solvent is actually

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.600
matters because the solvent will
affect how good something

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.616
is at reacting.

00:07:31.616 --> 00:07:35.390
So in nucleophilicity, there's
a difference between a protic

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.960
solvent and an aprotic
solvent.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.990
In a protic solvent, the
thing that has the best

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.490
nucleophilicity is actually
iodide because it's not

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.010
hindered by these hydrogen
bonds as much.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.950
It doesn't have a tight shell.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.590
It has this big molecular cloud,
and some people think

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.090
it also has kind
of a softness.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.370
It has this polarizability
where that cloud can be pulled

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.420
towards the carbon and do
what it needs to do.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.900
So in this case, iodide is a
better nucleophile, let me

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.950
just say, than hydroxide, which
is a better nucleophile

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.320
than fluorine.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:18.090
Now, in an aprotic solution,
where all of a sudden the

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.270
interactions with the solvent
are not going to be as

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.710
significant, then
things change.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.960
In this situation,
basicity matters.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:35.600
So in an aprotic solution,
basicity and

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.039
nucleophilicity correlate.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:48.710
I'll put an asterisk here
because there's also one other

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.050
aspect of nucleophilicty that
I haven't talked about yet,

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.790
but I'll talk about
it in a second.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.640
In this type of a situation,
hydroxide will be better at

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:03.310
reacting than fluoride, which
would be better at reacting

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.160
than iodide.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:11.080
And the whole reason why in both
situations hydroxide is--

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.730
I mean, even when it can
interact with the solvent,

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.470
it's still a pretty good
nucleophile, because if you

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.700
think about hydroxide, and I
have to think about this a

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.530
lot, it has an extra electron.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.960
If you think about it, you could
imagine it's water that

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.650
took away-- let me
draw it this way.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.660
You can imagine it's water where
a proton left or where

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.750
an electron was taken from a
proton, so normally, you'd

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.860
have two pairs and now you have
a third pair right here.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.080
This oxygen has one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.970
valence electrons, one more than
neutral oxygen, so it has

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.310
a negative charge.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.220
It already has an extra electron
that gives this

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.580
negative charge, but oxygen is
also more electronegative than

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.130
hydrogen, so it's also able to
get this guy involved a little

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.370
bit anyway.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:07.010
It's a very basic molecule.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.520
So even when it might be
interfered a little bit by a

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.670
protic environment like water,
it's still a better

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.050
nucleophile than something
like fluoride.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.680
If you take the solvent out of
the picture, it's a super

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.310
strong base.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.060
It's also going to be a very,
very good nucleophile.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.250
Now, the last aspect of
nucleophilicity, remember,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.930
nucleophilicity is how good
something reacts.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:35.250
Now, let's imagine we
have something here.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.390
We have two hydroxide
molecules, right?

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.010
 

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.680
Let's say that this one is just
a straight-up hydroxide.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.590
And let's say this one over
here has all sorts of

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.950
things off of it.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:55.760
Let's say it has this
big chain of stuff.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.110
I don't know which one.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.190
Now if you were to look at these
two molecules, if you

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.210
were to try to guess which one
is going to be a better

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.820
nucleophile, you should just
remember: nucleophilicity is

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.290
how good something reacts, how
good is it getting in there

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.160
and making a reaction happen.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.910
This thing has this big molecule
all around it.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.000
It might actually make it very
hard, if you go back to this

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.200
circumstance up here, it might
make it very hard for it to

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.770
get in there.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.090
We've talked about steric
hindrance from the point of

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.040
view of the carbon, but we
haven't really talked about it

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.820
from the point of view
the nucleophile.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.270
In this nucleophile right here,
it might be hard for

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:39.050
this extra electron right
here to actually get

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.290
to the target nucleus.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.310
It will be hindered.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.870
While in this situation, it
will be much easier, even

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.220
though the group that's
reacting, this oxygen that has

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.540
a negative charge, this extra
electron, is on some level

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.600
fairly, fairly equivalent.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.120
But this one right here is
a much smaller molecule.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.930
It'll be less hindered,
easier to get in.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.320
So this'll be a better
nucleophile.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.150
 

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.960
And that's why I didn't want to
make the strong statement

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.880
that in an aprotic solution,
basicity and nucleophilicity

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.530
are completely correlated,
because nucleophilicity still

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.050
has that other element of
how hindered is it.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.720
Is it in an environment or is
it part of a molecule that

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.720
will keep it from reacting even
though it might be a very

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.420
strong base?

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.470
If it actually forms a bond,
it'll be very strong.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.830
The big thing to remember
is that they're just two

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.810
fundamentally different concepts
and that's why there

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.750
are two different
terms for them.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.850
Nucleophilicity, how good is it
at reacting, saying nothing

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.110
about how good the resulting
bond is.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.860
Basicity is how good
is the bond?

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.570
How badly does it want to react,
but it doesn't say how

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.540
good is it at reacting itself.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.040
