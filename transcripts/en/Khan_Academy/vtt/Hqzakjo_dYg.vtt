00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.340
SAL: Let's do a couple more
of these exponential decay

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.500
problems, because a lot of this
really is just practice

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.220
and being very comfortable with
the general formula, and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.270
I'll write it again.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.000
Where the amount of the element
that's decaying, that

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.760
we have at any period in time,
is equal to the amount that we

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.150
started with, times
e to the minus kt.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.660
Where the k value is specific to
any certain element with a

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.560
certain half-life, and sometimes
they don't even give

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.600
you the half-life.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.020
So let's try this interesting
situation.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.940
Let's say that I have
an element.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.890
Let me just give
you a formula.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.180
Let's say that I have some magic
element here, where its

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.560
formula is, its k value I give
to you, k is equal to minus,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.440
let me think of a-- [coughs]

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.720
Excuse me, I just had a lot of
walnuts and my throat is dry.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.530
Let's say that k is equal to,
well k, we're putting a minus

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.940
in front of it, so I'll
say the k value

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.440
is a positive 0.05.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.950
So its exponential decay formula
would be the amount

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.760
that you start off with, times
e to the minus 0.05t.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.520
My question to you is, given
this, what is the half-life of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.910
the compound that we're
talking about?

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.770
What is the half-life?

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.630
So to figure that out, we need
to figure out what t value can

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.330
we put here, so that if we start
off with whatever value

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.370
here, we end up with 1/2
of that value there.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.960
So let's do that.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.370
So we're starting off with N sub
0 This is just some value,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.410
our initial starting point.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.790
We could put 100 there.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.050
Actually, let's do that, just to
keep things less abstract.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.840
So let's say we start
with 100.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.200
I'm just picking
100 out of air.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.340
I could have left it
abstract with N.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.220
Let's say I'm starting
with 100.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.720
And I take the 100 times e to
the minus 0.05, times t.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.850
t is whatever our half-life.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.900
So after our half-life we're
going to have 1/2 of this

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.940
stuff left.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.510
So this should be equal to 50.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.500
We just solved for t.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.170
Divide both sides by 100.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.259
You get e to the minus 0.05t,
is equal to 1/2.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.265
You take the natural log
of both sides of this.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:17.960
The natural log of this, the
natural log of that.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.770
And then you get-- the natural
log of e to anything, I've

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.790
said it before, is just
the anything.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.450
So it is minus 0.05t is equal
to the natural log of 1/2.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.710
And then you get t is equal
to the natural log of 1/2,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.900
divided by minus 0.05.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.440
So let's figure out
what that is.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.490
Actually, someone just
made a comment, and I

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.820
might as well do that.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.570
I could just put this
minus up here.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.170
I could make this a plus, and
this a minus, if I just

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.110
multiply the numerator and the
denominator by negative 1.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.436
And if I want to, just to make
the calculator math a little

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:58.390
easier, if you put a minus in
front of a natural log, or any

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.730
logarithm, that's the same
thing as the log of the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.330
inverse of 2 over 0.05.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.635
It makes the calculator math
a little bit easier.

00:03:07.635 --> 00:03:08.860
The same thing.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.550
So if I do 2 natural log,
divided by 0.05,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.230
it is equal to 13.86.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.310
So when t is equal to 13.86.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.270
And I'm assuming that we're
dealing with time in years.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.070
That tends to be the convention,
although sometimes

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.580
it could be something else
and you'd always have

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.890
to convert to years.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.600
But assuming that this original
formula, where they

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.790
gave this k value 0.05, that was
with the assumption that t

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.410
is in years, and I've just
solved its half-life.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.430
I just solved that after 13.86
years, you can expect to have

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.720
1/2 of the substance left.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.840
We started with 100, we
ended up with 50.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.370
I could have started with x and
ended up with x over 2.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.140
Let's do one more of these
problems, just so that we're

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.520
really comfortable
with the formula.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:13.060
Let's say that I have something
with a half-life of,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.399
I don't know, let's say I
have it as one month.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.010
Half-life of one month.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:27.170
And after, well let's say that
I-- well let me just for the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.910
sake of time, let me make
it a little bit simpler.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.670
Let's say I just have my k value
is equal to-- I mean you

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.010
can go from half-life to a k
value, we did that in the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.480
previous video.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.140
Let's say my k value
is equal to 0.001.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.130
So my general formula is the
amount of product I have, is

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.180
equal to the amount that I
started with times e to the

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.410
minus 0.001 times t.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.590
And I gave you this, if you
have to figure it out from

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.190
half-life, I did that in the
previous video with carbon-14.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.840
But let's say this
is the formula.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:06.160
And let's say that after, I
don't know, let's say after

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:14.520
1000 years I have 500 grams of
whatever element is described.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.320
The decay formula for
whatever element is

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.710
described by this formula.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.110
How much did I start off with?

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.340
So essentially I need to figure
out N sub 0, right?

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:32.320
I'm saying that after 1000
years, so N of 1000, which is

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.330
equal to N sub naught
times e to the minus

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.720
0.001, times 1000.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.020
Right?

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.730
That's the N of 1000.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.350
And I'm saying that that's
equal to 500 grams. That

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.560
equals 500 grams. So
I just have to

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.590
solve for N sub naught.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.830
So what's the e value?

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:02.560
So if I have 0.0001 times 1000,
so this is N sub naught.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.160
This is 1/1000 of a 1000-- so
times e to the minus 1 is

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.075
equal to 500 grams. Or I could
multiply both sides by e, and

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:17.410
I have N sub naught is equal to
500e, which is about 2.71.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.280
So it's 500 times 2.71.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.460
I don't actually have e on this
calculator or at least I

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.555
don't see it.

00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:33.710
So we'll have 1,355 grams. So
it's equal to 1,355 grams, or

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.940
1.355 kilograms. That's
what I started with.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.230
So hopefully you see now.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.310
I mean, I think we've approached
this pretty much at

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.590
almost any direction that a
chemistry test or teacher

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.610
could throw the problem
at you.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.870
But you really just need to
remember this formula.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.370
And this applies to
a lot of things.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.800
Later you'll learn, you know,
when you do compound interest

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.690
in finance, the k will just be
a positive value, but it's

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.230
essentially the same formula.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.350
And there's a lot of things
that this formula actually

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.210
describes well beyond just
radioactive decay.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.330
But the simple idea is, use
information they give you to

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.690
solve for as many of these
constants as you can.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.160
And then whatever they're
asking for, solve for

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160
whatever's left over.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.550
And hopefully I've given you
enough examples of that.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.060
But let me know, I'm
happy to do more.
