00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:01.372
What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:02.566
is think about the demand curve

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.164
for two different products.

00:00:04.164 --> 00:00:05.880
So this is some laptop

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.878
that's on the market.

00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:08.370
And this, let's just say,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.371
is the cheapest car

00:00:09.371 --> 00:00:10.656
that happens to be on the market

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.583
this is actually a picture of a 1985

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:15.302
assuming this is the cheapest car on the market.

00:00:15.302 --> 00:00:17.817
So let's just think about

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.287
their hypothetical demand curves right now

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:23.002
So once again, on the vertical axis,

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.671
we're going to put price,

00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:25.417
and on the horizontal axis,

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:29.545
we put quantity,

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:30.949
and then over here

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.635
let me do it for the same thing

00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:36.160
So this is price,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.995
and this right over here is quantity.

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:42.314
And both of them satisfy the law of demand

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:44.815
if the price is really high

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:48.210
the quantity demanded is going to be really low for the laptop

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.128
and so it might be right over there

00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:51.578
and if the price is low

00:00:51.578 --> 00:00:53.588
the quantity demanded is going to increase.

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:57.426
So, the demand curve might look something like that.

00:00:57.426 --> 00:00:59.301
And it doesn't have to be a curve,

00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:00.814
or doesn't have to be a line,

00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:02.364
it could be a curve or anything like that.

00:01:02.364 --> 00:01:09.762
So that is the current demand for the laptop

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:10.839
All else equal,

00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:13.158
so we're not talking about shifting any of those other factors

00:01:13.158 --> 00:01:15.758
that we've been talking about in the last few videos.

00:01:15.758 --> 00:01:18.154
Now we can draw a similar demand curve

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:20.205
for this very cheap automobile.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.116
If the price is high,

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:24.283
very few people are going to want to buy it,

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.451
and I'm not going to specify what the price is,

00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:27.583
but this is a general idea

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:28.956
if the price is higher,

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.317
fewer people are going to want to buy it

00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:31.782
If the price is lower,

00:01:31.782 --> 00:01:33.025
more people are going to want to buy it

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:36.195
So this demand curve will also have the same shape

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.024
from the top left to the bottom right

00:01:38.024 --> 00:01:40.895
it satisfies the law of demand.

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:46.037
So once again, that is the current demand.

00:01:46.037 --> 00:01:47.247
Now let's think about

00:01:47.247 --> 00:01:50.809
how the demand for each of these goods might change

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:54.593
depending on changes in income.

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:57.410
So we're going to focus on the income factor

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.125
the income effect, for this video

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:02.157
and see how these 2 products might change.

00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:05.340
So let's just assume that

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.154
income in the general population goes up.

00:02:10.154 --> 00:02:12.816
So for something like a laptop, wow,

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:14.085
if more people are making more money

00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:16.149
especially in real terms

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:17.989
they have more money to spend well

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:18.489
for any given price point,

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.973
at any given price point,

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:25.299
there's going to be a higher quantity

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.075
that's demanded.

00:02:26.075 --> 00:02:26.741
At any given price point,

00:02:26.741 --> 00:02:30.227
higher quantity demanded.

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:33.389
And so if income goes up for this laptop,

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.947
the demand will increase.

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.401
And the way we show demand increasing

00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:39.933
is the whole curve shifts to the right

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.819
so this right over here demand increased

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.276
demand went up when income went up.

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:48.266
And this makes complete sense

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:49.768
and if income were to go down,

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:51.316
demand would go down

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:52.787
because people would have less money

00:02:52.787 --> 00:02:54.795
to buy something like a laptop.

00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:56.173
And this is the case for most goods

00:02:56.173 --> 00:02:57.897
we call things like this,

00:02:57.897 --> 00:02:59.580
when income goes up, demand goes up,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.053
whole curve shifts to the right

00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:02.879
income goes down, demand goes down,

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.299
whole curve shifts to the left

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.504
We call this a normal good.

00:03:06.504 --> 00:03:11.650
So this right over here is a normal good.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.787
Now let's think about

00:03:12.787 --> 00:03:16.730
what happens with the cheapest car on the market.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.687
And let's assume we're in a developed country

00:03:18.687 --> 00:03:21.788
where almost everyone has some form of a car.

00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:25.427
Now, what happens when income goes up?

00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:27.673
So people have more money

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:29.545
but are they going to spend that money

00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:31.766
buying the cheapest car on the market?

00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:35.172
Well, in most cases, if income goes up generally,

00:03:35.172 --> 00:03:36.631
people say, well I have a little bit more money,

00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:39.254
maybe I'll buy a slightly nicer car.

00:03:39.254 --> 00:03:40.876
So, and maybe in particular

00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:42.892
the people who were going to buy this car

00:03:42.892 --> 00:03:44.176
at any given price point

00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:45.661
So this price point,

00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:47.507
the people who were going to buy the car will say

00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:49.738
Wait! I can now afford a better car!

00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:51.131
Why should I you know,

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.181
this is not safe

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:53.939
maybe or not as safe as the other cars,

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.269
and I want to impress my friends

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.352
from high school and all that,

00:03:57.352 --> 00:04:00.527
so something very strange might happen for this car,

00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:02.195
the demand for this car.

00:04:02.195 --> 00:04:04.493
It actually will decrease

00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:11.330
so the whole curve could shift to the left.

00:04:11.361 --> 00:04:14.338
So income is a very strange thing for this good

00:04:14.338 --> 00:04:16.337
because income increasing maybe people say,

00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:17.355
hey you know what,

00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:18.162
I could trade out of this good

00:04:18.162 --> 00:04:19.246
I could get a good that

00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:23.282
I'd rather have than just getting more of this thing right over here

00:04:23.282 --> 00:04:24.733
Demand went down.

00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:30.804
And goods like this, we call them inferior goods.

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.317
And the general way to think about

00:04:32.317 --> 00:04:33.558
inferior goods are the goods

00:04:33.558 --> 00:04:36.876
that people will want to not own if they had more money

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:39.687
they would want to buy, I guess, less inferior goods.

00:04:39.687 --> 00:04:41.541
Or another way to think about it is,

00:04:41.541 --> 00:04:45.057
if income were to go down,

00:04:45.057 --> 00:04:46.603
and more people are budget strapped

00:04:46.603 --> 00:04:47.838
and they can't afford

00:04:47.838 --> 00:04:49.692
the Mercedes-Benz or the BMW

00:04:49.692 --> 00:04:51.654
or even the mid-sized sedan anymore,

00:04:51.654 --> 00:04:52.938
so if income were to go down

00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:54.330
and things were getting tighter,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.269
more people would want this car

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:57.468
more people would have to trade down to this

00:04:57.468 --> 00:04:59.591
because they're strapped,

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:00.855
they're tightening their belts

00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:04.072
and so you'll have this strange situation

00:05:04.072 --> 00:05:06.451
where if income goes down,

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:09.009
demand would go up for this thing

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.198
So income goes down,

00:05:12.198 --> 00:05:13.541
demand goes up.

00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:15.161
Remember, we're talking about demand,

00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:17.172
we're talking about the entire shifting of the curve.

00:05:17.172 --> 00:05:18.818
At any given price point,

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.395
the quantity demanded will go up.

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:23.850
Because, this is, or we're assuming,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.207
is the cheapest car on the market.

00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:28.641
So, and likewise,

00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:30.215
if income were to go down for a normal good,

00:05:30.215 --> 00:05:31.297
it'll do what you'll expect,

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:32.524
demand would go down.

00:05:32.524 --> 00:05:33.644
So this, an inferior good,

00:05:33.644 --> 00:05:35.761
does the opposite of a normal good

00:05:35.761 --> 00:05:40.678
when we're talking about the income effect,

00:05:40.678 --> 00:05:44.272
the inferior good will do the opposite of a normal good

00:05:44.272 --> 00:05:46.280
and that's because people want to trade out of it

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.415
when their income goes up

00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:48.642
or they don't want to buy it

00:05:48.642 --> 00:05:49.961
or they want to buy something nicer.

00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:50.923
And when their income goes down,

00:05:50.923 --> 00:05:51.453
they'll say

00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:52.215
I have to buy this thing,

00:05:52.215 --> 00:05:55.123
so you know, let me just do it.
