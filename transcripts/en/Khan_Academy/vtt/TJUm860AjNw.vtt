00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.590
Let's see if we can get the
molecular structure for

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.840
butylcyclopentane.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.980
So you just break this up the
way we've done it in the last

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.970
several videos, the suffix is
-ane, so it is an alkane, all

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.430
single bonds.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.010
So single bonds.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.930
It's pentane, so we're dealing
with five carbons on the base,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.422
or on the backbone.

00:00:31.422 --> 00:00:35.360
So this is five carbons and it's
a cyclopentane, so it's

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.560
five carbons in a ring.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.360
So its five-carbon ring is the
backbone, and then we have a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.180
butyl group added to that
five-carbon ring.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.630
Now, you might say, hey, Sal,
how do I know which

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.940
carbon to add it to?

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.330
When you're dealing with a ring
and you only have one

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.590
group on the ring, it
doesn't matter.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.640
Let me just show you
what I mean.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.140
So let's draw the five-carbon
ring.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.280
Let's draw the cyclopentane.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.630
So it'll just be a pentagon,
so one, two, three, four,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.900
five, and it's a ring, so
you can connect them.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.120
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.580
Now, it doesn't matter where
I draw the butyl group.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.060
It's all symmetric
around there.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.710
We just have a ring and it's
connected to a butyl group at

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.200
some point.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.410
It'll start to matter once we
add more than one group.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.660
So we can just pick any of
these carbons to add

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.890
the butyl group to.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.450
Now, just as a review, the but-
prefix, that refers to,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.520
remember, methyl, ethyl,
propyl, or meth-,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.970
eth-, prop-, but-.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.800
This is four carbons.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.780
This is a four-carbon
alkyl group.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.110
So let me just add it here.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.760
I could have added it to any of
these carbons around this

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.870
cyclopentane ring.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.960
So if I just add it right here,
so I'm going to have

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.810
four carbons.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.170
So one, two, three, four.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.290
That is the butyl part
of this whole thing.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.120
And then let me just
attach them up.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.170
So you might be tempted to just
draw this right there.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.640
And actually, this
would be right.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.500
This is butylcyclopentane.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.390
But a question might arise.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.030
I just happened to connect the
cyclopentane to the butyl at

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.150
this first carbon on the
butyl right there.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.080
I could have just as easily
done it like this.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.570
I could have just as easily had
it like this, where-- let

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.540
me draw my butyl again, so I
have one, two, three, four.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.370
So, once again, this is a butyl,
but instead of being

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.380
bonded to the cyclopentane on
my first carbon, maybe it's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.490
bonded right here.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.570
Let me do it with that
yellow color.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.240
Maybe it's bonded right here.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.150
This seems like maybe
this could also be

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.630
butylcyclopentane.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.440
It looks like we have
a butyl group.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.700
This is a butyl right here.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.840
I drew a butyl group right over
here, and I also drew a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.260
butyl group right over here.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.470
But these are fundamentally
two different molecular

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.000
structures.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.430
I'm touching the first
carbon here.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.850
I'm touching the second
carbon over here.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.770
Now, there's two ways to
differentiate this.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.760
One is the common naming and one
is the systematic naming.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.650
So let me differentiate
between the two.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.860
So in the common naming, and
this can get a little bit

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.930
involved, and this frankly is
probably the most complicated

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.020
part of naming organic
compounds.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.540
Systematic is often more
complicated, but it's easier

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.720
to systematically
come up with it.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.075
So there's a common and then
there's a systematic.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.440
So the common way of doing
it is, if you just say

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.020
butylcyclopentane, that implies
that you are bonding

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.230
to the first or, depending on
how you view it, the last

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.070
carbon in the chain.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.940
So this right here is
butylcyclopentane.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.170
This right here is not just
butylcyclopentane.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.110
What you would do is you
definitely have a cyclopentane

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.360
ring, so this would definitely
be a cyclopentane.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.620
Let me put some space here.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.320
This is definitely going
to be a cyclopentane.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.690
And you do have a butyl group
on it, so we do have a butyl

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.880
group, but because we are
bonded-- we aren't bonded to

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.490
the first carbon.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.529
We're bonded to a carbon
that is bonded

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.829
to two other carbons.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.810
We call this

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.550
sec-butylcyclopentane, so this is sec-.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.960
And everything I'm doing
is obviously free-hand.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.120
If you were to see this in
a book, the sec- would be

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.370
italicized, or sometimes
it would be written as

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.620
s-butylcyclopentane.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.970
And this sec- means that we have
attached to a carbon that

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.440
is touching two other carbons.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.090
So you look at the butyl group,
and say, well, which of

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.270
these carbons is attached
to two others?

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.740
It's either that one
or that one.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.830
And regardless of whether you're
attached to this or

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.680
this, if you think about it,
it's fundamentally the same

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.050
molecular structure.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.920
So that's what you do when
you're attached to that guy

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.460
right over there.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.400
But what about the situation
where we're dealing with just

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.840
the common names right here?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.960
What about the situation where
it looks like this?

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.430
So we have our cyclopentane
right there, and we have a-- I

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.960
guess we could call
it a butyl group.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.040
It'll have four carbons in it,
but let's say that the four

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.780
carbons look something
like this.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.190
Let's say there are four
carbons, so we have one, two,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.040
three, four carbons and
we're bonded to this

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.930
one right over here.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.260
So whenever you're bonded to
one end of the four-carbon

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.860
group and it branches off at the
other end, and it seems a

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.660
little complicated, this only
deals for alkyl groups below

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.290
five or six carbons, this we
call an isobutyl group.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.370
So let me write this down.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.920
So this right here, is
sec-butyl, or s-butyl

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.100
sometimes for short.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.750
This right here, this right
there is iso-butyl.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.030
It's actually-- iso- that
is an iso-butyl group.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.710
And then the last thing to
worry about when you're

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.020
dealing with butyl groups
is something like this.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.350
Let me draw it.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.160
So you could also draw four
carbons like this.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.910
You have one carbon,
two, three, four.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.200
One, two, three, four carbons
and you're attached over here.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.160
Now this naming, this group
right here-- and you're going

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.800
see the systematic
naming is much

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.480
easier for these compounds.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.350
This group right here, over
here the carbon you're

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.920
attached to is attached
to two other

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.410
carbons, so it is sec-butyl.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.820
When you're attached to three
carbons, it is t-butyl, or

00:06:52.820 --> 00:07:00.390
tert-butyl, so this right here
is a tert-butyl group, or

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.170
sometimes called a t-butyl.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.630
And I really want you
to understand

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.200
the difference here.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.000
The common naming, it's easier
to say and easier to spell,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.560
but it's sometimes a
little confusing.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.390
This is just straight up butyl
so you would call this

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.380
butylcyclopentane.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.110
This is sec-butyl, because
you have this guy

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.670
connected to two carbons.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.210
That's where the sec-
comes from.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.290
Sometimes it'll be s-butyl.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.570
So this could be called
sec-butylcyclopentane or

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.500
s-butylcyclopentane.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.660
This, because we're attached
to the end away from this

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.240
branching off, is still a butyl
group, since we have

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.670
four carbons.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.650
But since we're attached here,
this is iso-butyl, so this is

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.770
iso-butylcyclopentane,

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.350
And then finally, since the
carbon we're attaching to is

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.730
attached to one, two, three
other carbons, it is a

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.750
tert-butyl or a t-butyl group.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.070
So this is t-butylcyclopentane.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.630
That's the common naming.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.890
So maybe I should clear out
systematic here just so it's

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.410
clear to you that everything
we've done

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.820
here is common naming.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.675
So let me write it down.

00:08:05.675 --> 00:08:08.670
It won't hurt to write them down
again because the more

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.490
familiar you are with
these, the better.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.740
So this is just
butylcyclopentane.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.410
This is s- or sec-
butylcyclopentane.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.330
And this is
iso-butylcyclopentane.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.990
I'm going off the screen here.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.230
And then finally, this
is tert-butyl, or

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.480
t-butylcyclopentane.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.100
Now, I said these are
the common naming.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.900
What are the systematic
naming?

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.080
Well, in the systematic, this
is still butylcyclopentane.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.240
So let me write this down.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:01.110
Systematic, this is still

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.940
butylcyclopentane, which makes sense.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.850
This is very clearly
a cyclopentane.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.040
This is very clearly
a butyl group.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.120
But in the systematic naming,
what we try to do is we try to

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.900
name this group right here
just as we would name a

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.600
traditional chain, but we
ended it with an -yl.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.760
So if you look at this right
here, what we do is we just

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.180
consider the chain
where we attach.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.730
We attached over here, so the
longest chain from that point

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.600
is there and there.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.540
So if you look at it like that,
it looks like you have

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.550
one, two, three carbons, and you
have one carbon attached

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.220
on the beginning.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.870
So this little group right here
in the systematic naming,

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.890
this looks like a
one, two, three.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.520
Three carbons, that's the prop-
prefix, so we're dealing

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.910
with a prop-, and it's all going
to be one group, so it's

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.840
a propyl group.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.330
This is a propyl group, but it
has a methyl-- remember, meth-

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.500
is one carbon.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.870
It has a methyl group attached
on the first carbon.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.435
So this is 1-methylpropyl.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.130
Now, that describes
just the group.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.970
1-methylpropyl describes just
this part right here.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.870
That describes just that
right over there.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.120
And then to have the whole
compound, to describe the

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.550
whole compound, you put this in
parentheses, so this is the

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.180
systematic naming.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.040
So 1-methyl-- I put
an L there.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.490
Let me do it in the
same color.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.550
1-methyl, because
you're starting

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.850
where you're attaching.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.810
So 1-methyl, you have a methyl
group right there on that

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.420
first carbon.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.600
It's a propyl chain.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.800
One, two, three, propyl,
and then you would say

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.050
cyclopentane.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.540
That's the systematic
name for that.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.200
Now if you look at this one
right here, and the common

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.650
name is iso-butyl, what
you do is you

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.520
look at where we attach.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.110
Where we attached is one,
two, three carbons.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.940
So once again, I'm doing that
same one, two, three carbons.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.260
So once again, this
is a propyl.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.210
Prop- is for three, but with a
methyl group now is attached

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:23.370
to the one, two, the
second carbon.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.330
So this is 2-methyl.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.460
Let me make some space here.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.710
This is 2-methyl.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.500
So that describes this
group right here.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.640
That describes this entire
group cyclopentane.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.490
Remember, this is a
systematic name.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.230
You might sometimes see
this referred to as

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.430
iso-butylcyclopentane or
2-methylpropylcyclopentane.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.890
And this is actually a -yl.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.530
I spelled it wrong.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.690
And then finally, we do the same
exact idea here, but it

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.510
becomes a little bit
more interesting.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.520
Over here, we are attached to
this carbon and the longest

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.190
chain I can do starting with
that carbon is just one chain

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.730
right there.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.640
So we just have a two-carbon
chain, right?

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.630
One, two.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.360
The prefix for a two carbon
is ethyl, or eth-.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.640
Eth-, and since it's
a group, ethyl.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:22.970
And then we have two methyl
groups attached right over

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.750
there, and it's attached on
the one carbon, right?

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.180
This is one and this is two.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.560
We call the one carbon
where we are attached

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.910
to the broader chain.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.080
So what this is going to be, you
would actually write one

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.960
comma one to show that we have
two groups attached to the

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.050
first carbon and both
of them are methyl.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.975
So we write 1,1-dimethyl,
di- for two, dimethyl.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.680
So this entire group right here,
which we also called

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.990
t-butyl, in systematic
naming is 1,1-.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.020
We have two groups attached
to this first carbon.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.270
1,1-dimethylethyl.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.720
That's this whole thing.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.580
This is the ethyl, and then we
have two methyls attached

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.930
there. that's why
we write 1,1-.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:04.940
They're both attached
to the one.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.320
We have two of them.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.290
That's why we wrote
di- over there.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.135
So it's 1,1-dimethylethyl- and
then finally, cyclopentane.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.750
So hopefully, that doesn't
confuse you too much.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.640
I think if you watch the video
over and over and try to

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.900
practice it with your own
problems, you'll see that the

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.530
systematic name way is actually

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.770
pretty, pretty logical.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.570
And actually, if you have more
than five or six carbons in

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.460
the group, they always or they
tend to always use the

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.710
systematic naming.
