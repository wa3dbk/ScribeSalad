00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.200
In the last video, we
did problem 65,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.470
and we got the answer.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.750
And we did it in kind of an
intuitive way, but if it was a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.390
slightly harder problem, it
would've gotten a little more

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.820
complicated, so I really wanted
to show you how you can

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.090
do it with the binomial theorem
as well, or at least

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.030
with binomial coefficients, and
then we can try to see how

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.070
they relate to each other,
that they're

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.270
actually the same thing.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.780
I realized that I should do
this, because I'm looking at

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.320
the next couple of questions,
and they all deal with the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.450
binomial coefficient.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.620
So I figured I might as well do
it the binomial way because

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.130
that's probably what
the California

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.400
Standards want you to do.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.330
And it's a good way.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.230
It's good to be able to do it
intuitively and with the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.030
binomial coefficients and
understand how they're the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.020
same thing.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.050
So reading the same problem,
Teresa and Julia are among 10

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.580
students who have applied
for a trip to D.C.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.390
Two students from the group
will be selected at

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.890
random for the trip.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.790
What is probability that Teresa
and Julia will be the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.200
two students selected?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.160
So the way we did it last time,
we said, OK, we could

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.720
pick Julia first, and there's a
1 in 10 chance, and then we

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.240
would pick Teresa, and that's
a 1 in 9 chance.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.910
Or we could go the other way
around, so it would be 2 times

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.960
1/10 times 1/9.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.930
2, because there's two different
ways to pick the

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.240
people, and then for each of
those ways, there's a 1 in 10

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.380
chance of picking the first
person and then a 1 in 9 for

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.020
the second.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.310
That was the intuitive way we
did that in the last video.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.860
The way you would do it with
the binomial coefficient is

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.980
you'd say, OK, I have 10 items,
10 students in this

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.640
case, and I'm going to
choose two of them.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.340
And people will often read
this as 10 choose 2.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.570
And it's useful to memorize to
some degree what this means.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.500
This means 10 factorial
over 2 factorial

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.750
times 10 minus 2 factorial.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.970
And so that is equal to-- and
I'll give you in a second what

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.560
the intuition is.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.480
That's equal to 10
factorial over 2

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.230
factorial times 8 factorial.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.480
And at first, you might say, oh,
my God, 10 factorial is a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.140
huge number.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.440
It's going to take me forever
to multiply that out, until

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.870
you realize that you're dividing
it by 8 factorial.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.240
So 10 factorial, that's the same
thing as 10 times 9 times

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.670
8 times 7, and you keep going.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.540
But 8 factorial is 8 times
7 times 6 and so

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.310
forth and so on.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.160
So the 8 factorial, if you
divide into 10 factorial,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.050
that's going to cancel
out with that.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.520
And you're just left
with 10 times 9.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.590
So if you have to say, how many
different ways can you

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.730
pick 2 people out of 10?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.800
You then get 10 times 9, which
is 90, divided by 2 factorial,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.610
which is 2 times 1, so you say
there's 45 different ways to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.070
pick 2 people.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.320
So the chances that I pick one
of those ways, pick Julia and

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.490
Teresa, is 1 out of 45.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.270
There are 45 combinations of
picking 2 people out of 10.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.900
So the chances of picking
any one of those

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.260
combinations is 1 out of 45.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.420
So you get to the same answer.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.240
And just to get the intuition,
this thing boils down

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.990
to-- we just saw.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.660
It boils down to 10 times
9 over 2 factorial.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.090
And if you just want the
intuition, there's 10 ways to

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.390
pick the first person, there's
9 ways to pick the second

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.500
person, and then there's 2 ways,
or 2 factorial ways,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.300
that you could have picked
one person and

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.050
then another person.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.960
So it's the same intuition
as this.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.890
But if you just wanted to kind
of plug and chug and get the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.650
answer, you say, oh,
10 choose 2.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.453
That gives me the answer.

00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:28.220
I have 10 things.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.870
I need to choose 2.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.410
That gives me 45 different
combinations and I want only

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.380
one of them.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.660
So that's 1 out of 45.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.270
Next question.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.340
Let me see.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.250
Scroll up.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.060
All right.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.410
And when I saw this, I said, oh,
they definitely want us to

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.010
deal with binomial
coefficients.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.020
And I'll show you two ways how
to do this problem, too.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.100
So this one says 3y minus
1 to the fourth power.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.590
And you can multiply it out just
using regular algebraic

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.640
multiplication, polynomial
multiplication.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.590
It will take you some
time and you might

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.790
make a careless mistake.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.270
I'm guessing they want us to
use the binomial theorem.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.880
And the binomial expansion
of this-- I'll use that

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.180
combinatorics or that binomial
coefficient notation.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.510
I think you'll get
the pattern.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.870
And I've done several videos on
this where I explain deeper

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.760
why it works and all of that.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.480
But it equals 4 choose 0 times
the first term to the fourth

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:33.670
power, 3y to the fourth, times
the second term to the 0th

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.030
power, so you don't
include it.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.620
That's times 1.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.790
Anything to the 0th power is 1.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.440
Fine.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:45.820
Plus 4 choose 1 times the first
term, so that's 3y to

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.880
the third power-- I'm just
decrementing it on each term--

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.880
Times the second term to the
first power, so times negative

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.130
1 to the first power.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.170
And, in general, if you want
to know what should this

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.390
exponent be, it's going to
be whatever is here.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.780
So this one is the
same as that.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.180
So here we had a 0, so negative
1 to the 0, I didn't

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.560
even take the trouble
to write that down.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.490
Let me just keep going.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.070
I'll switch colors.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.210
So the next term, you could
probably pause it and guess

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.110
it, is going to be 4 choose 2.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.825
And I know you're wondering
well, what is this 4 choose 1

00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:18.510
and 4 choose 2?

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.280
Well, we saw it in the last
problem, but I'll calculate

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.680
them in a second.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:32.290
That's going to be 3y squared
times negative 1 squared.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.330
And we have two more terms.
Plus 4 choose 3

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.450
times 3y to the 1.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.020
And just so you know, the
exponents of these two should

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.000
always add up to 4.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.940
So you have 4 and 0, you
have 3 and 1, 2 and 2.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.790
So in this case, you have
times negative 1 to the

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:59.380
third-- and this 3 is that 3--
plus 4 choose 4 times negative

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.630
1 to the fourth power.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.550
So what do each of these
binomial coefficients equal?

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.060
4 choose 0, that is equal to--
I'll do it in yellow.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.190
That's equal to 4 factorial over
0 factorial, which, you

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.570
may or may not know, is defined
to be 1, over 0

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.310
factorial divided by 4
minus 0 factorial.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.790
And so that just turns
into 1, right?

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.890
4 minus 0 is 4.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.530
So you get 4 factorial
over factorial.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.700
So this is equal to 1.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.440
So let me write it out.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.520
So 3y the fourth.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.340
3 to the fourth power is what?

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.200
It's 81.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.080
So we get 81 y to the fourth.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.640
All right.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.890
Next term.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.220
Well, the first thing that you
see is you have this negative

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.170
1 to the first power.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.610
This negative 1 is just going
to keep flipping the sign.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.820
So negative 1 to the first
power, that's just going to

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.370
make this whole term negative
and then we can

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.170
ignore it from there.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.790
So we're going to get a negative
there because of this

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.055
negative 1 to the first power.

00:07:00.055 --> 00:07:02.030
And what's 4 choose 1?

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.860
So that's 4 factorial over 1
factorial, which is also 1,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.470
divided by 4 minus
1 factorial.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.010
So that's 4 factorial
over 3 factorial.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.420
So it's 4 times 3 times
2 times 1 divided by 3

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.880
times 2 times 1.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.190
So that just equals 4.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.300
Try it out if you don't
believe me.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.010
4 times 3 times 2 times 1
divided by 3 times 2 times 1,

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.780
you're just left with a 4.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.270
So you get 4.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.820
This coefficient becomes 4.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.230
But it's 4 times 3 to
the third power.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.690
So maybe I'll just write it.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:45.060
The binomial coefficient is
4 times 27y to the third.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.430
And we already took care
of the negative 1.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.900
Negative 1 to the first
power is negative 1.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.500
And that's why I put
the negative there.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.100
So the next term.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.790
We have a negative 1 to the
second power, so it's going to

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:53.710
be a positive.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.370
This is going to
turn into a 1.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.680
That turns into a 1.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.750
So it's plus-- what's
4 choose 2?

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.570
4 choose 2 is-- I'm already
running out of space.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.460
I'll write it up here.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.370
It's 4 factorial over
2 factorial

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.830
times 4 minus 2 factorial.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.460
4 minus 2 factorial, that's
also 2 factorial.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.520
So it's equal to 4 times 3 times
2 times 1 divided by 2

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.440
factorial is 2 and
2 factorial is 2.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.080
Let's say this 2 cancels
out with that 2.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.120
This 2 cancels-- let's see, if
you cancel out that 2, that

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.470
becomes a 2.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.090
So you get 2 times 3
just becomes a 6.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.350
So that third term
just becomes a 6.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.840
4 choose 2 is 6.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.440
I know this is messy.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.810
So you have a plus 6
times 3y squared.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.040
So 9 times 9y squared.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.110
And we could go keep going.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.320
And actually, the binomial
coefficient, the next one's

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.400
going to be a 4, and it's
negative 1 to the third, so

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.260
it's going to be a minus
4 times 3y to the 1.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.650
I mean, we could keep going.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.660
Actually, let's just
keep going.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.670
So the next term, 4 choose 3,
I'll leave that for you to

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.890
calculate it, but I already know
that since we're kind of

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.790
past the middle point, the
binomial coefficient is going

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.020
to be the same as 4 choose 1.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.005
So it's going to be a 4 and we
have a minus 1 to the third,

00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:19.750
so this is minus 1.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:26.890
So it's minus 4 times 3y
to the 1, so times 3y.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.020
And then we have
the last term.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.120
4 choose 4-- you could calculate
it using this

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.660
formula, but that turns out to
be 1 as well-- plus 1 times

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.580
negative 1 to the fourth,
so that's just plus 1.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.010
And let's see what
this is equal to.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:39.980
Let's see if we can
simplify it.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:45.740
This is equal to 81y to the
fourth minus-- let's see, 4

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.600
times 20 is 80, 4 times
7 is 28, so it'd be

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.930
108, 108y to the third.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.930
6 times 9 is 54, so
plus 54y squared.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.610
Minus 12y plus 1.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.750
And if we look at the choices,
only choice A

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.400
is the right answer.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.990
And actually, we could have
figured out it was choice A

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.730
just by going one term deep,
because that's where all of

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.130
the choices- became different,
so we could have

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.420
saved a lot of work.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.240
Another option: Instead of
evaluating each of the

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.970
binomial coefficients, another
option would have been to do a

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:32.910
Pascal's triangle, where you
say, OK, if I have a plus b to

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.880
the first power, the
coefficients are 1 and 1,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.500
right, 1a plus 1b.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.170
If I take it to the second
power, a plus b squared, the

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.430
coefficients become
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.440
You bring down a
1 both places.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.520
And that makes sense because a
plus b squared is 1a squared

00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:00.930
plus 2ab plus 1b squared.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.240
And then we could
have kept going.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.360
This would have been
to the third power.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.480
You had a 1, a 3, a 3 and a 1.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.630
And then the fourth power is
what this problem was about.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.860
So you get a 1, you get a 4.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.030
3 plus 3 is 6.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.180
3 plus 1 is 4, and
you get a 1.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.460
And so these would be the
coefficients, and in this

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:27.070
case, we were doing 3y minus
1 to the fourth power.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.460
If we had just drawn this out
really fast, we would have

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:39.730
said, well, this becomes 1 times
3y to the fourth plus 4

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:45.160
times 3y to the third-- I just
keep decrementing the 3y--

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:52.510
times negative 1 to the 1 plus
6 times 3y squared--

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.340
this 6 is this one.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.790
I'm getting a little
misaligned-- 3y squared times

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.700
negative 1 squared.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.230
So every time I increment the
power on negative 1 and I

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.840
decrement the power on 3y.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.240
And then plus 4.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.410
Now I'm at this one.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:15.010
Plus 4 times 3y negative
1 to the third.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:23.270
And then finally plus 1 times
3y to the 0 is just 1 times

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.270
negative 1 to the the
fourth power.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.720
And I would have evaluated it.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.100
And that might have been
a slightly faster

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.630
way of doing it.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.130
But I wanted to do this a
couple of different ways

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.360
because I think the binomial
theorem and binomial expansion

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.520
is something that people forget,
and it's important to

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.170
kind of have the neurons make a
lot of cross-connections so

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.590
that you don't forget it when
you're 30 years old.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.040
Anyway, this was the least
number of problems I've done

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.670
in a video, but I think
it was worth it.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.820
I'll see you in the
next video.
