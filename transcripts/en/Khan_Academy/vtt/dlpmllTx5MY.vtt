00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.920
Welcome back.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.180
Let's continue doing projectile
motion problems. I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.380
think this video will be
especially entertaining,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.370
because I will teach you a game
that you can play with a

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.370
friend, and it's called let's
see how fast and how high I

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.110
can throw this ball.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.270
You'd be surprised--
it's actually quite

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.020
a stimulating game.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.910
Let me just write
down everything

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.100
we've learned so far.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:32.119
Change in distance is
equal to the average

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.540
velocity times time.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.170
We know that change in
velocity is equal to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.340
acceleration times time.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.600
We also know that average
velocity is equal to the final

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.800
velocity plus the initial
velocity over 2.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.400
We know the change in velocity,
of course, is equal

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.960
to the final velocity minus
the initial velocity.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.775
This should hopefully be
intuitive to you, because it's

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:02.660
just how fast you're going at
the end, minus how fast you're

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.080
going at the beginning,
divided-- oh no, no division,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.080
it's just that I got
stuck in a pattern.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.900
It's just vf minus
vi, of course.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.560
You probably already knew this
before you even stumbled upon

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.340
my videos, but-- the two
non-intuitive ones that we've

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.980
learned, they're really just
derived from what I've just

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.470
written up here.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.120
If you ever forget them, you
should try to derive them.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.130
Actually, you should try to
derive them, even if you don't

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.780
forget them, so that you
when you do forget it,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.000
you can derive it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.020
It's change in distance-- let
me change it to lowercase d,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.680
just to confuse you-- is equal
to the initial velocity times

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:52.760
time plus at squared over 2,
and that's one of what I'll

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.110
call the non-intuitive
formulas.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.600
The other one is the final
velocity squared is equal to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.200
the initial velocity
squared plus 2ad.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.090
We've derived all of these,
and I encourage you to try

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.060
rederive them.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.070
But using these two formulas
you can play my fun game of

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.630
how fast and how high did
I throw this ball?

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.890
All you need is your arm, a
ball, a stopwatch, and maybe

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.200
some friends to watch
you throw the ball.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.460
So how do we play this game?

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.110
We take a ball, and we throw
it as high as we can.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.760
We see how long does the
ball stay in the air?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.810
What do we know?

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.120
We know the time for the ball
to leave your hand, to

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.970
essentially leave the ground and
come back to the ground.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:48.240
We are given time, and
what else do we know?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.570
We know acceleration-- we know
acceleration is this minus 10

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.670
meters per second.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.130
If you're actually playing
this game for money, or

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.770
something, you would probably
want to use a more accurate

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.550
acceleration-- you could look
it up on Wikipedia.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.400
It's minus 9.81 meters
per second squared.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.680
Do we know the change
in distance?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.060
At first, you're saying-- Sal,
I don't know how high this

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.540
ball went, but we're talking
about the change in distance

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.700
over the entire time.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.430
It starts at the ground--
essentially at the ground,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.266
because I'm assuming that you're
not 100 feet tall, and

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:24.050
so you're essentially at the
ground-- so it starts at the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.610
ground, and it ends of the
ground, so the change in

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.260
distance of delta d is 0.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.180
It starts with at the ground
and ends at the ground.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.080
This is interesting-- this is a
vector quantity, because the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.880
direction matters.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.460
If I told you how far did the
ball travel, then you'd have

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.720
to look at its path, and say
how high did it go, and how

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.690
high would it come back?

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.000
Actually, if you want to be
really exact, the change in

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.930
distance would be the height
from your hand when the ball

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.880
left your hand, to the ground--
so, if you're 6 feet

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.440
tall, or 2 meters tall, the
change in distance would

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.490
actually be minus 2 meters,
but we're not going to do

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.870
that, because that would just be
too much, but you could do

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.190
it if there's ever a close call
between you and a friend,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.280
and you're betting for money.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.830
You're given these things,
and we want to figure

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.300
out a couple of things.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.410
The first thing I want to figure
out is how fast did I

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.560
throw the ball, because that's
what's interesting-- that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.800
would be a pure test
of testosterone.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.450
How fast?

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:30.470
I want to figure out vi--
vi equals question mark.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.640
Which of these formulas
can be used?

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.300
Actually, I'm going do it first
with the formulas, and

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.750
then I'm going to show you
almost an easier way to do it,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.640
where it's more intuitive.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.440
I want to show you that these
formulas can be used for fun

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.310
with your friends.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.060
We know time, we know
acceleration, we know the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.930
change in distance, so we could
just solve for vi--

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.350
let's do that.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.310
In this situation, change in
distance is 0-- let me change

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.730
colors again just to change
colors-- so change in distance

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:09.450
is 0 is equal to
vi times time.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.420
Let me put the g in for here,
so it's minus 10 meters per

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.850
second squared divided by 2,
and it's minus 5 meters per

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.720
second squared-- so it's
minus 5t squared.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.170
All I did it is that I took
minus 10 meters per second

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.400
squared for a, divided it
by 2, and that's how I

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.070
got the minus 5.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.510
If you used 9.81 or whatever,
this would be

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.610
4.905 something something.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.630
Anyway, let's get back
to the problem.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.000
If we wanted to solve this
equation for vi,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.860
what could we do?

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.900
This is pretty interesting,
because we

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.910
could factor a t out.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.700
What's cool about these physics
equations is that

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.190
everything we do actually has
kind of a real reasoning

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.590
behind it in the real world,
so let me actually flip the

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.600
sides, and factor out a t, just
to make it confusing.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:12.210
I get t times vi minus
5t is equal to 0.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.770
All I did is that I factored out
a t, and I could do this--

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.710
I didn't have to use a quadratic
equation, or factor,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.930
because there wasn't a
constant term here.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.320
So I have this expression, and
if I were to solve it,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.110
assuming that you know vi is
some positive number, I know

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.160
that there's two times where
this equation is true.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:41.810
Either t equals 0, or this term
equals 0-- vi minus 5t is

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:48.460
equal to 0, or since I'm solving
for velocity, we know

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.323
that vi is equal to 5t.

00:06:57.198 --> 00:06:58.880
That's interesting.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.070
So what does this say?

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.050
If we knew the velocity, we
could solve it the other way.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.580
We could say that t is equal to
vi divided by 5-- these are

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.370
the same things, just solving
for a different variable.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.790
But that's cool, because there
are two times when the change

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.000
in distance is zero-- at time
equals 0, of course, the

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.430
change in distance is zero,
because I haven't thrown the

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.150
ball yet, and then, at a later
time, or my initial velocity

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.530
divided by 5, it'll also
hit the ground again.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.930
Those are the two times
that the change

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:31.740
in distance is zero.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.330
That's pretty cool.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.810
This isn't just math--
everything we're doing in math

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.550
has kind of an application
in the real world.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.570
We've solved our equation--
vi is equal to 5t.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:49.150
So, if you and a friend go
outside and throw a ball, and

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.710
you try to throw it straight
up--0 although we'll learn

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.540
when we do the two dimensional
projectile motion that it

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.000
actually doesn't matter if you
have a little bit of an angle

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.340
on it, because the vertical
motion and the horizontal

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.390
motions are actually
independent, or can be viewed

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.070
as independent from each other--
this velocity you're

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.160
going to get if you play this
game is going to be just the

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.670
component of your velocity
that goes straight up.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.645
I know that might be a little
confusing, and hopefully it

00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:16.270
will make a little more sense in
a couple of videos from now

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.520
when I teach you vectors.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.940
If you were to throw this ball
straight up, and time when it

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.120
hits the ground, then this
velocity would literally the

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.990
speed-- actually, the
velocity-- at which

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.230
you throw the ball.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.410
So what would it be?

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:39.950
If I threw a ball, and it took
two seconds to go up hit the

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.400
ground, then I could
use this formula.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.890
This is actually 5
meters per second

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:51.490
squared times t seconds.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:57.710
If it took 2 seconds-- so if
t is equal to 2-- then my

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.100
initial velocity is equal
to 10 meters per second.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.160
You could convert that to
miles per hour-- we've

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.980
actually done that in
previous videos.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:16.380
If you throw a ball that stays
up in the air for 10 seconds,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.780
then you threw it at 50 meters
per second, which is

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.170
extremely, extremely fast.
Hopefully, I've taught you a

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.560
little bit about a fun game.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.040
In the next video, I'll show
you how to figure out-- how

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.380
high did the ball go?

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.790
I'll see you soon.
