00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.280
We are on problem 63.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.140
The height of a triangle
is 4 inches greater

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.580
than twice its base.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.215
Let me this triangle
in question.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.300
That's the triangle, that's its
height, that's its base.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.530
Let's say this is the base.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.970
Let's call that b.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.030
So then the height, that's that,
is 4 inches greater than

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.070
twice its base.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.450
So 4 inches more than
2 times the base.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.440
Fair enough.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.980
The area of the triangle
is 168 square inches.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.920
What is the base of
the triangle?

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.900
So what's the area
of a triangle?

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.640
It's the base times the
height times 1/2.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.080
So area is equal to 1/2
base times height.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.660
Well they told us that the
height is four more than twice

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.710
the base, so we can just
substitute that in.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.385
And then we'll have a just
in terms of the base.

00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:58.510
Let me keep that there.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.920
So the area is equal to 1/2
the base times the height,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.210
which they told us is 4 more
than twice the base.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.710
And now if we distribute
the 1/2 b.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.240
1/2 b times 4 is equal to 2b.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.500
And then 1/2 b times 2b,
that's plus b squared.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.890
1/2 time 2 is 1 and then
b times b is b squared.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.590
Fair enough.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.780
And they tell us that
the area is 168.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.160
OK, so we have area is 168, and
that's equal to 2 times

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.110
the base plus the
base sqaured.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.110
Let's swap the sides just
to make it look

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.980
a little bit familiar.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.220
B squared plus 2 times the
base is equal to 168.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.650
We could subtract 168
from both sides.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:54.850
You get b squared plus 2b
minus 168 is equal to 0.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.730
And 168 is a bit of
a strange number.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.060
I don't know exactly which
numbers go into 168.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.770
Let's see, 4 isn't
going to work.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.770
Does 12 go into it?

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.970
Yeah, 12 goes into 168,
and I think it

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.140
goes into it 14 times.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.200
So that works.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.820
So you could use the quadratic
equation to solve this.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.490
But I think that 12
times 14 is 168.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.190
And they have to be of different
signs, since this is

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.610
a negative.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.290
Only different signs
when multiplied get

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.220
you a negative number.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.790
And they're 2 apart.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.510
So that works out.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.840
So you get b plus 14 times
b minus 12 is equal to 0.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.610
Let me just confirm and
not waste your time.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.600
14 times 12, I'm pretty
sure I'm right.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.570
Yeah, 168.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.630
I just factored that out.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.260
So b could be equal
to minus 14.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.360
Right, that would make that 0.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.470
Or b could be equal to 12,
which would make that 0.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.390
Obviously if you can make one
of these terms 0, you're

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.190
making this whole thing 0.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.200
And the base, since we're
dealing with distances or

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.960
lengths, we can't have
a negative length.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.250
So the base has to
be 12 inches.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.805
Which is choice C in
that question.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.840
Next question.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.550
Problem 64.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.800
All right.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.920
This is a good one.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.620
What is that thing reduced
to lowest terms?

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.750
So essentially what they want
us to do is factor stuff out

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.390
and factor it out and write it
as a product of factors and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.410
then cancel out the ones.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.320
So let's see what we can do.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.030
Can we factor that
top expression?

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.300
Let's see.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.340
This is looks like a perfect
square, right?

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.430
Because if you have minus 2y
squared is 4y squared.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.020
And minus 2y and minus
2y is minus 4y.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.150
So the top expression is
x minus 2y squared.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.060
And I'll just write it twice.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.360
Because I'm guessing that one
of them are going to have to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.050
be factored out.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.520
And once, the intuition is that
if I had this, x squared

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.380
minus 4x plus 4, you say OK,
what two numbers when you

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.204
multiply them equal four
and when you add

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:20.170
them equal minus 4?

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.250
You say, minus 2 and you'd so
that's equal to x minus

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.720
2 and x minus 2.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.500
The only difference between
that and that is

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.560
they put y's here.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.540
Y and a y squared.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.690
OK, so you could visualize this
thing as x squared minus

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:45.810
4yx plus 4y squared.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.000
Or you could visualize this as x
squared minus two times 2y x

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.630
plus 2y squared.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.450
This isn't 4y squared.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.410
This is 4 y squared.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.600
Forget the parentheses.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.540
But I hope you can see that this
thing up here is the same

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.940
thing is this thing
right here.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.910
And that's where I got the
intuition that that's going to

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.900
be x minus 2y times
x minus 2y.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.970
You say, OK what two numbers
when you add

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.740
them are 2 times 2y?

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.410
Well, obviously 2y.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.130
And what numbers when you
squared them are 2y squared?

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.120
Well 2y times 2y
is 2y squared.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.660
So that's where you get the
intuition that it's x minus 2y

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.490
times x minus 2y.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.130
That's the numerator, let's see
what we can do with the

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.910
denominator.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.230
Well immediately, both factors
are divisible by 3 and both

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.040
terms are divisible by y.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.980
So let's factor those out.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.781
So this is equal to 3y.

00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:42.640
Now if you divide this term
by 3y, all you're

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.880
left with is an x.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.780
3xy divided by 3y, you
just have an x.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.120
And then if you divide minus
6y squared by 3y, minus six

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.470
divided by 3 is minus 2, y
squared divided by y is y.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.180
Let's see, if we assume that x
does not equal 2y, because

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.940
then this would be undefined,
we can cancel these two out.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.680
And you're just left with
x minus 2y over 3y.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.020
And that is choice B.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.710
Problem 65.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.960
They want us to do it again.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.290
OK, let's see.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.110
So this top expression,
everything is divisible by 3,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.070
so let's rewrite it.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.950
Let's factor out a 3 there.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.620
So it'd be 3 times to 2x
squared, plus 7x-- or 21

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.540
divided by 3-- Plus 3.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.480
Let's see, what's
the bottom one?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.520
Well this fits a pattern.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.190
A squared minus b
squared, right?

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.130
This is something squared.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.030
4x squared is 2x squared.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.980
And then 1 is obviously
1 squared.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.950
So we can write this as a
plus b times a minus b.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.550
And that would be 2x plus
1, times 2x minus 1.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.800
2x squared is 4x squared,
and 1 squared is 1.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.960
So let's see, we factored
that top part.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.860
And I'm guessing it's going to
cancel out with something in

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.450
the denominator.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.890
So let's see what we can get.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.251
Let me do it on the side here.

00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:33.620
So if I have to factor 2x
squared plus 7x plus 3, it's

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:40.815
going to be 2x plus something
times x plus something.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.610
Because 2x times the
x is 2x squared.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.070
And the b times the a is
going to be equal to 3.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.960
So I'm guessing one of them is
going to be a 3 and one of

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.200
them is going to be 1.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.610
And I could already guess, if
we could do it a little bit

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.440
more systematically than
how it's going, so

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.210
let's multiply it out.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.690
2x times x, 2x squared.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.840
2x times a, plus 2ax.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.120
B times x, plus bx.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.520
B times a, plus ba.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.360
So you get 2x squared, then
merge these terms, add the

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.040
coefficients.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:26.660
Plus 2a plus bx, that's those
two terms. Plus ba is equal to

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.610
this thing up here.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.090
I'll write it right below it so
we can compare terms. It's

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:37.600
equal to 2x squared
plus 7x plus 3.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.600
So what could a and b equal?

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.900
Let's see, 2 times a plus b is
equal to-- so if a is 3 and

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.630
this is 1, 2 times 3 is
6 plus 1 is 7, works.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.980
And then 3 times 1 is 7.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.746
So b is 1 and a is 3.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.690
And you could multiply that
out if you're not

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.430
comfortable with it.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.190
But anyway, we could rewrite
this top thing as 3 times--

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.690
and we did the factoring here,
we figured out that b and a

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:18.990
are 2x plus 1, times x plus 3.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:24.620
All of that over 2x plus
1, times 2x minus 1.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.160
And we know we're on the right
track because we've got

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.010
something to cancel out.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.860
And sure enough, we
cancel those out.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.800
Assuming that this
never equals 0.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.600
This x does not equal minus 1/2,
because that would make

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.630
that equal 0.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:43.510
And we get 3 times x plus
3 over 2x minus 1.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:48.500
And that is choice B.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.180
Let me see the next problem,
see if we have time

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.620
to do it right now.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.510
Oh, it's another one of these.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.170
I'll wait for the next
video, see you soon.
