00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.250
Solve the equation: x squared
minus x squared minus 4 over x

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.570
minus 2 is equal to 4.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.920
And they tell us that x won't
or cannot be 2 because if it

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.670
was 2, then this would
be undefined.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.460
It would be dividing by 0.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.535
So let's see what x is.

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:18.860
Let's see the x that actually
satisfies this equation.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.530
So you might be tempted to try
to express this with the

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.490
common denominator of x minus
2 and then add these two

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.580
expressions.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.550
But the thing that jumps out
at me initially is that we

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.230
have x squared minus 4 on the
numerator, which is a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.439
difference of squares.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.290
Or if you factor it out, it's
x plus 2 times x minus 2.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.460
So we should be able to factor
this x minus 2 out.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.460
So let's do that.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.580
So if we were to rewrite it,
this is equivalent to x

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.940
squared minus-- instead of
writing x squared minus 4, we

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.230
know that's a difference
of squares.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.300
That is x plus 2 times
x minus 2.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.630
All of that over x minus 2.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.160
And that is equal to 4.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.533
And this whole time we're
assuming that x

00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.760
won't be equal to 2.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.990
And because x does not equal to
2, x minus 2 divided by x

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.600
minus 2 is going
to be defined.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.890
And it will be 1.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.720
So those two will cancel out.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.870
And so we're left with x squared
minus x plus 2 is

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.020
equal to 4.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.555
We can distribute the
negative sign.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:18.450
And I'll just arbitrarily
switch colors here.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.880
We can distribute the negative
sign, so we get x squared

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.550
minus x minus 2 is equal to 4.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.350
And what we want to do is put
this in the form ax squared

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.190
plus bx plus c is equal to 0.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.190
That allows us to either
factor it or apply the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.100
quadratic equation or complete
the square, or any of the ways

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.260
that we know how to
solve quadratics.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.000
So let's do that.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.970
Let's get a 0 on the
right-hand side.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.720
The best way to do that is to
subtract 4 from both sides of

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.830
this equation.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.820
Subtract 4 and we are left
with x squared minus x.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.330
Negative 2 minus 4
is negative 6.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.460
And then 4 minus 4 is 0.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.270
That was the whole point.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.170
So we have x squared minus
x minus 6 is equal to 0.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.050
Let me write it up here.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.330
x squared minus x minus
6 is equal to 0.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.730
And this looks factorable.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.500
We just have to think of two
numbers that when we multiply

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.669
them give us negative 6.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:10.660
So they're going to have
different signs.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.570
When I add them I'll
get negative 1.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.420
So it looks like negative
3 and positive 2 work.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.430
So if we do x minus
3 times x plus 2.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.200
It's a little bit of trial and
error, but 6 doesn't have that

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.630
many factors to deal with and
3 and 2 are one apart.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.780
They have different signs, so
that's how you can think of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.700
how we get to that conclusion.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.360
Negative 3 times 2
is negative 6.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.630
Negative 3 plus 2
is negative 1.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.760
So that is equal to 0.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.620
So we have two possible
ways to get 0.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.730
Either x minus 3 is equal to 0
or x plus 2 is equal to 0.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.610
And then if we take x minus 3 is
equal to 0, if we add 3 to

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.290
both sides of that equation, we
get x is equal to 3 or, if

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.190
we subtract 2 from both sides of
this equation, we get x is

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.640
equal to negative 2.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.910
So both of these
are solutions.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.320
And let's apply them into
this equation to make

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.400
sure that they work.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.200
Because these are solutions to
essentially, the situation

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.940
where we got rid of
the x minus 2.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.540
Maybe it had some type
of side effects.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.140
So let's just make sure that
both of these actually work in

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.110
the original equation.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.400
So let's try x is equal
to 3 first.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.810
So you get 3 squared minus
3 squared over 4.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.130
Sorry, 3 squared minus
4 over 3 minus 2.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.730
So this is equal to 9 minus--
3 squared is 9 --minus 4,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.160
which is 5, over 1.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.720
So 9 minus 5, which
is equal to 4.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.805
Which is exactly what we
needed it to equal.

00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:42.440
And let's try it with
negative 2.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:50.000
So if I take negative 2 squared
and I have a minus

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.290
negative 2 squared minus
4, all of that over

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.210
negative 2 minus 2.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.720
So negative 2 squared is 4.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.680
Minus negative 2 squared,
which is 4.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.320
Minus 4.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.230
All of that over negative
2 minus negative 2

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.310
over negative 4.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.480
Well 4 minus 4 is 0, so this
whole thing is just

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.740
going to become 0.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.260
So this whole thing is
going to equal 4.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.710
So both of these
solutions work.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.940
And that makes sense, because
when we actually canceled this

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.060
out, we actually didn't
fundamentally change anything

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.779
about the equation.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.550
Only if you had the situation
where the x would have been

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.000
equal to 2.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.070
That's the only thing that
you're really changing.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.140
So that's why it makes
sense that both of

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.910
these solutions work.
