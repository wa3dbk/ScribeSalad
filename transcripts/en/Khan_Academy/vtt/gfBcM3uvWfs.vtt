00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.480
We now have a respectable
understanding of the periodic

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.840
table itself and the
atoms in them.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.070
And now we're ready to deal
with molecules themselves.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.080
And to deal with molecules, we
have to have some way of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.690
representing them.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.380
And you represent them
with formulas.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.690
And there's two major--
actually, three major ways to

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.650
represent a molecule.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.135
One is the molecular formula.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.930
And the other is the
empirical formula.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.729
And I'll do it in a different
color to differentiate it.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.610
And the difference is, well,
let's just talk about what the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.660
word empirical means.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.120
I remember when I first took
chemistry the teacher kept

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.080
using the word empirical.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.390
Well, what does empirical
really mean?

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.310
I clearly did not have a
very deep vocabulary.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.720
I forgot what age I was.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.470
But it means achieved through
observation or experiment, or

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.780
based on experience.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.180
So if someone said that they
empirically figured out x, y,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.300
or z, it means that they figured
it out through an

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.150
experiment or they
observed it.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.440
The molecular formula is
essentially the actual number

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.810
of atoms in that molecule.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.790
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.330
So the empirical formula tells
you what people have observed.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.730
Maybe before they even knew that
there was such a thing as

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.620
atoms, what they would have
observed is the ratio of the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.910
atoms to one another in a
molecule without knowing in

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.500
the exact molecule how many
of that atom there are.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.330
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:42.790
So if I were to give you, I
don't know, a benzene, the

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.240
molecular formula of benzene,
you have 6 carbon atoms and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.240
you have 6 hydrogen atoms. Now,
if you were some chemist

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.710
in the 1800's and you didn't
know about the actual atoms,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.280
but if you had a big bag of
benzene and you were to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.360
measure the ratio of the carbon
to the hydrogen that

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.870
you had in that bag, you would
find out that for every one

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.560
carbon you have one hydrogen.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.400
So your empirical formula
is the ratio of the two.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.060
You don't know that each atom
actually has 6 of these, but

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.480
you know that for every carbon,
there's a hydrogen.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.150
And for every hydrogen
there's a carbon.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.030
And the way to go back, you
can go from the molecular

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.160
formula to the empirical
formula very easily.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.870
You just find the greatest
common divisor of the number

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.640
of atoms in the molecule.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.570
So the greatest common divisor
is six, and six is obviously

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.590
six, you divide both of these
by six and you get the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.710
empirical formula.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.730
It's not easy.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.090
You pretty much can't go back
from the empirical formula to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.880
the molecular formula.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.290
You've lost information.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.300
I don't know whether
this was C6H6.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.870
Was it C2H2?

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.190
You just don't know.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.070
And I mentioned right at the
beginning of the video that

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.750
there's a third way to
represent molecules.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.100
And that's the structural
formula.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.880
And we'll do that, off and on,
and we've already done it a

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.720
little bit.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.250
Let me show you.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.760
The structural formula for
benzene would actually say how

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.490
the molecular formula atoms
are configured.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.470
So benzene in particular
is very interesting.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.270
It looks like this.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.290
It's often drawn like this.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.220
And you'll see this a lot when
you take organic chemistry.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.380
But it looks like a little
hexagon, where the vertices of

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.310
the hexagon are carbon atoms.
So let me draw the carbon

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.000
atoms in yellow.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.720
So this is carbon,
carbon, carbon,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.730
carbon, carbon, carbon.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.690
They have double bonds,
every other carbon.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.920
Double bonds.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.200
And then they have single
bonds to hydrogen.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.075
Let me just do the hydrogen
in another color.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.370
Let me do it in magenta.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.620
Hydrogen.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.450
And obviously, the structural
formula gives you the most

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.940
information.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.200
Right?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.270
Then you can start to think
about, gee, how will this

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.890
interact with other things?

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.310
While the molecular formula just
tells you what's in the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.310
molecule, the empirical formula
really gives you the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.470
least information.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.300
It just tells you the ratio
of the different

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.890
items in the molecule.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.420
Structural formula.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.390
Let's do a couple more.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.269
OK, what if we're dealing with,
let's say we're dealing

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.250
with water.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.280
I think you know the molecular
formula for water.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.870
H2O.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.940
Now what would be the empirical
formula for this?

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.510
Well we want to know the ratio,
so for every oxygen

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.390
there's two hydrogens.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.000
Or I guess you could say
for every hydrogen

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.900
there's a half of oxygen.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.230
So you can't reduce this.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.280
If I wrote this as H2O1, what's
the greatest common

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.490
divisor of 2 and 1?

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.480
Well, it's 1, so you just have
to divide them by 1.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.410
So in this case, the empirical
and the molecular formula are

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.760
the exact same thing.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.390
It's H2O.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.570
What about sulfur?

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.940
And an interesting molecule,
because obviously,

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.630
it's just one atom.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.560
Sulfur.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.450
Sorry, no, I'm spelling
it wrong.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.620
No.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.660
No, it's not a p h, it's f.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.460
Clearly, I shouldn't be making
spelling videos.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.710
So sulfur.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.790
So the molecular formula S8.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.420
So it forms this neat kind of

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.270
octagon-looking chain of sulfurs.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.120
And if I were to draw that,
you would see that.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.490
And you could look it up on
Wikipedia, if you like.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.320
But its empirical formula, if
you had just a bag of sulfur,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.080
you don't know that each
atom has eight sulfurs.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.430
You just have a big
bag of sulfur.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.050
So, the imperative formula,
there's only one

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.060
atom in this molecule.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.520
You divide by eight
and you get S.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.670
So you just know that all you've
got there is sulfur.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.050
So let's just do one more.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.300
Glucose.

00:05:57.555 --> 00:05:59.490
I'll pick a new color.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.250
Glucose.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:11.760
The molecular formula
is C6H12O6.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.930
So for every carbon,
there are how many?

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.240
For every 6 carbons, there's
12 hydrogen and 1 oxygen.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.320
So if you kind of reduce this
formula to its empirical form,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.270
what do you get?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.930
Let's see, you can divide all
these numbers by 6, so we get

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.180
1 carbon, 2 hydrogens,
and 1 oxygen.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.720
So this just tells you the ratio
that they exist in a big

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.540
bag of this molecule.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.400
This tells you the
exact number of

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.390
atoms in that molecule.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.020
Fair enough.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.280
So now we know a little bit
of the difference between

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.120
molecular formula, and empirical
formula, and

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.760
structural formula.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.400
Now let's see if we can use
what we know about the

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.780
formulas and the periodic table
to think a little bit

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.330
about the composition, the mass
composition, of some of

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.440
these molecules.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.460
So the first thing to even think
about is, how do you

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.500
figure out the molecular mass?

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.560
Right?

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.050
I have my little periodic
table down there.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.300
So molecular mass.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.540
So the first question is, how
do you figure out-- I mean,

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.850
the molecular mass is going to
be the sum of all of the atoms

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.610
in that molecule, right?

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.960
So if you wanted to know the
molecular mass of-- let's say

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.340
you wanted to know
how much does one

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.380
molecule of benzene mass?

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.700
I don't want to say weight,
because it should be

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.970
independent of what
planet you're on.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.160
So what is the mass of one
molecule of benzene?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.890
Well, all you do is you add up
the masses of the different

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:50.570
constituents.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.110
So you have 6 carbons
and 6 hydrogens.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.360
So let's do benzene.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.570
You have 6 carbons
and 6 hydrogens.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.680
So what's the mass
of each carbon?

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.470
So let's go back down to
the periodic table.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.290
Just to give proper credit, I
got this off of the Los Alamos

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.690
National Laboratories website.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.680
So let's see, the atomic
mass of carbon.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.520
The reason why I used this one
instead of my previous one is

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.040
my previous periodic table that
I got off Wikipedia only

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.490
had atomic numbers on them.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.200
But now that we're actually
going to start talking about

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.260
the mass composition
of different atoms

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.995
or different molecules.

00:08:26.995 --> 00:08:28.210
We're going to have to
start looking at the

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.860
atomic mass, right?

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.270
Remember, the atomic mass, when
you think about atomic

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.809
mass units, it's just the number
of protons plus the

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:37.280
number of neutrons.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.400
So you have six protons
in carbon

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.850
and roughly six neutrons.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.890
And why is there this decimal?

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.060
Because, as we said before, this
is an average of all of

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.360
the masses of the isotopes
you'll find of carbon.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.670
So there's a little bit of
carbon 14 on the planet, very

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.100
little, but most of the
carbon is carbon 12.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.200
When you proportionately average
them, you get 12.01.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.280
But let's say we're dealing with
carbon 12, just because

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.530
that's the most common
element.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.410
Carbon is 12 atomic
mass units.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:13.870
Right?

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.040
And atomic mass units
is a unit of mass.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.100
And we'll talk about
how small it is.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.040
It's a very, very, very,
very small fraction

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.330
of a gram or kilogram.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.120
And we'll talk about that,
probably in the next video.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.490
So carbon is 12 atomic
mass units.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.590
What about hydrogen?

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.190
Let's see.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.250
We go to our periodic table.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.980
Hydrogen is here in
this dark blue.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.600
And I don't know if you can
read it, but this is

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.550
interesting, the atomic number
of hydrogen is 1.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:45.270
The atomic mass of hydrogen
is 1.0008.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.190
So that tells us that most of
the hydrogen on this planet

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.850
has an atomic mass of 1.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.850
Which tells us that it
essentially has no neutrons.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.970
That hydrogen is a kind of an
interesting nucleus there,

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.520
where there is really
just a proton.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.580
Just a proton sitting
in that nucleus.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.670
And so if you were to
ionize hydrogen.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.930
If you were to turn into a
cation and take one of its

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.240
electrons away, what
are you left with?

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.880
You just have a proton.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.790
A proton sitting by itself, just
a single proton, really

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.540
is no different than
a hydrogen ion.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.220
And that to me is kind
of interesting.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.600
That hydrogen is that simple.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.050
It's really just a proton.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.490
So hydrogen has an
atomic mass of 1.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.580
Right?

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.210
If it had any neutrons in it, it
would have been at least an

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.230
atomic mass of 2.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.350
But hydrogen has atomic
mass of 1.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.770
One atomic mass unit.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:43.330
So what is the mass of one
molecule of benzene?

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.620
Well it's 6 times
the carbon mass.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:51.610
6 times 12 plus 6 times
the mass of hydrogen.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.770
Plus 6 times 1.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:59.635
So that is 6 times 12, is 72,
plus 6 times 1, plus 6, is

00:10:59.635 --> 00:11:01.980
equal to 78.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.950
Now, what if someone
said, what percent

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.470
of benzene is carbon?

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.450
Well then you say, OK, this
is the piece that's

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.370
carbon, right here.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:17.730
The carbon piece of benzene
is 72 atomic mass units.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.890
Right, that's carbon.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.670
So what percentage of
benzene is carbon?

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.770
Well it's 72 over 78.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.950
The whole thing is 78.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.450
So it's 72 over 78.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.730
And what does that equal?

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.110
Let me get a calculator going.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.650
I should've had my calculator
open ahead of time.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.680
All right.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:51.820
So 72 divided by 78
is equal to 92.3%.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:12:00.510
So benzene is 92.3%
carbon by mass.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.950
And of course, the remainder,
the 7.7%,

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.790
is going to be hydrogen.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.880
Let's do that for a couple of
these other guys down here.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.820
So let's say we wanted to
know what is the mass of

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.490
a molecule of water?

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.120
Fair enough.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.280
There's enough water on the
planet, if you want to know

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:16.780
what that is.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.980
Well we already know what the
mass of a hydrogen is.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.950
It's 1.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:21.180
Right?

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.250
Hydrogen is 1.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.840
One atomic mass unit.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.880
Oxygen is what?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.640
Oxygen is 16.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.930
Notice, it's exactly 16.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:37.170
So on most of the planet, you
pretty much have, in an oxygen

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:41.890
atom, you have 8 protons
and exactly 8 neutrons.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.050
So you get an atomic
mass of 16.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:49.540
So oxygen has an atomic mass
of 16 atomic mass units.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.580
So the atomic mass of the entire
molecule, you have 2

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:57.970
hydrogens, so you have 2 times
the mass of hydrogen plus 1

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:03.100
oxygen-- plus 16-- so that
equals 18 atomic

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.520
mass units for water.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.970
And once again, if you want to
say, what percent by mass of

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.510
water is oxygen?

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.530
Well it's 16 out of
the 18, right?

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:15.330
Is oxygen.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.360
So if we get the calculator
back, you get 16

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.710
divided by 18 is water.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.630
So, let's say you round
it, 88.9% water.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:34.280
Sorry, 88.9% oxygen.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.700
So most of water is oxygen.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.720
And this is interesting, even
though you have two hydrogens

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:45.550
here, two hydrogens for every
one oxygen, oxygen's mass is

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.490
so much larger-- it's 16
times larger-- that

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.665
most of water is oxygen.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.540
Well, I'm probably running out
of time, so the next video I'm

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.960
going to talk about how
do we go backwards.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.380
If someone gives you the
composition, how can you get

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.710
the empirical formula.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.950
Actually on a side note,
slightly unrelated to what I

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:09.140
just talked about, I was doing
some research last night about

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.020
metals, because they're actually
interesting, about

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.805
why some metals conduct more
and some conduct less.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.480
Because when I first talked
about, you know, these were

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.870
obviously the transition
metals.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.160
They're backfilling
their d orbitals.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:28.580
And I said, hey, the periodic
table that was in-- I think I

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.930
was looking in a Princeton
Review book that described

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.950
these as metals and described
these as transition metals.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.350
And I was like, hey, you know,
that's kind of not fair,

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.470
because I consider iron and
copper and gold and silver to

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.150
be as metallic as anything.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.120
Why should these be called
transition metals and these be

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.380
just called regular metals.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.310
And it actually turns out that
a common name for these are

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.340
poor metals.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.570
Poor metals.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.580
Because, to a large degree,
they're softer, they have

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.780
lower melting points, so the
intuition was right.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.580
To a large degree, when we think
of metals, these are the

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.610
metals I think of.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:10.560
And when we think of metallic
nature in a chemistry sense--

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.140
we talked a lot about that,
who wants to donate their

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.490
electrons the most, that's
metallic nature.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.000
They're the guys down here.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.180
And as you go to the top right,
these want to donate

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.540
their electrons the least.
These are the most

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.190
electronegative.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.690
They like electrons the most, so
they actually have some of

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.210
the worst metallic nature, so
it actually makes sense to

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.320
call them poor metals.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.170
And there's some debate on
whether these should even be

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.800
called poor metals.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.080
If you look up a bunch of
periodic tables, some will

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.460
call these metals.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.830
Some will call these
poor metals.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.830
But I just wanted to throw that
out there just so you're

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.800
exposed to it.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.200
And so, you know, for me, it is
a little bit more intuitive

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.790
to call these poor metals,
because they have less

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.330
metallic nature than the stuff,
especially down here,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.970
the alkali and the alkaline
earth metals.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.060
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
