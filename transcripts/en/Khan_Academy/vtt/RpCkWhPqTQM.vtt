00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.830
We're on problem 13.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:11.520
And they say if 4x is equal to
6u, which is equal to 5v,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.670
which is equal to 7w, all of
which is greater than 0, which

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.210
of the following is true.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.243
So they're essentially wanting
you to order w to-- they want

00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:27.670
you to order these terms in
order from least to greatest.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.710
So one thing I'm going to do,
let me order these terms, the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.900
coefficients from least to
greatest. That's the same

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.330
thing as 4x is equal to 5v,
which is equal to 6u, which is

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.840
equal to 7w.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.290
They're all greater than 0.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.290
So what's going to be
greater, x or w?

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.350
So if I have 4 of something
and that equals 7 of this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.090
thing, this is going to be
the smallest, right?

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.340
Think of it this way.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.990
If x was 7, then w would be 4.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.330
Try that out.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.660
If x was 7 and this term would
be 28, the w would be 4.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.920
So w is the smallest. And by
that same principle, u is

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.800
going to be next.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.780
So w is less than u, which
is less than v, which

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.990
is less than x.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.790
And it's just on the principle,
if it takes me 7 of

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.080
something to make up the 4 of
something else, this thing has

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.900
to be bigger because I
need fewer of it to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.000
make 7 of this thing.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.430
And by the same logic u is less
than v, right, because

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.640
you need 6 of that thing
to make one of v.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.550
I mean if you really wanted to
kind of try it out you could

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.100
divide all of these by 4 and
you'd get x is equal to 5/4v,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.710
which is equal to 6/4u, which
is equal to 7/4w.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.800
All of these terms are
greater than 1.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.560
So x is more than
all of these.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.800
And you could do it for all of
these and you would see that

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.380
same order.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.655
That whichever one has the
highest coefficient is going

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:01.320
to be the smallest number, and
then the next smallest is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.700
going to be u, then v, then x.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.210
So let's see what choice that
is. w is less than u, which is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.780
less than u, which
is less than x.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.930
That's choice D.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.800
Problem 14.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.210
Let the function h be defined by
h of t is equal to 2 times

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.910
t cubed minus 3.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.280
When h of t is equal to minus
60, so h of t is equal to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.730
minus 60, what is 2 minus 3t?

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.280
What is 2 minus 3t.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.260
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.452
2 minus 3t.

00:02:47.452 --> 00:02:53.710
So h of t is equal to minus 60,
so minus 60 is equal to 2

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.210
times t cubed minus 3.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.810
Fair enough.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.410
And then divide both
sides by 2.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.460
I'm just trying to see where
I can go with this.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.650
Divide both sides by 2.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.350
So you get minus 30 is equal
to t cubed minus 3.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.050
Add 3 to both sides you get
minus 27 is equal to t cubed.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.450
This is pretty straightforward.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.960
Something to the third power
is equal to minus 27.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.920
Well what's the cubed
root of 27?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.680
It's 3.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.830
So the cubed root of minus
27 is minus 3.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.360
So t is equal to minus 3.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.100
And you could try that out.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.430
What's minus 3 to
the third power?

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.140
Minus 3 times minus 3 is 9 times
minus 3 is minus 27.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.340
So when h of t is minus 60,
t is equal to minus 3.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.810
And so what is 2 minus 3t, which
is what they asked us

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.285
originally?

00:03:47.285 --> 00:03:51.670
It's going to be 2 minus
3 times minus 3.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.790
So it's 2 minus minus 9 or 2
plus 9, which is equal to 11.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.910
And that is choice B.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.160
Next problem.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.840
I'll switch colors.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.100
Where was I?

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.770
My brain is fried from doing all
of these SAT problems. But

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.430
I figure I do it once an it'll
be there forever for students

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.589
for the rest of eternity to
learn SAT problems and compete

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.220
with my future children and
they'll be [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.630
Problem 15.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.410
If x is divisible by 3 and y
is divisible by 5, which of

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.630
the following must be
divisible by 15?

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.040
So x divisible by 3, so x is a
multiple of 3-- you can view

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.130
it that way.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.130
y is the divisible by 5.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.970
Which of the following must
also be divisible by 15?

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:46.710
Do you know how I'm
going to do it?

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.400
I'm going to say look, you could
write x is equal to 3k

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.660
where k is some integer.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.120
We don't know what multiple x
is of 3, but we know 3 times

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.270
some integer, k,
is equal to x.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.550
And similarly, you could say y
is equal to 5, I don't know,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.690
5m where you could say
some integer m times

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.550
5 is equal to y.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.960
Because we know that 5 times
something's equal to y.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.510
That's what divisible means.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.520
So let's look at the choices.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.890
1.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.090
They want to know which
are the ones that are

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.350
divisible by 15.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.170
So choice 1 is x times y.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:25.540
Well x times y is the same
thing as 3k times 5m.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.530
And that's the same
thing as 15km.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.430
So xy is the same thing as 15
times a product of integers,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.040
and the product of two integers
is going to be an

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.330
integer, right?

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.560
So this is definitely
divisible by 15.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.720
So choice 1 is divisible
by 15.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.970
Problem 2.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.930
3x plus 5y.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.260
So we could do the same thing.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:03.610
x is 3k, so that's 3 times 3k
plus 5y plus 5 times 5m.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.210
That equals 9k plus 25m.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.270
This isn't necessarily
divisible by 15.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.810
I mean what if k and
m are both 1?

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.680
Then you get 34 and-- this
is not divisible by 15.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.930
Choice 3.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.700
5x plus 3y.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.510
Doing the same thing.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.600
That equals 5 times 3k,
right, this is x.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.360
5 times 3k plus 3 times 5m.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.480
And this equals 15k plus 15m.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.670
An you can factor out the 15.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.020
That's 15 times k plus m.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.270
And once again, so this thing is
equal to 15 times k plus m.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.900
k plus m is going to
be some integer.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.760
We said k and m are
both integers.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.420
So this term right here is
definitely divisible by 15.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.720
So one and three
are our answer.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.940
And that is choice D.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.070
And you know, if you didn't want
to do this fancy stuff

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.720
where you say it's multiplying
by some integer,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.160
et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.090
Just x is divisible by 3, y is
divisible by 5, well let's

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.810
just say x is equal to 3
and y is equal to 5 and

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.920
then try them out.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.090
Then xy is going to be 15,
which is, of course,

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.810
divisible by 15.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.670
This would be, let's see, 3
times 3 plus 5 times 5, this

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:27.620
would be 34.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.380
Not divisible by 15.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.205
And then the final one, 3 times
5 is 15 plus 3 times 5

00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:35.970
is 15, this would be 30, which
is divisible by 15.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.950
So that would have been the
quick and dirty, not

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.920
necessarily the most
mathematically rigorous way of

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.170
doing it, but it would have
gotten you the right answer.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.400
And that really is what matters,
I guess, on the SAT.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.455
That would have been the quick
and dirty solution.

00:07:51.455 --> 00:07:55.900
Let me see if I can
draw this thing.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.920
One line like that.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.270
One line like that.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.900
One line something like that.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.460
And what do they tell
us about this?

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.750
I'll use yellow.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:14.020
They tell us that this angle
right here is 115 degrees.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.910
This is line l.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.290
This is z degrees.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.190
Line m, line n, and
this is y degrees.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.730
Looks like we're going to have
to play the angle game here.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.920
This is y degrees.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.370
In the figure above
what is y plus z?

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.370
So when I play the angle game
I just try to figure out as

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.750
many sides as I can.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.330
So if this is 115 what
is this going to be?

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.320
Well 115 plus this
supplementary, right?

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.440
So these are going to add up to
be 180, so this is going to

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.380
be 180 minus 115.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.070
What's 80 minus 15?

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.910
It's 65, right, because
80 minus 10 is 70.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.010
So this is 65 degrees.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.720
And I just said that because
this angle plus

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.390
this has to be 180.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.370
Now what is this angle
right here?

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.760
This angle right here is going
to be 180 minus y for the same

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.650
reason because it's
supplementary to y.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:15.330
This angle here, same reason,
it's going to be 180 minus z.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.690
And we know that this angle
plus this angle plus this

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.680
angle has to add up to 180.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:29.060
So 65 plus 180 minus y plus 180
minus z is equal to 180.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:35.150
Let's see, so that's-- you could
subtract 180 from both

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.770
sides, you get a 0 here.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.740
What's 65 plus 180?

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:47.160
65 plus 180 is 245 minus y
minus z, is equal to 0.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:53.110
Add y and z to both sides, you
get 245 is equal to y plus z.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.780
And that is choice E.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.600
See you in the next video.
