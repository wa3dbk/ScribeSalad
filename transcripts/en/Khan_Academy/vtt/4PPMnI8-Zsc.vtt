00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.310
All right, we're on problem
number seven.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.635
And when I copied and
pasted it I made it

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:05.310
a little bit smaller.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.030
So I'm going to read it for you
just in case this is too

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.330
small for you to read.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.980
It says, use the proof to answer
the question below.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.560
So they gave us that angle 2
is congruent to angle 3.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.070
So the measure of angle
2 is equal to the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.190
measure of angle 3.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.510
I'm trying to get the knack of
the language that they use in

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.520
geometry class.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.590
Which, I will admit, that
language kind of tends to

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.810
disappear as you leave
your geometry class.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.330
But since we're in
geometry class,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.800
we'll use that language.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.950
So angle 2 is congruent
to angle 3.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.690
Which means that their
measure is the same.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.510
Or that they kind of did the
same angle, essentially.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.910
Fair enough.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.890
So let's see.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.870
Statement one, angle 2 is
congruent to angle 3.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.120
That's given, I drew that
already up here.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.850
Statement two, angle 1 is
congruent to angle 2, angle 3

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.430
is congruent to angle 4.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.270
So they're saying that angle
2 is congruent to angle 1.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.830
Or angle 1 is congruent
to angle 2.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.129
That's right there.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.850
And that angle 4 is congruent
to angle 3.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.720
Fair enough.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.910
And they say, what's the reason
that you could give.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.130
And I forgot the actual
terminology.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.590
But in my head, I was thinking
opposite angles are equal or

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.490
the measures are equal,
or they are congruent.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.250
And you could just imagine two
sticks and changing the angles

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.800
of the intersection.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.140
You'll see that opposite
angles are

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.830
always going to be congruent.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.680
Let's see, that is the
reason I would give.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.720
Opposite angles are congruent.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.100
Let's see which statement of the
choices is most like what

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.020
I just said.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.910
Complements of congruent
angles are congruent.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.450
Complements.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.610
Vertical angles are congruent.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.030
I think that's what they
call opposite angles.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.360
Vertical angles.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.740
I think that's what they mean
by opposite angles.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.890
Supplements of congruent
angles are congruent.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.490
That's not true.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.350
Corresponding angles
are congruent.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.530
These aren't corresponding.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.600
I think this is what they
mean by vertical angles.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.450
Complements of congruent
angles are congruent.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.370
You know what, I'm going
to look this

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.810
up with you on Wikipedia.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.900
Let me see.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.930
Vertical angles.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.840
As you can see, at the age of
32 some of the terminology

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.640
starts to escape you.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.580
What matters is that you
understand the intuition and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.710
then you can do these Wikipedia
searches to just

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.070
make sure that you remember
the right terminology.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.170
Let's see what Wikipedia
has to say about it.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.910
Vertical angles.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.710
A pair of angles is said to be
vertical or opposite, I guess

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.110
I used the British English,
opposite angles if the angles

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.700
share the same vertex and are
bounded by the same pair of

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.320
lines but are opposite
to each other.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.700
Right.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.350
So somehow, growing up in
Louisiana, I somehow picked up

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.470
the British English
version of it.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.210
Maybe because the word opposite
made a lot more sense

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.840
to me than the word vertical.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.650
With that said, they're
the same thing.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.940
Wikipedia has shown
us the light.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.420
And so my logic of opposite
angles is the same as their

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.280
logic of vertical angles
are congruent.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.530
Next problem.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.620
I'll start using the
U.S. terminology.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.780
Although I think there are a
good number of people outside

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.760
of the U.S. who watch these.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.650
So maybe it's good that I
somehow picked up the British

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.040
English version of it.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.290
Once again, it might be
hard for you to read.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.410
I'll read it out for you.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.700
Two lines in a plane
always intersect

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.910
in exactly one point.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.200
Fair enough.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.230
Which of the following best
describes a counter example to

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.960
the assertion above.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.150
I like to think of
the answer even

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.980
before seeing the choices.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.940
So can I think of two lines in
a plane that always intersect

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.280
at exactly one point.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.830
Well, what if they
are parallel?

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.420
What if I have that line
and that line.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.960
They're never going to intersect
with each other.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.600
They're parallel.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.490
That's the definition
of parallel lines.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.150
The other example I
can think of is if

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.410
they're the same line.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.430
I guess you might not want to
call them two the lines then.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.880
But I would.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.400
This line and then
I had this line.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.640
Well that's parallel, but
imagine they were right on top

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.800
of each other, they would
intersect everywhere.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.260
So either of those would be
counter examples to the idea

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.450
that two lines in a plane
always intersect

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.260
at exactly one point.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.310
And if we look at their choices,
well OK, they have

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.340
the first thing I just
wrote there.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.770
Parallel lines, obviously they
are two lines in a plane.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.400
But they don't intersect
in one point.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.090
Problem eight.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.820
I'm going to make it a little
bigger from now on so

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.240
you can read it.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.055
OK, this is problem nine.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.120
Which figure can serve as the
counter example to the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.450
conjecture below?

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.050
If one pair of opposite sides
of a quadrilateral is

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.790
parallel, then the quadrilateral
is a

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.380
parallelogram.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.880
So once again, a lot
of terminology.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.440
And I do remember these
from my geometry days.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.620
Quadrilateral means
four sides.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.230
A four sided figure.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.640
And a parallelogram
means that all the

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.000
opposite sides are parallel.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.280
For example, this is
a parallelogram.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.000
Let me see how well
I can do this.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.250
If you ignore this little part
is hanging off there, that's a

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.200
parallelogram.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.680
And if all the sides were
the same, it's a

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.190
rhombus and all of that.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.160
But that's a parallelogram.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.550
And that's a parallelogram
because this side is parallel

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.910
to that side.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.350
And this side is parallel
to that side.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.920
All the sides are parallel.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.190
Now they say, if one pair
of opposite sides of a

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.640
quadrilateral is parallel, then
the quadrilateral is a

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.070
parallelogram.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.470
So I want to give a
counter example.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.980
Let me draw a figure that has
two sides that are parallel.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.050
Let's say that side and that
side are parallel.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.700
And I don't want the other
two to be parallel.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.620
Then it wouldn't be
a parallelogram.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.200
Let's say the other sides
are not parallel.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.170
Let's say they look like that.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.250
And like that.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.330
And once again, just digging in
my head of definitions of

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.380
shapes, that looks like
a trapezoid to me.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.660
So let's see.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.550
Yeah, good, you have a trapezoid
as a choice.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.910
Trapezoid.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.240
All the rest are parallelograms.
A rectangle,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.470
all the sides are parellel.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.130
And we have all 90
degree angles.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.150
Rectangles are actually a subset
of parallelograms.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.980
Rhombus, we have a parallelogram
where all of the

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.610
sides are the same length.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.570
All the angles aren't
necessarily equal.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.930
Square is all the sides are
parallel, equal, and all the

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:43.980
angles are 90 degrees.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.940
So all of these are subsets
of parallelograms.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.260
This is not a parallelogram.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.500
Although it does have two
sides that are parallel.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.220
So this is the counter example
to the conjecture.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.450
I think you're already
seeing a pattern.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.210
In a lot of geometry,
the terminology is

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.461
often the hard part.

00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:09.900
The ideas aren't as deep as the
terminology might suggest.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.840
Given, TRAP, that already
makes me worried.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.460
Given TRAP is an isosceles
trapezoid with diagonals RP

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:26.410
and TA, which of the following
must be true?

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.970
OK, let's see what
we can do here.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:33.210
So an isosceles trapezoid means
that the two sides that

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.910
lead up from the base to
the top side are equal.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.640
Kind of like an isosceles
triangle.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.140
So let me draw that.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.300
Actually, I'm kind
of guessing that.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.300
I haven't seen the definition
of an isosceles triangle

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.590
anytime in the recent past.
An isosceles trapezoid.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.030
But it sounds right.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.616
So I'll go with it.

00:07:49.616 --> 00:07:51.295
And that's a good
skill in life.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.570
So I think what they say when
they say an isosceles

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.900
trapezoid, they are essentially
saying that this

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.650
side, it's a trapezoid,
so that's going

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.180
to be equal to that.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.510
They're saying that this side
is equal to that side.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.760
An isosceles trapezoid.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.280
And they say RP and TA
are diagonals of it.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.160
Let me draw that.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.720
So let me actually write
the whole TRAP.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:29.920
So this is T R A P
is a trapezoid.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.470
Let me draw the diagonals.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:38.169
RP is that diagonal.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:42.750
And TA is this diagonal
right here.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.390
OK.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.020
All right, let's see
what we can do.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.330
Which of the following
must be true?

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.700
RP is perpendicular to TA.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.840
Well, I can already tell
you that that's

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.530
not going to be true.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.560
And you don't even
have to prove it.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.360
Because you can even
visualize it.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.310
If you squeezed the
top part down.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.730
Imagine some device where this
is kind of a cross-section.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.800
If you were to squeeze the top
down, they didn't tell us how

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.480
high it is.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:16.540
Then these angles, let me
see if I can draw it.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.150
That angle and that angle, which
are opposite or vertical

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.550
angles, which we know is
the U.S. word for it.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.135
Those are going to get smaller
and smaller if

00:09:23.135 --> 00:09:24.560
we squeeze it down.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.710
And in order for both of these
to be perpendicular those

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.940
would have to be 90
degree angles.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.940
And we already can
see that that's

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.750
definitely not the case.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.060
All right.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.660
RP is parallel to TA.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.700
Well that's clearly not the
case, they intersect.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.190
All right, they're
the diagonals.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.840
RP is congruent to TA.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.980
Well, that looks pretty
good to me.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.340
Because it's an isosceles
trapezoid.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:59.005
If we drew a line of symmetry
here, everything you see on

00:09:59.005 --> 00:10:01.060
this side is going to be kind
of congruent to its mirror

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.280
image on that side.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.430
So both of these lines, this is
going to be equal to this.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.470
And I can make the argument, but
basically we know that RP,

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.620
since this is an isosceles
trapezoid, you could imagine

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.680
kind of continuing a triangle
and making an isosceles

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.240
triangle here.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.390
Then we would know that that
angle is equal to that angle.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.000
Well, actually I'm not going
to go down that path.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.100
But you can almost look
at it from inspection.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.340
Although, maybe I should do
a little more rigorous

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.550
definition of it.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:39.040
But RP is definitely going
to be congruent to TA.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.200
Because both sides of
these trapezoids

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.480
are going to be symmetric.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.730
And so there's no way you
could have RP being a

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.160
different length than TA.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.340
Since this trapezoid is
perfectly symmetric, since

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.800
it's isoceles.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.610
And then D, RP bisects TA.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.710
Let's say if I were to draw
this trapezoid slightly

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.870
differently.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.170
If it looks something
like this.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.380
If this was the trapezoid.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.640
This is also an isosceles
trapezoid.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.830
And then the diagonals
would look like this.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.050
So here, it's pretty clear that
they're not bisecting

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.440
each other.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.600
In order for them to bisect each
other, this length would

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.760
have to be equal
to that length.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.370
And that's clear just by
looking at it that

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.890
that's not the case.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.280
That is not equal to that.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.990
So they're definitely not
bisecting each other.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.860
So you can really, in this
problem, knock out

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.240
choices A, B and D.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.510
And say oh well choice
C looks pretty good.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.760
But you can actually deduce that
by using an argument of

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.010
all of the angles.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.820
Anyway, that's going
to waste your time.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.180
But that's a good exercise
for you.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.120
Is to make the formal proof
argument of why this is true.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.210
Although, you can make a pretty
good intuitive argument

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.210
just based on the symmetry
of the triangle itself.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.750
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
