00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.370
I want to build on what
we did in the last

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.660
video a little bit.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.110
Let's say we have two
random variables.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.690
So I have random variable x.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.650
And let me draw its probability
distribution.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.210
And actually, it doesn't
have to be normal.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.640
But I'll just draw it as
a normal distribution.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.300
So this is the distribution
of random variable x.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.710
This is the mean.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.160
The population mean of
random variable x.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.670
And then it has some type
of standard deviation.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.850
Actually, let me just focus
on the variance.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.960
So it has some variance right
here for random variable x.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.510
This is x, the distribution
for x.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.430
Let's say we have another
random variable.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.720
Random variable y.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.020
Let's do the same
thing for it.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.050
Let's draw its distribution.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.530
And let me draw the parameters
for that distribution.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.890
So it has some true mean, some
population mean for the random

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.710
variable y.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.570
And it has some variance
right over here.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.940
And I've drawn it
roughly normal.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.610
Once again, we don't have to
assume that it's normal.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.920
Because we're going to assume,
when we go to the next level,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.080
that when we take the samples,
we're taking enough samples

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.030
that the central limit theorem
will actually apply.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.160
But with that said, let's
think about the sampling

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.000
distributions of each of
these random variables.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.900
So let's think about the
sampling distribution of the

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.745
sample mean of x.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.130
Let's say the sample size
over here is going

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.550
to be equal to n.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.990
So what is that going
to look like?

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.410
Well it's going to be
some distribution.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.180
And we're assuming that n is
a fairly large number.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.920
So this is going to be a
normal distribution.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.856
Or it can be approximated with
a normal distribution.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.510
Let me shift it over
a little bit.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.180
I'm going to draw it a
little bit narrow.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.500
Let me draw the mean.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.440
So the population mean of the
sampling distribution is going

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.110
to be denoted with this x bar,
that tells us the distribution

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.490
of the means when the
sample size is n.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.970
And we know that this is going
to be the same thing as the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.810
population mean for that
random variable.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.660
And we know from the central
limit theorem that the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.870
variance of the sampling
distribution or, often called

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.260
the standard error of the mean,
is going to be equal to

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.070
the population variance
divided by this

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.320
n right over here.

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:05.490
And if you wanted the standard
deviation of this, you just

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.300
take the square root
of both sides.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.710
Let's do the same thing
for random variable y.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.040
Let's take the sampling
distribution

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.040
of the sample mean.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.270
But here, we're talking about
y, random variable y.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.500
And let's just say it has
a different sample size.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.710
It doesn't have to be
a different one.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.450
But it just shows you that it
doesn't have to be the same.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:37.360
So it has a sample size of m.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.730
Let me draw its distribution
right over here.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.170
Once again, it'll be a narrower
distribution than the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.180
population distribution.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.970
And it will be approximately
normal, assuming that we have

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.730
a large enough sample size.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.160
And the mean of the sampling
distribution of the sample

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.010
mean is going to be the same
thing as the population mean.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.260
We've seen that multiple
times.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:14.620
And its variance for the sample
means, or the standard

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.890
error of the mean.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.339
Actually, this isn't
the standard error.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.829
Standard error would be the
square root of this.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.170
So if I called this standard
error of the

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.820
mean, that's wrong.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.200
The standard error of the mean
is the square root of this.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.310
It's the standard deviation.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.940
This is the variance
of the mean.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.210
Don't want to confuse you.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.080
So the variance of the mean here
is going to be the exact

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.590
same thing.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:41.110
It's going to be the variance
of the population divided by

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.360
our sample size.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.860
And everything we've done so
far is complete review.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.350
It's a little different, because
I'm actually doing it

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.030
with two different
random variables.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.720
And I'm doing it with
two different random

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.840
variables for a reason.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.640
Because now I'm going to define
a new random variable.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.400
We could just call it z.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.450
But z is equal to
the difference

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.110
of our sample means.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:25.030
It's equal to the x sample mean
minus the y sample mean.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.240
So what does that really mean?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.090
Well, to get a sample mean,
or at least for this

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.500
distribution, you're taking
n samples from this

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.490
population over here.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.620
Maybe n is 10.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.800
You're taking 10 samples
and finding its mean.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.390
That sample mean is
a random variable.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.940
Let's say you take 10 samples
from here and you get 9.2 when

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.060
you find their mean.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.570
That 9.2 can be viewed as a
sample from this distribution

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.760
right over here.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.820
Same thing if this
right here is m.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.600
Or if m right here is 12.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.930
You're taking 12 samples,
taking its mean.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.360
And that sample mean, maybe it's
15.2, could be viewed as

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.120
a sample from this
distribution.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.940
As a sample from the sampling
distribution.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.920
So what z is, z is a random
variable where you're taking n

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.770
samples from this distribution
up here, this population

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.470
distribution, taking its mean.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.020
Then you're taking m samples
from this population

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.830
distribution up here,
taking its mean.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.610
And then finding the difference
between that mean

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.050
and that mean.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.660
So it's another random
veritable.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.970
But what is the distribution
of the z?

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.230
So let's draw it.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.300
Well there's a couple
of things we

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.520
immediately know about z.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.210
And we kind of came up with
this in the last video.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:58.430
Instead of writing z, I'm just
going to write the mean of x

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:05.550
bar, which is a sample from the
sampling distribution of

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.960
x, or the sample mean of x,
minus the sample mean of y.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.020
We saw this in the last video.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.780
In fact, I think I still
have the work up here.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.330
Yeah, I still have the
work right up here.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.350
The mean of the difference
is going to be the

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.720
difference of the means.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.490
The mean of the difference
is the same thing is the

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.270
difference of the means.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.100
So the mean of this new
distribution right over here

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:38.790
is going to be the same thing as
the mean of our sample mean

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.425
minus the mean of our
sample mean of y.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.380
And this might seem a little
abstract in this video.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.550
In the next video, we're
actually going to do this with

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.460
concrete numbers.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.180
And hopefully it'll make a
little bit more sense.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.540
And just so you know where we're
going with this, the

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.820
whole point of this is so that
we can eventually do some

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.580
inferential statistics about
differences of means.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.990
How likely is a difference of
means of two samples, random

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.410
chance or not random chance?

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.260
Or what is a confidence
interval of the

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.120
difference of means?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.410
That's what this is all
building up to.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.200
So anyway, we know
the mean of this

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.960
distribution right over here.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.060
And what's the variance
of this distribution?

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.250
We came up with that result
in the last video.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.090
If we're taking essentially the
difference of two random

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.190
variables, the variance is going
to be the sum of those

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.800
two random variables.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.580
And the whole point of that
video is to show that it's not

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.870
the difference of the
variances, it's

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.970
the sum of the variances.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.630
The variance of this new
distribution-- and I haven't

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.880
drawn the distribution yet--
The variance of this new

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.210
distribution, I'll just write x
bar minus y bar, is going to

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.310
be equal to the sum of the
variances of each of these

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.440
distributions.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:57.060
The variance of x bar plus
the variance of y bar.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.250
Actually, let me just
draw this here.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.190
Just so we can visualize
another distribution.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.230
Although, all I'm going to
draw is another normal

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.480
distribution.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.070
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.670
So the mean over here, the mean
of x bar minus y bar, is

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.350
going to be equal to
the difference of

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.130
these means over here.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.405
I don't have to rewrite it.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.310
Let me draw the curve.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.390
And notice, I'm drawing a fatter
curve than either one.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.120
And why am I doing that?

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.620
Because the variance here is the
sum of the variances here.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.950
So we're going to have
a fatter curve.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.330
It's going to have a bigger
variance, or a bigger standard

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.360
deviation than either
of these.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.145
So then we have some variance
here, variance of

00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:49.390
x bar minus y bar.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.230
Now what are these, in terms
of the original population

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.270
distribution?

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.280
We came up with those results
right over here.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.020
We know what the standard
deviation is.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:05.680
We know that this thing is the
same thing as the variance of

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.130
the population distribution
divided by n.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.825
We've done this multiple,
multiple times.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.630
What's this going
to be equal to?

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.820
This is right here is the same
thing as the variance of our

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.136
population distribution.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.040
And the x just means this is
for random variable x.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.500
But there's no bar on top.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.420
This is the actual population
distribution, not the sampling

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.200
distribution of the
sample mean.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.390
So that divided by n.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.280
And then if we want the variance
of the sampling

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.560
distribution for y, let me do
that in a different color.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.420
I'll use blue, because that was
what we were using for the

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.020
y random variable.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.170
That's going to be equal to
this thing over here.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.420
And we've done this
multiple times.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.290
Same exact logic as this.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:55.990
The population distribution
for y divided by m.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.770
And so once again, I'll just
write this out front.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.860
This is the variance
of the differences

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.110
of the sample means.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.030
And now if you wanted the
standard deviation of the

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.910
differences of the sample means,
you just have to take

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.620
the square root of both
sides of this.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.420
You take the square root of
this, you get the standard

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.770
deviation of the difference of
the sample means is equal to

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:30.050
the square root of the
population distribution of x.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.780
Or the variance of the
population distribution of x

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:40.540
divided by n plus the variance
of the population distribution

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:47.120
of y divided by m.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.870
And this is just neat.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.040
Because it kind of looks
a little bit

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.350
like a distance formula.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.130
I'll throw that out there as we
get more sophisticated with

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.630
our statistics and try to
visualize what all of this

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.130
kind of stuff means in
more advanced topics.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.710
But the whole point of this is,
now we can make inferences

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.060
about a difference of means.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.550
If we have two samples, and we
take the means of both of

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.730
those samples and we find some
difference, we can make some

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.640
conclusions about
how likely that

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.750
difference was just by chance.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.310
And we're going to do that
in the next video.
