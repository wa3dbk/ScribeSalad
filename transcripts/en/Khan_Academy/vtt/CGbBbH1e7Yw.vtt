00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.289
- [Teacher] So, just as a
reminder of where we are,

00:00:02.289 --> 00:00:04.571
we've got this very
non-linear transformation

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.558
and we showed that if you zoom
in on a specific point while

00:00:07.558 --> 00:00:09.046
that transformation is happening,

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:10.968
it looks a lot like something linear

00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:12.772
and we reason that you can figure out

00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:14.854
what linear transformation that looks like

00:00:14.854 --> 00:00:17.922
by taking the partial derivatives
of your given function,

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:19.897
the one that I defined up here,

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:22.514
and then turning that into a matrix.

00:00:22.514 --> 00:00:24.599
And what I want to do here
is basically just finish up

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.315
what I was talking about by computing all

00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:27.802
of those partial derivatives.

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:30.298
So, first of all, let me
just rewrite the function

00:00:30.298 --> 00:00:31.553
back on the screen so we have it

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:33.598
in a convenient place to look at.

00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:37.884
The first component is x plus sin of y.

00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:40.217
Sin of y and then y plus sin

00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:45.097
of x was the second component.

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:47.390
So, what I want to do
here is just compute all

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.819
of those partial derivatives to show

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.627
what kind of thing this looks like.

00:00:50.627 --> 00:00:54.270
So, let's go ahead and
get rid of this word

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.401
and I'll go ahead and kind
of redraw the matrix here.

00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.868
So, for that upper left component,

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:01.723
we're taking the partial derivative

00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:04.231
with respect to x of the first component.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.799
So, we look up at this first component

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.335
and the partial derivative
with respect to x is just one.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:12.049
Since there's one times x plus
something that has nothing

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.005
to do with x and then below that,

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:15.064
we take the partial derivative

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:17.829
of the second component
with respect to x down here.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.593
And that guy, the y, well
that looks like a constant

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:22.995
so nothing happens, and
the derivative of sin

00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:25.328
of x becomes cosine of x.

00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:30.563
And then up here, we're
taking the partial derivative

00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:32.826
with respect to y of the first component;

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.739
that upper one here, and for that,

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:37.779
partial derivative of x,
with respect to y, is zero

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:39.626
and partial derivative of sin of y,

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:42.459
with respect to y, is cosine of y.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:46.343
And then, finally, the partial derivative

00:01:46.343 --> 00:01:50.506
of the second component with
respect to y looks like one

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:54.151
because it's just one
times y plus some constant.

00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.461
And this is the general Jacobian
as a function of x and y,

00:01:57.461 --> 00:01:58.986
but if we want to understand what happens

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:01.383
around this specific
point that started off

00:02:01.383 --> 00:02:04.110
at, well, I think I recorded
it here at negative two, one,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.779
we plug that in to each
one of these values.

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:10.367
So, when we plug in negative two, one.

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:12.409
So go ahead and just
kind of again, rewrite it

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.979
to remember we're plugging
in negative two, one

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:20.133
as our specific point,
that matrix as a function,

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.257
kind of a matrix valued function,

00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:25.307
becomes one, and then next we have cosine,

00:02:25.307 --> 00:02:27.705
but we're plugging in negative two for x,

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:30.036
cosine of negative two,
and if you're curious,

00:02:30.036 --> 00:02:32.580
that is approximately equal to,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.249
I calculated this earlier.

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:38.158
Negative zero point four
two, if you just want

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.758
to think in terms of a number there.

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:42.993
Then for the upper right,
we have cosine again,

00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:45.118
but now we're plugging in the value for y,

00:02:45.118 --> 00:02:48.550
which is one and cosine of
one is approximately equal

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.467
to zero point five four;
and then bottom right,

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.212
that's just another constant: one.

00:02:56.212 --> 00:03:00.250
So, that is the matrix, just
as a matrix full of numbers,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.361
and just as kind of a gut
check we can take a look

00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:05.148
at the linear transformation
this was supposed to look like,

00:03:05.148 --> 00:03:07.008
and notice how the first basis factor,

00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:10.615
the thing it got turned into,
which is this factor here,

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:13.182
does look like it has coordinates one

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:15.210
and negative zero point four two, right?

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.669
It's got this rightward component

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.792
that's about as long as
the vector itself started

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:20.188
and then this downward component,

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:21.920
which I think that's pretty believable

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.523
that that's negative zero point four two.

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:26.821
And then, likewise, this
second column is telling us

00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:29.120
what happened to that second basis factor,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.115
which is the one that looks like this.

00:03:32.115 --> 00:03:35.529
And again, its y component
is about as long as

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:37.982
how it started, right, the length of one.

00:03:37.982 --> 00:03:40.833
And then the rightward component
is around half of that,

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:42.663
and we actually see that in the diagram,

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:43.847
but this is something you compute.

00:03:43.847 --> 00:03:44.801
Again, it's pretty straightforward.

00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:47.696
You just take all of the
possible partial derivatives,

00:03:47.696 --> 00:03:50.172
and you organize them
into a grid like this.

00:03:50.172 --> 00:03:52.405
So, with that, I'll see
you guys next video.
