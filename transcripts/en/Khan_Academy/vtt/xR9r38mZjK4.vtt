00:00:00.273 --> 00:00:07.464
what i want to do with this video is think about the relationship between variables and then think about what the graph of that relationship should look like.

00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:13.212
So let's say these two axis, the horizontal axis over here I plot

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:20.065
the price of a product and lets say this vertical axis over here i plot the demand for the product, and

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:24.498
i'm only plotting the first quadrant here because i'm assuming that the price can only be positive and

00:00:24.498 --> 00:00:30.320
i'm assuming that the demand can only be positive, that people aren't going to pay someone to take the product

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.114
away from them. So let's think about what would happen for the price and demand for most normal products.

00:00:37.114 --> 00:00:43.231
So, if the price is low, you would expect that a lot of poeple are willing to buy that thing they're

00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:46.652
like "Oh it's a good price, i would like to buy it."

00:00:46.652 --> 00:00:51.163
So, if the price is low, then the demand would be high so maybe it would be somplace over here, all the

00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:54.697
way that you would have really high demand if the price was zero.

00:00:54.697 --> 00:00:58.581
so if the price was low the demand would be high.

00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:02.331
Now what happens is the price -- so right here the price is low, demand is high, if the price were to

00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:06.464
go up a little bit then maybe the demand goes down a little bit, right?

00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:09.280
price went up a little bit demand went down a little bit.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.165
if the price went up a little bit more then maybe demand goes down a little bit more.

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:17.849
as the price went up a bunch then demand would go down a bunch and so the line that represents how the

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:28.115
demand relates to price might look something like this, and i'm just going to assume it's

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:33.099
it a line. It might not be a line, it might be a curve. It might look something like that.

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:37.766
Or it might look something like that. But in general is someone were to ask you,

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:43.030
if you saw this magenta curve that as price increases what happens to demand.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.931
You just say "Well look price increases, as price increases what happens to demand?"

00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:53.731
Well demand is decreasing. Now let's think about a different scenario.

00:01:53.731 --> 00:02:02.951
Let's talk about the demand for real estate. For actual property, and lets say that on this axis

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:08.648
that we plot the population. The population in the area, and this right over here this is

00:02:08.648 --> 00:02:17.682
demand for land. So when the population is very low, you can imagine, if the population is

00:02:17.682 --> 00:02:23.447
zero there is no one there that would want to buy land. So if the population is very low

00:02:23.447 --> 00:02:26.914
the demand is going to be very low. And as population increases, demand should increase.

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:31.280
If the population increases, more people are going to want to buy land. And if the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.564
population goes up a bunch then a lot of people are going to want to buy land. So you'll see a

00:02:36.564 --> 00:02:41.364
line that looks something like this. And once again I drew a line, it doesn't have to be a line

00:02:41.364 --> 00:02:47.581
it could be a curve of some kind. It could be a curve that looks something like that, or a curve

00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:50.397
that looks something like that. We don't know but the general idea is that if someone

00:02:50.397 --> 00:02:56.498
showed you a graph that looked like this. And as population increases what happens to demand.

00:02:56.498 --> 00:03:00.231
We'll you'd say "Look, this is population increasing, what happens to demand?" Demand

00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:07.049
is going up. Where as price increased the demand went down. Here as population is increasing

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.180
demand went up. And you can just make that more general with variables. We're talking about

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.298
specific cases here. But if I were to plot something like this, if you were to see a graph that

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:26.479
looked like that and this is the variable x and this is the variable y. And someone were to ask you what

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:38.465
happens to y as x increases. Well you take any x that's the y that we have for that x.

00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:42.713
And as you increase x, as you move in the positive horizontal directions. As you increase

00:03:42.713 --> 00:03:49.850
x what is happening to y? Y is going up. So for this example, as x increases

00:03:49.850 --> 00:04:00.098
y is increasing. If we had a graph that looked like this. Let's call that the

00:04:00.098 --> 00:04:05.530
a axis and this is the b axis and maybe our graph looked like this.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:14.281
What happens as A increases? If you pick an A right over here. We're at that A and that B.

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:24.897
As A increases what's happening to B? Well as A increases our B is lower. As A

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:32.931
increases here B is decreasing. So, just wanting to give you a general idea, when X and Y increased

00:04:32.931 --> 00:04:39.864
together the line goes from the bottom left to the top right, we would call this an upward sloping line.

00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:49.115
We would call this a positive slope. Everytime X is increased Y also increases is upwards sloping.

00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:54.857
When our independant variable increases and our dependent variable decreases.

00:04:54.857 --> 00:05:05.466
When the independent variable is increasing, then you say it has a downward slope, when you go from the top left to the bottom right.
