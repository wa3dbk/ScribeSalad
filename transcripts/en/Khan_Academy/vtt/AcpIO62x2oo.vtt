00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680
 

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.380
Find the sum of negative 15 plus
negative 46 plus negative 29.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.180
To do this, let's
just first visualize

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.830
what each of these
numbers look like.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.300
So I'm going to draw a
number line for each of them.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.140
Negative 15 might look
something like this.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.790
So if this is 0 and let's
say that this is negative 15,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.270
I could represent
negative 15 as--

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.960
if I'd like to-- an arrow that
points from 0 to negative 15.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.340
The length of the arrow is
the absolute value of this.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.920
It's the distance from 0.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.680
So the length here is 15.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.130
And the negative says that
we are pointing to the left.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.600
So the absolute value is 15.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.320
That's the length of that arrow.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.760
Let's do the same
thing for negative 46.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.820
So once again, let me
draw my number line.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.070
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.270
0 is going to be
right over there.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.420
And negative 46 is going
to be someplace over here.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.610
Negative 46.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.730
Notice, same exact idea.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.720
The distance between negative
46 and 0-- or another way

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.130
to think about that is the
absolute value of negative 46--

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.215
this distance right over
here is going to be 46.

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:14.700
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.980
And its direction
is to the left.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.167
That is why we get to
the number negative 46.

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:23.500
The negative really tells you
whether you're to the left

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.390
or to the right of 0,
but the absolute value

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.850
says how far are you to
the left or the right of 0.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.345
And then, finally, let's do
the same thing for negative 29.

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:35.280
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.390
So once again, let me
draw my number line.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.280
 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.740
I want to use the yellow again.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.640
So draw my number line.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.190
Let's say this is 0.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.180
Then negative 29 is going
to be roughly over here.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.600
I'm estimating it.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.510
And once again, negative 29
is exactly 29 away from 0.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.120
So this length right over here
is 29, and it is to the left.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.630
That is why it is negative 29.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.930
If it was positive 29, it
would be 29 to the right of 0.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.090
So we've represented
all of these numbers.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.389
And you can see what their
absolute values are like.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.680
And now let's think about
what happens if you add them.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.910
So one way to think about
adding these numbers

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.090
is if you added
these arrows, if you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.120
put this arrow on
top of this arrow

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.660
or to the left of this
arrow, if you started where

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.940
this arrow leaves off-- and
then you put this green arrow,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.390
and then you put
the orange arrow.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.160
So let's do that.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.170
 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.100
Let's draw that.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.410
It's going to be a
longer arrow now.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.720
So we're going to start at 0.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.180
First, we have the negative 15.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.520
So we're going to move
15 spaces to the left

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.765
to get us to negative 15.

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:46.580
 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.740
Then we're going to go
46 spaces to the left

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.350
to get us to negative
15 plus negative 46.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.770
So let me draw that.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.740
So then we're going
to go-- and we're

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.160
going to figure out what
that number is in a second.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.370
So then we're going
to go 46 to the left.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.710
That's about that far.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.120
Really just this arrow,
I'm now placing it.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.260
I'm starting off where
the negative 15 left off,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.410
and then I'm putting
that arrow after that.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.555
And we don't know yet what
number this gets us to.

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:19.430
We're going to have to
do a little math here.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.030
And that's actually the
point of this problem.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.960
But we know what the
length of this arrow is.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.645
The length of this arrow is 46.

00:03:24.645 --> 00:03:27.260
It is 46 to the
left, and we know

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.500
the length of this
magenta arrow is 15.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.910
And then, finally, we
have this orange arrow.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.810
The orange arrow, which we
know has a length of 29.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.670
Although, it's 29 to the left.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.080
It looks like that.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.930
It has a length of 29.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.790
So when all is said
and done, where are we?

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.590
Where do we end up
on our number line?

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.460
Well, the total length
that we are to the left

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.220
is going to be 15
plus 46 plus 29.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.620
But it's going to
be to the left,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.160
so it's going to be negative.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.490
So what we can really view
this as, since all of these

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.020
have the same sign,
is we could say,

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.620
look, this is the same
thing as the absolute value

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.680
of negative 15, which is
15, plus the absolute value

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.210
of negative 46, which is
46, plus the absolute value

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.510
of negative 29,
which is 29, but then

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.260
take the negative value of it.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.300
So let's just add that.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:24.580
15 plus 46 plus 29 is equal
to, let's see-- 5 plus 6 is 11.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.480
11 plus 9 is 20.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.330
Carry the 2.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.900
2 plus 1 is 3.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.186
3 plus 4 is 7.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:32.330
7 plus 2 is 9.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.330
So you get 90.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.120
So this entire
length here is 90.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.300
The entire length, if you add
up the arrows, you get a 90.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.220
But it is not 90 to the right.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.870
So if it was 90 to the right,
these would all be positives.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.578
And then we would just
get a positive 90.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.020
But this is 90 to the left.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.560
So when you add these guys up,
you don't get to positive 90.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.860
You get to negative 90.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.760
So one way to think about it
is these are all the same sign.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.000
So this is going to be
equal to the negative

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.560
of the absolute
value of negative 15

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.710
plus the absolute
value of negative 46

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.410
plus the absolute
value of negative 29.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.590
And the reason why we're
writing this here-- this

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.089
might look fancy,
but this is really

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:21.110
just the length of
this purple arrow.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.440
This absolute value
of negative 46,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.750
that's really just the
length of the green arrow.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.890
46.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.590
And this is just the
length of the orange arrow.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.380
So this is 15 plus 46
plus 29, gave us 90,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.600
but it is to the left.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.391
So that is why it
is negative 90.

00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:40.891
