00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.700
Let's try to get our heads
around the idea of divergence.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.890
So first, like I did with
gradients, I'll show you the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.050
mechanics, which are actually
pretty straightforward.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.280
And then I'll try to
give you the intuition.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.036
And once you have the
intuition, at first it

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:16.820
will seemed very, I don't
know, unintuitive, maybe.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.610
But it once you get it,
you're like oh, that's it.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.380
So let's see what
divergence is.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.870
Let's say I have
a vector field.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.920
And let's say this vector
field, just for the purposes

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.320
of visualization it could be
anything, but let's say it

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.130
represents the velocity of
particles of fluid of any

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.650
point in two dimensions.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.690
So it's going to be a
two-dimensional vector field.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.860
It's going to be a function of
x and y, so the velocity at any

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.140
point-- it's a vector field --
let's say it is, and I'm just

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.880
going to make up something.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.670
Let's say it's x squared, yi.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.710
So at any point in the
x-direction, at any point x

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.730
comma y, its velocity in the
x-direction will

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.860
be x squared, y.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.230
And then its velocity in the
y-direction, I don't know

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.080
maybe it's just 3y, j.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.240
That's its velocity
in the x-direction.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.310
So its velocity in the
x-direction is actually

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.680
a function of x and y.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.475
its velocity in the y-direction
is just a function of y.

00:01:26.475 --> 00:01:29.030
So what is the divergence?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.090
So a couple of ways
we can write it.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.560
The correct way to write
it is the divergence of

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.170
our vector field, v.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.610
But a common mnemonic to
remember the operation of

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.820
diverge and is to write the
upside down triangle, which was

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.270
the same notation we used for
gradient, but take the dot

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.630
product of that and the vector.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.980
And if you remember from the
gradient discussion, we said

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.240
that you can view, although
it's kind of an abuse of

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.440
notation, but you could view
this upside down triangle as

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.070
being equal to the partial
derivative with respect to x in

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.330
the x-direction plus the
partial derivative with respect

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.320
to y in the y-direction,
which is the j-unit vector.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.180
And then if we went to three
dimensions, the partial

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.170
derivative with respect to
z and the k-direction,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.870
et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.590
But we're dealing with a
two-dimensional vector here,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.700
so let's just stick with
two dimensions, x and y.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.720
So what would this
turn out to be?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.520
If you took the dot product of
this, which is this upside down

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.720
triangle, with this vector
field, what would you get?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.650
Well, you would just get the
partial derivative of the x

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.150
dimension with respect to x, so
you would get-- it's actually

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.950
pretty straight forward to
memorize; you might not even

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.360
need this mnemonic right here,
this abuse of notation; you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.990
might just know it off hand
--the x component, you take the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.683
partial derivative with respect
to x, and the y component, you

00:03:07.683 --> 00:03:09.470
take the partial derivative
with respect to y.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.430
But I'll show you why it
looks like the dot product.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.790
So if you took the dot product
of that and that, it would be

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.310
the partial derivative with
respect to x of that

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:26.500
expression, of x squared, y and
then plus the partial

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.170
derivative with respect to y of
that second expression, the y

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.930
component of 3y, and then
you would evaluate it.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.950
What's the partial derivative
of this with respect to x?

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.410
We just pretended y is a
constant, just a number, so

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.670
the derivative of this with
respect to x, would be

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.340
2x times the constant.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.810
So it'll be 2xy plus-- what's
the partial derivative

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.460
of 3y with respect to y?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.295
Well, there's nothing else to
hold constant, so it's just

00:04:02.295 --> 00:04:03.930
like taking the derivative
with respect to y

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.340
--so it's 2y plus 3.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.070
So this is the divergence
at a point x, y.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.290
You could almost view it
as a function of x and y.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.170
So you could almost say you
know, that the divergence of

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.310
v-- I'm going to make up some
notation here --as long as you

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.870
get the point across, you can
say that the divergence

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.470
of v, that this is a
function of x and y.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.760
That we just have an expression
that if you give me a point

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.290
anywhere in this vector
field, I can tell you the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.430
divergence at that point.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.640
So I think you'll find that
the computation of divergence

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.910
isn't too difficult.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.260
You just take the partial
derivative of the x component

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.550
with respect to x, and you add
that to the partial derivative

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.480
to the y component
with respect to y.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.450
And if you had the z, you
would do the same thing,

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.580
so on and so forth.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.130
Actually, let me do just do one
more just hit the point home,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.375
and then we'll work
on intuition.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.170
So if I said that I had, I
don't know, let's say, my

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:10.455
vector field is cosine of yi
plus-- so it's interesting; my

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:14.980
x-direction is dependent on
my y-coordinate --plus, I

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.040
don't know, e to the xyj.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.820
So then oh, that's difficult
because I have these

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.210
e's and these cosines.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.770
But we'll see; if you just
keep your head straight on

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.150
what's constant and what's
not, it's not too bad.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:41.230
So the divergence of v is equal
to the partial derivative

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.080
of this expression
with respect to x.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.050
Well, what's the derivative
of this with respect to x?

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.200
If y is just a constant,
cosine of y is just a number.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.670
So the derivative of this with
respect to x is just 0 plus--

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.110
what's the derivative of
this with respect to y?

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.660
Well, you could just do x,
since it's a constant,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.130
as the coefficient on y.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.590
So the derivative of x, y
with respect to y is just x.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.830
And then the derivative of e
to anything is e to anything.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.670
I just did the chain rule.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.430
e to the x, y.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.100
And so that is the divergence.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.130
So you could just ignore this.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.490
It's x, e to the x, y.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.360
One thing to immediately
realize, even before we work on

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.400
the intuition, is when we did
gradient I gave you a surface

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.980
and it gave us a vector field.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.700
Or I gave you a scalar field
and you got a vector field.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.250
When you take the divergence of
something, you're going in the

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.310
opposite direction,
in some ways.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.420
You start with the
vector field, right?

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.170
And what's a factor field?

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.770
It's something that if you
give me any point x and y,

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.810
I'll give you a vector.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.830
So if you wanted to graph it,
in the x, y plane you'd have a

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.120
bunch of vectors, and I'll show
you how that looks in a second

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.200
when we go over to intuition.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.040
Well, when you take the
divergence of it, you get a

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.000
value for any point x, y.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.080
So even though a vector field
has all these vectors on it,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.180
the divergence tells you an
actual scalar number at

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.180
any point in the field.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.950
So let's get a little bit
of intuition of what a

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.050
divergence actually is.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.040
Let me do it in one dimension.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.770
Or we can even, let's do it
in two dimensions, but I'll

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.600
make it constant in the y.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.010
So let's say that my-- let me
erase this; I'll probably

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.270
need some space.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.270
OK, oh, I didn't want
to do that dot.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.250
OK let's say the velocity of
fluid, or the particles in

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.180
fluid, at any point in the x, y
plane, let's say it is equal to

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:51.140
5xi plus, I don't know, 0y--
there's never any, sorry --0j,

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.510
right? j is the unit vector
in the y-direction.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.190
So there's never a y component
to the velocity vector.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.250
So what would that look like?

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.570
I don't need a computer
to draw this.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.480
I can handle this
one myself I think.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.250
So if that's the y-axis,
that's my x-axis.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.200
So when x is equal-- I'll just
sample some points and draw

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.740
some vectors --when x is equal
to 1-- let's say x is 1 there

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.580
--what's the magnitude
of this vector?

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.740
It'll be 5, right?

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.730
Actually, let me make this a
different number, because

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.620
it'll make it hard to do.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.070
Let's make this 1/2 x.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.980
So when x is 1, the magnitude
of my vector is 1/2.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.850
Only in the x-direction.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.480
It has no y component;
ignore this right here.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.460
It's 1/2xi plus 0j.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.000
Or you could just say 1/2xi.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.180
And when x is equal to 2-- I
could have picked any points,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.600
but I'm just picking the
numbers that's easy to

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.020
calculate --when x is equal to
2, what is the magnitude

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.650
of the vector?

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.420
It's 1/2 times 2, which is 1.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.870
So it's going to
be twice as big.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.160
And remember, if I have a
particle right here in my

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.680
fluid, if this is a particle,
its velocity in the x-direction

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.010
is going to be 1 meter
per second to the right.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.850
If I have a particle here, it's
velocity in the x-direction

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.160
is going to be 1/2 a meter
per second to the right.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.720
Let's just do one more point.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.820
So let's say that
x is equal to 3.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.740
What's my velocity
to the right?

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.210
I'll do it in a different
color just so that you

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.310
don't get confused.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.440
There's going to be 3/2; it's
going to be even longer.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.550
But the general idea here,
and as we move up in x it

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.710
doesn't change much, right?

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.340
It doesn't change at all.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.786
Our x value doesn't--

00:09:48.786 --> 00:09:49.660
[COUGHS].

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.280
So for any y, the magnitude
of the vector doesn't

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:54.760
change, right?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.090
It's only dependent on x.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.000
And then for example, here,
it'll be even longer.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.950
If we draw the vector here
it'll be even longer, right?

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.150
If you do it here.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.990
I think you get the point.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.830
The further you go to the
right, the faster the particles

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.260
are moving towards the right.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.030
So now let's try to get a
little bit of intuition.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.870
Oh, I just realized that I ran
out of time, so I will continue

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.370
this in the next video.
