00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.270
In the last video, we showed
that if you had a line, which

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.020
we'll call a directrix--
we draw the directrix.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.780
That's our directrix and it has
the equation y is equal to k.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.450
And you have a point, that's
our focus, and it's the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.510
coordinate a comma b.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.910
That the locus of all points in
the xy plane that are

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.530
equidistant to this focus and
this directrix has a shape that

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.520
looks something-- we know that
this was a point-- that

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.480
looks something like this.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.830
And the actually equation, we
actually just took an arbitrary

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.650
xy in the coordinate plane, and
we said that xy has to satisfy

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.900
the condition that its distance
to this focus is equal to--

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.460
that this distance right here
is equal to this distance here.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.170
And we set that up using the
distance formula to here, and

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.710
then setting that equal to the
distance to the line,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.670
to the directrix.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.800
And then we did a bunch of
algebra and we got this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.440
equation right here.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.270
For all of the points in the xy
plane that satisfy the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.870
conditions that its distance to
the focus is equal to the

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.360
distance to this line.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.040
And we hopefully satisfied
ourselves that this is

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.830
in fact a parabola.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.100
And although it looks a little
bit hairier than most parabolas

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.690
we see, I think if you look
at it closely, you'll realize

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.820
that it is indeed a parabola.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.040
For example, the classic
parabola is y is

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.050
equal to x squared.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.420
How is this the same
thing as this?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.320
Well in this case, this
coefficient out here

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.530
is just equal to 1.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:42.410
So in this case, 1 over 2 b
minus k is equal to 1, right?

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.160
Let me delete that little
thing there, because it

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.900
looks like a squared.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.790
All right, the coefficient
in front of the x squared

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.950
term is equal to a 1.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.940
What is a equal to?

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.780
Well this is the same
thing-- actually, let

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.760
me rewrite it that way.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.520
I could rewrite this equation
right here as y minus 0 is

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.320
equal to 1 times x
minus 0 squared.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.070
And now hopefully you see that
this has the same pattern as

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.520
this, although the y's and the
x's are just sitting

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.390
on different sides
of the equation.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.420
So here you see that the 1/2
over b minus k, that's the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.970
coefficient in front of the
x minus a squared term.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.290
So that's where we got that
that has to be equal to 1.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.470
a has to be equal to
0 in this situation.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.840
This curve right here is equal
to x squared, y is equal

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.040
to x squared, a is 0.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.650
And then b plus k over 2, this
is going to be equal to that.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.235
And keep in mind, I actually
swapped the left and

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:53.350
the right hand sides.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.050
But this is y minus something,
this is y minus 0.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.120
So this something has
to be equal to 0.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.640
So you get b plus k
over 2 is equal to 0.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.200
And now we should be able to
use this information to figure

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.660
out the actual coordinates of
the focus and the directrix of

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.495
what I would call the classic
parabola, y is equal

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:18.540
to x squared.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.500
So keep in mind what we did.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.930
In the last video, we said what
is the equation of the line

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.740
that is equidistant between
this focus and this directrix?

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.010
And we got this equation,
which we said, hey,

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.070
that's a parabola.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.530
Now we're going the
other way around.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.350
We say we have a parabola, and
we're saying that this parabola

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.580
is the set of all points that's
equidistant between some

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.530
focus and some directrix.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.240
What is that focus and
that directrix for this

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.410
particular parabola?

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.750
That's what we're trying to do.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.640
And the way we did that was, we
pattern matched this formula to

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.800
this one, to essentially set up
these variables, which

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.620
essentially define a focus
and a directrix, right?

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.290
b is the y-coordinate of the
focus, k defines the horizontal

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.290
line of the directrix.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.620
So if we can solve for b and
k, we know what the focus

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.390
and the directrix are.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.100
And for a, although
a is pretty easy.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.240
So let's do that.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.500
So if we know that 1 over 2
b minus k is equal to 1--

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.460
let me do that over here.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.190
I'm going to do it in
particular for this case right

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.090
here, but you don't want to do
that every time, so then we'll

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.760
do a more general formula that
we can just plug in next time

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.430
you see a new parabola.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.320
So if we multiply both sides of
this equation by 2 b minus k,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.340
you get 1 is equal to
2 times b minus k.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.590
Actually I should redivide both
sides by 2, so you get 1/2

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.110
is equal to b minus k.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.120
Fair enough.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.420
Let's see, this equation
right here, b plus k

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.310
over 2 is equal to 0.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.940
That means that b plus k
must be equal to 0, right?

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.610
This numerator has
to be equal to 0.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.320
So let me write that down.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.900
b plus k is equal to 0.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.710
Two linear equations
of to unknowns.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.590
Let's add them up.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.520
The k's cancel out.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.290
You get 2b is equal to 1/2.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.500
Divide both sides by 2, you
get b is equal to 1/4.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.180
And now what's k?

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.720
Well, we can just
resubstitute back.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.790
Let's use this equation.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.080
We get 0 is equal
to 1/4 plus k.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.060
You can figure that out by
inspection, but you can

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.720
subtract 1/4 from both sides.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.540
So this tells us that k
is equal to minus 1/4.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.690
So let's draw this.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.660
So if this is my coordinate
axis-- I'll do it in

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.010
a different color.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.940
That's the x-axis,
that's the y-axis.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.820
We're dealing with y is equal
to x squared, which you should

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.220
hopefully be reasonably
familiar with at this point.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.430
It's kind of the classic
U-shaped parabola that

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.720
looks just like that.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.350
Let me write that down.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.580
This is y is equal to x
squared, which we could have

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.690
rewritten as y minus 0 is equal
to 1 times x minus 0 squared.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.200
Same thing, that's this line.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.810
It's equidistant from a focus
and a directrix, where

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.040
this is the focus.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.330
And how do I know that the
focus is right there, instead

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.730
of right here or right there?

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.530
Well one, you could kind
of think about it.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.480
But the other thing to realize
is, what is the vertex

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.080
of this parabola?

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.940
And I think we've gone
over that already.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.206
But the vertex are the
coordinates given by this

00:06:40.206 --> 00:06:42.210
x value and this y value.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.290
Or what x values make this
whole term 0 and make

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.060
this whole term 0?

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.140
And that's essentially 0,0.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.780
So this is the vertex
of this parabola.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.930
This is the vertex,
0,0 is the vertex.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.560
I'll say v for vertex.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.560
In an upward opening parabola,
you can view that as

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.190
the minimum point.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.820
If it was a downward opening,
it would be the topmost

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.820
point, or the maximum point.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.910
That's the vertex.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.380
And we saw from when we solved
this, when we just did our

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:17.620
pattern matching, that the
x-coordinate of our focus is

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.400
equivalent to, if we just
pattern match right here, x

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.000
minus a squared, here you
have x minus 0 squared.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.720
This is always going to
be the same as this.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:34.220
So the x-coordinate of our
focus is always going to

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.830
be the same thing as the
x-coordinate of our vertex.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.050
So we figured out that
a was equal to 0.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.290
So the coordinate here is
0, and then what's b?

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.840
This was the coordinate 0,b.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.410
We figured out that b is
equal to 1/4, 0, 1/4.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.270
And then the directrix is
the line y is equal to k.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.500
In this case, we figure out
k is equal to minus 1/4.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.670
So our directrix is going
to be right down here.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.990
Right down here, like that.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.960
And it's going to be line
y is equal to minus 1/4.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.960
And that first of all
looks about right.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.600
And it also gels
with what we know.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.130
Because this point right here,
our vertex, is equidistant,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:22.390
it's 1/4 below our focus and
it's 1/4 above our directrix.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.810
So at least that little
reality check holds.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.900
But it's was a particular
circumstance, and you don't

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.270
want to have to go through this
whole situation every time you

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.910
have to figure out the focus or
the directrix of a parabola.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.850
So let's see if we can come up
with a more general solution.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.165
And actually what I'm
going to do is, I'm going

00:08:40.165 --> 00:08:41.700
to erase all of this.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.650
Just because I want to reuse
that, and I haven't committed

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.924
that formula to heart yet.

00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:52.050
Let me erase all of this,
and erase all the work

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:52.975
we did down here.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.990
So let's do a general form.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:02.480
And actually, I've abused this
so much, let me rewrite it.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.390
So I'll put the y's on the
left hand side, instead

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.950
of keep telling you that
I've switched them.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:13.030
So this is the same thing as--
I'll do it in-- the color

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.650
choosing is the hard part.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.730
I'll do it in this
light, off-white color.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:27.790
So you get y minus b plus k
over 2 is equal to 1 over 2

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:34.510
times b minus k, times
x minus a squared.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:40.000
This is the locus of all points
that are between the directrix,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.520
y is equal to k-- well, they're
equidistant to the directrix,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.720
y is equal to k, and
the focus a comma b.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.270
So let's say that I
have a parabola.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.080
And I'm going to try to
use different letters, so

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.210
we don't get confused.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.240
I give you the
parabola y minus y1.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:08.850
And let's say this parabola
has a vertex at x1 comma y1.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.050
So this parabola I'm drawing
has a vertex right there.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:16.710
So its formula will be y minus
y1 is equal to some constant,

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.890
let's make that a capital A.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.170
This capital A is different
than that lowercase a.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.380
This is what I was going to
embark on in the previous

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.260
video, and then I realized that
I was trying to load that video

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.240
up too much and probably
confusing you.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.180
So some constant factor, some
type of scaling factor, times

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.780
x minus the x value
of our vertex.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.930
So x1, all of that, squared.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.090
So if you're given this
parabola, or if you can get a

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:48.140
parabola to this form, how do
you figure out the a's, the

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.920
b's, and the k's so you know
the coordinates of the

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.160
directrix and the focus?

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.980
So the easy thing is to figure
out a, because you just

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.500
do a pattern match.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.480
This is going to
be equal to that.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.040
So you know that a
is equal to x1.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.910
So the x-coordinate of our
focus is the same as the

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.250
x-coordinate of our vertex.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.710
You can pattern match that this
scaling factor right here is

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.870
going to be the same thing
as this 1 over 2 b minus k.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.860
So let's write that down.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:26.450
A is equal to 1
over 2 b minus k.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:31.510
And then we have,
finally, this.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.520
Let me do another color.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.800
I'll do a magenta.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.930
The b plus k over 2, we
have y minus that thing.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.220
We have y minus y1.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.840
So that's going to
be equal to y1.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:48.350
So you have y1 is equal
to b plus k over 2.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.520
And now we have two equations
with two unknowns.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.135
Remember, this is
going to be a given.

00:11:52.135 --> 00:11:55.160
The A is going to be given, and
the y1 is going to be given.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.400
So now we can solve for
b and k in terms of the

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.360
numbers that we have.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.000
So let's see if we can do that.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.290
So if we multiply both sides of
this equation times b minus k,

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:11.480
you get b minus k times
A is equal to 1/2.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.220
Divide both sides by A,
you get b minus k is

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.260
equal to 1 over 2A.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.040
And on the right hand side,
let's use this other

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.840
formula right here.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.800
If we multiply both sides by
2-- I'll use a different

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:31.010
color-- you get 2 times
y1 is equal to b plus k.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.470
Two equations with
two unknowns.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.000
Let's take this and bring it
down here, so you get b plus

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.510
k is equal to 2 times y1.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:46.400
And so you add them, and you
get 2b is equal to-- the k's

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.080
cancel out; I'm just adding
these two equations--

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:55.570
1 over 2A plus 2 y1.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.980
Or b-- which is,
remember, what was b?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.250
That was the y-coordinate of
our focus-- is equal to, divide

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:08.680
everything by 2, is equal
to 1 over 4A plus y1.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.380
Which is interesting.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:14.910
It tells us that we take the
y-coordinate of our vertex

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.980
and we add 1 over 4A to it.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.700
Which is exactly what
happened last time, right?

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.210
I actually erased what
I did last time.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.980
But last time, when we
had y equal x squared,

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.830
this value was 0.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.040
The scaling factor was 1.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.090
So we saw that the y-coordinate
of our focus was 1/4.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.730
So this is gelling
with what we know.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.710
So that's our b.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.660
And let's see if we
can solve back for k.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:47.560
So we know that--
let's do it up here.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.580
We know that 2 y1 is equal
to b, which is 1 over

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.360
4A plus y1 plus k.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.360
We can subtract y1 from both
sides, so this goes away and

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.090
we just have a y1 there.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:06.640
Subtract 1 over 4A from both
sides and you get y1 minus

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.830
1 over 4A is equal to k.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.670
So then we are done.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.550
So this is interesting.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.640
Right now these might look
a little, these little

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.650
hairy formulas.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.870
But if we actually graph it,
I think they'll become a

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.720
little bit more intuitive.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.620
So once again, we had the
parabola y minus y1 is equal to

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.200
A times x minus x1 squared.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.950
And so the graph of that
parabola will look

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:37.740
something like this.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.800
I don't know where it is
relative to the x- and y-axis.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.500
It will look
something like this.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.690
It'll be this U shape.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:49.120
It could actually be downward
pointing, but I'll just assume

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.490
an upward pointing
parabola for now.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.110
That's this formula.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:59.490
Its vertex, right there,
its vertex is the

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.940
point x1 comma y1.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.140
Right?

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.660
What y value makes this
expression equal 0?

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.430
It's y1.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.910
What x value makes
that equal 0?

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.140
It's x1.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.090
Now notice, what is
this directrix?

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:19.080
It's the line ok, y equal to
k, but it's 1/4 less than

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.310
this value right here.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.410
So you literally just go down
1/4-- not just 1/4, 1/4

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.060
times this scaling factor.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.720
So it's 1/4 A.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.760
This distance is 1/4 A.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.215
And then you get your
directrix, right?

00:15:33.215 --> 00:15:37.900
It's y1 minus 1/4 A is
equal to k. y1 minus

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.550
1/4 A is equal to k.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.270
Or 1 over 4A.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:48.900
So your directrix is
going to be right there.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.600
Let me write this.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.070
It's y is equal to y1,
which is just this

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.290
level, minus 1 over 4A.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.310
But this is the intuitive part.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:05.250
Just remember, you're going
1 over 4A below the vertex.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.040
And then the focal point, the x
value of the focal point is

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.040
going to be x1, the same as
the x value of the vertex.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.890
And then the y value is
just b, and we just go

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.950
1 over 4A above it.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.420
Which makes sense because we
need to be equidistant from

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.060
the directrix and the focus.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.070
So this is y1 plus 1 over 4A.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.620
But the intuitive part is, we
just took 1 over 4A above it.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.180
So in general, if I gave
you-- so just think

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.930
about this a second.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.290
If I gave you an equation,
an arbitrary equation now.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:49.100
Say, y minus 1 is equal to 2
times x minus 3 squared, we can

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.700
graph this and draw the focus
fairly-- and actually

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.580
it's foci, if there was
more than one focus.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.540
Let's see, that's the
x-axis, that's the y-axis.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.930
Where's its vertex?

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.200
The vertex is at the
point 3 comma 1.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.110
So we go 1, 2, 3 comma 1.

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:10.690
So that's its vertex.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.320
It's an upward opening
parabola, because this

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.790
is a positive number.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.060
Actually, we don't even
have to know that.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.210
If you just draw the focus and
the directrix, you might be

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.970
able to figure that out.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.900
But where's the focus point?

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.960
The focal point is going to be
1 over 4A above this point.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.740
So 1 over 4 times 2
is equal to 1/8.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.340
So the focal point is
going to be really close.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.340
It's going to be right up here.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.210
It's going to be 1/8
above our vertex.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.970
And then our directrix is
going to be 1/8 below it.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.130
So it's going to
be right there.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.000
The directrix is going
to look like this.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.810
The directrix is going
to be there, the

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.160
focal point is there.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.280
And then the graph of this
parabola is going to look

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.090
something like this.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.050
So anyway, hopefully I didn't
confuse you too much.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.580
And the whole point of doing
all of this is just to realize

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.600
that it's pretty easy to find
the focus and the directrix of

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.360
a parabola if you have its
equation in this form.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:11.600
You just take whatever is
multiplying times the x minus

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.570
whatever squared term.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:18.270
And you essentially divide
1 by 4 times this value.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.355
And then you know the distance
from the vertex to the focus,

00:18:21.355 --> 00:18:24.210
and you know the distance from
the vertex to the directrix,

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.530
and you're all done.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.450
See you in the next video.
