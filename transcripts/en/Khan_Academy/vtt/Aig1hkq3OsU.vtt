00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.970
We are told that the formula for
finding the perimeter of a

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.180
rectangle is P is equal to 2l
plus 2w, where P is the

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.520
perimeter, l is the length,
and w is the width.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.840
And just to visualize what
they're saying, and you might

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.080
already be familiar with this,
let me draw a rectangle.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.080
That looks like a rectangle.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.780
And if this side's length is l,
then this side's length is

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.230
also going to be l.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.140
And if this width is w, then
this width up here is w.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.690
And the perimeter is just how,
what is the distance if you

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.460
were to go around
this rectangle?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.310
And so, that distance is going
to be this w plus this l, plus

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.350
this w-- or that width--
plus this length.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.070
And if you have 1 w and you add
it to another w, that's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.320
going to give you 2 w's.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.940
So that's 2 w's.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.700
And then if you have 1 l, and
then you have another l,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.260
that's going to give you, if you
add them together, that's

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.970
going to give you 2 l's.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.150
So the perimeter is going
to be 2 l's plus 2 w's.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.720
They just wrote it in a
different order than

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.300
the way I wrote it.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.650
But the same thing, so hopefully
that makes sense.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.040
Now, their question is, rewrite
the formula so that it

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.630
solves for width.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.050
So the formula, the way it's
written now, it says P is

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.120
equal to something.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.770
They want us to write it so
it's, this w, right here, they

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.410
want it to be w is equal to a
bunch of stuff with l's and

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.210
P's in it, and maybe
some numbers there.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.240
So let's think about
how we can do this.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.260
So they tell us that P is
equal to 2 times l,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.380
plus 2 times w.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.300
We want to solve for w.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.750
Well, a good starting point
might be to get rid of the l

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.630
on this side of the equation.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.790
And to get rid of it on that
side of the equation, we could

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.050
subtract the 2l from both
sides of the equation.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.040
So let's do it this way.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.259
So you subtract 2l over here.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.870
Minus 2l.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.070
You're also going to have to do
that on the left-hand side.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.400
So you're going to
have minus 2l.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.060
We're doing it on both sides
of the equation.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.180
And remember, an equation says
P is equal to that, so if you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.570
do anything to that, you
have to do it to P.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.780
So if you subtract 2l from this,
you're going to have to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.950
subtract 2l from P in order
for the equality

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.260
to keep being true.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:39.450
So the left-hand side is going
to be P minus 2l, and then

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.250
that is going to be equal to--
well, 2l minus 2l, the whole

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.150
reason why we subtracted 2l is
because these are going to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.280
cancel out.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.350
So these cancel out,
and you're just

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.870
left with a 2w here.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.170
You're just left with a 2w.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.260
We're almost there.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.250
We've almost solved for w.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.990
To finish it up, we just have
to divide both sides of this

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.350
equation by 2.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.510
And the whole reason why I'm
dividing both sides of this

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.400
equation by 2 is to get rid of
this 2 coefficient, this 2

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.830
that's multiplying w.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.770
So if you divide both sides of
this equation by 2, once

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.780
again, if you do something to
one side of the equation, you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.260
do it to the other side.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.330
The whole reason why I divided
the right-hand side by 2 is 2

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.120
times anything divided by 2
is just going to be that

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.240
anything, so this is
going to be a w.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.240
And then we have our
left-hand side.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.300
So we're done.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.240
If we flip these two sides, we
have our w will be equal to

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.830
this thing over here-- equals
P minus 2l, all

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.700
of that over 2.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.830
Now, this is the
correct answer.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.990
There's other ways to
write it, though.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.610
You might want to rewrite this,
so let me square this

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.840
off, because this is completely
the correct answer.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.590
This is the correct answer, but
there's other ways that

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.650
you might have been able to
get this answer, other

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.360
expressions for this answer.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.630
You might have also, you know,
another completely legitimate

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.720
way to do this problem-- let me
write it this way-- so our

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.779
original problem is P is equal
to 2l plus 2w-- is on this

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.960
right-hand side, what if
we factor out a 2?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.010
So let me make this clear.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.280
You have a 2 here, and
you have a 2 here.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.090
So you could imagine
undistributing the 2.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:41.650
So we would get P is equal
to 2 times l plus w.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.680
This is an equally legitimate
way to do this problem.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.780
Now, we can divide both sides of
this equation by 2, so that

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.710
we get rid of this 2 on
the right-hand side.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.170
So if you divide both sides of
this equation by 2, these 2's

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.760
are going to cancel out-- 2
times anything divided by 2 is

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.220
just going to be the
anything-- is

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.440
equal to P over 2.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.280
So let me just rewrite
this over here.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.350
Let me just rewrite this.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:18.310
So we will get P over 2 is going
to be equal to l plus w.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.460
And then if we want to solve for
w, we just subtract l from

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.500
both sides.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.320
And sometimes, you know, you
could write it in a separate

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.030
line like this.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.840
Sometimes you could just
write it like this.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.560
You could say, I'm going to
subtract an l on that side.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.790
If I do it on that side,
I have to do it

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.830
on this side, too.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.470
That's the same thing as
adding a negative l.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.160
And so the right-hand side,
you're just left with a w.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.230
And then the left-hand side,
you're going to have, it could

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.080
be a negative l plus P over 2,
or you could just change the

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:58.190
order, and you can write this
as P over 2 minus l.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.650
And this is also an equally
legitimate answer.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.750
And you're probably saying,
hey Sal, wait.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.410
These things look different.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.850
P minus 2l over 2, that
looks different than P

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.530
over 2 minus l.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.880
And they're not.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.580
Think about this.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.780
We could rewrite this as P-- let
me do this with the same

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:26.690
colors-- this over here is the
same thing as P over 2

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.570
minus 2l over 2.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.825
Right?

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:35.450
If I have a minus b and they're
both being divided by

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.360
2, I can just separate-- you can
imagine I'm distributing

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.850
the division by 2
right over here.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.640
And over here, 2 times
l divided by 2,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.040
that's just an l.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:53.710
So this is going to be equal to
P over 2 minus l, which is

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.440
the exact same thing as
this right there.
