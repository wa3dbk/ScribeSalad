00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.420
So let's think about what we
did in that last video and

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.160
maybe do it in a little
bit more of a visual way.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.280
So let's say this rectangle
that I'm about to draw is

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:19.660
the set of all the things
that I guess can happen.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.430
It's a set of all
of the outcomes.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.990
And we know from the get-go,
and we're still doing that same

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.300
example where I have a bag of
coins and one of them

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.890
only has heads on it.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.880
Two sides are heads, the
other ones are normal.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.090
So, if this is the whole set of
things we know that there's a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.060
1/10 chance that we pick the
coin that only has heads.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.510
So let me say out of
this area-- I don't

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.370
know-- this is 1/2.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.690
That's 1/4.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.960
So 1/10 is going to be
about that much, roughly.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.280
So this area right here.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.520
And let me color it.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.690
Let me color it a color.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.410
So that area right there, this
is the chances that we got

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.450
the two-sided sided coin.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.080
And this whole area, this
is all a normal coin.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.800
And then we said, oh, you know,
what are the chances that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.760
we get 5 heads in a row?

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.350
Well, if we had a normal coin,
there was a 1 out of 32 chance

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.880
that we get 5 heads in a row.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.670
So whatever this area
is, 1 out of 32.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.880
So I'll do it in a column.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.200
It's roughly there.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.460
It can be a little messy.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.790
And I'm assuming that this
column right here is 1/32

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.060
of this normal area.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.370
So this is a situation of
normal-- I'll just write this

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.090
as n-- and that upside down
U means and in set theory.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.380
Or it's a kind of intersection.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.100
But it means and I got
5 out of 5 heads.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.470
And if we think about,
what is the area of this?

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.480
Well, it's going to be
the area-- it's 1/32

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.550
of the normal area.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.570
And the normal area is 9/10.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.820
So this is equal to the
normal area, which is 9/10.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.400
And then 1/32 of that.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.710
Times 1/32.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.210
Or you could also, another way
of viewing that area, you could

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.930
say that well, that area,
that's the probability-- I'll

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.180
do it in the same color.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.240
That's the probability of
me getting-- I'll just

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.140
write 5 out of 5.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.120
5 out of 5 means 5
out of 5 heads.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.590
That's what probability of
getting 5 out of 5 heads

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.880
given that I picked
a normal coin out.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.450
Times the probability that I
picked out a normal coin.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.770
And so this is 1 out of 32,
and this is 9 out of 10.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.130
And I'm assuming that the
area of this entire magenta

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.750
rectangle I already
drew, that's 1 or 100%.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.000
Or however you want to view it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.150
And so this is 1 out of
32 times 9 out of 10.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.050
So this is 9 out of 32.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.430
So this whole thing, the area
this entire of this entire

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.310
magenta rectangle, is 1.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:35.390
Then the area of this that I
just shaded in, this is 9/320.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.760
Another way of viewing this,
this is also the probability--

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.920
this area right here is also
the probability that I got

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.560
5 out of 5 and that I
picked the normal coin.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.820
So that's also equal to.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.430
Both of those things
are true in this area.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.560
In this area, if I have a point
in that area-- this might be a

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.210
little abstract for you-- if at
any point, it is true that I

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.100
got 5 out of 5, and I have
picked a normal coin.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.630
So that's also going to be
equal to and I'm doing an

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.510
arbitrary color change here.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.310
9 out of 320.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.390
So we could say in general,
that the probability of me

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.920
getting 5 out of 5 coins, given
that I got a normal coin times

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.960
the probability that I got the
normal coin-- that is going

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.160
to be equal that 5 out of 5
happens and I got the normal.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.920
That equals probability
of 5 out of 5, and I

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.600
got the normal coin.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.810
Fair enough.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.350
Let's go to the
other side of this.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.670
This kind of yellowish
color here.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.610
There's a probability I
got a two-sided coin.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.125
And then given that, what's
the probability that

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.630
I get 5 out of 5?

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.800
Well, pretty much,
this entire area.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.930
It's also true that
I get 5 out of 5.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:14.190
So the probability that I get 5
out of 5 and two-sided, it's

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.640
equal to the probability--
oh sorry, and.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.600
And two-sided, is equal to the
probability of 5 out of 5,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.290
given the two-sided coin
times the probability

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.710
of the two-sided coin.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.200
So this is 1, right?

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.610
If I got the two-sided coin I'm
definitely going to 5 out of 5,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.670
That's why this whole
area is filled in.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.410
And then, the probability of
the two-sided coin we know

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.410
already is 1 out of 10.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.090
So this area is 1 out of 10.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.840
And so what is the total area
where I have 5 out of 5?

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.340
Well, it's going to be
this area over here,

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.070
which I figured out.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.530
Which was 9/320 of this
entire rectangle.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.250
And then this whole area is
also another area where I

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.460
got 5 out of 5 because I
picked the two-sided coin.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.640
And that's 1/10.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.020
In the last video we would
essentially-- if we want to

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.770
know the chances of getting
5 out of 5, it's this

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.960
total rectangle.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.937
I say this without showing
you anything, so let

00:06:16.937 --> 00:06:18.120
me-- it'll be red.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.280
And I think you get the point.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.000
That is the 5 out of 5,
so it's going to be this

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.600
area plus this area.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:34.340
And that is why it was 9 out
of 320 plus 1 out of 10.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.890
And we had the
answer last time.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.130
Fair enough.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:43.350
So let me pose a slightly
more difficult problem.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.850
I don't know if I should have
just erased that, but I did.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.280
So let's move forward.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.780
What is the probability that I
picked the two-sided coin given

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.530
that I got 5 out of 5 heads?

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.370
And remember, this is different
than the probability that I get

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.270
5 out of 5 heads given
the two-sided coin.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.230
What's the difference?

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.680
This says I picked the
two-sided coin, now what's the

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.340
probability I got 5 out of 5?

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.680
Well that's equal to 1.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.230
We're guaranteed to get a
million heads in a row.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.130
But this says I put my hand in
the bag, I didn't look at which

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.660
coin I got, I just flipped it
five times and I know that

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.860
I got 5 heads in a row.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.720
So now I say, well, what is the
probability without looking at

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.070
the coin, what is the
probability that this was

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.830
the two-sided coin
that I picked up?

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.590
Well, we can go back to
what we said before.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.150
Let me just say it a
little bit abstract.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:41.920
Before I clear this, we know
that the probability of a

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:49.860
given b, or the probability
of-- well, actually.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.000
Let me start over.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.300
The probability of a and b
happening, if you remember that

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.270
thing that before I erased it,
is a probability of a given

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.050
that b happened times the
probability that b happens.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.820
If both of these things have to
happen then we could say, well,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.300
definitely b has to happen.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.780
And then, whatever the
probability of a happening

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.690
given that b happened.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.060
This could be exclusive events.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.790
If these are independent
this could be equal to the

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.620
probability of a times
the probability of b.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.390
But we don't know for sure that
they're exclusive events.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.210
So the probability of a given b
could be the probability of a.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.330
It might not be dependent on b
at all, but we don't know that.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.470
Let's ignore that.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.630
So the probability of
a given b is that.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.540
But we also know that the
probability of a given

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:45.540
b is equal to-- I mean,
the probability-- sorry.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.350
We also know the probability of
a and b is also the same thing

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.580
as the probability of
b and a happening.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.580
The same thing.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.630
And so that's the probability
of b given that a happened,

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.150
times the probability
that a happened.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.670
By the same logic.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.900
Well, we see that this is
equal to this, so this

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.500
has to be equal to that.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.212
So let's write that down.

00:09:08.212 --> 00:09:09.960
And we're going to do a lot of
applications; I know this is

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.440
a little abstract right now.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.920
So that tells us the
probability of a given b times

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:22.990
the probability of b, is equal
to the probability of b given

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.690
a, times the probability of a.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.810
And then, let's just
divide both sides by a.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:36.160
And we get this, the
probability of b given

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:43.490
a is equal to this,
probability of a given b.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.390
Times the probability
of b divided by the

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.120
probability of a.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.600
And this is called Bayes'
theorem or Bayes' law.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.210
And this is what we will now
use to figure out the

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.930
probability that we got the
two-sided coin after seeing

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.930
that we rolled or we
got 5 heads in a row.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.870
See you in the next video.
