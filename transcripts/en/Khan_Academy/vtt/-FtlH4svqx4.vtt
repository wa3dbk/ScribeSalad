00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.880
A neurologist is testing the
effect of a drug on response

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.690
time by injecting 100 rats with
a unit dose of the drug,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.570
subjecting each to neurological
stimulus and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.450
recording its response time.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.350
The neurologist knows that the
mean response time for rats

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.810
not injected with the
drug is 1.2 seconds.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.030
The mean of the 100 injected
rats response times is 1.05

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.800
seconds with the
sample standard

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.470
deviation of 0.5 seconds.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.650
Do you think that the drug has
an affect on response time?

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.130
So to do this we're going to
set up two hypotheses.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.660
We're going to say, one, the
first hypothesis is we're

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.260
going to call it the null
hypothesis, and that is that

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.400
the drug has no effect
on response time.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.740
And your null hypothesis is
always going to be-- you can

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.820
view it as a status quo.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.570
You assume that whatever your
researching has no effect.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.975
So drug has no effect.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.390
Or another way to think about
it is that the mean of the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.130
rats taking the drug should be
the mean with the drug-- let

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.930
me write it this way-- with the
mean is still going to be

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.385
1.2 seconds even
with the drug.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.090
So that's essentially saying it
has no effect, because we

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.410
know that if you don't give
the drug the mean response

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.290
time is 1.2 seconds.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.940
Now, what you want is an
alternative hypothesis.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.010
The hypothesis is no,
I think the drug

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.520
actually does do something.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.970
So the alternative hypothesis,
right over here, that the drug

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.880
has an effect.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.340
Or another way to think about
it is that the mean does not

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:10.280
equal 1.2 seconds when
the drug is given.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.500
So how do we think about this?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.660
How do we know whether we should
accept the alternative

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.380
hypothesis or whether we should
just default to the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.680
null hypothesis because the
data isn't convincing?

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.700
And the way we're going to do it
in this video, and this is

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.875
really the way it's done in
pretty much all of science, is

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:32.230
you say OK, let's assume that
the null hypothesis is true.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.110
If the null hypothesis was true,
what is the probability

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.840
that we would have gotten these
results with the sample?

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.190
And if that probability is
really, really small, then the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.920
null hypothesis probably
isn't true.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.710
We could probably reject the
null hypothesis and we'll say

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.870
well, we kind of believe in the
alternative hypothesis.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.720
So let's think about that.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.720
Let's assume that the null
hypothesis is true.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.340
So if we assume the null
hypothesis is true, let's try

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.240
to figure out the probability
that we would have actually

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.950
gotten this result, that we
would have actually gotten a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.070
sample mean of 1.05 seconds with
a standard deviation of

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.180
0.5 seconds.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.320
So I want to see if we assumed
the null hypothesis is true, I

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.810
want to figure out the
probability-- and actually

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.860
what we're going to do is
not just figure out the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.740
probability of this, the
probability of getting

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.370
something like this or even
more extreme than this.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.780
So how likely of an
event is that?

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.600
To think about that let's just
think about the sampling

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.290
distribution if we assume
the null hypothesis.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.530
So the sampling distribution
is like this.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.050
It'll be a normal
distribution.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.960
We have a good number
of samples, we

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.250
have 100 samples here.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.320
So this is the sampling
distribution.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.050
It will have a mean.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.400
Now if we assume the null
hypothesis, that the drug has

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.830
no effect, the mean of our
sampling distribution will be

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.660
the same thing as the meaning
of the population

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.240
distribution, which would
be equal to 1.2 seconds.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.250
Now, what is the standard
deviation of our sampling

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.490
distribution?

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.990
The standard deviation of our
sampling distribution should

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.240
be equal to the standard
deviation of the population

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.060
distribution divided by the
square root of our sample

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.820
size, so divided by the
square root of 100.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.450
We do not know what the standard
deviation of the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.020
entire population is.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.920
So what we're going to do is
estimate it with our sample

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.070
standard deviation.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.670
And it's a reasonable thing to
do, especially because we have

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.700
a nice sample size.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.820
The sample size is
greater than 100.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.200
So this is going to be a pretty
good approximator.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.370
This is going to be a pretty
good approximator

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.120
for this over here.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.290
So we could say that this is
going to be approximately

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.100
equal to our sample standard
deviation divided by the

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.630
square root of 100, which is
going to be equal to our

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.610
sample standard deviation is
0.5, 0.5 seconds, and we want

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.800
to divide that by square
root of 100 is 10.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.960
So 0.5 divided by 10 is 0.05.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.870
So the standard deviation of our
sampling distribution is

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.320
going to be-- and we'll put a
little hat over it to show

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.640
that we approximated it with--
we approximated the population

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.140
standard deviation with the
sample standard deviation.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.380
So it is going to be equal
to 0.5 divided by 10.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.560
So 0.05.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.780
So what is the probability--
so let's think

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.060
about it this way.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.150
What is the probability of
getting 1.05 seconds?

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.610
Or another way to think about
it is how many standard

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.240
deviations away from this mean
is 1.05 seconds, and what is

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.480
the probability of getting a
result at least that many

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.480
standard deviations away
from the mean.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.940
So let's figure out how many
standard deviations away from

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.980
the mean that is.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.120
Now essentially we're just
figuring out a Z-score, a

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.070
Z-score for this result
right over there.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.980
So let me pick a nice color--
I haven't used orange yet.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.090
So our Z-score-- you could
even do the Z-statistic.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.260
It's being derived from these
other sample statistics.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.060
So our Z-statistic, how far
are we away from the mean?

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.310
Well the mean is 1.2.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.730
And we are at 1.05, so I'll
put that less just so that

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.350
it'll be a positive distance.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.930
So that's how far away we are.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.350
And if we wanted it in terms
of standard deviations, we

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.950
want to divide it by our best
estimate of the sampling

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:52.180
distribution's standard
deviation, which is this 0.05.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.730
So this is 0.05, and what is
this going to be equal to?

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.840
This result right here,
1.05 seconds.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.310
1.2 minus 1.05 is 0.15.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.535
So this is 0.15 in the numerator
divided by 0.05 in

00:07:12.535 --> 00:07:15.970
the denominator, and so
this is going to be 3.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.020
So this result right here
is 3 standard deviations

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.140
away from the mean.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.820
So let me draw this.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.950
This is the mean.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.280
If I did 1 standard deviation,
2 standard deviations, 3

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.680
standard deviations-- that's
in the positive direction.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.360
Actually let me draw
it a little bit

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.870
different than that.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.330
This wasn't a nicely drawn
bell curve, but I'll do 1

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.780
standard deviation, 2 standard
deviation, and then 3 standard

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.070
deviations in the positive
direction.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.620
And then we have 1 standard
deviation, 2 standard

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.300
deviations, and 3 standard
deviations in

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.770
the negative direction.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.270
So this result right here, 1.05
seconds that we got for

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.850
our 100 rat sample is
right over here.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.760
3 standard deviations
below the mean.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.460
Now what is the probability
of getting a result

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.470
this extreme by chance?

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.220
And when I talk about this
extreme, it could be either a

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.380
result less than this or a
result of that extreme in the

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.410
positive direction.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.490
More than 3 standard
deviations.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.570
So this is essentially, if we
think about the probability of

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.940
getting a result more extreme
than this result right over

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.030
here, we're thinking about
this area under the bell

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.530
curve, both in the negative
direction or in

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.180
the positive direction.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.880
What is the probability
of that?

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.100
Well we go from the empirical
rule that 99.7% of the

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.760
probability is within 3
standard deviations.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.140
So this thing right here-- you
can look it up on a Z-table as

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.340
well, but 3 standard deviation
is a nice clean number that

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.840
doesn't hurt to remember.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.270
So we know that this area right
here I'm doing and just

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:56.800
reddish-orange, that area
right over is 99.7%.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.610
So what is left for these two
magenta or pink areas?

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.250
Well if these are 99.7% and
both of these combined are

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.380
going to be 0.3%.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:13.480
So both of these combined are
0.3-- I should write it this

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.970
way or exactly-- are 0.3%.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.480
0.3%.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.290
Or is we wrote it as a decimal
it would be 0.003 of the total

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.530
area under the curve.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:33.000
So to answer our question, if we
assume that the drug has no

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.500
effect, the probability of
getting a sample this extreme

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.450
or actually more extreme
than this is only 0.3%

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.740
Less than 1 in 300.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.080
So if the null hypothesis was
true, there's only a 1 in 300

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.880
chance that we would have
gotten a result

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.730
this extreme or more.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.700
So at least from my point of
view this results seems to

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.040
favor the alternative
hypothesis.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:08.180
I'm going to reject the
null hypothesis.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.050
I don't know 100% sure.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.670
But if the null hypothesis was
true there's only 1 in 300

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.350
chance of getting this.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.610
So I'm going to go with the
alternative hypothesis.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.570
And just to give you a little
bit of some of the name or the

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.890
labels you might see in some
statistics or in some research

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:32.110
papers, this value, the
probability of getting a

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:38.620
result more extreme than this
given the null hypothesis is

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.470
called a P-value.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:45.840
So the P-value here, and that
really just stands for

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:52.400
probability value, the P-value
right over here is 0.003.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.010
So there's a very, very small
probability that we could have

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.610
gotten this result if the null
hypothesis was true, so we

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.500
will reject it.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.750
And in general, most people
have some type

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.640
of a threshold here.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.220
If you have a P-value less than
5%, which means less than

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.820
1 in 20 shot, let's say, you
know what, I'm going to reject

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.830
the null hypothesis.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.480
There's less than a 1 in 20
chance of getting that result.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.320
Here we got much less
than 1 in 20.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.170
So this is a very strong
indicator that the null

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.350
hypothesis is incorrect,
and the drug

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.860
definitely has some effect.
