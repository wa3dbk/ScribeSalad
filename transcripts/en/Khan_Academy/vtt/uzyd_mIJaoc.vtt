00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.215
Use substitution to
solve for x and y.

00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:04.840
And we have a system
of equations here.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.370
The first equation is
2y is equal to x plus 7.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.307
And the second equation here
is x is equal to y minus 4.

00:00:13.307 --> 00:00:15.390
So what we want to do,
when they say substitution,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.180
what we want to do
is substitute one

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.150
of the variables
with an expression

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.234
so that we have an equation
and only one variable.

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:22.441
And then we can solve for it.

00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.130
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.713
So let me rewrite
this first equation.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:29.490
2y is equal to x plus 7.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.740
And we have the second
equation over here,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.002
that x is equal to y minus 4.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.710
So if we're looking
for an x and a y that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.740
satisfies both constraints,
well we could say, well look,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.640
at the x and y have to
satisfy both constraints, both

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.840
of these constraints
have to be true.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.070
So x must be equal to y minus 4.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.715
So anywhere in this top
equation where we see an x,

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:54.340
anywhere we see an
x, we say well look,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.690
that x by the second constraint
has to be equal to y minus 4.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.310
So everywhere we see an
x, we can substitute it

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.030
with a y minus 4.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.150
So let's do that.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.910
So if we substitute y minus
4 for x in this top equation,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.940
the top equation becomes 2y
is equal to instead of an x,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.090
the second constraint
tells us that x

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.920
needs to be equal to y minus 4.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.480
So instead of an x,
we'll write a y minus 4,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.390
and then we have a plus 7.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.420
All I did here is I
substituted y minus 4 for x.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.190
The second constraint tells
us that we need to do it.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.750
y minus 4 needs to be
equal to x or x needs

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.640
to be equal to y minus 4.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.470
The value here is now
we have an equation,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.090
one equation with one variable.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.250
We can just solve for y.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.380
So we get 2y is equal to y, and
then we have minus 4 plus 7.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.630
So y plus 3.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.550
We can subtract y from both
sides of this equation.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.010
The left hand side,
2y minus y is just y.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.804
y is equal to-- these
cancel out. y is equal to 3.

00:02:07.804 --> 00:02:09.470
And then we could go
back and substitute

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.950
into either of these
equations to solve for x.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.570
This is easier right over
here, so let's substitute

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.600
right over here. x needs
to be equal to y minus 4.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:26.220
So we could say that x
is equal to 3 minus 4

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.830
which is equal to negative 1.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.130
So the solution to this system
is x is equal to negative 1

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.002
and y is equal to 3.

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:39.210
And you can verify that it
works in this top equation

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.876
right over here.

00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:45.490
2 times 3 is 6 which is indeed
equal to negative 1 plus 7.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.230
Now I want to show you that
over here we substituted--

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.830
we had an expression that,
or we had an equation,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.750
that explicitly solved for x.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.490
So we were able to
substitute the x's.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.265
What I want to show
you is we could

00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:57.681
have done it the
other way around.

00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:01.350
We could have solved for y and
then substituted for the y's.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.069
So let's do that.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.110
And we could have substituted
from one constraint

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.940
into the other
constraint or vice versa.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.750
Either way, we would have
gotten the same exact answer.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.500
So instead of saying x
is equal to y minus 4,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.480
in that second
equation, if we add 4

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.970
to both sides of this equation,
we get x plus 4 is equal to y.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.860
This and this is the
exact same constraint.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.720
I just added 4 to
both sides of this

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.610
to get this
constraint over here.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.490
And now since we've solved
this equation explicitly for y,

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.280
we can use the first
constraint, the first equation.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.430
And everywhere
where we see a y, we

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.080
can substitute it with x plus 4.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.200
So it's 2 times--
instead of 2 times y,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.530
we can write 2 times x plus 4.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.940
2 times x plus 4 is
equal to x plus 7.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.540
We can distribute this 2.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.720
So we get 2x plus 8
is equal to x plus 7.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.440
We can subtract x from both
sides of this equation.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.810
And then we can subtract 8 from
both sides of this equation,

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.170
subtract 8.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.610
The left hand side,
that cancels out.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.180
We're just left with an x.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.960
On the right hand
side, that cancels out,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.170
and we are left
with a negative 1.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.160
And then we can
substitute back over here

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.830
we have y is equal to x plus 4,
or so y is equal to negative 1

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.580
plus 4 which is equal to 3.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.520
So once again, we
got the same answer

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.720
even though this time we
substituted for y instead

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.710
of substituting for x.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.350
Hopefully you found
that interesting.
