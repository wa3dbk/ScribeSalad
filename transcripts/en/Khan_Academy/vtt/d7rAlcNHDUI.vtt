00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:07.110
Miranda's Maid Service charges
$280 to clean 8 offices.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.190
What is the company's price for
cleaning a single office?

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:22.810
So they charge $280 to
clean 8 offices.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.885
So it's $280 per every
8 offices.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.520
And then we can simplify this.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.070
We could see, well,
are both of them

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.960
divisible by a common factor?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.510
And this one looks like
it is divisible by 8.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.050
200 is divisible by
8, and then 80 is

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.140
divisible by 8 as well.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.770
So let's divide both the
numerator and the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.470
denominator by 8.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.840
And if we do that, 8 goes
into 28 three times.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.130
3 times 8 is 24.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.250
Subtract.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.800
You have 4 left over.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.140
8 minus 4 is 4.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.879
Bring down this 0.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.980
8 goes into 40 exactly
five times.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.590
5 times 8 is 40, and you
have no remainder.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.475
So when you divide 280
by 8, you get 35.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:20.170
And if you divide 8
by 8, you get 1.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.310
So this rate simplifies to, this
price per office, I guess

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:35.460
we could call it, simplifies
to $35 for every 1 office,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.980
which we could also write as 35
over 1 dollars per office,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:53.630
which is the exact same thing
as $35 per office.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.280
And we're done.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.710
That is the company's
price for cleaning a

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.330
single office: $35.
