00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:02.160
- [Instructor] So where we
left off we have these two

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.529
different equations that we wanna solve

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.000
and there's three unknowns.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.299
There's s, the tons of
steel that you're using,

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.599
h the hours of labor, and then lambda,

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.501
this Lagrange Multiplier we introduced

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:15.387
that's basically a
proportionality constant

00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:18.251
between the gradient vectors
of the revenue function

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.897
and the constraint function.

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:23.380
And always the third equation
that we're dealing with here

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.912
to solve this, is the constraint itself.

00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:27.627
That gives us another equation
that'll help solve for

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:30.198
h and s, and ultimately lambda,

00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:32.302
if that's something that you want as well.

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:33.511
So it's kind of a first pass here,

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.104
I'm gonna do a little more simplifying

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:36.354
but I'm gonna make a substitution

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:37.879
that'll make this easier for us.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.075
So I see s over h here, and
they're both to the same power,

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:42.764
so I feel it might be a little bit easier

00:00:42.764 --> 00:00:46.514
if I just substitute u
in for s divided by h.

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:50.054
And what that'll let me do, is rewrite

00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:53.304
this first equation here as 200 thirds,

00:00:54.406 --> 00:00:58.156
200 thirds times u to
the power of one third.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.906
And that's equal to 20 times lambda.

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:06.346
And then likewise, what
that means for this guy,

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:09.773
is, well, this is h over s, not s over h,

00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:12.426
so that one's gonna be 100 thirds,

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:14.777
not times u to the power of two thirds,

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:17.944
but times u to the negative two thirds

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:21.281
because we swapped the h and s here.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.645
So that's u to the negative two thirds

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:27.754
and this is just to make it a
little bit cleaner, I think.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:31.921
We kind of want to treat h
and s in the same package.

00:01:32.877 --> 00:01:34.661
Now I'm gonna go ahead and
put all the constants together

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.067
and then I'm gonna take this guy

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:39.714
and multiply it by three divided by 200,

00:01:39.714 --> 00:01:41.736
multiply both sides of
that just to cancel out

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:44.110
what's on the left side here.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.360
And what that's gonna give
me, and I'll go ahead and

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.323
write it over here, kind
of all over the place,

00:01:49.323 --> 00:01:51.754
u to the one third is equal to,

00:01:51.754 --> 00:01:54.090
let's see three over 200, so that 20

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.876
almost cancels out with the
200, it just leaves a 10,

00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:59.876
so that's gonna give me three tenths

00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:03.424
of lambda.

00:02:04.846 --> 00:02:06.124
And then similarly over here,

00:02:06.124 --> 00:02:08.197
I'm gonna take this full equation

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:10.947
and multiply it by three over 100

00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:14.366
and what that's gonna leave me with

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:17.612
is that u to the negative two thirds,

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:19.567
u to the negative two thirds is equal to,

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.036
let's see this 2,000
when we divide it by 100

00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:25.342
becomes 20, and that 20 times three is 60,

00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:27.842
so that'll be 60 times lambda.

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:32.852
Alright, so now I want a way
to simplify each of these,

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:35.381
and what I notice is they look
pretty similar on each side,

00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:38.191
you know it's something
related to u equal to lambda,

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.433
so if I can get this in a form

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:42.817
where I'm really isolating
u, that would be great.

00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:44.648
The way I'm gonna do this
is I'm gonna multiply

00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:47.566
each one of them by u to the two thirds,

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.329
so I'm gonna multiply it into this guy

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.298
and I'm gonna multiply it into that guy,

00:02:51.298 --> 00:02:54.555
because on the top, it's
gonna turn this into just u,

00:02:54.555 --> 00:02:56.357
which will be nice, and on the bottom

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:58.111
it'll cancel out that u entirely.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.838
So it feels like it'll
make both of these nicer,

00:02:59.838 --> 00:03:02.278
even though it might make the
right side a little uglier,

00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:04.016
those right sides will
still kind of be the same,

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:05.721
and we'll take advantage of that.

00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:07.751
So, when I do that to the top part,

00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.047
like I said, that u to the one third

00:03:09.047 --> 00:03:12.109
times u to the two thirds ends up being u,

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.106
and then on the right side we have

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:16.106
our three tenths lambda,

00:03:17.222 --> 00:03:19.555
but now u to the two thirds.

00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:23.122
And then on the bottom here, we,

00:03:23.122 --> 00:03:25.135
when I multiply it by u to the two thirds,

00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:27.305
the right side becomes
one, 'cause it cancels out

00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:29.376
with u to the negative two thirds,

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:32.459
and the right side is 60 times lambda

00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:35.709
times u to the two thirds.

00:03:38.077 --> 00:03:39.658
Now these right sides look very similar,

00:03:39.658 --> 00:03:41.155
and the left sides are quite simple.

00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:42.628
So I'm gonna multiply this top one

00:03:42.628 --> 00:03:44.509
by whatever it takes
to make it look exactly

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:45.575
like that right side.

00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:48.581
So in this case I'm gonna
multiply that top by 10,

00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:51.249
which will get it to three,
and then by another 20

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:53.716
to make that constant 60,
so I'm gonna multiply this

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:56.134
entire top equation by 200,

00:03:56.134 --> 00:03:59.634
and what that gives me is that 200 times u

00:04:00.972 --> 00:04:03.222
is equal to 60 times lambda

00:04:04.707 --> 00:04:06.874
times u to the two thirds.

00:04:07.806 --> 00:04:11.839
And now these two equations,
these two equations

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:13.368
have the same right side.

00:04:13.368 --> 00:04:15.205
So this is the same as saying,

00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:18.122
200 times u is equal to, well, one.

00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:21.478
Because each one of those expressions

00:04:21.478 --> 00:04:24.125
equals the same complicated thing.

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:27.554
And now 200 times u, well
that's s divided by h.

00:04:27.554 --> 00:04:30.948
So this is the same thing as saying 200

00:04:30.948 --> 00:04:33.115
times s over h equals one,

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.742
which we can write much more simply as h

00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:40.075
is equal to 200

00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:42.059
times s.

00:04:43.975 --> 00:04:45.522
Great, so I'm gonna go
ahead and circle that,

00:04:45.522 --> 00:04:48.267
h is equal to 200 times s.

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:50.700
And now what we apply that to

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.789
is the constraint, is the 200 times h

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.940
plus 2,000 times s equals our budget.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.649
We'll go ahead and kind
of write that down again.

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:02.118
That are 20 times h, I think,
20 times the hours of labor

00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:04.451
plus $2,000 per ton of steel

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.917
is equal to our budget

00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:11.601
of $20,000, and now we
can just substitute in.

00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:16.599
Instead of h I'm gonna
write 200 s, so that's 200,

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.432
sorry, 20 times 200 s,

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.423
200 s,

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:24.362
plus 2,000

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:27.156
times s

00:05:27.156 --> 00:05:28.739
is equal to 20,000.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:34.910
And now this right side, 20
times 200 is equal to 4,000,

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.426
and I'm just gonna go
ahead and kind of write

00:05:36.426 --> 00:05:38.027
so this here

00:05:38.027 --> 00:05:42.194
is 4,000 s, so the entire
right side of the equation

00:05:43.514 --> 00:05:45.181
simplifies to 6,000,

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:47.729
6,000 times s

00:05:49.274 --> 00:05:50.774
is equal to 20,000

00:05:53.648 --> 00:05:55.070
and when those cancel
out, what that gives us

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.999
is s is equal to 20 divided by six,

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:01.416
which is the same as 10 divided by three.

00:06:02.938 --> 00:06:05.276
So that's how many tons
of steel we should get.

00:06:05.276 --> 00:06:07.562
S is 10 over three,
then when we apply that

00:06:07.562 --> 00:06:10.039
to the fact that h is 200 times s,

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.271
that's gonna mean that h is equal

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:14.271
to 200 times that value,

00:06:16.257 --> 00:06:18.924
10 over three, which is equal to

00:06:20.701 --> 00:06:21.534
2,000,

00:06:22.832 --> 00:06:23.915
2,000 thirds,

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:29.410
2,000 thirds, that's how
many hours of labor we want.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.049
So, evidently in our original problem,

00:06:32.049 --> 00:06:35.127
where we have this model
for our revenue function

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:37.949
for our Widgets with
$20 per hour of labor,

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.458
and $2,000 per ton of steel,

00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:43.224
with a budget of $20,000, the allocation

00:06:43.224 --> 00:06:47.341
that you should make is to buy
10 thirds of a ton of steel

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:50.091
and 2,000 thirds hours of labor.
