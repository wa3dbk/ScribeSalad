00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.280
In the last video we saw how a
matrix and figuring out its

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.730
inverse can be used to solve
a system of equations.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.790
And we did a 2 by 2.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.200
And in the future, we'll
do 3 by 3's.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.170
We won't do 4 by 4's because
those take too long.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.740
But you'll see it applies to
kind of an n by n matrix.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.310
And that is probably the
application of matrices that

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.420
you learn if you learn this in
your Algebra 2 class, or your

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.190
Algebra 1 class.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.720
And you often wonder,
well why even do the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.120
whole matrix thing?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.570
Now I will show you another
application of matrices that

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.920
actually you're more likely to
see in your linear algebra

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.200
class when you take
it in college.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.030
But the really neat thing here
is, and I think this will

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.220
really hit the point home, that
the matrix representation

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.360
is just one way of representing
multiple types of

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.550
problems. And what's really
cool is that if different

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.590
problems can be represented the
same way, it kind of tells

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.920
you that they're the
same problem.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.550
And that's called an isomorphism
in math.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.240
That if you can reduce one
problem into another problem,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.450
then all the work you
did with one of them

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.570
applies to the other.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.330
But anyway, let's figure
out a new way that

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.580
matrices can be used.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.120
So I'm going to draw
some vectors.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.880
Let's say I have the vector--
Let's call this vector a.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.920
And I'm going to just write this
is as a column vector.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.780
And all of this is
just convention.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.080
These are just human
invented things.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.320
I could have written
this diagonally.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.640
I could have written
this however.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:31.120
But if I say vector a
is 3, negative 6.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.265
And I view this as the x
component of the vector, and

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:35.330
this is equal to the y component
of the vector.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.690
And then I have vector b.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:57.810
Vector b is equal to 2, 6.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.330
And I want to know are there
some combinations of vectors a

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.949
and b-- where you can say, 5
times vector a, plus 3 times

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.350
vector b, or 10 times victor a
minus 6 times vector b-- some

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.420
combination of vector a and b,
where I can get vector c.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:31.250
And vector c is the
vector 7, 6.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.205
So let me see if I can visually
draw this problem.

00:02:33.205 --> 00:02:35.560
So let me draw the
coordinate axes.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.300
Let's see this one.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.490
3, negative 6.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.440
That'll be in quadrant--
these are both

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.180
in the first quadrant.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.840
So I just want to figure
out how much of the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.900
axes I need to draw.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.580
So let's see-- Let me do
a different color.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.670
That's my y-axis.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.160
I'm not drawing the second or
third quadrants, because I

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.140
don't think our vectors
show up there.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.385
And then this is the x-axis.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.365
Let me draw each of
these vectors.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.130
So first I'll do vector a.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.310
That's 3, negative 6.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.770
1, 2, 3, and then negative 6.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.170
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.970
So it's there.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.010
So if I wanted to draw it
as a vector, usually

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.260
start at the origin.

00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:36.980
And it doesn't have to start
at the origin like that.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.730
I'm just choosing to.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.990
You can move around a vector.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.190
It just has to have the
same orientation

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.680
and the same magnitude.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.620
So that is vector
a for the green.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.670
Now let me do in magenta,
I'll do vector b.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.050
That is 2, 6.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:12.630
So 2, 6 is right over there.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.740
And that's vector b.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.300
So it'll look like this.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.370
That's vector b.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.630
And then let me write down
vector a down there.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.790
That's vector a.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.210
And I want to take some
combination of

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.720
vectors a and b.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.400
And add them up and
get vector c.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.690
So what does vector
c look like?

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.620
It's 7, 6.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.290
Let me do that in purple.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:50.390
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.240
Comma 6.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.940
So 7, 6 is right over there.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.190
That's vector c.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.145
Vector c looks like that.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.730
I'm going to draw
it like that.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.640
And that's vector c.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.010
So what was the original
problem I said?

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.460
I said I want to add some
multiple of vector a to some

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.890
multiple of vector b,
and get vector c.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.000
And I want to see what
those multiples are.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.650
So let's say the multiple
that I multiply

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.650
times vector a is x.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.210
And the multiple of
vector b is y.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.380
So I essentially want to say
that-- let me do it in another

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:42.330
neutral color-- that vector ax--
that's how much of vector

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:49.740
a I'm contributing-- plus vector
by-- that's how much of

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.920
vector b I'm contributing--
is equal to vector c.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.200
And you know, maybe I can't.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.470
Maybe there's no combinations of
vector a and b when you add

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.830
them together equal vector c.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.120
But let's see if we
can solve this.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.830
So how do we solve?

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.900
So let's expand out
vectors a and b.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.710
Vector a is what?

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.860
3, negative 6.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:17.210
So vector a, we could write
as 3, minus 6 times x.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.120
That just tells us how much
vector a we're contributing.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.120
Plus vector b, which is 2, 6.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.240
And then y is how much vector
b we're contributing.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.960
And that is equal to 7, 6.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.920
Vector c.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.440
Now this right here, this
problem can be rewritten just

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.990
based on how we've defined
matrix multiplication, et

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.150
cetera, et cetera, as this.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:07:07.780
As 3, minus 6, 2, 6, times
x, y, is equal to 7, 6.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.150
Now how does that work out?

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.850
Well think about how matrix
multiplication works out.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.530
The way we learned matrix
multiplication, we said, 3

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:25.250
times x, plus 2 times
y is equal to 7.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.740
3 times x plus 2 times
y is equal to 7.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.800
That's how we learned matrix
multiplication.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.700
That's the same thing here.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.170
3 times x, plus 2 times y, is
going to be equal to 7.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.270
These x and y here are
just scalar numbers.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.380
So 3 times x plus 2 times
y is equal to 7.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.630
And then matrix multiplication
here, minus 6 times x plus 6

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.030
times y is equal to 6.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.080
That's just traditional matrix
multiplication that we learned

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.330
several videos ago.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.120
That's the same thing here.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.390
Minus 6x plus 6y
is equal to 6.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.560
These x's and y's are
just numbers.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.410
They're just scalar numbers.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.380
They're not vectors
or anything.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.640
We would just multiply them
times both of these numbers.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.710
So hopefully you see that this
problem is the exact same

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.580
thing as this problem.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.030
And you've maybe had an a-ha
moment now, if you watched the

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.700
previous video.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:16.070
Because this matrix also
represented the problem, where

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.210
do we find the intersection
of two lines?

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.220
Where the two lines-- I'm just
going to do it on the side

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.290
here-- the intersection of
the two lines, 3x plus

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.210
2y is equal to 7.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:31.800
And minus 6x plus 6y
is equal to 6.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.409
And so, I had drawn two lines.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.900
And we said, what's the
point of intersection,

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.600
et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.539
And it was represented
by this problem.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.860
But here, we have-- well I
won't say a completely

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.140
different problem, because
we're learning they're

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.580
actually very similar-- but here
I'm doing a problem of,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.870
I'm trying to find what
combination of the matrices a

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.570
and b add up to the matrix c.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.340
But it got reduced to the same
matrix representation.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.430
And so we can solve this the
same exactly way we solved

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.750
this problem.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.570
If we call this the matrix a,
let's figure out a inverse.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.190
So we get a inverse
is equal to what?

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.222
It equals 1 over the
determinant of a.

00:09:08.222 --> 00:09:10.740
The determinant of
a is 3 times 6.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.850
18 minus minus 12.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.560
So that's 18 plus 12,
which is 1/30.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.850
And we did this in the
previous video.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.170
You swap these two numbers.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.150
So you get 6 and 3.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.120
And then you make these
two negatives.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.600
So you get 6 and minus 2.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.730
That's a inverse.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.590
And now to solve for x and y, we
can multiply both sides of

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.210
this equation by a inverse.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.340
If you multiply a inverse times
a, this cancels out.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:45.790
So you get x, y is equal to
a inverse times this.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:53.740
It's equal to 1/30 times
6, minus 2, 6, 3.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.330
Times 7, 6.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.250
And remember, with matrices,
the order that

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.830
you multiply matters.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.830
So on this side, we multiplied
a inverse on

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.250
this side of the equation.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.580
So we have to do a inverse on
the left side on this side of

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.530
this equation.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.360
So that's why did it here.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.570
If we did it the other way,
all bets are off.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.310
So what does this equal?

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.860
This is equal to 1/30 times--
and we did this the previous

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.060
problem-- 6 times 7
is 42, minus 12.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.250
30.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.410
6 times 7, 42.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.220
Plus 18.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.170
60.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.800
So that equals 1, 2.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.170
So what does this tell us?

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:37.130
This tells us that if we have
1 times vector a, plus 2

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.610
times vector b.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:43.360
1 times-- this is 1-- and
2 times vector b.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.420
So 1 times vector a plus
2 times vector b is

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.685
equal to vector c.

00:10:47.685 --> 00:10:49.090
And let's confirm
that visually.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.820
So 1 times vector a.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.140
Well that's vector
a right there.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.410
So if we add 2 vector b's to
it, we should get vector c.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.300
So let's see if we
can do that.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.150
So if we just shift vector b
over this way, well vector

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.330
let's see, vector b is
over 2 and up 6.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.020
So over 2 and up 6 would
get us there.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.230
So 1, vector b-- just doing
heads to tail visual method of

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.240
adding vectors-- would
get us there.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.271
1, 2, 3.

00:11:17.271 --> 00:11:18.521
Good.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.250
No, let me see.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.780
1, 2, 3.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.340
And then vector b goes
over two more.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.140
two more.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.240
So it'll get us up 6.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.860
It's like that.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.410
So that's 1, vector b.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.550
And then if we add another-- but
we want 2 times vector b.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.180
We essentially need
two vector b's.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.820
So we had one, and then
we add another one.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.395
I think visually you see that
it does actually-- I didn't

00:11:51.395 --> 00:11:52.160
want to do it like that.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.240
I wanted to use the line
tool so it looks neat.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.830
So you add another vector b.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.840
And there you have it.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.320
That's a vector b.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.680
So it's 2 times vector b.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.530
So it's the same direction as
vector b, but it's two times

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.270
the length.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.610
So we visually showed it.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.530
We solved it algabraically.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.990
But the real learning, and the
big real discovery of this

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.730
whole video, is to show you that
the matrix representation

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.720
can represent multiple different
problems. This was a

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.210
finding the combinations
of a vector problem.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.360
And the previous one it
was figure out if

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.090
two lines can intersect.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.420
But what it tells you is that
these two problems are

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.980
connected in some deep way.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.830
That if we take the veneer of
reality, that underlying it,

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.260
they are the same thing.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.890
And frankly, that's why math
is so interesting.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.480
Because when you realize that
two problems are really the

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.540
same thing, it takes all of the
superficial human veneer

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.780
away from things.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.280
Because our brains are kind of
wired to perceive the world in

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:52.790
a certain way.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.330
But it tells us that there's
some fundamental truth,

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.050
independent of our perception,
that is tying all of these

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.350
different concepts together.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.800
But anyway, I don't want to
get all mystical on you.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.780
But if you do see
the mysticism in

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.310
math, all the better.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.890
But hopefully you found that
pretty interesting.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.660
And actually, I know I'm going
over time, but I think this

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.820
is-- A lot of people take linear
algebra, they learn how

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.500
to do all of the things, and
they say, well what is the

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.180
whole point of this?

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.020
But this is kind of
an interesting

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.250
thing to think about.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:27.070
We had this had vector a and
we had this vector b.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.310
And we were able to say, well
there's some combinations of

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.600
the vectors a and b, that
when we added it up,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.400
we got vector c.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.250
So an interesting question is,
what are all the vectors that

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.390
I could get to by adding
combinations of

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.220
vectors a and b.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.600
Or adding or subtracting.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.280
Or you could say,
I could multiply

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.090
them by negative numbers.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.730
But either way.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.260
What are all of the vectors
that I can get by taking

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.490
linear combinations of
vectors a and b?

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:57.600
And that's actually called the
vector space spanned by the

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.360
vectors a and b.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.060
And we'll do more of that
in linear algebra.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.460
And here we're dealing
with a two

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.450
dimensional Euclidean space.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.160
We could have had three
dimensional vectors.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.740
We could've had n dimensional
vectors.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.990
So it gets really, really,
really abstract.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.390
But this is, I think, a really
good toe dipping for linear

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:14.980
algebra as well.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.110
So hopefully I haven't confused
or overwhelmed you.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.430
And I'll see you in
the next video.
