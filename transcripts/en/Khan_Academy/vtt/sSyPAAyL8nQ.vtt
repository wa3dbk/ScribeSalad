00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.260
Let's say I have a path in the
xy plane that's essentially

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.990
the unit circle.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:15.080
So this is my y-axis, this is
my x-axis, and our path is

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.780
going to be the unit circle.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.070
And we're going to traverse
it just like that.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.940
We're going to traverse
it clockwise.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.460
I think you get the idea.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.530
And so its equation
is the units circle.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.600
So the equation of this is x
squared plus y squared is

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.440
equal to 1; has a radius
of 1 unit circle.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.690
And what we're concerned
with is the line integral

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.700
over this curve c.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.310
It's a closed curve c.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:11.400
It's actually going in that
direction of 2y dx minus 3x dy.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.760
So, we are probably
tempted to use Green's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.520
theorem and why not?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.200
So let's try.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.970
So this is our path.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.510
So Green's theorem tells us
that the integral of some curve

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:33.640
f dot dr over some path where f
is equal to-- let me write

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.020
it a little nit neater.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:46.650
Where f of x,y is equal to P
of x, y i plus Q of x, y j.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.960
That this integral is equal to
the double integral over the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.510
region-- this would be the
region under question

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.780
in this example.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:10.140
Over the region of the partial
of Q with respect to x

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.170
minus the partial of
P with respect to y.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.250
All of that dA, the
differential of area.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.110
And of course, the region
is what I just showed you.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.690
Now, you may or may not
remember-- well, there's a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.500
slight, subtle thing in
this, which would give

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.590
you the wrong answer.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.370
In the last video we said that
Green's theorem applies when

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.220
we're going counterclockwise.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.905
Notice, even on this little
thing on the integral I made

00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:42.410
it go counterclockwise.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.740
In our example, the
curve goes clockwise.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.430
The region is to our right.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.295
Green's theorem-- this applies
when the region is to our left.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.000
So in this situation when the
region is to our right and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.340
we're going-- so this
is counterclockwise.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.140
So in our example, where we're
going clockwise, the region is

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.960
to our right, Green's theorem
is going to be the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.730
negative of this.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.970
So in our example, we're going
to have the integral of c and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.670
we're going to go in the
clockwise direction.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.910
So maybe I'll draw it like that
of f dot dr. This is going

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.000
to be equal to the double
integral over the region.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.960
You could just swap these two--
the partial of P with respect

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.880
to y minus the partial of
Q with respect to x da.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.650
So let's do that.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.480
So this is going to be equal
to, in this example, the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.420
integral over the region--
let's just keep it

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.000
abstract for now.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.420
We could start setting the
boundaries, but let's just

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.930
keep the region abstract.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.790
And what is the partial of P
with respect-- let's remember,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.650
this right here is our-- I
think we could recognize right

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.010
now that if we take f dot dr
we're going to get this.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.940
The dr contributes
those components.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.330
The f contributes
these two components.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.570
So this is P of x,y.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.370
And then this is Q of x,y.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.865
And we've seen it.

00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:16.010
I don't want to go into the
whole dot dr and take the dot

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.950
product over and over again.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.120
I think you can see that
this is the dot product

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.570
of two vectors.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.310
This is the x component
of f, y component of f.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.300
This is the x component of dr,
y component of dr. So let's

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.290
take the partial of P
with respect to y.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.740
You take the derivative of this
with respect to y, you get 2.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.740
Derivative of 2y is just 2.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.590
So you get 2, and then,
minus the derivative of

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.270
Q with respect to x.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.100
Derivative of this with
respect to x is minus 3.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.800
So we're going to get minus
3, and then all of that da.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.430
And this is equal to the
integral over the region.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.540
What's this, it's
2 minus minus 3?

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.510
That's the same
thing as 2 plus 3.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.190
So it's the integral over
the region of 5 dA.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.280
5 is just a constant, so we can
take it out of the integral.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.230
So this is going to turn out
to be quite a simple problem.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.790
So this is going to be equal to
5 times the double integral

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.870
over the region R dA.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.080
Now what is this thing?

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.610
What is this thing right here?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.880
It looks very abstract,
but we can solve this.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.770
This is just the
area of the region.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.550
That's what that double
integral represents.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.470
You just sum up all
the little dA's.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.490
That's a dA, that's a dA.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.270
You sum up the infinite
sums of those little

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.150
dA's over the region.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.580
Well, what's the area
of this unit circle?

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.730
Here we just break out a little
bit of ninth grade-- actually,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.630
even earlier than that--
pre-algebra or middle

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.860
school geometry.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.960
Area is equal to pi r squared.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.360
What's our radius?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.800
So unit circle,
our radius is 1.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.980
Length is 1.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.200
So the area here is pi.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.290
So this thing over here,
that whole thing is

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.350
just equal to pi.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.460
So the answer to our line
integral is just 5 pi, which

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.570
is pretty straightforward.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.420
I mean, we could have taken the
trouble of setting up a double

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.870
integral where we take the
antiderivative with respect to

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.990
y first and write y is equal to
the negative square root of 1

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.990
minus x squared y is equal to
the positive square root.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.810
x goes from minus 1 to 1.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.060
But that would have been
super hairy and a huge pain.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.250
And we just have to realize,
no, this is just the area.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.000
And the other interesting thing
is I challenge you to solve

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.170
the same integral without
using Green's theorem.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.310
You know, after generating a
parameterization for this

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.230
curve, going in that direction,
taking the derivatives

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.660
of x of t and y of t.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.880
Multiplying by the appropriate
thing and then taking the

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.540
antiderivative-- way hairier
than what we just did using

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.810
Green's theorem to get 5 pi.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.645
And remember, the reason why
it wasn't minus 5 pi here

00:06:54.645 --> 00:06:57.980
is because we're going in
a clockwise direction.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.040
If we were going in a
counterclockwise direction we

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.330
could have applied the straight
up Green's theorem, and we

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.200
would have gotten minus 5 pi.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.530
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
