00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
 

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.610
We now know how to name
aldehydes and ketones, and

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.845
what I want to do in this video
is show a mechanism for

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:06.710
actually creating one.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.230
In particular, we're going
to create a ketone.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.060
So let's say we've got ourselves
some benzene, and in

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.020
the first step of this reaction,
the benzene is just

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.219
going to sit and watch.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.870
We've got some benzene
and we've got

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.260
some of acetyl chloride.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.530
So it looks almost like an
aldehyde or a ketone, but

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.630
instead of having a carbon chain
or a hydrogen, we're

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.790
going to have a chlorine
atom right over there.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.350
So this is acetyl chloride,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.660
sometimes called acyl chloride.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.670
This is acetyl chloride, and
we're going to have an

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.420
aluminum chloride catalyst. And
a catalyst means that it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
participates in the reaction,
but it enters the reaction and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.000
it exits the reaction as
the same molecule.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.890
So it just catalyzes it.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.040
It doesn't disappear.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.130
It just changes halfway,
but then goes back

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.590
to what it was before.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.820
So we have some aluminum
chloride and it's bonded to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.630
one, two, three chlorines.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.260
Now, the first step of this
reaction is to turn this

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.420
acetyl chloride into a good
electrophile, turn it into

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.270
something that's really good at
nabbing electrons, so good

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.310
that it can break the
aromaticity of the benzene

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.960
ring and essentially add itself
to the benzene ring.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.200
This is actually the same
mechanism we saw with

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.510
electrophilic aromatic
substitution.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.130
I always have trouble
remembering the name, but I

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.910
always imagine it's
electrophilic substitution.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.230
Either way, but it's a very
similar mechanism.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.730
And actually, what we're going
to show in this video is

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.670
called Friedel-Crafts acylation,
because this right

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.710
here is called an acyl group and
we're essentially going to

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.200
acylate the benzene ring.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.360
We're going to add this
group right here

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.750
to the benzene ring.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.340
So enough of what's
going to happen.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.480
Let's actually see it happen.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.340
So the first thing to realize,
this aluminum chloride, the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.350
aluminum in it is electron
deficient.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.470
And at first, if you just look
at the Periodic Table, you

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.100
have these chlorines over here,
pretty electronegative.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.860
Aluminum is in the same row, but
chlorine's way more to the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.110
right, so it's more
electronegative, so the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.340
chlorines are going to hog the
electrons in this molecule.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.586
The chlorines are going to hog
electrons, so the aluminum is

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:16.640
going to have a partial
positive charge.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.650
Chlorines will have slightly
partial negative charge.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.930
On top of that, you see aluminum
is a Group 3 element,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.040
one, two, three, so it has
three valence electrons.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.790
You see that right here, one,
two, three, nowhere close to

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.730
the magic number of eight.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.990
Even when it covalently bonds
with these chlorines, it can

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.790
only pretend like it
has six electrons.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.630
It can kind of pretend like it
has these chlorine electrons

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.830
over here, but that only
gets it to six.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.760
So it would really like to have
more electrons to get

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.620
closer to that magic
eight number.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.840
So what you can imagine is a
situation where this chlorine

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.170
on the acetyl chloride, it's
already hogging this green

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.300
electron from this carbon.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.160
It was already doing that.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.920
It's more electronegative, so
this thing over here will

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.200
actually be given
to the aluminum.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.550
And so it will then have a
bond with the chloride.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.160
So if that happened, what does
our reaction look like?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.690
So if that happened, what does
everything look like?

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.850
Our aluminum, our aluminum
chloride, or what was formerly

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.520
aluminum chloride, now just
gained an electron, and with

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.030
it, it is now bonded to
another chlorine.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.890
So it is now bonded to another
chlorine, and since it gains

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.700
an electron-- let me
make it very clear.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.400
This is an L.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.870
My penmanship is
deteriorating.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.830
That's an L.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.660
And since this aluminum gained
an electron, it now has a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.260
negative charge.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.700
And normally, a negatively
charged thing isn't that

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.980
stable, but these guys are
electronegative, so they might

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.850
hog a lot of that
negative charge.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.110
And on top of it, aluminum
can now pretend like

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.600
it has eight electrons.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.200
It has one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.830
When you covalently bond to
someone, you can kind of

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.630
pretend like you have their
electrons as well.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.120
So now you have this anion
that was formed from the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.480
aluminum chloride, and now
the acetyl chloride

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.580
will look like this.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.570
Scroll down a little bit.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.350
Let me make it clear.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.754
We're in the next step
of the reaction.

00:04:18.754 --> 00:04:21.730
 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.250
What was formerly the acetyl
chloride has now lost the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.200
chloride, so it's now really
just an acyl group.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.070
So you have the carbonyl bonded
to a CH3, a methyl,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.150
just like that.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.520
This guy lost his electrons,
so now he

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.180
has a positive charge.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.240
And this is actually
not that stable.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.850
you're going to see it's
actually highly reactive.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.200
It's a very good electrophile.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.810
It wants to steal other
people's electrons.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.640
But it can exist for a short
amount of time, especially

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.200
because it is resonant
stabilized.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.190
You say, how is it resonant
stabilized?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.070
Well, this oxygen over here has
two electron pairs that I

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.580
didn't draw before.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.680
And let me draw the second
one in a different color.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.620
It has two electron
pairs like that.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.230
So you can imagine
the situation.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.570
This carbon is already-- he has
a positive charge, and his

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.590
oxygen is more electronegative.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.880
It's already hogging
his electrons.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.280
Maybe he wants to give
back a little bit.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.190
Say, hey, this is positive.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.910
All of the electrons are
hanging out here.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.440
They'd be attracted to the
positive, and you could

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.440
imagine one of these
electrons being

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.970
given back to the carbon.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.870
And if that happened then we
have another resonance form

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.770
that looks like this.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.295
So this was our original
molecule.

00:05:34.295 --> 00:05:36.820
 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.010
That's our original, or
what it looked like.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.390
We still have this double bond
right over there or that pair

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.950
of electrons.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.960
Now, this pair of electrons
now forms another bond.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.540
This electron here is now
on the oxygen end.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.720
This electron over here is now
on the carbon end, and now

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.500
they have a triple bond.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.540
And what happened?

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.870
This positive carbon gained an
electron, so it's now neutral.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.180
And the neutral oxygen
lost an electron,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.140
so it is now positive.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.260
And you could imagine, this
is not a very stable-- you

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.430
wouldn't see this just floating
around by itself, but

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.625
it does stabilize this
entire configuration.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:13.950
It stabilizes this molecule.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.580
So you can show that these
are alternate resonantly

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.700
stabilized structures
right there.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.720
But as I said, these aren't
super stable.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.180
This guy really, really,
really wants to react.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.050
And now this is where benzene
comes into the mix.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.030
And actually, let me draw a
little dividing line here,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.410
just so we know that
this was a separate

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.330
stage of our reaction.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.500
So that was the first stage.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.590
Then we go over here and now
benzene comes into the mix.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.520
The benzene was floating
around.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.340
So we have our benzene floating

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.140
around, just like that.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.790
And then I'm going to draw
one of the hydrogens

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.760
on one of the carbons.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.510
All of these carbons have
hydrogens on them.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.420
I just won't draw them all.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.320
It just make things
complicated.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.050
But this guy we said is a really
good electrophile, and

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.640
you have to be a really good
electrophile to attract

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.870
electrons from a benzene ring,
to break it's aromaticity.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.630
But if it bumps into this guy in
just the right way, at just

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.620
the right angle, you could
imagine that this electron on

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.200
this carbon right here gets
swiped by the acyl group.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.970
 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.830
So then what do we have?

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.840
So now I will go back
in this direction.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.075
So you have what was
a benzene ring.

00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:36.050
 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.420
We can draw the double
bonds here and here.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.920
 

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.320
And we, of course, have
this hydrogen.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.680
But now this bond, which was
a double bond there, is now

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.070
bonded to the acyl group.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.900
So it has that blue electron
that the acyl group nabbed.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.960
And let me draw the
acyl group.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.250
And I'll flip it over so that
we have the methyl on the

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.020
right-hand side.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:06.930
So it's carbonyl bonded
to a CH3.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.050
It was positive.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.420
It now gained an electron.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.510
It is now neutral.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.350
This carbon over here lost
an electron, so it is now

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:21.950
positive, so it is now
positively charged.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.050
Now, we mentioned the aluminum
chloride is a catalyst, so it

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.610
won't just sit around
there as the anion.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.730
It has to go back to being
aluminum chloride, so let's

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.730
bring the aluminum chloride
back into the scene.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.200
So we have our aluminum
chloride.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.080
Let me copy and paste it.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.150
So we have our aluminum chloride
here, and so you can

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.830
imagine that the benzene ring
wants to go back to being

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:54.910
aromatic, so this electron right
here on the hydrogen

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.630
might really want to go back
to this carbon right over

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.540
here, this carbocation.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.790
At the same time, if this anion
now passes the hydrogen

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.960
at just the right angle at the
right time while this guy's

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.310
attracted to this carbon, this
chlorine can give this green

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.350
electron to the hydrogen
nucleus, which is

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.620
really just a proton.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.940
And then the hydrogen's electron
can be taken up by

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.000
what was this carbocation.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.780
And then what do we have?

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.070
Then we have a situation where
our benzene ring is reformed.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.970
We have the aromaticity again.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.630
We have that double bond, that
double bond, and now we have

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.980
this double bond again, although
now it's using the

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.350
electron from the hydrogen.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.940
And now we've substituted this
hydrogen with essentially this

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.740
acyl group right over here.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.600
So we have a carbon double
bonded to an oxygen bonded to

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.860
a methyl group.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.885
And now the aluminum, or this
anion, lost its electron, so

00:10:01.885 --> 00:10:05.790
it goes back to just being
straight-up aluminum chloride.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.100
It goes back to just being
straight-up neutral,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.130
electron-deficient aluminum
chloride.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.480
And we're done.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.050
We've just acylized this benzene
ring, and that's why

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:32.245
this mechanism is called
Friedel-Crafts acylation.

00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:35.220
 

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.460
And Friedel is actually a former
president of MIT, and I

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.680
did some reading on this.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.120
Apparently, he did not have a
PhD, but because he discovered

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.450
Friedel-Crafts acylation and
this Friedel-Crafts alkylation

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.380
as well, they said, hey, you
know, this guy's a smart dude.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.710
Let's make him the
president of MIT.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.620
But I just wanted to show you
that this is a reaction for

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.710
creating a ketone.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.500
So this ketone that we've
created is acetophenone, which

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.740
we've seen before, which we've
learned is a common name for

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.940
this molecule that we learned
in the first ketone video.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.940
And I'll write it in purple.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.190
Acetophenone.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.010
 

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.610
And we're done!

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.110
