00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.650
In the last video, I hinted
that this was leading to a

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.940
discussion of an elastic money
supply-- or a supply of money

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.890
that can change depending on
the needs for the money.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.340
So before we go there-- and I
took a little hiatus and told

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.880
you a little bit about
treasuries because that's a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.710
critical component-- let's
review what the

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.400
money supply even is.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.030
So there were two definitions.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.050
When we had originally talked
about kind of an M0, I talked

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.530
about just the gold reserves,
but now we're going to expand

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.640
that definition a little bit
and I think you can tell--

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.650
I've got a lot of questions
about this-- eventually

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.990
getting off the gold reserve
system and we will get there

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.070
and we're kind of already there,
but now I'll consider

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.400
the base money supply
as Federal Reserve

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.640
deposits and notes.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.570
So in this reality that I just
created, all of the Federal

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.340
Reserve deposits have
essentially been turned into

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.180
notes, but if this bank didn't
want all cash, it could have

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.600
had some of this as just a
checking account with the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.140
Federal Reserve bank.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.230
So a Federal Reserve note and
a Federal Reserve deposit

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.140
account is essentially
the same thing.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.940
A note is just a little
bit more fungible.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.110
You can hand it to someone and
then they can hand it to

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.760
someone else, while a checking
account or demand account with

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.820
the Federal Reserve bank, you
have to kind of do a wire

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.330
transfer or write a check, et
cetera, but that is the base

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.930
money supply.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.150
You could call that
base money.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.980
And that's essentially the size
of the liabilities of the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.510
Federal Reserve, in very broad
terms. We'll go into detail on

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.000
the actual Federal
Reserve's balance

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.130
sheet in the near future.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.860
So in this example right now,
our base money supply is 200--

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.020
let's call it dollars now.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.340
Let's move away from
gold pieces.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.930
Let's just say a dollar equals
a gold piece for the sake of

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.880
our instruction right now.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.260
So our base money supply--
and I'll call that M0.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.310
And that's the cash out there,
which are the Federal Reserve

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.870
notes plus the Federal Reserve
demand deposits.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.100
So for example, this could have
been just 100, like a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.140
checking account at the reserve
bank and then this

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.800
over here would have been a
checking account instead.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.330
But it would still be considered
part of the base

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.830
money supply because if this
bank, who had a checking

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.880
account, says, I just want that
in terms of notes, then

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.350
the Federal Reserve bank will
just issue notes and cancel

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.330
out this checking account and it
would turn back into notes.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.150
So they're equivalent.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.630
They're just a different way
of keeping track of it.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.870
So that's the base
money supply.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.740
Now, a slightly broader
definition

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.840
of the money supply.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.585
We could call this bank money.

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:33.160
It's sometimes referred to as
that and the formal definition

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.740
is M1-- and that's essentially
that notion that I went over I

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.000
think almost 10 videos ago--
how much money do

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.440
people think they have?

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.810
And that's the amount of money
in demand deposit accounts.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.670
So that in this case,
that's this.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.890
So all the people in this bank,
they think they have

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.360
$100 there, right?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.500
That's $100 that they think that
they have that they can

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.450
write checks against.
And then this bank

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.710
also has another $100.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:12.820
And so the base money supply--
no, that's not right.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.420
No, no, sorry.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.530
They don't have $100.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.180
Why am I saying $100?

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.460
Let's see.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.750
This bank had $100 in gold and
it could lend out up to $200

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.700
in-- or it could put
out up to $200 in

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.830
checking deposit accounts.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.220
So it has $200.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.850
Right, that's what I was--
because we talked about

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.670
earlier in the last video that
we have a 50% reserve ratio,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.290
which tells us that if this
bank has $100 in reserves,

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.130
that it can essentially manage--
or it can issue $200

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.810
in demand deposit accounts.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.010
And we went over that many times
on how that happens.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.350
And then this bank
can do the same.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.040
It'll have $200 in demand
deposit accounts.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.790
And so the total amount of money
that people think they

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.150
have, either in demand deposit
accounts-- in this situation,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.330
I'm assuming that all of the
cash is sitting in the reserve

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330
bank, although we do know that
some of this is going to be

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.490
sitting around circulating.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.530
But let's just say we live in
a world where everyone uses

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.670
debit cards all the time
and no-one uses cash.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.870
And I think we're heading to
that world very quickly.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.410
And as we'll see soon, that
actually increases the money

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.339
supply when you do that.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.740
But anyway, I don't want to
go too technical just yet.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.950
But the M1, which is the total
amount of demand deposit

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.540
accounts in our universe,
is $400.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.660
And this relationship makes
a lot of sense because our

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.410
reserve requirements are 50%.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.190
So we can kind of assume that
banks tend to get as close to

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.890
their reserve requirement as
they can because they don't

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.390
get interest on reserves.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.200
They make interest on the loans
that they make against

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.540
demand accounts.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.090
So if the reserve requirement
were 10% and our base money

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.550
was $200, we would probably see
$2,000 in the M1 supply.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.840
So my question to you is-- and
maybe you want to pause and

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.470
think about this is-- how can
the government or the central

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.930
bank or, how can the economy,
increase or

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.470
decrease the money supply?

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.110
And I guess the first question
is, why would you want to

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.420
increase or decrease
the money supply?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.060
Well, let's say we're in this
world already and we only have

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.810
these two banks.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.250
And we have an M1
supply of $400.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.130
But let's say the
economy expands.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.590
We have more goods
and services that

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.260
we're able to produce.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.140
Maybe we have immigrants come
in so we have more labor.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.150
Maybe we have some innovative
technology.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.110
Or maybe it's just seasonal.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.600
Maybe it's the crop planting
season so a lot of farmers

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.830
need their cash in order
to hire people

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.920
to plant the crops.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.800
So that's another time where
you'd want more money.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.120
If you don't increase the money
supply at those times

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.220
when you have economic expansion
or there's just more

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.260
demand because of some type of
seasonal fluctuaction-- if you

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.340
don't increase the money, then
what you're going to do is

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.620
money's going to become
more expensive.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.390
And I'll do a whole video
on that so don't get too

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.550
confused, but money getting
more expensive means that

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.200
interest rates will go up.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.510
And if money becomes too
expensive, then some good

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.470
projects, maybe some farmers who
might have planted seeds,

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.970
wouldn't be able to-- and so
you would kind of restrict

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.070
economic expansion.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.090
But we'll have a whole other
discussion on when does it

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.750
make sense to expand
or contract money.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.820
Let's just talk now about how
you would actually do it.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.860
So there's two ways.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.550
I just said if this reserve
requirement were 10%, then

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.200
these banks could create more
checking accounts, right?

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.090
They could lend out more money
and create more checking

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.460
accounts if the reserve
requirement were 10%.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.130
If it was 10%, then you would
have an M1 of $2,000, right?

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.256
It would be 10 times this
instead of two times this.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.410
And that is considered one of
the tools of the Federal

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.040
Reserve bank.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.790
Because we've said in the past
that the Federal Reserve bank

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.640
actually sets these reserve
requirements.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.680
But the problem with that tool,
if you think about it,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.670
is, if we made a reserve
requirement 10%, right?

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.970
And all of a sudden all of these
banks started lending a

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.840
lot more money and they
only had 10%.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.460
The ratio of reserves to
checking accounts were 10%.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.430
Think about what would happen
if we wanted to raise the

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.630
reserve requirement
back to 50%.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.150
Then all of the banks-- they'd
only have 10% reserves.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.540
How would they get
back to 50%?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.570
All of these banks would have to
either start selling assets

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.690
or unwinding loans.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.330
It would be a very
messy situation.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.850
If you were to lower the reserve
requirement and then

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.880
wanted to actually increase it
again, you would actually make

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.640
a lot of banks become
undercapitalized, because most

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.630
banks just operate right
at where they need to.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.820
So you really don't want to mess
around with this reserve

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.660
requirement much.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.830
So the question is, if you're
not going to change the

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.510
reserve requirement, which is
the ratio of the reserves to

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.030
checking accounts, if you're not
going to mess with that,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.320
the only other way that you
can actually increase the

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.420
number of checking accounts is
if somehow you can increase

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.600
the reserves.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:56.120
If you can somehow add some
actual reserves over here.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.210
So my question is, how
can you do that?

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.480
Well, let's just say that--
we're hopefully already

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.180
reasonably familiar with
fractional reserve banking.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.770
So you might have seen it
coming, that that also applies

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.790
to the central bank.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.110
So the central bank right now,
all of its deposits were

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.910
directly backed by gold, 1:1.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:19.400
But there's nothing to stop
this bank from also doing

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.130
fractional reserve lending.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.970
And actually, the central bank
has no reserve requirement.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.690
And that's because to some
degree, it can always provide

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.180
the liquidity because its notes
are obligations of the

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:31.630
government.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:36.059
So it can always tax more people
to back up its loans.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:39.700
So what essentially the Federal
Reserve can do is--

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.159
and this is the printing press
of the base money supply that

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.190
people talk about.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.460
But there's two printing
presses.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.640
There's the base money printing
press and then

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.750
there's the leverage
printing press.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.170
So if this increases-- well,
I'll do a whole video on that

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.950
another-- I don't want to get
too technical because I

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.930
realize I'm running
out of time.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.880
So what the Federal Reserve
could do in this situation is

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.690
it can print some notes.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.450
So let's say it prints 100 of
the notes, right, and those

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.360
are just-- it literally just
prints those dollars.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.260
It pays the treasury to print
it for them, but it creates

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.400
these notes and then of course,
offsetting that is a

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.000
liability, right?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.190
Notes outstanding,
100 liability.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.990
And then what it does is, it
takes these $100-- I mean,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.290
these are literally dollar bills
although it could be

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.540
some type of demand account or
whatever, but take these $100

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.220
bills that it printed and
then it can buy treasury

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.170
securities.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.920
So what happens if it takes
these $100 bills and buys

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.350
treasuries?

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.790
And the treasuries don't
have to be issued by

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:46.630
the government anymore.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.630
Because whenever the government
does issue

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.760
treasuries, it's bought
by just a bunch of

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.310
people in the world.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.340
There's always a bunch of
treasuries sitting out there

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.300
as long as the treasury
has some debt.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.650
So I was holding the treasuries
and let's say that

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.900
this is the central bank.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.780
I was holding some some of these
government IOUs, right,

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.820
that I had bought from
the government.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:17.630
And the Federal Reserve,
they have this $100.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:18.880
Let me draw that in green.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.300
So they just buy the
treasury from me.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.640
Maybe I don't want to sell it
at the current price so they

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.610
have to pay me a little bit more
than the current price in

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.610
order for me to part with it--
and I'll do a whole other

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.510
video on what that means and
how that changes the yield

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.310
curve and all of that, but I
just want to get you to that

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.610
base notion that the treasury
essentially creates a notes

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.530
outstanding liability and has
an offsetting $100 of dollar

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.160
bills that it just created or
prints-- and then it can use

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.700
those $100 bills to buy
treasuries, or government

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.910
IOUs, in the open market.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.510
And now what happens here?

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.820
Well, these $100 bills, these
are now treasuries.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.450
And my question to you
is, what am I-- I

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.430
was holding a treasury.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.730
It was sitting in my mattress.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.790
What am I now going-- now
I don't have a treasury.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.190
I have $100.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.430
What am I going to do
with that $100?

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.950
Well, I'm going to deposit
it in the bank.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.530
I'm going to deposit
it in the bank.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.480
So this is me depositing
my $100.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.100
Maybe I deposited it up here,
but-- and my checking account

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.520
grows a little bit, but
what's the net effect?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.030
Now all of a sudden the banking
system, the national

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.500
banking system, has more
currency, more dollar

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.860
reserves, that apply to
its reserve ratio.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.470
So now it got my $100 deposit.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.140
Now it can also do another
$100 of lending.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.370
So I would have essentially
increased the base-- so now

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:50.550
the M0 goes from $200 to $300
right, because I have $300 in

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.670
notes outstanding.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.960
And now my M1-- I took that $100
bill that the treasury

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.160
gave me, deposited it
in a bank account.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.520
Now I have a bank account that
says $100 and then because of

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.150
a 50% reserve requirement, the
bank can issue another loan.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.820
I know it's getting messy.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.690
$400-- so essentially
our M1 is now $600.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.780
So just like that, just by
printing money and issuing

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:20.890
treasuries, the central
bank was able to

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.880
increase the M1 by $200.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.940
I'll do more videos on this.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:25.910
I don't want to confuse
you too much.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.420
See you soon.
