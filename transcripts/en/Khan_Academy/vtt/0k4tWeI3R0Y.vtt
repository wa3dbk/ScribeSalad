00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:02.331
- [Voiceover] So I'm
explaining the formula for

00:00:02.331 --> 00:00:04.221
three-dimensional curl
and where we left off,

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:06.801
we have this determinant
of a three-by-three matrix,

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:07.955
which looks absurd because

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:09.215
none of the individual components

00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:11.165
are actual numbers, but nevertheless,

00:00:11.165 --> 00:00:12.324
I'm about show how when you kind of

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:14.415
go through the motions
of taking a determinant,

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:16.104
you get a vector-valued function

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:18.663
that corresponds to the curl.

00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:20.736
So let me show you what I mean by that.

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:22.303
If you're computing the determinant,

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:23.825
of the guy that we have pictured

00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:25.977
there in the upper-right,

00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:28.743
you start by taking this
upper-left component,

00:00:28.743 --> 00:00:31.037
and then multiplying it by the determinant

00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:33.678
of the sub-matrix, the sub-matrix whose

00:00:33.678 --> 00:00:35.446
rows are not the row of I and

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:37.864
whose columns are not the row of I.

00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:39.346
So what that looks like over here,

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:41.397
is we're gonna take that unit vector I,

00:00:41.397 --> 00:00:44.446
and then multiple it by a
certain little determinant,

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:46.537
and what this sub-determinant involves

00:00:46.537 --> 00:00:49.626
is multiplying this
partial-partial Y by R,

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:51.577
which means taking the partial derivative

00:00:51.577 --> 00:00:54.933
with respect to Y of the
multi-variable function R

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.024
and then subtracting off
the partial derivative

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.136
with respect to Z of Q.

00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:01.716
So we're subtracting
off partial derivative

00:01:01.716 --> 00:01:06.477
with respect to Z of the
multi-variable function Q,

00:01:06.477 --> 00:01:09.437
and then that,

00:01:09.437 --> 00:01:11.020
so that's the first thing that we do,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.260
and then as a second part,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.799
we take this J and we're
gonna subtract off,

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.485
so you're kind of thinking
plus, minus, plus,

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:19.128
for the elements in this top row,

00:01:19.128 --> 00:01:21.648
so we're gonna subtract off J,

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.167
multiplied by another sub-determinant,

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:26.607
and then this one is gonna involve,

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:28.395
you know, this column
that it's not part of

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:29.917
and this column that it's not part of,

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:32.719
and you imagine those guys
as a two-by-two matrix,

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.125
and its determinant involves taking the

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:36.927
partial derivative with respect to X of R,

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:38.898
so that's kind of the diagonal,

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:42.919
partial-partial X of R,

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:44.995
and then subtracting off
the partial derivative

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:47.066
with respect to Z of P,

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:51.350
so partial-partial Z of P,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.091
and then that's just two out of three

00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:57.344
of the things we need to do
for our overall determinant,

00:01:57.344 --> 00:01:58.931
because the last part we're gonna add,

00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:03.114
we're gonna add that
top-right component, K,

00:02:03.114 --> 00:02:06.752
multiplied by the sub-matrix whose

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:08.970
columns involve the
column it's not part of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.623
and whose rows involve the
rows that it's not part of,

00:02:12.623 --> 00:02:15.874
so K multiplied by the
determinant of this guy

00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:17.844
is going to be, let's see,

00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:19.774
partial-partial X of Q,

00:02:19.774 --> 00:02:24.774
so that's partial-partial X of Q

00:02:26.154 --> 00:02:28.796
minus partial-partial Y of P,

00:02:28.796 --> 00:02:32.394
so partial derivative with respect to Y

00:02:32.394 --> 00:02:35.277
of the multi-variable function P,

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:39.344
and that entire expression is the

00:02:39.344 --> 00:02:41.617
three-dimensional curl of the function

00:02:41.617 --> 00:02:44.948
whose components are P, Q, and R.

00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:46.575
So here we have our vector function,

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:48.404
vector-valued function V whose

00:02:48.404 --> 00:02:50.193
components are P, Q, and R,

00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:51.574
and when you go through this whole process

00:02:51.574 --> 00:02:53.524
of imagining the cross-product between

00:02:53.524 --> 00:02:55.921
the Del operator, this Nabla symbol,

00:02:55.921 --> 00:03:00.471
and the vector output P, Q, and R,

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:03.092
what you get is this whole expression,

00:03:03.092 --> 00:03:06.342
and, you know, here we're
writing with I, J, K notation,

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:09.492
if you're writing it as a column vector,

00:03:09.492 --> 00:03:11.442
I guess I didn't erase some of these guys,

00:03:11.442 --> 00:03:13.478
but if you're writing
this as a column vector,

00:03:13.478 --> 00:03:16.219
it would look like saying the curl

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.331
of your vector valued function V

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:20.689
as a function of X, Y, and Z

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.681
is equal to,

00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:26.237
and then what I'd put in
for this first component

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:27.270
would be what's up there,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.007
so that would be your partial
with respect to Y of R

00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:34.200
minus partial of Q with respect to Z,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.740
so partial of Q with respect to Z,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.912
and I won't copy it down
for all of the other ones

00:03:38.912 --> 00:03:39.890
but in principle, you know,

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.203
you'd kind of, whatever
this J component is,

00:03:42.203 --> 00:03:43.342
and I guess we're subtracting it

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:45.030
so you'd subtract there,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.791
you'd copy that as the next
component and then over here.

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:49.621
But often times when
you're computing curl,

00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:52.302
you kinda switch to
using this IJK notation.

00:03:52.302 --> 00:03:54.091
My personal preference,
I typically default

00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:55.920
to column vectors and other people

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.744
will write in terms of I, J, and K,

00:03:57.744 --> 00:03:59.044
it doesn't really matter as long as

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:01.872
you know how to go back
and forth between the two.

00:04:01.872 --> 00:04:03.373
One really quick thing
that I wanna highlight

00:04:03.373 --> 00:04:05.021
before doing an example of this

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:08.595
is that the K-component here,

00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:10.544
the Z-component of the output,

00:04:10.544 --> 00:04:12.943
is exactly the
two-dimensional curl formula.

00:04:12.943 --> 00:04:15.422
If you kind of look back
to the videos on 2-D curl

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.581
and what its formula is,

00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:18.043
that is what we have here.

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:19.242
And in fact all the other components

00:04:19.242 --> 00:04:20.830
kind of look like mirrors of that

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.760
but you're using slightly
different operators

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.463
and slightly different functions

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:25.642
but if you think about rotation

00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:27.553
that happens purely in the XY plane,

00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:29.160
just two-dimensional rotation,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.315
and how in three dimensions that's

00:04:30.315 --> 00:04:32.834
described with a vector in the K direction

00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:34.421
and again, if that
doesn't quite seem clear,

00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:36.124
maybe look back at the video on

00:04:36.124 --> 00:04:38.341
describing rotation with
a three-dimensional vector

00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:39.521
and the right-hand rule,

00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.322
but vector is pointing
in the pure Z direction,

00:04:42.322 --> 00:04:44.560
describe rotation in the XY plane,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.283
and what's happening with these other guys

00:04:46.283 --> 00:04:47.684
is kind of similar, right?

00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:50.714
Rotation that happens
purely in the XZ plane

00:04:50.714 --> 00:04:52.704
is gonna correspond with a rotation vector

00:04:52.704 --> 00:04:54.170
in the Y direction, the direction

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.730
perpendicular to the X, let's see, so

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.721
the XZ plane over here.

00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:00.711
And then similarly this first component

00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:02.294
kind of tells you all
the rotation happening

00:05:02.294 --> 00:05:04.773
in the YZ plane and the vectors

00:05:04.773 --> 00:05:08.104
in the I direction, the X
direction of the output,

00:05:08.104 --> 00:05:11.213
kind of corresponds to
rotation in that plane.

00:05:11.213 --> 00:05:12.372
Now when you compute it,

00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:13.471
you're not always thinking about

00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:14.912
oh, you know, this corresponds to

00:05:14.912 --> 00:05:15.991
rotation in that plane and this

00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:17.492
corresponds to rotation in that plane,

00:05:17.492 --> 00:05:19.035
you're just kind of computing it to

00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:20.012
get a formula out,

00:05:20.012 --> 00:05:20.965
but I think it's kind of nice to

00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:22.633
recognize that all the intuition

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:24.134
that we put into the two-dimensional curl

00:05:24.134 --> 00:05:25.722
does show up here

00:05:25.722 --> 00:05:27.673
and another thing I wanna emphasize

00:05:27.673 --> 00:05:30.393
is this is not a formula to be memorized.

00:05:30.393 --> 00:05:32.162
I would not, if I were you, try to

00:05:32.162 --> 00:05:34.641
sit down and memorize
this long expression.

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:36.632
The only thing that you need to remember,

00:05:36.632 --> 00:05:38.723
the only thing, is that curl is

00:05:38.723 --> 00:05:41.404
represented as this Del cross V,

00:05:41.404 --> 00:05:43.823
this Nabla symbol cross product with

00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:45.451
a vector-valued function V,

00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:47.300
because from there, whatever
your components are,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.862
you can kind of go through the process

00:05:48.862 --> 00:05:50.384
that I just did and the more you do it,

00:05:50.384 --> 00:05:51.644
the quicker it becomes,

00:05:51.644 --> 00:05:53.902
it's kind of long but it
doesn't take that long,

00:05:53.902 --> 00:05:55.892
and it's certainly much
more fault-tolerant

00:05:55.892 --> 00:05:57.459
than trying to remember something that

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:00.161
has as many moving parts as the formula

00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:01.582
that you see here,

00:06:01.582 --> 00:06:02.942
and in the next video I'll go through

00:06:02.942 --> 00:06:04.041
an actual example of that.

00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:06.374
I'll have functions for P, Q, and R

00:06:06.374 --> 00:06:08.430
and walk through that process in

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.034
a more concrete context.

00:06:10.034 --> 00:06:11.160
I'll see you then!
