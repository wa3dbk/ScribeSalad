00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.340
I've been doing a ton of videos
on the mechanics of

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.530
taking the Laplace Transform,
but you've been sitting

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.620
through them always wondering,
what am I learning this for?

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.670
And now I'll show you, at
least in the context of

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.870
differential equations.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.140
And I've gotten a
bunch of letters

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.680
on the Laplace Transform.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.570
What does it really mean?

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.390
And and all that.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.050
And those are excellent
questions and you should

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.120
strive for that.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.410
It's hard to really have an
intuition of the Laplace

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.030
Transform in the differential
equations context, other than

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.630
it being a very useful tool that
converts differential or

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.530
integral problems into algebra
problems. But I'll give you a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.980
hint, and if you want a path
to learn it in, you should

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.520
learn about Fourier series and
Fourier Transforms, which are

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.710
very similar to Laplace
Transforms. And that'll

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.360
actually build up the intuition
on what the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.610
frequency domain is all about.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.200
Well anyway, let's actually use
the Laplace Transform to

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.630
solve a differential equation.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.680
And this is one we've
seen before.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.210
So let me see.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.300
So let's say the differential
equation is y prime prime,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.330
plus 5, times the first
derivative, plus

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.210
6y, is equal to 0.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.930
And you know how to solve this
one, but I just want to show

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.490
you, with a fairly
straightforward differential

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.540
equation, that you could solve
it with the Laplace Transform.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.930
And actually, you
end up having a

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.630
characteristic equation.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.400
And the initial conditions are
y of 0 is equal to 2, and y

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.490
prime of 0 is equal to 3.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.100
Now, to use the Laplace
Transform here, we essentially

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.280
just take the Laplace Transform
of both sides of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.460
this equation.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.590
Let me use a more
vibrant color.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.060
So we get the Laplace Transform
of y the second

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.090
derivative, plus-- well we
could say the Laplace

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.590
Transform of 5 times y prime,
but that's the same thing as 5

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.745
times the Laplace Transform--
y prime.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.190
y prime plus 6 times the
Laplace Transform of y.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.910
And let me ask you a question.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.780
What's the Laplace
Transform of 0?

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.130
Let me do that.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.990
So the Laplace Transform of 0
would be be the integral from

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.160
0 to infinity, of 0 times
e to the minus stdt.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.330
So this is a 0 in here.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.400
So this is equal to 0.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.340
So the Laplace Transform
of 0 is 0.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.870
And that's good, because I
didn't have space to do

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.560
another curly L.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.730
So what are the Laplace
Transforms of these things?

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.210
Well this is where we break
out one of the useful

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.500
properties that we learned.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.530
Let me write it over here.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.820
I think that's going
to need as much

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.656
real estate as possible.

00:02:42.656 --> 00:02:44.320
Let me erase this.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.080
So we learned that the Laplace
Transform-- I'll do it here.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.860
Actually, I'll do
it down here.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.150
The Laplace Transform of f
prime, or we could even say y

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.990
prime, is equal to s times
the Laplace Transform of

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.690
y, minus y of 0.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.800
We proved that to you.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.300
And this is extremely
important to know.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.800
So let's see if we
can apply that.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.810
So the Laplace Transform of y
prime prime, if we apply that,

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:33.296
that's equal to s times the
Laplace Transform of-- well if

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:35.540
we go from y prime to y,
you're just taking the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.390
anti-derivative, so if you're
taking the anti-derivative of

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.140
y, of the second derivative, we
just end up with the first

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.950
derivative-- minus the first
derivative at 0.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.530
Notice, we're already using
our initial conditions.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.130
I won't substitute
it just yet.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.950
And then we end up with plus 5,
times-- I'll write it every

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:07.530
time-- so plus 5 times the
Laplace Transform of y prime,

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.800
plus 6 times the Laplace
Transform of y.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.970
All of that is equal to 0.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.490
So just to be clear, all I did
is I expanded this into this

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.350
using this.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.410
So how can we rewrite the
Laplace Transform of y prime?

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.870
Well, we could use this once
again, so let's do that.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.630
So this over here-- I'll do it
in magenta-- this is equal to

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.830
s times what?

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.950
s times the Laplace Transform
of y prime.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:48.410
Well that's s times the Laplace
Transform of y, minus

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.220
y of 0, right?

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.300
I took this part and replaced
it with what I have in

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.310
parentheses.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:05.800
So minus y prime of 0-- and now
I'll switch colors-- plus

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.370
5 times-- once again the Laplace
Transform of y prime.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.360
Well we can use this again.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:24.550
So 5 times s times Laplace
Transform of y, minus y of 0,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.540
plus 6 times the Laplace
Transform-- oh I ran out of

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.160
space, I'll do it in another
line-- plus 6 times the

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.250
Laplace Transform of y.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.190
All of that is equal to 0.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.730
I know this looks really
confusing but we'll

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.820
simplify right now.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.680
And we could get rid of this
right here, because we've used

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.550
it as much as we need to.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.050
So now we just simplify.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.900
And notice, using the Laplace
Transform, we didn't have to

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.030
guess at a general solution
or anything like that.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.900
Even when we did a
characteristic equation, we

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.030
guessed what the original
general solution was.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.900
Now we're just taking Laplace
Transforms, and let's see

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.595
where this gets us.

00:05:57.595 --> 00:05:59.410
And actually I just want to
make clear, because I know

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:09.830
it's very confusing, so I
rewrote this part as this.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.260
And I rewrote this
thing as this.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.360
And everything else
is the same.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.610
But now let's simplify
the math.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.930
So we get s squared, times the
Laplace Transform of y-- I'm

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.900
going to write smaller, I've
learned my lesson-- minus s

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.150
times y of 0.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.860
Let's substitute y of 0 here. y
of 0 is 2, so s times y of 0

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.970
is 2 times s, so 2s, distribute
that s, minus y

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:42.770
prime of 0.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.590
Y prime of 0 is 3.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:52.720
So minus 3, plus-- so we have
5 times s times the Laplace

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.830
Transform of y, so plus 5s times
the Laplace Transform of

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:07.450
y, minus 5 times y of 0. y
of 0 is 2, so minus 10.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.980
Minus 10, right?

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.040
5 times-- this is 2 right here--
so 5 times 2, plus 6

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.950
times the Laplace
Transform of y.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.450
All of that is equal to 0.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.070
Now, let's group our Laplace
Transform of y terms and our

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.800
constant terms, and we
should be hopefully

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.790
getting some place.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.750
So let's see, my Laplace
Transform of y terms, I have

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:39.700
this one, I have this one,
and I have that one.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.480
So what am I left with?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.020
Well let me factor out the
Laplace Transform of y part.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.160
So I get the Laplace Transform
of y-- and that's good because

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.980
it's a pain to keep writing
it over and over-- times s

00:07:50.980 --> 00:08:02.120
squared plus 5s plus 6.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.370
So those are all my Laplace
Transform terms. And then I

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.460
have my constant terms. So let's
see, I have 1s, so minus

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:20.040
2s, minus 3, minus 10,
is equal to 0.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.480
And what can we do here?

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.480
Well, this is interesting,
first of all.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.270
Notice that the coefficients on
the Laplace Transform of y

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.200
terms, that those are that
characteristic equation that

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.840
we dealt with so much, and that
is hopefully, to some

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.909
degree, second nature to you.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.240
So that's a little bit of a
clue, and if you want some

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.690
very tenuous connections, well
that makes a lot of sense.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.030
Because the characteristic
equation to get that, we

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.030
substituted e to the rt, and the
Laplace Transform involves

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.140
very similar function.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.670
But anyway, let's go back
to the problem.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.400
So how do we solve this?

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.190
And actually, let me just give
you the big picture here,

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.630
because this is a good point.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.830
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to solve this.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.280
I'm going to say the Laplace
Transform of

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.970
y is equal to something.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.260
And then I'm going to say,
boy, what functions the

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.100
Laplace Transform
is at something?

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.220
And then I'll have
the solution.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.010
If that confuses you, just wait
and hopefully it'll make

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:09.380
some sense.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.630
From here until that point
it's just some

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.610
fairly hairy algebra.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.830
So let's scroll down a little
bit, just so we have some

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:17.900
breathing room.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:23.720
And so I get the Laplace
Transform of y, times s

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:29.800
squared, plus 5s, plus 6, is
equal to-- let's add these

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.950
terms to both sides of this
equation-- is equal to 2s plus

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:40.930
3 plus 10-- oh, that's
silly-- plus 13.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.630
This is minus 13 here.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.630
A phone call.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.770
Who's calling?

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.650
I think it's some kind of
marketing phone call.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.600
Anyway, 2s plus 13, and
now what can I do?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:51.910
Well.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.130
Let's divide both sides by this
s squared plus 5s plus 6.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:08.030
So I get the Laplace Transform
of y is equal to 2s plus 13,

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:13.910
over s squared plus 5s plus 6.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.540
Now we're almost done.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.440
Everything here is just a
little bit of algebra.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.350
So now we're almost done.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.730
We haven't solved for y yet, but
we know that the Laplace

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.970
Transform of y is
equal to this.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.160
Now, if we just had this in
our table of our Laplace

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.210
Transforms, we would immediately
know what y was,

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.750
but I don't see something, or
I don't remember anything we

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.790
did in our table that looks
like this expression of s.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.130
I'm essentially out of time, so
the next video we're going

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.950
to figure out what functions
Laplace Transform is this.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.490
And it actually turns out it's
a sum of things we already

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.590
know, and we just have to
manipulate this a little bit

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.640
algebraically.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.620
See you in the next video.
