00:00:00.877 --> 00:00:02.949
- [Voiceover] So I wanna give
you guys just one more example

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:04.798
of a transformation before we move on

00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:08.048
to the actual calculus of
multi variable calculus.

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:09.938
In the video on parametric surfaces

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:12.133
I gave you guys this function here.

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.124
Its a very complicated looking function

00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:15.465
its got a two dimensional input

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.050
and a three dimensional output

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.553
and I talked about how
you can think about it

00:00:18.553 --> 00:00:21.621
as drawing a surface in
three dimensional space

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.185
and that one came out to be the surface

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:26.944
of a doughnut which we also call a torus.

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:28.570
So what I wanna do here is talk about

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.662
how you might think of
this as a transformation

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:32.104
and first let me just get straight

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:34.380
what the input space here is.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.331
So the input space you
could think about it

00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.434
as the entire T,S plane, right?

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:42.752
We might draw this as the entire T axis

00:00:44.827 --> 00:00:46.652
and the S axis

00:00:46.652 --> 00:00:49.073
and just everything here
and see where it maps.

00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:51.325
But you can actually go to
just a small subset of that.

00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:54.921
So if you limit yourself
to T going between zero

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.754
so between zero and lets say 2 pi

00:00:59.147 --> 00:01:04.003
and then similarly with S
going from zero up to 2 pi

00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.685
can you imagine what, you know

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:09.570
that would be sort of a square region.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.419
Just limiting yourself to that

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:12.963
you're actually gonna
get all of the points

00:01:12.963 --> 00:01:15.686
that you need to draw the torus.

00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:17.230
And the basic reason for that is that

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.384
as T ranges from zero to 2 pi

00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:21.314
the cosine of T goes over its full range

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:23.935
before it starts becoming periodic.

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:26.982
Sine of T does the same
and same deal with S.

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:29.461
If you let S range from zero to 2 pi

00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:30.985
that covers a full period of cosine

00:01:30.985 --> 00:01:32.691
a full period of sine

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:35.353
so you'll get no new
information by going elsewhere.

00:01:35.353 --> 00:01:36.836
So what we can do is
think about this portion

00:01:36.836 --> 00:01:39.274
of the T,S plane kind of as living inside

00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:41.466
three dimensional space
as a sort of cheating

00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.282
but its a little bit easier to do this

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:44.966
than to imagine moving from

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.462
some separate area into the space.

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:48.986
At the very least for
the animation efforts

00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:51.524
its easier to just start it off in 3D.

00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:52.704
So what I'm thinking about here

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:55.813
this square is representing that T,S plane

00:01:55.813 --> 00:01:58.048
and for this function which is taking all

00:01:58.048 --> 00:02:00.120
of the points in this square as its input

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.294
and outputs a point in
three dimensional space

00:02:02.294 --> 00:02:03.879
you can think about how those points

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:07.379
move to their corresponding output points.

00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.437
So I'll show that again.

00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:13.509
We start off with our T,S plane here

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.419
and then whatever your input point is

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.573
if you were to follow it, and you were to

00:02:17.573 --> 00:02:20.559
follow it through this
whole transformation

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.469
the place where it lands would be

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.517
the corresponding output of this function.

00:02:25.517 --> 00:02:26.756
And one thing I should mention is

00:02:26.756 --> 00:02:29.072
all of the interpolating values

00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:31.795
as you go in between
these don't really matter.

00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:33.989
Their function is really
a very static thing

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.021
there's just an input
and there's an output.

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.850
And if I'm thinking in terms of

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.211
a transformation actually moving it

00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:42.238
there's a little bit of magic sauce

00:02:42.238 --> 00:02:45.022
that has to go into making
an animation do this

00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:46.159
and in this case I kind of put it

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.643
into two different phases to sort of

00:02:47.643 --> 00:02:49.878
roll up one side and roll up the other

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.377
it doesn't really matter
but the general idea

00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:54.835
of starting with a square
and somehow warping that

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:56.745
however you do choose to warp it

00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:58.675
is actually a pretty powerful thought.

00:02:58.675 --> 00:03:00.239
And as we get into multi variable calculus

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.840
and you start thinking a little
more deeply about surfaces

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.587
I think it really helps if you think about

00:03:04.587 --> 00:03:07.391
what a slight little movement over here

00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.764
on your input space would look like

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:12.999
what happens to that tiny little movement

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:14.563
or that tiny little traversal

00:03:14.563 --> 00:03:16.392
what it looks like if
you do that same movement

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:18.363
somewhere on the output space.

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.618
And you'll get lots of
chances to wrap your mind

00:03:20.618 --> 00:03:23.198
about this and engage with the idea.

00:03:23.198 --> 00:03:25.128
But here I just want to get
your minds churning on this

00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:28.558
pretty neat way of viewing
what functions are doing.
