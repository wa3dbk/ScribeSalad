00:00:00.161 --> 00:00:01.229
- [Voiceover] So here I want to talk about

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.119
the gradient and the
context of a contour map.

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:06.409
So let's say we have a
multivariable function.

00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:09.169
A two-variable function f of x,y.

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.111
And this one is just
gonna equal x times y.

00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:15.551
So we can visualize
this with a contour map

00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:17.036
just on the xy plane.

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:17.895
So what I'm gonna do

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:19.149
is I'm gonna go over here.

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:21.798
I'm gonna draw a y axis

00:00:22.868 --> 00:00:24.455
and my x axis.

00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:27.084
All right, so

00:00:27.084 --> 00:00:28.981
this right here represents x values.

00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:30.376
And this represents y values.

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:32.064
And this is entirely the input space.

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.760
And I have a video on contour maps

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.451
if you are unfamiliar with them

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:36.784
or are feeling uncomfortable.

00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:39.264
And the contour map for x times y

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:40.643
looks something like this.

00:00:40.643 --> 00:00:43.695
And each one of these lines
represents a constant value.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:46.434
So you might be thinking that you have,

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:47.735
you know, let's say you want a

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:52.157
the constant value for f of
x times y is equal to two.

00:00:52.157 --> 00:00:53.689
Would be one of these lines.

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:55.907
That would be what one of
these lines represents.

00:00:55.907 --> 00:00:57.296
And a way you could think about that

00:00:57.296 --> 00:00:58.518
for this specific function

00:00:58.518 --> 00:01:01.548
is you saying hey, when
is x times y equal to two?

00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:03.071
And that's kind of like the graph

00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:05.236
y equals two over x.

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:09.599
And that's where you would
see something like this.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:10.546
So all of these lines,

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:13.122
they're representing constant
values for the function.

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:15.440
And now I want to take a
look at the gradient field.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.850
And the gradient, if you'll remember,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.576
is just a vector full of the
partial derivatives of f.

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:23.589
And let's just actually write it out.

00:01:23.589 --> 00:01:27.046
The gradient of f, with
our little del symbol,

00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:28.553
is a function of x and y.

00:01:29.653 --> 00:01:31.938
And it's a vector-valued function

00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:33.929
whose first coordinate is

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.254
the partial derivative
of f with respect to x.

00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:37.969
And the second component

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.125
is the partial derivative
with respect to y.

00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:46.665
So when we actually do
this for our function,

00:01:46.665 --> 00:01:49.017
we take the partial
derivative with respect to x.

00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:49.846
It takes a look.

00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:50.870
X looks like a variable.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.065
Y looks like a constant.

00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:53.546
The derivative of this whole thing

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:57.992
is just equal to that constant, y.

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.468
And then kind of the reverse for when you

00:01:59.468 --> 00:02:01.409
take the partial derivative
with respect to y.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.768
Y looks like a variable.

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:03.989
X looks like a constant.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.039
And the derivative is
just that constant, x.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.131
And this can be visualized
as a vector field

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.316
in the xy plane as well.

00:02:12.316 --> 00:02:14.394
You know, at every given point, xy,

00:02:14.394 --> 00:02:15.377
so you kind of go like

00:02:15.377 --> 00:02:19.597
x equals two, y equals one, let's say.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:21.710
So that would be x
equals two, y equals one.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.344
You would plug in the vector

00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:24.721
and see what should be output.

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:28.422
And at this point, the point is two, one.

00:02:28.422 --> 00:02:30.423
The desired output kind of swaps those.

00:02:30.423 --> 00:02:33.942
So we're looking somehow to
draw the vector one, two.

00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:36.617
So you would expect to
see the vector that has

00:02:36.617 --> 00:02:39.928
an x component of one
and a y component of two.

00:02:39.928 --> 00:02:41.151
Something like that.

00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:42.769
But it's probably gonna be scaled down

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.724
because of the way we
usually draw vector fields.

00:02:44.724 --> 00:02:47.978
And the entire field looks like this.

00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:51.139
So I'll go ahead and
erase what I had going on.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.217
Since this is a little bit clearer.

00:02:53.217 --> 00:02:55.181
And remember, we scaled
down all the vectors.

00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:56.309
The color represents length.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.577
So red here is super-long.

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.802
Blue is gonna be kind of short.

00:02:59.802 --> 00:03:01.619
And one thing worth noticing.

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.690
If you take a look at all
of the given points around,

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.350
if the vector is crossing a contour line,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.358
it's perpendicular to that contour line.

00:03:09.358 --> 00:03:10.129
Wherever you go.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.942
You know, you go down here,

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:12.737
this vector's perpendicular
to the contour line.

00:03:12.737 --> 00:03:15.115
Over here, perpendicular
to the contour line.

00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:16.782
And this happens everywhere.

00:03:16.782 --> 00:03:18.662
And it's for a very good reason.

00:03:18.662 --> 00:03:20.300
And it's also super-useful.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.094
So let's just think about
what that reason should be.

00:03:23.094 --> 00:03:25.163
Let's zoom in on a point.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.576
So I'm gonna clear up our function here.

00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:29.350
Clear up all of the information about it.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.434
And just zoom in on one of those points.

00:03:34.724 --> 00:03:38.166
So let's say like right here.

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:39.979
We'll take that guy

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.896
and kind of imagine

00:03:41.896 --> 00:03:44.845
zooming in and saying what's
going on in that region?

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:47.069
So you've got some kind of contour line.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.899
And it's swooping down like this.

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:50.596
And that represents some kind of value.

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:53.071
Let's say that represents
the value f equals two.

00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:56.272
And, you know, it might not
be a perfect straight line.

00:03:56.272 --> 00:03:57.327
But the more you zoom in,

00:03:57.327 --> 00:03:58.687
the more it looks like a straight line.

00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:01.049
And when you want to
interpret the gradient vector.

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.532
If you remember, in the
video about how to interpret

00:04:03.532 --> 00:04:05.303
the gradient in the context of a graph,

00:04:05.303 --> 00:04:08.016
I said it points in the
direction of steepest descent.

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:10.541
So if you imagine all the possible vectors

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:12.777
kind of pointing away from this point,

00:04:12.777 --> 00:04:15.352
the question is, which
direction should you move

00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:18.293
to increase the value of f the fastest?

00:04:18.293 --> 00:04:19.952
And there's two ways
of thinking about that.

00:04:19.952 --> 00:04:22.378
One is to look at all of
these different directions

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:24.532
and say which one increases x the most?

00:04:24.532 --> 00:04:26.063
But another way of doing it

00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:27.683
would be to get rid of them all

00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:29.637
and just take a look
at another contour line

00:04:29.637 --> 00:04:31.234
that represents a slight increase.

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:32.101
All right, so let's say

00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:34.548
you're taking a look at a contour line,

00:04:34.548 --> 00:04:35.879
another contour line.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:36.786
Something like this.

00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:39.549
And maybe that represents
something that's right next to it.

00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:40.783
Like 2.1.

00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:43.876
That represents, you know,
another value that's very close.

00:04:43.876 --> 00:04:45.379
And if I were a better artist,

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.369
and this was more representative,

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:48.544
it would look like a line

00:04:48.544 --> 00:04:50.091
that's parallel to the original one.

00:04:50.091 --> 00:04:52.084
Because if you change the output

00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:52.993
by just a little bit,

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:55.935
the set of in points that look like it

00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:58.853
is pretty much the same but
just shifted over a bit.

00:04:58.853 --> 00:05:00.891
So another way we can think
about the gradient here

00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:03.795
is to say of all of the vectors that move

00:05:03.795 --> 00:05:05.915
from this output of two

00:05:05.915 --> 00:05:07.925
up to the value of 2.1.

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:09.053
You know, you're looking at

00:05:09.053 --> 00:05:10.839
all of the possible different
vectors that do that.

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:13.914
You know, which one does it the fastest?

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:15.728
And this time, instead of
thinking of the fastest

00:05:15.728 --> 00:05:17.266
as constant-length vectors,

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:18.572
what increases it the most,

00:05:18.572 --> 00:05:21.479
we'll be thinking, constant
increase in the output.

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.255
Which one does it with
the shortest distance?

00:05:24.255 --> 00:05:26.906
And if you think of them as
being roughly parallel lines,

00:05:26.906 --> 00:05:28.446
it shouldn't be hard to convince yourself

00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:30.490
that the shortest distance isn't gonna be,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.927
you know, any of those.

00:05:31.927 --> 00:05:35.570
It's gonna be the one that connects them

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.029
pretty much perpendicular
to the original line.

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.390
Because if you think about these as lines,

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.363
And the more you zoom in,

00:05:40.363 --> 00:05:42.772
the more they pretty much
look like parallel lines,

00:05:42.772 --> 00:05:44.925
the path that connects one to the other

00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:47.392
is gonna be perpendicular to both of them.

00:05:47.392 --> 00:05:49.681
So because of this
interpretation of the gradient

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:51.236
as the direction of steepest descent,

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:52.567
it's a natural consequence

00:05:52.567 --> 00:05:54.258
that every time it's on a contour line,

00:05:54.258 --> 00:05:55.475
wherever you're looking

00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:57.671
it's actually perpendicular to that line.

00:05:57.671 --> 00:05:58.675
Because you can think about it

00:05:58.675 --> 00:06:01.348
as getting to the next contour
line as fast as it can.

00:06:01.348 --> 00:06:03.704
Increasing the function as fast as it can.

00:06:03.704 --> 00:06:06.576
And this is actually a
very useful intepretation

00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:08.184
of the gradient in different contexts.

00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:10.438
So it's a good one to keep
in the back of your mind.

00:06:10.438 --> 00:06:13.560
Gradient is always
perpendicular to contour lines.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.566
Great.

00:06:14.566 --> 00:06:15.936
See you next video.
