00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.560
I touched on this a little bit
in the video on how variation

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.970
can be introduced into a
population, but I think it's

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.750
fairly common knowledge that all
of us-- when I talk about

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.360
us I'm talking about human
beings, and frankly, most

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.150
eukaryotic organisms-- we're
the product of sexual

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.360
reproduction.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.440
So if this is the first cell
that had the potential to

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.260
become Sal, we know that this
first cell-- let me say this

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.190
is the nucleus of that first
cell so I can draw the whole

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.350
cell and all that, but let's
just focus on the nucleus.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.820
It has 23 chromosomes.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.040
Well, let me put it this way.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.290
It has 46 chromosomes, 23 from
my father and 23 from my

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.010
mother, so that's 1, 2 3, 4, 3
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.040
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23 from my father.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.000
And then let's say that last
one actually helps to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.460
determine my gender, or it fully
determines my gender.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.090
That's my Y chromosome.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.080
And let's say I had 23
homologous chromosomes, or one

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.120
chromosome that kind of was
the homologue for each of

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.730
these, but I have 23 of them
from my mother, so 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.820
5-- oh, you get the idea.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.900
I can just draw a bunch of
them, and then have the X

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.480
chromosome that is essentially
one of the gender-determining

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.450
chromosomes from my mother.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.550
And we learned before that
each of these pairs are

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.820
homologous chromosomes, that
they essentially code for the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.260
same gene, one from my father
and one from my mother.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.980
Now, that first cell that had
the potential to become me, it

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.030
was a product of fertilization,
of an egg from

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.070
my mother-- so an egg
from my mother.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.240
I'll just draw the whole
egg like that.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.290
I'll just focus on the DNA from
now, so my mother's DNA,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.820
it had 23 chromosomes.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.650
So it didn't have pairs,
and this is key.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.040
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.910
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, and then 23 was the X

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.320
chromosome.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.800
And so it's a combination from
my mother, so this is from my

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.830
mother, and a sperm
from my father.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.920
Let me do that here.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.320
And I'll draw the sperm much
larger than it is normally

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.830
relatively to the egg.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.840
This is kind of the nucleus of
the egg, but let's say that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.030
this is the sperm, and it has a
tail that helps it swim, and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.670
it has 23 chromosomes.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.670
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.375
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and then
it has that Y chromosome.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:43.750
Let me do that Y chromosome
in a separate color.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.010
Just as an aside, this
unification, this

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.230
fertilization that occurred from
this sperm cell to this

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.120
egg cell, so it essentially
penetrates into this egg cell

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.700
and it creates this zygote,
which is a fertilized egg cell

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.240
from my mother, and this
contains all DNA from both my

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.070
father and my mother.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.940
So this very first cell that
was created from this

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.700
fertilized egg, this
is called a zygote.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.690
It's a product of

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.630
fertilization between two gametes.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.540
So that's a gamete and
this is a gamete.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.820
Both a sperm cell or an
egg cell, they're

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.450
both examples of gametes.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.340
Now, the whole reason why I'm
doing this is I want to

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.150
introduce you-- and I already
introduced this notion to you

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.700
when we talked about the
variation of population, that,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.370
look, this has my full
chromosome complement.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.990
It has 23 pairs, and each pair
is a pair of homologous

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.550
chromosomes.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.040
They essentially code for the
same things, one from my

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.310
mother, one from my father,
and that is 46 individual

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.810
chromosomes, 23 from my mother,
23 from my father.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:11.370
These gametes, they each have
only 23 chromosomes, or half

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.760
the number of a full
complement.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.709
Now, everything that I'm talking
about here, the number

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.310
46, or 23 pairs, or 23
individual chromosomes, this

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.220
is unique to human beings.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.980
If I talked about other species,
they might have 10

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.270
chromosomes or they might
have 5 chromosomes.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.270
But one thing that is universal
for all sexually

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.340
reproducing organisms is that
gametes have half the number

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.860
of chromosomes as the zygote, or
you can kind of view it as

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.690
the organism itself, the way we

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.270
conventionally think about it.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.740
So when people talk about half
the number of chromosomees,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.095
they say it has a
haploid number.

00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:49.850
And that literally just means
half the number of

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.420
chromosomes.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.700
It's very easy to memorize,
because haploid starts with

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.420
the same two letters as half.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.010
Haploid number for humans
is 23 chromosomes.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.640
And so, you say, oh, if you say
this is a haploid number,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.970
what do you call it when you
have the full complement of

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.840
chromosomes?

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.290
Well, that's called the
diploid number.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.270
And I remember that because
di- often is a prefix

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.230
associated with having two of
something, and so you have

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.480
twice the number
of chromosomes.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.820
So this is haploid, this is
diploid number, and this is

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.310
for humans, right?

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.360
For an organism where the
diploid number is N, and

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.840
you'll sometimes see this
notation, so I want to make

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.890
sure you're comfortable with it,
there's some organism, or

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.800
actually any organism.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.190
If the diploid number is 2N,
then the haploid number is

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.870
going to be half of
that, or just N.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.740
Now, in the case of humans, the
diploid number is 46, so N

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.410
is equal to 23.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.080
So a fertilized egg or even just
a regular somatic cell or

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.890
a body cell will have a diploid
number of chromosome,

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.400
while a sex cell, and I'll be
a little bit clearer about

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.540
that in a second, will have a
haploid number of chromosomes.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.600
So gametes, which are either a
sperm or an egg, those are

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.000
both examples of gametes, they
have half the number, they

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.610
merge, and then you get a
zygote, which is that very

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.740
first cell that had the
potential to turn into me,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.800
that has a diploid number
of chromosomes.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.830
And I actually want to do a
little bit of a side here,

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.450
because it's fascinating.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.590
We talk about natural selection,
and we even wonder

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.060
today to what degree is it
occurring, because our

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.860
society, it's not as tough of an
environment as the natural

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.100
world would be where we're being
stalked by predators and

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.160
we have to live out in
the wild and find

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.330
food and all of that.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.360
But even this process of
fertilization is an incredibly

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.780
competitive process, because
this sperm that happened to be

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.090
the one that kind of won the
race from my father to

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.480
fertilize my mother's egg, it
was actually the first of

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.540
roughly 200 million other
sperms. There were 200

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.740
million, roughly.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.650
There could've been 200
to 300 million other

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.390
sperms in that race.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.800
From the moment we're born,
we're already the product of

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.730
an intense competition amongst
these male-- I guess we could

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.550
call them male gametes, or
amongst these sperm cells.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.480
Some of them might have had
weird mutations, that they

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.630
didn't know which direction to
swim, they happened to go in

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.380
the wrong direction, maybe some
of them had weird tails

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.080
that didn't allow them to swim
as fast, so you're already on

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.950
some level selecting for
fitness within this

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.540
environment.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.600
So if you had some weird
mutations from the get go in

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.680
some of these sperm cells, it
would have been less likely,

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.310
especially if they affected
their ability to kind of swim,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.080
it would've been less likely
that they would have been the

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.610
ones to win this race.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.720
So already, you are the product
of a race of 280

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.600
million organisms, if you
consider each of these sperm

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.180
cells an organism, and you are
the product of that winning

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:04.940
combination.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.460
So, you know, sometimes we
feel lost on this planet.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.610
We're one of 6 billion people
and all that, or just a

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:17.080
number, but we already are the
product of a pretty intense

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.260
accomplishment.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.560
But now with some of this
vocabulary thrown out of the

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.450
way, let's talk a little bit
about zygotes and how do

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.870
zygotes turn into people, and
then how do those people

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.020
essentially produce gametes,
which then can fertilize other

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.929
people's gametes to
form more zygotes.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:41.440
So the general idea: So that
very first cell that was

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.410
essentially my mom's egg
fertilized by a sperm cell

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.500
from my father, that was a
zygote, and as soon as it's

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.400
successfully fertilized, it has
2N, or it has the diploid

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.430
number of chromosomes in the
case of humans, which I

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.000
believe I am one of them.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.030
I have 46 chromosomes.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.920
And then this cell right here
begins to split and divide

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.300
over and over and over again.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.610
We'll do a whole series of
videos on the actual mechanics

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:16.260
of that, but it splits by a
mechanism called mitosis.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.730
And mitosis literally is just
a cell splitting to form

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.370
copies of itself.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.710
So it just starts splitting into
two more cells that are--

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.910
and actually, let me do it this
way, just because the

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.450
actual way it works is right
when a cell is split, the

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.650
cells that it splits into aren't
that much larger than

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.670
the original one.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.375
But now each of these have 2N
chromosomes, or 46 in the case

00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:42.850
of humans, and you keep
splitting, and it happens over

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.020
and over and over again.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.810
So eventually-- well, let
me just do it this way.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:53.150
This keeps splitting, and then
you have-- and I'll go into

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.430
the words for some of these
initial collections of cell,

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.440
but I won't go into
that right now.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.350
2N, all of these are original
copies from a genetic point of

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.220
view of that original cell.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.860
And then eventually, they start
to really-- I start to

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.270
have tons of them.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:15.670
There's just a gazillion of them
that are all duplicates

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.240
of the cell, and they all
contain the 2N number of

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.900
chromosomes, the diploid
number of chromosomes.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.900
They all contain all of my
genetic material, but based on

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.320
how they relate to each other
and what they see around them,

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.200
they start differentiating.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.110
So all of these have 2N number,

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.900
so they're all diploid.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.830
And mitosis-- this is the
process the whole time-- is

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.200
these divide one cell into two
cells and those two cells into

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.610
four cells and keep going.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.610
And then these begin
to differentiate.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.840
Maybe these cells eventually
differentiate into things

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.660
that'll turn to my brain.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.430
These cells right here
differentiate into things

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.440
that'll turn into my heart.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.410
These cells here differentiate
into things that will turn

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.570
into my lungs and so
forth and so on.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.540
And eventually, you
get a human being.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.690
But it doesn't have to
be a human being.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.450
It could be whatever species we
happen to be talking about.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.630
So let me draw the
human being.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.820
So I'll draw my best shot at an
outline of a human being.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.660
Now, we're talking about
gazillions of cells.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.670
You have your human being, and
I'll just draw a very simple

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.170
diagram, outline of
a human being.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.120
When I was in high school, I was
a class artist, so I don't

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.020
want to make this representative
of my true

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.220
artistic ability.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:43.210
I'm doing this here just to
kind of give you an idea.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.595
But anyway, eventually, you keep
dividing these cells and

00:11:46.595 --> 00:11:48.040
you end up with a human being,
and this human being, you

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.570
know, you wouldn't even notice
the cells on this scale.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.380
Now, most of these cells of this
human being, if this is

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.430
me or you, these are all the
product of mitosis that

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.170
started off with that zygote,
and it just kept dividing and

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.020
dividing and dividing
into mitosis.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.450
But it differentiated.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.470
I said some of them will
turn into brain cells.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.750
Some of them will turn
into heart cells.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.650
The whole process of
differentiation is actually

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.710
fascinating, and we'll talk a
lot more about that when we

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.230
talk about stem cells, embryonic
stem cells, and

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.960
maybe we'll even talk about
the debate of it.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.170
But the question is,
well, how do I then

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.460
produce those gametes?

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.240
How do I produce those things
that eventually, if I'm going

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.710
to reproduce, turn into
these kind of

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.350
haploid number of cells?

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.690
And that's what happens
in your sexual organs.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.310
So in a male, you have some germ
cells, so some of these

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.980
cells turn into germ cells.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.640
And the germ cells exist
as part of your

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.210
reproductive organs.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.990
So let's say those are
the germ cells.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.450
In a male, they would be
part of the gonads, so

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.040
they would be there.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.840
In a female, they would be
involved in the ovaries.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.270
And these germ cells, they're
the product of mitosis.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.720
So let me draw a germ cell.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:16.690
So a germ cell is the product of
mitosis, so it still has 2N

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:22.980
number of chromosomes, so it
still is a diploid cell or has

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.990
a diploid number.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.960
But what's special about a
germ cell is it has the

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:32.300
potential, one, it can either
continue to do mitosis and

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.690
produce more germ cells that
are identical to it, so it

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.880
could produce two germ cells
that are identical to it, or

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.400
it can undergo meiosis.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.330
And meiosis is essentially what
a germ cell undergoes to

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.940
produce gametes.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.840
And so if this germ cell
undergoes meiosis, and I'll do

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.470
a whole video on the mechanics
of it, instead of two cells,

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:05.810
it'll actually produce four
cells that each have half the

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:12.460
number of chromosomes in them,
so these cells are haploid.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.930
In the case of a male, these
would be sperm cells.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.690
This would be sperm.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:24.560
In the case of a female, these
would be ova, sperm or ova,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.030
and these are the gametes.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.160
So it's an interesting thing to
talk about, because in the

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.090
last several videos, I talked a
lot about mutations and what

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.250
does that do to a species, but
think about what happens.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.010
If I have a mutation in some
cell here, some somatic cell,

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:45.290
some body cell, somatic cell,
will that mutation or can that

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.490
mutation in any way affect
what's going to

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.750
happen to my kids?

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.160
Will that mutation be carried
on to my kids?

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.000
Well, no.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.760
Because in no way will what goes
on in this cell affect

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.660
what I actually pass on
eventually in the sperm cells.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.850
It'll just be a random
mutation.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.570
It could affect my ability
to reproduce.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:09.760
For example, it could be-- God
forbid, it could be some type

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.990
of cancer or something that,
especially if you contract it

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.080
at a young age, it might be some
type of terminal form so

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.960
that might affect your ability
to reproduce, but it will not

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.120
affect the actual DNA that you
pass on to your offspring.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.720
So if you have some really bad
mutation here, it could affect

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.310
how you live or it could turn
cancerous and start

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.040
reproducing, but it will not
affect what you pass on to

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.280
your children.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.640
The traits that will be passed
on or the changes that will be

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.200
passed on are those that occur
in the germ cells.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.000
So if you have mutations in your
germ cells, or during the

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.270
process of meiosis, you have
essentially recombination of

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.130
DNA because of crossovers, and
we saw that in the variation

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.510
video, then that will introduce
new forms or new

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.350
variants inside that could be
passed on to your children.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.970
And I really want to make that
point there, because we talk

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.520
about mutations, but there's
different types of mutations.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.580
There's some mutations that
won't be passed on to your

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.030
children, and those are the
ones that occur in your

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.120
somatic cells.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.170
Maybe some of them do nothing
so then it really doesn't

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.180
affect your overall function,
but in the mutations that

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:24.350
either occur in your germ cells
or the recombination or

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.830
the variation that is introduced
during meiosis,

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.880
that will be passed on
to your children.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.290
But even there I want
to be careful.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.700
Because remember, this is
a severe competition.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.270
So out of all of the-- let's say
there's 280 million sperm

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:42.520
cells that at one time are being
competitive for an egg,

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.710
it's possible that some of
them have mutations.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.360
In order for one of those
mutations-- let me do the

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.140
mutations in different colors.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.120
That's a purple mutation.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.340
That's a blue mutation.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.400
But in order for that mutation
to truly be passed on to my

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.530
offspring, the sperm containing
the mutation is the

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.430
one that has to win the race.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.540
So already you have a selection
going on at kind of

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.240
this sexual reproduction level
where you're selecting for

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.810
things that are at least good
enough-- I mean, to some

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.910
degree, the sperm has to be
good enough to win this is

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.930
incredibly, incredibly
competitive race.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.810
So that mutation that somehow
made the sperm deformed or

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.200
didn't allow it to swim or made
it behave in some weird

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.670
way, it's very unlikely that
that mutation would go on to

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.820
be the one or that cell would go
on to be the one that would

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.120
successfully fertilize an egg.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.820
So anyway, I wanted to introduce
you to these ideas.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.580
The main idea is really
some of the

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.090
vocabulary: haploid, diploid.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.105
It's very confusing when you
first learn it, but it

00:17:42.105 --> 00:17:48.950
literally just means half the
normal group of chromosomes.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.050
And in the case of humans,
that would be 23.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.360
And the cells that have a
haploid number of chromosomes

00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.130
are our gametes, which are sperm
cells for men, and ova,

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.840
or egg cells for women.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.490
But everything else in our
body, all of our somatic

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.510
cells, are diploid, which means
that the full complement

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.300
of chromosomes, they all
have a copy of our DNA.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.460
And that's why DNA testing is so
interesting because you can

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.850
get any cell from someone
anywhere, and you have their

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.410
full complement of DNA.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.120
You have all of the information
that describes

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.860
them genetically.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.530
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
