00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.080
Jason bicycled from home to
the train station at an

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.120
average speed of 10
miles per hour.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.910
Then he boarded a train and
traveled into the city at an

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.100
average speed of 50
miles per hour.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.360
The entire distance
was 30 miles; the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.440
entire trip took 1 hour.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.360
How many miles did Jason
travel by train?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.980
So let's write that down
as a variable.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.620
So let's say distance, and we'll
write a little small t

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.060
right here, a little
subscript t.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.840
This is the distance by train,
so train distance.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.720
Right there.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.280
And let's have a d with
a little bit of a

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.250
little b right there.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.570
That is the bike distance.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.990
Now, they give us one piece of
information, that the total

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.920
distance, the entire distance,
was 30 miles.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.200
So that means that the distance
by train plus the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.030
distance by bike is 30 miles.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.140
So I could write that
right here.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.680
The distance by train plus
the distance by bike

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.910
is equal to 30 miles.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.650
That's what that constraint
tells us.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.810
Now the next one, they
tell us that the

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.150
entire trip took 1 hour.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.980
So the time by train plus the
time by bike took 1 hour.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.450
And you might be thinking,
hey, gee, that's going to

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.040
introduce two new variables.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.760
But let's think a little bit
about whether we can express

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.970
the time by train and the
time by bike in terms

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.540
of these two variables.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.560
So just as a bit of review-- I
think this is review-- you're

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.630
probably familiar with distance
is equal to rate

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.960
times time.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.780
Or if you divide both sides of
this equation by rate, you get

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.095
time is equal to distance
divided by rate.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.700
So let's think about
the situation for

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.800
each of these guys.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.340
What is the time by train?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.200
I'll write it like this.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.130
The time by train is going to
be equal to the distance by

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.220
train divided by the rate that
the train was going at.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.200
And they gave us that
information.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.140
They told us that the train
traveled into the city at an

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.200
average speed of 50
miles per hour.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.350
That is the rate of the train.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.259
So the time of the train was
the distance of the train

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.320
divided by 50.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.420
Same exact argument.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.990
The time of the bicycle, the
time traveled on the bicycle,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.950
will be the distance traveled on
the bicycle divided by the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.050
speed of the bicycle.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.340
And they give us the
speed right there,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.510
10 miles per hour.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.530
And everything in this problem
we're assuming is going to be

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.050
in either miles or hours.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.350
There's not any major
unit conversion.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.610
So that's there right there.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.690
So the second statement
is that the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.110
entire trip took 1 hour.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.470
So the time by train plus
the time by bicycle is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.000
going to be 1 hour.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.765
Actually, let me do that
in a different color.

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:46.570
The entire trip took 1 hour.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.210
So this time plus this
time is 1 hour.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.100
And I'm going to write it in
terms of the distances so I

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.210
only have two unknowns.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.780
So the time by train is the
distance by train divided by

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.050
50 plus the time by bicycle
is the distance by bicycle

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.510
divided by 10.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.250
And then that is equal
to 1 hour.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.020
That's what this statement
right here is telling us,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.200
although we had to use that
information and that

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.150
information to divide by the
10 and to divide by the 50.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.810
Now we have two equations
of two unknowns.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.570
And our whole goal, the whole
purpose of this problem, they

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.510
want to know how many miles
did Jason travel by train.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.440
So we want to figure out that
variable, or we want to figure

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.730
out that variable.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.710
Now, the easiest way to do
this is if we can just

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.020
eliminate the distance by
bicycle and then solve for the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.050
distance by train.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.640
Then we're done.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.630
We would have solved
the problem.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.530
Now, the easiest way I can think
of doing that is this

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.990
one is pretty simple already.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.020
Let me just rewrite it
to the right here.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.700
So the distance by train plus
the distance by bicycle is

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.230
equal to 30.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.500
And I want to cancel out the
distance by bicycle.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.330
So if I could make this into
just a negative distance by

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.030
bicycle, then I'm all set.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.960
And if I add the two equations,
they'll cancel out.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.950
So the easiest way to just make
this a negative distance

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.210
by bicycle is multiply both
sides of this equation by

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.100
negative 10.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.360
Because you multiply negative 10
times this, the 10's cancel

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.920
out, this just becomes a
negative distance by bicycle.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.740
So let's write it over here.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.180
Negative 10 times the distance
by train over 50.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.420
10 divided by 50 is 1/5,
so it's negative

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.050
1/5 distance by train.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.620
And then negative 10 times this
expression right here,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.470
the 10's cancel out.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.160
It's just negative distance by
bicycle is equal to-- forgot

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.890
that parentheses-- is equal
to negative 10.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.000
The whole point here was so that
this becomes the negative

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.700
version of that.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.460
So when I add these two
equations, they'll cancel out.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.830
So let's do that.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.410
Let's add these two equations.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.470
So if you add the left-hand
side, these guys cancel out.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.760
You have 1 dt minus 1/5 dt.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.910
1 dt you can view as 5/5 dt.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:06.140
So 5/5 minus 1/5, you have 4/5
distance by train is equal to

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.990
30 plus negative 10,
or is equal to 20.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.270
Now to solve for distance by
train, we can just multiply

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.060
both sides of this expression,
both sides of this equation,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.970
by the inverse of 4/5.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.630
So we'll multiply both
sides by 5/4.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.920
The whole point of that is that
this cancels out, and we

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.530
are left with the distance by
train is equal to 20 times

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.840
5/4, that's the same thing
as 20/1 times 5/4.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.850
20 divided by 4 is 5,
4 divided by 4 is 1.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.850
So it's just 5 times 5.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.210
So the distance traveled
by train is 25 miles.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.830
And we're done.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.620
And we could go back if we
wanted to figure out any of

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.270
the times, or the distance
by bicycle.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.060
Actually, it's very easy.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.280
The distance by train is 25,
distance by bicycle has to be

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.630
5 if they're going to add
up to be 30 miles.
