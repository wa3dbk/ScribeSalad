00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.740
Let's see if we can tackle this

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.720
spectrophotometry example.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.090
I took this from the Kotz,
Treichel and Townsend

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.020
Chemistry &amp; Chemical Reactivity
book and did it

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.150
with their permission.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.320
So let's see what
the problem is.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.900
It says a solution of potassium
permanganate-- let

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.880
me underline that in a darker
color-- potassium permanganate

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:32.189
has an absorbance of 0.539 when
measured at 540 nanometer

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130
in a 1 centimeter cell.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.840
So this 540 nanometers is the
wavelength of light that we're

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.700
measuring the absorbance of.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.870
And so this is probably a
special wavelength of light

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.820
for potassium permanganate, one
that it tends to be good

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.870
at absorbing.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.430
So it'll be pretty sensitive to
how much solute we have in

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.240
the solution.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.500
OK, and the beaker
is 1 centimeter.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.930
So that's just the length
right there.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.790
What is the concentration of
potassium permanganate?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.510
Prior to determining the
absorbance for the unknown

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.350
solution, the following
calibration data were

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.320
collected for the
spectrophotometer.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.780
The absorbances of these
known concentrations

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.240
were already measured.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.400
So what we're going to do is
we're going to plot these.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.600
And then, essentially, this
absorbance is going

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.920
to sit on the line.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.670
We learned from the Beer-Lambert
law, that is a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.630
linear relationship between
absorbance and concentration.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.320
So this absorbance is going to
sit some place on this line.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.390
And we're just going to have
to read off where that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.360
concentration is.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.330
And that will be our unknown
concentration.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.710
So let's plot this first. Let's
plot our concentrations

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.040
first. So this axis, the
horizontal axis, will be our

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.780
concentration axis.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.250
I'll draw the axis in
blue right there.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.000
Let me scroll down a
little bit more.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.550
I just need to make sure I
have all this data here.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.310
So this is concentration
in molarity.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.280
And let's see, it goes from
0.03 all the way to 0.15.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.970
So let's make this 0.03,
then go three more.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.510
This over here is 0.06.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.220
One, two, three, then this
over here is 0.09.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.500
This over here is 0.12.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.870
And then this over
here is 0.15.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.430
And then the absorbances go--
well it's close to 0, or close

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.040
to 0.1-- all the way
up to close to 1.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.060
So let's make this
right here 0.1.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:10.250
Let's make this 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
0.5-- almost done-- 0.6, 0.7,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.020
0.8, and then 0.9.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.500
And that, essentially, covers
all of the values of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.050
absorbency that we have here.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.720
So let's plot the first one.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.865
When we had a concentration of
potassium permanganate at 0.03

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:31.180
molar, our absorbance
was 0.162.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.640
So 0.03, and then
it goes to 0.16.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.690
This is 0.15, so 0.162 is going
to be right over there.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.260
And then when we had 0.06
molarity of potassium

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.830
permanganate our absorbance
was 0.33.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:59.810
So 0.06, 0.33 which is right
about-- this is 0.35, so 0.33

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.570
would be right about there.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.290
And we already see an
interesting line form, but

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.310
I'll plot all of these points.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:14.860
So at 0.09 molarity,
we have 0.499.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.550
So almost 0.5 right
over there.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.870
That's that value.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.430
And then at 0.12, we have
0.67 absorbance.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.120
So at 0.12, we have 0.67.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.830
So this is 0.12.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.690
This would be 0.65,
so we have 0.67

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.510
absorbance right over there.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.150
And actually, what we're doing
here, we're actually showing

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.080
you that the Beer-Lambert
law is true.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.750
At specific concentrations,
we've measured the absorbance

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.700
and you see that it's a
linear relationship.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.480
Anyway, let's do
this last one.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:57.530
At 0.15 molarity, we have
absorbance of 0.84.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.910
So this right here is 0.15.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.660
I want to make sure I don't
lose track of that line.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.550
And 0.84 is right over there.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.640
So you see the linear
relationship?

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.520
Let me draw the line.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.840
I don't have a line tool here,
so I'm just going to try to

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.540
freehand it.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.170
I'll draw a dotted line.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.860
Dotted lines are a little bit
easier to adjust. I'm doing it

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.000
in a slight green color, but
I think you see this linear

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.820
relationship.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.110
This is the Beer-Lambert
law in effect.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.980
Now let's go back
to our problem.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.540
We know that a solution, some
mystery solution, has an

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:37.250
absorbance of 0.539-- let me do
our mystery solution in--

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.940
well, I've pretty much
run out of colors.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.930
I'll do it in pink-- of 0.539.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.200
So our absorbance is 0.5--
this is 0.55, so 0.539 is

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.240
going to be right over there.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.630
And we want to know the
concentration of potassium

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.340
permanganate.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.280
Well, if we just follow the
Beer-Lambert law, it's got to

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.230
sit on that line.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.380
So the concentration is going
to be pretty darn close to

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.460
this line right over here.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.570
And this over here looks
like 0.10 molar.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.490
So this right here is 0, or at
least just estimating it,

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:25.650
looking at this, that looks
like 0.10 molar, or 0.10

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.930
molarity for that solution.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.290
So that's the answer to our
question just eyeballing it

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.060
off of this chart.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.900
Let's try to get a little
bit more exact.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.760
We know the Beer-Lambert
law, and we can even

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.070
figure out the constant.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.990
The Beer-Lambert law tells us
that the absorbance is equal

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:52.920
to some constant, times
the length, times the

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.010
concentration, where the
length is measured in

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.540
centimeters.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.540
So that is measured
in centimeters.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.780
And the concentration is
measured in moles per liter,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.470
or molarity.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:11.730
So we can figure out-- just
based on one of these data

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.450
points because we know that it's
0-- at 0 concentration

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.990
the absorbance is
going to be 0.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.050
So that's our other one.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.710
We can figure out what exactly
this constant is right here.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.200
So we know all of these were
measured at the same length,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.530
or at least that's what
I'm assuming.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.850
They're all in a 1
centimeter cell.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.290
That's how far the light had
to go through the solution.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.040
So in this example, our
absorbance, our length, is

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.470
equal to 1 centimeter.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:46.160
So let's see if we can figure
out this constant right here

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.380
for potassium permanganate at--
I guess this is probably

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.930
standard temperature and
pressure right here-- for this

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.370
frequency of light.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:02.000
Which they told us up here
it was 540 nanometers.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.170
So if we just take this first
data point-- might as well

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:10.740
take the first one, we get--
the absorbance was 0.162.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.240
That's going to be equal
to this constant of

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.930
proportionality times
1 centimeter.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.310
That's how wide the vial was.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.710
Times-- now what is
the concentration?

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.070
Well when the absorbance was
0.162, our concentration was

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:33.365
0.03 times 0.-- actually, I'll
write all the significant

00:08:33.365 --> 00:08:39.159
digits there-- 0.0300.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.370
So if we want to solve for
this epsilon, we can just

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:49.330
divide both sides of this
equation by 0.0300.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:54.630
So you divide both sides by
0.0300 and what do we get?

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.840
These cancel out, this
is just a 1.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.270
And so you get epsilon is equal
to-- let's figure out

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.460
what this number in
blue is here.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.730
And I'll take out
my calculator.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:16.390
And I have 0.162 divided by
0.03 is equal to 5.4.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.150
And actually more significant
is, we could really say it's

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.430
5.40 since we have at least
three significant digits in

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.460
both situations.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.990
So 5.40 is our proportionality
constant.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:39.030
And you would actually divide
by 1 in both cases.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.040
We just want the number here.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.270
But if you wanted the units,
you'd want to divide by that 1

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.800
centimeters as well.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.460
Now we can use this to figure
out the exact answer to our

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.810
problem without having to
eyeball it like we just did.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.710
We know that for potassium
permanganate at 540

00:09:53.710 --> 00:10:02.180
nanometers, the absorbance is
going to be equal to 5.4

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.710
times-- and I'll put
the units here.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.080
The units of this
proportionality constant right

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.900
here is liters per
centimeter mole.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.080
And you'll see it'll just cancel
out with the distance

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.330
which is in centimeters, or the
length, and the molarity

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.480
which is in moles per liter.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.000
And it just gives us a dimension
list, absorbance.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.060
So times-- in our example the
length is 1 centimeter-- times

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:37.020
1 centimeter, times
the concentration.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:50.430
Now in our example they told us
the absorbance was 0.539.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:56.890
That's going to be equal to
5.4 liters per centimeter

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:06.750
mole, times 1 centimeter,
times our concentration.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.310
Well this centimeter cancels out
with that centimeter right

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.540
over there.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.670
And then we can just divide
both sides by

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.760
5.4 liters per mole.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.290
So let's do that.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:29.640
Let's divide both sides by
5.4 liters per mole,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.665
and what do we have?

00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:33.090
So on the right-hand side, all
of this business is going to

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:33.580
cancel out.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.550
We're just going to have this
concentration left over.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.060
So our concentration is equal
to-- let's figure out what

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.690
this number is.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:53.030
So we have 0.539 divided by
5.4 gives us-- so we only

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.760
have-- well this is
actually 5.40.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.740
So we actually have three
significant digits.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:08.530
So we could say 0.0998.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:14.060
So this is 0.0998.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.130
And then if you're dividing by
liters per mole, that's the

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.635
same thing as moles per liter.

00:12:19.635 --> 00:12:22.410
So we're able to get a much more
exact answer by actually

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.590
just going through the math.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.990
But this is pretty darn close.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.950
This exact answer's pretty
darn close to what we

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:33.260
estimated just by eyeballing
it off the chart.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:38.870
0.1 is only a little bit
more than 0.0998.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.830
Anyway, hopefully you
enjoyed that.
