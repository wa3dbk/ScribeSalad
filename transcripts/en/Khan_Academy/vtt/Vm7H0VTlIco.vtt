00:00:00.773 --> 00:00:05.687
- [Sal] Let's explore the
notion of a polynomial.

00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:07.677
This seems like a very complicated word,

00:00:07.677 --> 00:00:09.464
but if you break it down
it'll start to make sense,

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:13.285
especially when we start to
see examples of polynomials.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:15.440
The first part of this word,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.791
lemme underline it, we have poly.

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:20.621
This comes from Greek, for many.

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.913
You see poly a lot in
the English language,

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.432
referring to the notion
of many of something.

00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:29.282
In this case, it's many nomials.

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:33.631
Nomial comes from Latin, from
the Latin nomen, for name.

00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.271
You could view this as many names.

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:37.897
But in a mathematical context,

00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:40.298
it's really referring to many terms.

00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:41.882
We're gonna talk, in a little bit,

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:44.240
about what a term really is.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.207
But to get a tangible sense
of what are polynomials

00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:50.378
and what are not polynomials,
lemme give you some examples.

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:51.959
And then we could write some, maybe,

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:54.313
more formal rules for them.

00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:57.771
So, an example of a polynomial could be

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:01.771
10x to the seventh power
minus nine x squared

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.529
plus 15x to the third plus nine.

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:09.492
This is a polynomial.

00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:11.686
Another example of a polynomial.

00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:13.853
Nine a squared minus five.

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.549
Even if I just have one number,

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.843
even if I were to just
write the number six,

00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:24.973
that can officially be
considered a polynomial.

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:29.140
If I were to write seven
x squared minus three.

00:01:30.183 --> 00:01:31.118
Lemme do it another variable.

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:34.285
Seven y squared minus three y plus pi,

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:38.810
that, too, would be a polynomial.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.356
These are examples of polynomials.

00:01:40.356 --> 00:01:43.890
What are examples of things
that are not polynomials?

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.078
Well, if I were to
replace the seventh power

00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:50.151
right over here with a
negative seven power.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:53.964
If I were to write 10x to
the negative seven power

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:58.131
minus nine x squared plus 15x
to the third power plus nine,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.418
this would not be a polynomial.

00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:04.249
So I think you might
be sensing a rule here

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.133
for what makes something a polynomial.

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:09.201
You have to have nonnegative powers

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:12.250
of your variable in each of the terms.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.524
I just used that word,
terms, so lemme explain it,

00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:17.246
'cause it'll help me explain
what a polynomial is.

00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:22.079
A polynomial is something that
is made up of a sum of terms.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.332
And so, for example, in
this first polynomial,

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:27.931
the first term is 10x to the seventh;

00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:31.344
the second term is
negative nine x squared;

00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:33.781
the next term is 15x to the third;

00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.880
and then the last term,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.561
maybe you could say the
fourth term, is nine.

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:38.691
You can see something.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.918
Let me underline these.

00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:42.623
These are all terms.

00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:46.811
This is a four-term
polynomial right over here.

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:48.637
You could say: "Hey, wait,
this thing you wrote in red,

00:02:48.637 --> 00:02:50.304
"this also has four terms."

00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:52.130
We have to put a few more rules for it

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.350
to officially be a polynomial,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.873
especially a polynomial in one variable.

00:02:55.873 --> 00:02:57.296
Each of those terms are going

00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:00.102
to be made up of a coefficient.

00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:01.973
This is the thing that multiplies

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.492
the variable to some power.

00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:07.641
So in this first term
the coefficient is 10.

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:10.606
Lemme write this word down, coefficient.

00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:13.000
It's another fancy word,
but it's just a thing

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.706
that's multiplied, in this case,

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:17.518
times the variable, which
is x to seventh power.

00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:19.488
The first coefficient is 10.

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:20.708
The next coefficient.

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:22.543
Actually, lemme be careful here,

00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:26.710
because the second coefficient
here is negative nine.

00:03:27.653 --> 00:03:30.236
We are looking at coefficients.

00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.873
The third coefficient here is 15.

00:03:33.873 --> 00:03:37.207
You can view this fourth
term, or this fourth number,

00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:40.903
as the coefficient because
this could be rewritten as,

00:03:40.903 --> 00:03:42.004
instead of just writing as nine,

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:45.885
you could write it as
nine x to the zero power.

00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:48.404
And then it looks a little bit
clearer, like a coefficient.

00:03:48.404 --> 00:03:51.901
So, in general, a polynomial is the sum

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:55.484
of a finite number of
terms where each term

00:03:56.581 --> 00:03:59.226
has a coefficient, which I could represent

00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:03.297
with the letter A, being
multiplied by a variable

00:04:03.297 --> 00:04:06.964
being raised to a
nonnegative integer power.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.654
So, this right over here is a coefficient.

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:15.812
It can be, if we're dealing...

00:04:15.812 --> 00:04:17.360
Well, I don't wanna get too technical.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.730
Positive, negative number.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.855
Could be any real number.

00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:22.239
We have our variable.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:26.406
And then the exponent,
here, has to be nonnegative.

00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:28.931
Nonnegative

00:04:30.516 --> 00:04:31.349
integer.

00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:34.475
So here, the reason
why what I wrote in red

00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:36.595
is not a polynomial is because here I have

00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:39.930
an exponent that is a negative integer.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.355
Let's give some other examples

00:04:41.355 --> 00:04:44.201
of things that are not polynomials.

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:47.701
So, if I were to change the second one to,

00:04:49.041 --> 00:04:50.301
instead of nine a squared,

00:04:50.301 --> 00:04:54.815
if I wrote it as nine a to
the one half power minus five,

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:57.335
this is not a polynomial
because this exponent

00:04:57.335 --> 00:05:00.668
right over here, it is
no longer an integer;

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:02.250
it's one half.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.137
This is the same thing as nine times

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:07.739
the square root of a minus five.

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:10.739
This also would not be a polynomial.

00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:16.052
Or, if I were to write nine
a to the a power minus five,

00:05:18.553 --> 00:05:21.315
also not a polynomial
because here the exponent

00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:25.148
is a variable; it's not
a nonnegative integer.

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:30.059
All of these are examples of polynomials.

00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:33.879
There's a few more pieces of terminology

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.046
that are valuable to know.

00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:41.483
Polynomial is a general term
for one of these expression

00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:44.525
that has multiple terms, a finite number,

00:05:44.525 --> 00:05:46.108
so not an infinite number,

00:05:46.108 --> 00:05:48.751
and each of the terms has this form.

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:50.334
But there's more specific terms for when

00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:54.929
you have only one term or
two terms or three terms.

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:58.659
When you have one term,
it's called a monomial.

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.242
This is a monomial.

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:04.177
This is an example of a monomial,

00:06:04.177 --> 00:06:06.874
which we could write as six x to the zero.

00:06:06.874 --> 00:06:10.776
Another example of a monomial might be

00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:12.609
10z to the 15th power.

00:06:14.754 --> 00:06:16.339
That's also a monomial.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.700
Your coefficient could be pi.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.533
Pi.

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:20.529
Whoops.

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:21.812
Could be pi.

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:25.812
So we could write pi times
b to the fifth power.

00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:30.921
Any of these would be monomials.

00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:32.424
So what's a binomial?

00:06:32.424 --> 00:06:33.849
Binomial's where you have two terms.

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.129
Monomial, mono for one, one term.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.161
Binomial is you have two terms.

00:06:38.161 --> 00:06:41.167
This right over here is a binomial.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.345
Binomial.

00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:44.132
You have two terms.

00:06:44.132 --> 00:06:47.590
All these are polynomials but
these are subclassifications.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.339
It's a binomial; you have one, two terms.

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.506
Another example of a binomial would be

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:57.819
three y to the third plus five y.

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:00.625
Once again, you have two terms

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:03.358
that have this form right over here.

00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:05.889
You'll also hear the term trinomial.

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.408
Trinomial's when you have three terms.

00:07:08.408 --> 00:07:09.241
Trinomial.

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:12.999
This right over here is an example.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.340
This is the first term;

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.006
this is the second term;

00:07:16.006 --> 00:07:18.256
and this is the third term.

00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:22.616
Now, the next word that
you will hear often

00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:26.192
in the context with
polynomials is the notion

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:29.486
of the degree of a polynomial.

00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:30.993
You might hear people say:

00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:33.590
"What is the degree of a polynomial?",

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.396
or "What is the degree of a
given term of a polynomial?"

00:07:37.396 --> 00:07:39.924
Let's start with the
degree of a given term.

00:07:39.924 --> 00:07:41.299
Let's go to this polynomial here.

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:44.024
We have this first term,
10x to the seventh.

00:07:44.024 --> 00:07:47.390
The degree is the power that
we're raising the variable to.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.669
So this is a seventh-degree term.

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:52.393
The second term is a second-degree term.

00:07:52.393 --> 00:07:55.648
The third term is a third-degree term.

00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:57.273
And you could view this constant term,

00:07:57.273 --> 00:07:59.752
which is really just nine,
you could view that as,

00:07:59.752 --> 00:08:01.583
sometimes people say the constant term.

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:05.282
Sometimes people will
say the zero-degree term.

00:08:05.282 --> 00:08:07.010
If people are talking about the degree

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.203
of the entire polynomial,
they're gonna say:

00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:11.842
"What is the degree of the highest term?

00:08:11.842 --> 00:08:14.164
"What is the term with
the highest degree?"

00:08:14.164 --> 00:08:17.418
That degree will be the degree
of the entire polynomial.

00:08:17.418 --> 00:08:19.244
So, this first polynomial,

00:08:19.244 --> 00:08:22.047
this is a seventh-degree polynomial.

00:08:22.047 --> 00:08:25.859
This one right over here is
a second-degree polynomial

00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:27.315
because it has a second-degree term

00:08:27.315 --> 00:08:29.753
and that's the highest-degree term.

00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:32.390
This right over here is a third-degree.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.952
You could even say third-degree binomial

00:08:34.952 --> 00:08:38.287
because its highest-degree
term has degree three.

00:08:38.287 --> 00:08:41.248
If this said five y to the
seventh instead of five y,

00:08:41.248 --> 00:08:44.095
then it would be a
seventh-degree binomial.

00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:47.916
This right over here is
a 15th-degree monomial.

00:08:47.916 --> 00:08:50.749
This is a second-degree trinomial.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:58.548
A few more things I will introduce you to

00:08:58.548 --> 00:09:02.121
is the idea of a leading term
and a leading coefficient.

00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:03.178
Lemme write this down.

00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:06.678
The notion of what it means to be leading.

00:09:10.173 --> 00:09:14.322
It can mean whatever is the
first term or the coefficient.

00:09:14.322 --> 00:09:16.836
If you're saying leading
term, it's the first term.

00:09:16.836 --> 00:09:18.140
If you're saying leading coefficient,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.191
it's the coefficient in the first term.

00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:22.428
But it's oftentimes associated with

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:26.788
a polynomial being
written in standard form.

00:09:26.788 --> 00:09:27.955
Standard form.

00:09:29.933 --> 00:09:31.016
Standard form

00:09:32.942 --> 00:09:35.997
is where you write the
terms in degree order,

00:09:35.997 --> 00:09:39.003
starting with the highest-degree term.

00:09:39.003 --> 00:09:41.362
So, for example, what I have up here,

00:09:41.362 --> 00:09:43.562
this is not in standard form;

00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:45.960
because I do have the
highest-degree term first,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.382
but then I should go to the next highest,

00:09:47.382 --> 00:09:48.884
which is the x to the third.

00:09:48.884 --> 00:09:51.160
But here I wrote x squared
next, so this is not standard.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.195
If I wanted to write it in standard form,

00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:55.717
it would be 10x to the seventh power,

00:09:55.717 --> 00:09:58.887
which is the highest-degree
term, has degree seven.

00:09:58.887 --> 00:10:01.039
Then, 15x to the third.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:04.858
So, plus 15x to the third, which
is the next highest degree.

00:10:04.858 --> 00:10:08.108
Then, negative nine x squared

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.897
is the next highest degree term.

00:10:09.897 --> 00:10:12.342
And then, the lowest-degree
term here is plus nine,

00:10:12.342 --> 00:10:14.456
or plus nine x to zero.

00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:16.367
Now this is in standard form.

00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:19.131
I have written the terms in
order of decreasing degree,

00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:21.045
with the highest degree first.

00:10:21.045 --> 00:10:25.112
Here, it's clear that your leading term

00:10:25.112 --> 00:10:29.265
is 10x to the seventh,
'cause it's the first one,

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:33.432
and our leading coefficient
here is the number 10.

00:10:34.377 --> 00:10:36.170
So, there was a lot in that video,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.205
but hopefully the notion of a polynomial

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:40.966
isn't seeming too
intimidating at this point.

00:10:40.966 --> 00:10:43.446
These are really useful
words to be familiar with

00:10:43.446 --> 00:10:46.779
as you continue on on your math journey.
