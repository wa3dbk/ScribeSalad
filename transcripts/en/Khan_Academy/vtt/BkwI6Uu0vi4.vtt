00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.840
Janelle is training
for a road race.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.090
Her pedometer tracks how
far she runs every day.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.350
Here are the pedometer readings
for the past four

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.190
days: on Saturday, she went
3.89 miles; Sunday, 5.1;

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.190
Monday, 10.21; Tuesday, 3.35.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.750
Estimate the total distance she
ran over the four days,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.640
and then calculate
the exact amount.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.460
Let's estimate first. So I'm
just going to round them to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.380
the nearest mile.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.190
So 3.89, let's round
it up to 4 miles.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.600
And I'm doing that because in
the tenths place, we have an

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.730
8, which is 5 or greater.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.370
So let's just make that
roughly 4 miles.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.770
Let's make this 5.1.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.040
We round that down because
this 1 is less than 5.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.350
So let's make this 5 miles.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.960
10.21, let's make that
10 miles because

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.950
2 would round down.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.480
It's less than 5.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.470
And 3.35, let's make that 3
miles, because 3 is less than

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.740
5, so we'd round down.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.610
So that is 3 miles.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.090
And if we were to add them
up, 4 plus 5 is 9.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.110
9 plus 10 is 19.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.040
19 plus 3 is 22.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:20.040
So my estimate is that she ran
22 miles over the four days.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.080
That's my estimate.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.200
Now let's figure out the exact
amount that she ran.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.670
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.940
So we're going to have to add
3.89 to 5.1-- and remember,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.870
when you're adding decimals,
you want to line up the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:44.390
decimal-- 10.21 and
then finally 3.35.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.900
And let's add all of these up.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.500
Now we'll start in the
hundredths place.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.820
There's nothing here, so 9 plus
nothing plus 1 is 10,

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.340
plus 5 is 15.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.910
So let's write the 5, and then
carry, or regroup, the 1.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.360
Let me do this in
another color.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.030
1 plus 8 is 9.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.090
9 plus 1 is 10.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.190
10 plus 2 is 12.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.240
12 plus 3 is 15.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.750
Put the 5 down.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.045
Carry, or regroup, the 1.

00:02:21.045 --> 00:02:22.810
1 plus 3 is 4.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.140
4 plus 5 is 9.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.790
9 plus 0 is still 9.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.480
9 plus 3 is 12.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.960
Write the 2.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.800
Regroup this 1 right here.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.530
I'll do it out here just so it's
not part of any of these

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.340
numbers, and then
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.770
And then we have to remember
the decimal

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.010
sitting right over there.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.760
So the exact distance she
ran was 22.55 miles.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.160
So our estimate wasn't
too bad.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.630
It was 22 miles.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.760
We got reasonably close, within
about little over a

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.310
half a mile.
