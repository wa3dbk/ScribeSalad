00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.580
I have a matrix A.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.430
It is an n by n matrix.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.620
And let me just write
its rows like this.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.070
Let me just write it as r1.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.210
We could call them row vectors
maybe. r2, I'm not doing it

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.790
too formally.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.510
This is just to save
on writing.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.806
And then it has an ith
row, ri, and then you

00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:21.030
can keep going .

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.940
That's an i right there.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.120
Then it has a jth row, rj, and
you keep going and you get to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.780
the nth throw.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.840
It has n rows and n columns.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.330
So you get to rn
just like that.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.130
That is my matrix.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.450
Just to make sure you get what
I'm saying, so if I have a kth

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.280
r-sub-k is equal to ak1.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.050
Maybe I'll write
it as a vector.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.380
ak2 all the way to akn.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.150
So this is just your standard
representation.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.000
I wrote it this way because
we're just going to be dealing

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.360
with rows in this video and it
makes our notation a little

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.600
bit easier.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.890
Let me focus on these
two rows right here.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.630
And let me define another
matrix B that is

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.920
also an n by n matrix.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.510
And it's identical to matrix
A except for one row.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.720
So it's identical to matrix
A except for one row.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.430
You have r1 just like
that; it's the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.040
same as that one there.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.020
r2, keep going, go down to our
ri, even that one's identical.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.570
But rj I've now replaced.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.300
I'm replacing rj with rj minus
a scalar multiple of ri.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.110
Minus c times ri.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.970
So minus a scalar multiple
of that.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.730
I've replaced rj with that.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.340
So this is equivalent to the
row operations we do we did

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.470
our Gaussian Elimination, or
when we put things in reduced

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.690
row echelon form.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.930
And everything else in this
matrix is the same as A.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.990
It's all the way down to rn.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.610
This is our matrix B.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.900
So let's think about what the
determinant of B is going to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.330
be equal to.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.580
I'll do it in blue.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.330
Well, you could immediately say
that B is equivalent to--

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.216
Well, you can imagine
two vectors.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.150
You can imagine two matrices.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.790
One matrix that look
like this.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.800
One matrix that look like r1,
r2, all the way down ri, all

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.110
the way down to rj.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.140
And then you keep going
down to rn.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.720
That's one matrix, which you
may have already noticed is

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.920
identical to A.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.820
That's one matrix.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.320
Then you could have another
matrix here

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.050
that looks like this.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.700
It's identical everywhere.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.540
r1, r2, ri.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.350
Some dots there to show you I
might have skipped some rows.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.150
Skip some more rows.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.350
And then you have c
times times ri.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.710
c times ri.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.760
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.130
This is ri right here.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.550
And then you just keep
going down to rn.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.490
Now, the determinant of B, you
could view as the determinant

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.120
of this guy.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
Let me write this here.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.360
The determinant of B is equal to
the determinant of this guy

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.200
plus the determinant
of this guy.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.150
Hopefully, you remember a couple
of videos ago, that if

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.400
one matrix-- Let's have two
matrices that are identical in

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.880
every way except for one row.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.850
So these two matrices are
completely identical except

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.380
for what's going on
on the jth row.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.210
Here you have a r-sub-j.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.790
Here you have a c
times r-sub-i.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.990
So it's a scalar multiple
of a row that you had

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.460
up here, this guy.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.610
So this is ri, this
is the ith row.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.350
Here you have an ri, here
you have an ri.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.850
But here you have another
version of r row, scalar

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.610
multiple of ri, while
here you have an rj.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.610
Now, if you have another matrix
that is essentially

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.300
identical to these two
matrices, except

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.710
for this one row.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.130
And in that one row, it looks
like the addition of these two

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.210
matrices-- and let me
put a negative here.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.320
So if you kept this matrix
completely identical, but if

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.690
you were to replace it with
the sum of these two rows.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.750
So rj minus c times ri, you'll
get this matrix right here.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.910
You'll get matrix B.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.360
And we learned that the
determinant of B is equal to

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.620
the determinant of this
guy and that guy.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.850
Remember, B is not the sum
of these two matrices.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.810
B is identical to these two
matrices, except for that one

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.190
row where B's jth row is
equivalent to the jth row of

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.870
this guy, plus the jth
row of that guy.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.220
And when I talk about adding
rows, you're just adding their

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.840
corresponding elements.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:20.430
So I could rewrite this so this
row would look like-- The

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:28.650
first term would be aj1
minus c times ai1.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.250
That would be the first
term in that row.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.010
The second term of that
row would be aj2

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.650
minus c times ai2.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.570
And it would go all the
way to ajn minus

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.820
ca-sub-in, the nth column.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.480
So that's all it
means by that.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.430
So the determinant of B is equal
to the determinant of

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.260
this plus the determinant
of this.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.420
The determinant of this,
this thing right here

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.470
is our matrix A.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.220
This is going to be the
determinant of A.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.540
And what's the determinant
of this?

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.950
Well, let's break this down
a little bit more.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.350
The determine of this
is equal to what?

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.025
This is completely equivalent to
A, except one of its rows--

00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:18.570
Sorry, this is completely
equivalent to this matrix.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.670
Not equivalent to A.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.620
Be very careful.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.810
Don't listen to everything
I say.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.070
It's not equivalent to A.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.340
The difference is that
A has an rj here.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.740
This guy has a minus
c times ri.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.860
So this is equivalent
to this matrix.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.560
It's completely equivalent to
this matrix right here.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.080
Let me do it like this.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:48.510
So you have an r1, r2, keep
going, and you have an ri,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.050
then you have another ri.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.630
Let me clean this
up a little bit.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.030
Let me clear this out
just so I have some

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.280
space to work with.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.330
You have an ri.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.430
You have that ri there.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.740
Then you have another ri.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.200
You have another
ri right there.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.290
You have another ri.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.760
So the jth row has
an ri there.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.900
Then you keep going and
you have an r-sub-n.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.320
These two guys are completely
equivalent except for this guy

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.840
has a minus c times
the jth row.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.490
Right?

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.850
That's what this was,
right here.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:26.820
This is the jth row.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.420
Everything we're doing
is in the jth row.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.520
This has a minus c times
the jth row.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.005
So the determinant of this guy
right here-- Let me just be

00:07:37.005 --> 00:07:38.520
clear that I'm only taking
the determinant of

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.970
this guy right here.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:46.450
It's going to be equal to minus
c times the determinant

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.640
of-- let me write it this
way --minus c times the

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:55.600
determinant of r1, r2.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.170
You have your first ri.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.640
And then in the jth row
you have another

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.190
version of the ri.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.480
And then you go down
to r-sub-n.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.410
So times that determinant.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.910
This is just the determinant
of this.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.920
I've added brackets and
straight lines.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.890
And we saw this a couple
of videos ago.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.255
If you have a matrix, you just
multiply one of its rows by a

00:08:17.255 --> 00:08:18.740
scalar, in this case minus c.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.510
It's equivalent to minus c.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.280
The determinant of the new
matrix is equal to minus c

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.160
times the determinant
of your matrix.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.810
That's all I'm saying
right here.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.760
But what is the determinant
of this matrix?

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.799
You might have already noticed
that it has duplicate rows.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:38.440
It has an ri, and then in the
ith row, then it has another

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.090
ri in the jth row.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:47.010
Remember, we kind of decomposed
this B matrix right

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.630
here as the sum of-- Or its
determinant can be described

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.930
as the determinant of the
sum of these two things.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.400
B isn't the sum of
these two things.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.500
Every other element is identical
to every other

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.410
element in each of these guys.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.100
But this guy right here,
he has duplicate ri's.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.580
And what do we know about the
determinant of a matrix with

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.110
duplicate entries?

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.260
The determinant is zero.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.420
So this entry right
here is zero.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.620
Minus c times 0, 0.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.570
So the determinant of this
whole thing is 0.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.430
So the big take-away right here
is that the determinant

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.930
of B is equal to just the
determinant of this thing,

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.090
which was the determinant
of A.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.590
This is a very big take-away.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.890
It's going to make our
life very easy.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:31.300
The determinant of B is equal
to the determinant of A.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.780
So if you start with some
matrix, and you replace the

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.700
jth row in this example,
but any row.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.060
If you replace any row with
that row minus some scalar

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.020
multiple of another row-- we
picked ri in this case, that

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:50.560
would be ri --the determinant
will not be changed.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.500
You have to be very particular
about how you say it because,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.500
obviously, if you just
multiplied something by a

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.690
scalar-- if you were to change
its determinant, or if you do

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.700
other things.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.390
If you just take a row, if you
take the jth row, and you

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:06.270
replace it with the jth row
minus c times the ith row

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.140
times some other row, which is
equivalent to just a row

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.010
operation that we have been
doing, then it will not change

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.060
your determinant.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.670
Which is a very big take-away
because now we can carefully

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:22.210
do some row operations and know
that the determinant will

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.860
not change.
