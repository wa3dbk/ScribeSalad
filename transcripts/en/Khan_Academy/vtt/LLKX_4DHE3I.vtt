00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.940
In its most popular sense,
when people talk about

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.310
mitosis, they're referring to
a cell, a diploid cell.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.670
So diploid just means it has
its full complement of

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.780
chromosomes, so it has
2N chromosomes.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.950
So that's the nucleus.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.410
This is the whole cell.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.960
And so most people are saying,
look, the cell itself

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.590
replicates into two diploid
cells, so it turns into two

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.710
cells, each that have a full
complement of chromosomes, 2N

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.640
chromosomes.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.400
And so when people say a cell
has experienced mitosis, they

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.580
normally mean this.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.850
But I want to make one slight
clarification, that formally,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.120
mitosis only refers to the
process of the replication of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.350
the genetic material
and the nucleus.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.180
So, for example, if I were to
draw this-- let me draw the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.300
cell-- and it has now two
nucleuses, each with the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.770
diploid number of chromosomes,
this cell

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.040
has experienced mitosis.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.030
It has not experienced
cytokinesis, which we will

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.730
talk about in a few moments, but
that's the process of the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.430
actual cytoplasm of the
cell being split into

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.490
two different cells.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.160
And just as a clarity, the
cytoplasm is all the stuff

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.630
outside of the nucleus.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.590
So I'll talk about that in a
second, but just know in

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.680
everyday usage, this is normally
the case when people

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.670
talk about mitosis.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.860
But if you've got a teacher
that likes to get you on a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.730
technicality, this is
technically what mitosis is.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.030
It's the splitting of the
nucleus or the replication of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.460
the nucleus into two
separate nucleuses.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.820
That's normally accompanied
by cytokinesis where the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.930
cytoplasms of the cells
actually separate.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.250
Now, with that said, let's go
into the mechanics of mitosis.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.150
So the first steps that are
really necessary for mitosis

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.920
actually occur outside of
mitosis when the cell is just

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.883
doing its day-to-day life, and
that's during the interphase.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.449
And the interphase, literally
it's not a phase of mitosis.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.810
It's literally when the
cell is just living.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.730
Let's say we have
some new cell.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.460
Let me do it in green.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.430
That's a new cell here.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.780
Maybe this is its nucleus.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.630
It's got 2N chromosomes,
and then it grows.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.790
It brings in nutrients from
the outside and builds

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.660
proteins and does whatever,
and so it grows a bit.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.610
It's obviously got its full
chromosomal complement still.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.080
And then at some point during
this life cycle, and I'll

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.220
label these actually, so this
phase in interphase, and this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.460
might not even be covered in
some biology classes, but they

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.070
give it a label.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.650
They call it G1, which
is really just

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.380
when the cell is growing.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.840
It's just growing, accumulating
materials and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.990
building itself out, and then
it actually replicates its

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.770
chromosomes.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.760
So you still have a diploid
number of chromosomes.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.390
So let me zoom in.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.160
So let me draw this.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.490
This is called the S phase of
interphase, so this is S.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.190
And S is where you have
replication of the actual

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.430
chromosomes.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.340
Once again, we're not
even in mitosis yet.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.910
So S, you have replication
of your chromosomes.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.770
So if I were to zoom in on the
nucleus during the S phase, if

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.230
I were to start off-- let me
just start with some organism

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.940
that has two chromosomes.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.210
So let's say that at the
beginning of S phase, and I'll

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.060
draw things as chromosomes just
to make it clear that

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.300
things are being replicated.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.010
So let me say it has this
chromosome right here and then

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.400
let's say it has this chromosome
right here.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.180
As it goes through S phase,
these chromosomes replicate.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.430
And I'm just drawing
the nucleus here.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.740
I've zoomed in on just this part
right here, where N is 1,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.050
where our full diploid
complement is two chomosomes.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.010
During S phase, our chromosomes
will replicate and

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.269
will have-- so that green one
will completely replicate and

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.220
generate a copy of itself, and
we've learned this a little

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.380
bit, they're connected
at the centromere.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.360
Now, each of those copies are
called chromatids, and that

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.350
magenta one will do
the same thing.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.260
Even though we have two
chromatids, one for each

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.170
chromosome, now we have four
chromatids, two for each

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.120
chromosome, we still say we
only have two chromosomes.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.000
That's its centromere
right there.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.410
This occurs in the S phase, and
then the cell will just

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.710
continue to grow more.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.160
So the cell was already big--
I'll focus on the cell again.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.720
The cell was already big
and it gets bigger.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.930
It gets bigger, and that's
during the G2 phase, so it's

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.380
just growing more.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.400
Now, there's another little part
of the cell we haven't

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.900
even talked about yet,
but I'll talk

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.800
about it a little bit.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.580
It's not super-duper important,
but it's the idea

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.010
of these centrosomes.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.530
These are going to be very
important later on when the

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.170
cell is actually dividing,
and those also duplicate.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.270
So let's say I have a little
centrosome here.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.940
It has centrioles inside it.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.820
You don't have to worry too much
about that, but they're

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.370
these little cylindrical-looking
things.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.560
But I just want to-- so you
don't get confused if you see

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.710
the word centriole and
centrosomes, not to be

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.690
confused with centromeres, which
are these little points

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.760
where the two chromatids
attach.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.640
Unfortunately, they named many
things in this process very

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.520
similarly, or a lot
of the parts

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.590
of a cell very similarly.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.320
But you have these things called
centrosomes that are

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.720
going to enter the picture very
soon, that are sitting

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.260
outside of the nucleus, and
they also replicate.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.280
They also replicate during
the interphase.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.100
So you had one before, now
you have two of them.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.530
And, of course, they each have
their two little centrioles

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.930
inside, but we're not going
to focus too much

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.020
on those just yet.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.460
So that's what happened
in the interphase.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.280
This is most of the cell's life,
and it's kind of growing

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.420
and doing what it wants.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.200
Actually, I'll make a
slight point here.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.310
When I drew the DNA here, I
drew them as chromosomes.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.140
But the reality is when we're
sitting in the interphase,

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.760
this is not what the DNA would
actually look like.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.930
The DNA, if I were to actually
draw this, it's in its

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.580
chromatin form.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.670
It's not all tightly wound
like I drew it here.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.050
I drew it tightly wound so that
you can see that it got

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.920
replicated, but the reality is
that that green chromosome

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.980
would actually be all unwound,
and if you were looking in a

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.330
microscope, you would even
have trouble seeing it.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.470
This is its chromatin form.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.370
We'll talk a little bit about
where it actually organizes

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.050
itself back into a chromosome,
but in its chromatin form,

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.270
it's just a bunch of DNA and
proteins that the DNA is

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.610
wrapped around a little bit,
so you might have some

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.990
proteins here that the DNA is
wrapped around a little bit.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.560
But if you're looking at it in
a microscope, it just looks

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.210
like a big blur of
DNA and proteins.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.090
Same thing for the
magenta molecule.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.010
Really, for DNA to
do anything, it

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.080
has to be like this.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.150
It has to be open to its
environment in order for the

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.960
mRNA and the different types of
helper proteins to really

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.790
be able to function with it.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.260
And even for it to be able to
replicate, it has to be

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.360
unwound like this in order
for it to function.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.600
It only gets tightly wound
like this later on.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.630
I just drew it like this, so
really it had one green one,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.080
and it's going to replicate to
form another green one, and

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.010
they're going to be attached
at some point.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.260
That magenta one is going to
replicate to form another

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.440
magenta one, and they'll be
attached at some point, but

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.680
it's not going to be clear.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.060
I just drew it this way to show
that it really happened.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.320
This is the reality.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.870
It's in its chromatin form.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.930
Now, we're ready for mitosis.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.060
So the first stage
of mitosis is

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.420
essentially-- let me draw this.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.200
So I'll draw the
cell in green.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.790
I'm going to draw the nucleus a
lot bigger than it normally

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.470
is relative to the cell just
because, at least right now, a

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.820
lot of the action is going
in the nucleus.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.890
So the first stage of mitosis
is the prophase.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.809
These are somewhat arbitrary
names that were assigned.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:41.890
People looked in a microscope.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.380
Oh, that's a certain type of
step that we always see when a

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.100
nucleus is dividing so we'll
call this the prophase.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:55.210
What happens in the prophase is
that the actual chromatin

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.050
starts actually turning into
this type of form.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.330
So as I just said, when we're
in the interphase, the DNA's

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.750
in this form where it's all
separated and unwound.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.220
It actually starts to wind
together, so this is where

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.940
you'll actually have-- and
remember, it's already

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.480
replicated.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.990
The replication happened
before mitosis begins.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.840
So I had that one chromosome
there, and then I

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.400
have another one here.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.740
It has two sister chromatids
that we'll see

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.270
soon get pulled apart.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:30.000
Now, during prophase, you
also start to have these

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.060
centromeres appear that I
was touching on before.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:40.380
These guys over here, they
start to facilitate the

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.060
generation of what you call
microtubules, and you can kind

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.770
of view these as these sticks or
these ropes that are going

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.890
to be key in moving things
around as we divide the cell.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.160
All of this is pretty amazing.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.630
I mean, you think of a cell, you
think of something that's

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.090
inherently pretty simple.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:01.940
It's the most basic living
structure in us or in life.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.750
But even here, you have these
complex mechanics going on,

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.360
and a lot of it still
isn't understood.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.820
I mean, we can observe it, but
we really don't know what's

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.140
happening at the atomic level
or at the protein level that

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.720
allows these things to move
around in such a nicely

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.760
choreographed way.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.480
It's still an area
of research.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.520
Some of this is understood,
some of it isn't.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.910
But you have these two
centrosomes, and they

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.970
facilitate the development of
these microtubules, which are

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.740
literally like these little
microstructures.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:40.310
You can view them as tubes
or as some type of rope.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:44.230
Now as prophase progresses, it
eventually gets to the point

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.720
where-- let me do it.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.955
I don't want this word
replication written here.

00:10:47.955 --> 00:10:49.030
It makes it confusing.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.950
Let me delete that.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.775
Let me get rid of this
replication.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.690
So as prophase progresses, the
nuclear envelope actually

00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.430
disappears.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.435
So let me redraw this.

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:03.855
Let me copy and paste what
I've done before.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.536
Put it there.

00:11:08.536 --> 00:11:15.760
So as prophase progresses-- the
nuclear envelope actually

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.790
starts to disassemble.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:24.400
So this starts to actually
dissolve and disassemble, and

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.330
then these things start to grow
and attach themselves to

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:29.840
the centromere.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.290
So actually, let me do that.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.230
So this is all during
prophase.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.430
Since all of this happens during
prophase, this latter

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.390
part of prophase, sometimes
they'll call it late prophase,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.820
sometimes it'll be called
prometaphase.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.140
Sometimes it's considered-- I
don't think there's a hyphen

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.390
really there.

00:11:57.745 --> 00:12:00.890
So sometimes it's actually
considered a separate phase of

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.700
mitosis, although when I learned
it in school, they

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.180
didn't bother with
prometaphase.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.620
They just called it
all prophase.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.620
But by the end of prophase,
or actually by the end of

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.220
prometaphase, depending on how
you want to view it, the whole

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.510
situation is going to look
something like this.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.390
You have your overall cell.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.460
The nuclear envelope has
disassembled, so to some

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.980
degree, it doesn't
exist anymore.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.380
Although the proteins that
formed it are still there and

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.350
they're going to be
used later on.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.840
And you have your two
chromosomes in this case.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.800
In a human's case, you would
have 46 of them.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.320
You have your two chomosomes,
each made with sister

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.050
chromatids, each made with
two sister chromatids.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.190
Two chromosomes.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.900
They, of course, have their
centromeres right there, and

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:55.160
then these centrosomes will
have migrated roughly on

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.930
opposite sides of what
was once the nucleus.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.370
And these things have kind
of spread apart, these

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.740
microtubules, so they're doing
two functions, really.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.270
At this point, they're
kind of pushing these

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.470
two centrosomes apart.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.370
So you have all of these things,
and they're connecting

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.880
the-- you know, some of them
are coming from this

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.760
centrosome, some are coming from
this centrosome, some are

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.120
connecting the two.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.900
And then some of these
microtubules, these tubes or

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.210
these ropes, however you want
to view them, attach

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:31.340
themselves to the centromeres of
the actual chromosomes, and

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.610
the protein structure that they
attach them to is called

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.570
the kinetochore.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.160
So there's the kinetochore
there, and that may or may not

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.040
be-- kinetochore.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.430
It's a protein structure.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.940
It's actually fascinating.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.980
It's still an open area of
research on how exactly the

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.350
microtubule attaches to the
kinetochore, and as we'll see

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.740
in a second, it's at the
kinetochore that the

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.400
microtubules essentially start
to pull at the two separate

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.670
sister chromatids and actually
pull them apart.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.530
And it's actually
not understood

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.720
exactly how that works.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.080
It's just been observed that
this actually happens.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:14.020
Once prophase is done,
essentially the cells then

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.190
just make sure that the
chromosomes are well aligned.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.270
I kind of drew them well aligned
here, but that just

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.760
kind of formally occurs
during metaphase,

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.090
which is the next phase.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.040
The first one was prophase.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.280
Now we're in metaphase, and
metaphase really is just an

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.680
aligning of the chromosomes, so
all of the chromosomes are

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.300
going to be aligned at the
center of the cell.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:42.430
So I have my magenta one here,
I have my magenta one here,

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.660
and I have my other one here,
my green one there, and, of

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.960
course, you have your
centrosomes, the microspindles

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.570
that are coming off of them.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.250
Some of them are kinetochore
microspindles that are

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:59.200
actually attaching to the
centromeres of the actual

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.470
chromosomes.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.910
It's very confusing, right?

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.850
The centrosomes are these
structures that help direct

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.070
what happens to these
microtubules.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.880
Centrioles are these little
structures, these little

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.850
can-shaped structures inside
the centrosomes, and the

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:19.050
centromere are the center
points where the two

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.170
chromatids attached to each
other within a chromosome.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.850
So this is one sister chromatid,
that's another

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.250
sister chromatid, and they
attach at the centromere.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.180
But this is metaphase.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.100
It's fairly easy.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.310
Metaphase, you just have this
aligning of the cells, and

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.220
there's actually some theories,
how does the cell

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.770
know to progress past
this point?

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.740
How does it know
that everything

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.240
is aligned and attached?

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.000
And then there are some theories
that there's actually

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.970
some signaling mechanism that
if one of these kinetochore

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.110
proteins isn't properly attached
to one of these

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.130
ropes, that somehow a signal
is sent that mitosis should

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:56.950
not continue.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.200
So this is a very intricate
process.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.540
You can imagine if you have 46
chromosomes and you have all

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.630
of this stuff going on in the
cell, and it's not like

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.080
there's some individual
pushing stuff, or some

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:08.800
computer here.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.360
It's really directed
by chemistry and by

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.910
thermodynamic processes.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:23.130
But just by the intricacy or
the elegance of how these

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.690
things are, it happens
spontaneously with all of the

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.780
proper checks and balances, so
that most of the time, nothing

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.210
bad happens, which is
all quite amazing.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.270
So after metaphase, now we're
ready to pull the stuff apart,

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.520
and that's anaphase.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.760
So in anaphase-- let
me write that down.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.250
I've changed the color
of my cell.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.280
These guys get pulled apart.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.490
And as soon as they get pulled
apart-- so let's see, this

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.520
guy's getting pulled.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.150
Let me do it in green.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.540
So one of the sister-- nope,
that's not green.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.410
One of the sister chromatids is
pulling in that direction.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.660
One is getting pulled
in that direction.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.520
And then the same is true
for the magenta ones.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.000
Pulled in that direction,
and one is getting

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.780
pulled in that direction.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.630
And, of course, you have your
centrosomes here and then

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.040
they're connected to the
kinetochores that are right

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.119
there and that's where
they're pulling.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.890
There's also a whole microtubule
structure that

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.650
isn't connected to the actual
chromosomes, but they're

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:29.260
helping to actually push apart
these two centrosomes so that

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.570
everything is going to opposite
sides of the cell.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.960
And so as soon as these two
chromatids are separated, and

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.140
I touched on this a little bit
before when we talked about

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.120
the vocabulary of DNA, then as
soon as that happens, these

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.030
are each referred to
as chromosomes.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.960
So now you can say that
the cell has what it

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.750
used to have here.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:51.770
It has two chromosomes.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.900
It now has four chromosomes.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.210
Because as soon as a chromatid
is no longer connected to its

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.590
sister chromatid, they're then
considered sister chromosomes,

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.100
which is just a naming
convention.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.740
I mean, they were there before,
they were there after.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.510
They were just attached
before.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.390
Now they're not attached, so
you kind of consider them

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.930
their own individual entity.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.590
And then we're almost done.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.960
The last stage is telophase.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.900
I'm going to draw the cell a
little bit different here

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.650
because something is happening
simultaneously with telophase

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.720
most of the time.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.910
So telophase, and actually I'll

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.520
rotate the cell 90 degrees.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.800
Let's say that this was
one centromere.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.930
This is the other centromere.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.640
So at this point,
it's essentially

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.670
pulled the DNA to itself.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:43.000
So this guy has pulled one copy
of that chromosome and

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.130
one copy of this chromosome.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.730
That guy's done the
same up here.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.370
He's pulled over one copy of
each-- oh, I used a different

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:54.060
color-- one copy of each
chromosome to himself.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.190
Let me draw that right
there like that.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:01.200
And now the nuclear membranes
start forming around each of

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:01.980
these two ends.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.660
So now you start having a
nuclear membrane form around

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.760
each of these two ends.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.310
And so by the end of the
telophase-- that's what we're

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.880
in, the telophase-- we will
have completed mitosis.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.110
We will have completely
replicated our two original

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.300
nucleuses and all of the genetic
content inside of it.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.430
Now, at the same time telophase
is happening, you

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.440
also normally have this
cytokinesis, where this

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.260
cleavage furrow forms, where
essentially-- during

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.570
telophase, these things are
getting pushed further and

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.720
further apart by those
microtubules so that they're

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.166
already at the ends of the cell,
of the cytoplasm of the

00:19:42.166 --> 00:19:45.270
cell, and you can almost view
them as pushing on the sides

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.860
to elongate the cell.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.440
As that is happening, you have
this furrow forming, this

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.310
little indentation.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.520
By the end of telophase in
mitosis, you also have this

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.340
process of cytokinesis, where
this cleavage furrow forms and

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.900
deepens, deepens, deepens
until the cytoplasm is

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.730
actually split into two
separate cells.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.560
So this is cytokinesis, which
is formally not a part of

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.450
mitosis, but it normally occurs
with the telophase, so

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.950
right at the end of mitosis,
you do normally have two

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.770
complete identical cells.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.800
Once you have each of these
two cells, then they, each

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.140
individually, enter their
own interphase.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.840
Or they each individually, if
we look at just this one, he

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.780
will then be in his G1 phase.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.650
At some point, these two things
are going to replicate,

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.500
and that's the S phase, and you
go to the G2 phase, and

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.280
then this guy will experience
mitosis all over again.
