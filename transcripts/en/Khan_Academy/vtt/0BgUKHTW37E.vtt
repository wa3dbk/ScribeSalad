00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.720
We're asked to solve and graph
this system of equations here.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.810
And just as a bit of a review,
solving a system of equations

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.090
really just means figuring out
the x and y value that will

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.910
satisfy both of these
equations.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.230
And one way to do it is to use
one of the equations to solve

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.990
for either the x or the y, and
then substitute for that value

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.820
in the other one.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.870
That makes sure that you're
making use of both

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.780
constraints.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.830
So let's start with this bottom
equation right here.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.900
So we have y minus
x is equal to 5.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.100
It's pretty straightforward
to solve for y here.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.350
We just have to add x to both
sides of this equation.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.850
So add x.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.800
And so the left-hand side,
these x's cancel out, the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.980
negative x and the positive x,
and we're left with y is equal

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.520
to 5 plus x.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.970
Now, the whole point of me doing
that, is now any time we

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.340
see a y in the other equation,
we can replace it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.970
with a 5 plus x.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.010
So the other equation was-- let
me do it in this orange

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.940
color-- 9x plus 3y
is equal to 15.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.020
This second equation told us, if
we just rearranged it, that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.840
y is equal to 5 plus x, so we
can replace y in the second

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.740
equation with 5 plus x.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.460
That makes sure we're making
use of both constraints.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.260
So let's do that.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.100
We're going to replace
y with 5 plus x.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.380
So this 9x plus 3y equals 15
becomes 9x plus 3 times y.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.540
The second equation says
y is 5 plus x.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.510
So we're going to put 5 plus
x there instead of a y.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.020
3 times 5 plus x
is equal to 15.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.520
And now we can just
solve for x.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.970
We get 9x plus 3 times 5
is 15 plus 3 times x is

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.720
3x is equal to 15.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:04.870
So we can add the 9x and the 3x,
so we get 12x, plus 15, is

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.570
equal to 15.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.820
Now we can subtract 15 from both
sides, just so you get

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.870
only x terms on the
left-hand side.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.270
These guys cancel each other
out, and you're left with 12x

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.210
is equal to 0.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.480
Now you divide both sides by 12,
and you get x is equal to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.380
0/12, or x is equal to 0.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.160
So let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.880
So x is equal to 0.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.520
Now if x equals 0, what is y?

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.850
Well, we could substitute
into either one of these

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.750
equations up here.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.610
If we substitute x equals 0 in
this first equation, you get 9

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.340
times 0 plus 3y is
equal to 15.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.100
Or that's just a 0, so you
get 3y is equal to 15.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.730
Divide both sides by 3, you get
y is equal to 15/3 or 5.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.170
y is equal to 5.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.040
And we can test that that also
satisfies this equation.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.760
y, 5, minus 0 is also
equal to 5.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.720
So the value x is equal to--
I'll do this in green. x is

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.690
equal to 0, y is equal
to 5 satisfies

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.590
both of these equations.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.230
So we've done the first part.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.430
Let's do the second part, where
we're asked to graph it.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.510
The second equation is pretty
straightforward to graph.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.420
We actually ended up putting
it in mx plus

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.650
b form right there.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.130
And actually, let
me rewrite it.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.330
Let me just switch the x and the
5, so it really is in that

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.550
mx plus b form.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.710
So y is equal to x plus 5.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.185
So its y-intercept is 5--
1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- and

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:46.690
its slope is 1, right?

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.040
There's a 1 implicitly being
multiplied, or the x is being

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.650
multiplied by 1.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.830
So it looks like Let me see
how well I can draw it.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.450
The line will look like that.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.640
It has a slope of 1.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.560
You move back 1,
you go down 1.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.960
You move forward
1, you go up 1.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.750
That's a pretty good job.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.670
So that right here
is this equation.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.760
Now let's graph that
top equation.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.530
And we just have to put it
in mx plus b form, or

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.079
slope-intercept form.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.110
And I'll do that in green.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.620
So we have 9x plus 3y
is equal to 15.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.630
One simplification we can do
right from the get-go is every

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.620
number here is divisible by
3, so let's just divide

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.460
everything by 3 to make
things simpler.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.180
So we get 3x plus
y is equal to 5.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.430
Now we can subtract 3x
from both sides.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.900
We are left with y is equal
to negative 3x plus 5.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.955
So that's what this first
equation gets turned into, if

00:04:51.955 --> 00:04:54.740
you put it in slope-intercept
form. y is equal to

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.850
negative 3x plus 5.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.100
So if you were to graph it,
the y-intercept is 5.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.900
0, 5.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.350
And then its slope
is negative 3.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.570
So you move 1 in the
x-direction, you move down 3

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.970
in the y-direction.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.210
Move 2, you would move down 6.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.870
2, 4, 6.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.120
Move 2, you go 2, 4, 6.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.190
So this line is going to look
something like this.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.410
It's going to look something
like that right there.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.160
As you can see, the solution to
this system is the point of

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.090
intersection of these
two lines.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.900
It's the combination of x and y
that satisfy both of these.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.090
Remember, this pink line, or
this red line, is all of the

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.670
x's and y's that satisfy
this equation: y minus

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.060
x is equal to 5.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.060
This green line is all of the
x's and y's, or all the

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.810
combinations of them, that
satisfy this first equation.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.950
Now, the one x and y combination
that satisfies

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.420
both is their point
of intersection.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.370
And we figured it out
algebraically using

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.320
substitution.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.780
That happens at x is equal to 0,
y is equal to 5. x is equal

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.600
to 0-- this is the x-axis-- y
is equal to 5 right there.
