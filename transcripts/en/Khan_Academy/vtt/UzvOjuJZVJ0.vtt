00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.210
We're on problem number six and
I actually figured out how

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.780
to cut and paste from the PDF
file to my little writing

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.020
board, so we actually have
access to the problem.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.460
So it says: What system of
inequalities best represents

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.270
the graph shown below?

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.130
So we want to figure out what
inequalities represents this

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.670
shaded area.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.580
So a good place to start is just
to figure out what these

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.320
dotted line graphs, what the
equations of them look like.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.790
So this one, let's do the
hard one first, right?

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.810
This is at an angle.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.960
So whenever I look at a line,
I like to think what's it's

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.180
slope and what it's y-intercept,
right?

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.860
And then you could just write
it in the form y is equal to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.790
mx plus b, where b is
the y-intercept

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.170
and m is the slope.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.680
So let's try to figure out the
equation of this line up here,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.510
this dotted line.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.670
So what's its slope?

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.730
So when I move over 1 and x,
when I move over to the right,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.970
when x increases by 1, or let's
say when x increases by

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.920
2, how much does y increase?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.070
Well, y increases
by 2 as well.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950
Or whatever we increase x by.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.230
If x increases by 1, then
y increases by 1.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.580
So the slope is 1, right?

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.520
Slope is just change in
y over change in x.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.350
So the slope of this
first line is 1.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.950
So m is equal to 1, for at least
this first line up here.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.170
And what's it's y-intercept?

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.055
The y-intercept is just what
does the graph equal when x is

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:30.110
equal to 0 or where does it
intersect the y-axis?

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.810
Well, it intersects the y-axis
right here at y is equal to 1,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.140
so b is equal to 1.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.720
So the equation of this dotted
line up here is y is equal to

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.100
mx, the slope times x, we
figured out the slope was 1,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.450
so that's x plus the
y-intercept, which we also

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.430
figured out was 1.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.770
So that's the graph of
that line, right?

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.750
But notice, the shaded region
is below that line.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.760
And it also does not include
the line, right?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.960
That's why they drew
a dotted line.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.200
If it was a solid line, that
means that we're including the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.290
line itself.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.720
But the shaded region does
not include the line.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.680
But it's below it.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.260
Think of it this way: For any
given x-- let's pick this x.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.450
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.940
Let me do it in blue.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.680
If I were to pick x is equal to
1, this is the point y is

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.310
equal to x plus 1.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.470
That's the equation.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.420
Now, my question to you is y
above y is equal to x plus 1?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.900
Is the shaded region y is
greater than x plus 1, which

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.270
would be that region?

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.990
Or would it be y is less
than x plus 1,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.370
which is this region?

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.350
Well, clearly, it is y is
less than x plus 1.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.450
You pick any x, x
is equal to 3.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.795
This is what y would be equal
to. y would be equal to 3 plus

00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:50.330
1 if you picked this choice.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.620
But the y's that satisfy the
grey area are always less than

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.730
this point.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.940
So at least the grey area
relative to this equation, we

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.030
can write the inequality y
is less than x plus 1.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.630
And we know it's not less
than or equal to.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.730
It would be less than or equal
to if they had filled in this

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.660
line, if this was part of
the area, but it's not.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.610
They drew a dotted line.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.750
So that's why we know it's
less than, right?

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.820
If the grey area was up here
it would be greater than.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.430
You just pick an x, you say,
oh, the y's less than the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.980
line, not the y is greater.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.450
But we're not done, right?

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.780
Because this would be the
solution set if all of this

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.520
area was grey.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.500
But it's only grey up
to a certain point.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.070
It's only grey up to this
line down here.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.930
This line is easier.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.000
This line has no slope, right?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.996
No matter what my change in
x, my change in y is 0.

00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:41.530
So what's the equation
of this?

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.100
The equation of this line
is just slope is 0.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.770
So y is equal to 0x plus
the y-intercept.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.060
Well, the y-intercept
is minus 2.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.250
So the equation of this line
is y is equal to minus 2.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.940
Let me do it in the purple.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.540
I'll just write it here.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.740
That equation is y is equal to
minus 2, Which makes sense.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.690
For all x, y is equal
to minus to 2.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.810
Now, my question to you
is this grey area.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.130
For any given x, the y is
greater than the line or the y

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.020
is less than the line?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.450
Well, let's pick this x.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.680
When x is equal to 3, y is
equal to negative 2.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.980
That's this line.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.670
Now, is the grey area-- the
y's for that x-- above the

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.220
line or below it?

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.790
Well, it's above the
line, right?

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.640
So if we look at it from the
point of view of this

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.430
boundary, we say that y has to
be greater than minus 2.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.330
That's the shaded area.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.110
y is equal to negative 2 is this
dotted line's equation.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.230
The shaded area, at least
relative to this line, is y is

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.480
greater than negative 2.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.790
If I just had this by itself,
I would shade up everything

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.980
above y is equal to
negative 2, right?

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.070
But I want just the combination
of both of these.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.460
So essentially, we have to say
that y-- let me do it in a

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.650
nice, vibrant color.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.400
Since the shaded area is below
this line, we know that y is

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.740
less than x plus 1.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.850
And since the shaded area is
above this line, we know that

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.060
y is greater than negative 2.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.990
Where could I write that?

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.240
I'll write it right here.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.700
So which of the choices
satisfy that?

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.050
Let's see.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.290
Whoops, I went to the
next problem.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.530
So we know that y is greater
than negative 2.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.030
So these can't-- let me
just cross those out.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.270
That and that can't
be the answer.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.520
And then we also know that
y is less than x plus 1.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.090
So we know that this
is the answer.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.520
And frankly, if you just looked
at the choices, you

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.450
really didn't have to figure out
the slope and y-intercept.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.480
They're essentially giving you
the equations of the two

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.080
lines, right?

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.950
You say, like, oh, one is x plus
1 and one is negative 2,

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.230
and I just have to figure out
whether y is greater than or

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.730
less than each of those lines.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.170
And you can say, OK, relative
to the y equals negative 2,

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.600
we're definitely greater than
negative 2, so I'm one of

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.730
these two choices, and relative
to y is equal to x

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.630
plus 1, we're definitely less
than that line, so we have to

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.200
be choice b.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.360
Next problem.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.460
Which point lies in the solution
set for the system?

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.350
So you essentially just have
to say which coordinates

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.460
satisfy both of these
equations?

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.370
And frankly, you could graph
them and you could draw the

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.930
area like we did in the last
one, or you could just try out

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.870
the numbers, right?

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.270
Let's just try the numbers.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.970
That never hurts.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.060
So minus 4, 1.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.190
Let's see if it satisfies it.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.510
So remember, the first
coordinate is x, the

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.370
second one is y.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.900
So 2y would be 2 times
minus 1 minus x.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.240
So minus minus 4.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.480
Now, is that greater than
or equal to minus 6?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.270
Well, this is minus 2 plus 4.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.590
And this is what?

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.120
Minus 2 plus 4 is equal to 2,
which is definitely greater

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.980
than or equal to minus 6.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.900
So it satisfies the
first equation.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.480
Let's see if it satisfies
the second equation.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.720
I'll do it in another color and
I'll do it up in the black

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.140
area up here.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.620
So 2 times y.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.980
So it's 2 times minus 1--
y is minus 1-- minus

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.835
3 times minus 4.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.780
And they want to know is
that less than minus 6?

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.490
So you get minus 2.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:32.070
3 times 4 is 12, so
it's plus 12.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.700
Negative times a negative is a
positive, so that equals plus

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.890
10, which is not less
than negative 6.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.590
So the first one
does not work.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.020
That is not the answer.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.400
Let's try the second one.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.030
3 comma 1.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.220
So y is 1.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:50.950
So it becomes 2 times 1, which
is just 2, minus 3.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.430
Is that greater than or
equal to negative 6?

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.730
So you get negative 1 is
definitely greater than

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.450
negative 6, so this satisfies
the first equation.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.140
Does it satisfy the
second one?

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.150
2 times y.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:09.295
2 times 1 is 2, minus
3 times 3.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.600
Is that less than minus 6?

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.520
So you get 2 minus 9.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.780
Is that less than minus 6?

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.350
You get minus 7 is less
than minus 6.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.750
So that is true.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.830
So choice b works.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.390
You don't have to
go any further.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.060
That point lies in the solution
set, which just means

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.630
it satisfies both of
these inequalites.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.950
Next problem.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.970
Scroll down a little bit.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.570
Which system of linear
equalities is represented by

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:41.179
this graph?

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:44.059
So now we can use some of the
skills we used the last time.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.120
I don't have much space
to draw all of them.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.980
So let's just to figure out
the-- let's see, do they gives

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.900
us-- no, they don't even give
us the equations because all

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.110
the equations are different, so
we have to figure out the

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.740
equations of these two graphs.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.450
So let's do this top
one first. So let's

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.460
figure out its slope.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.920
When you increase-- and you
can just eyeball this one.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.350
When you increase x by
3, y increases by the

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.250
same amount, right?

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.630
So change in y over change
in x would be 3 over 3.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.860
Whatever you change x by, y
increases the same amount.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.890
So the slope of this first one
at least-- let me do it in a

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.530
color you can see over black--
the slope is equal to 1.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.870
And what's its y-intercept?

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.720
Well, you just look at where did
it intercept the y-axis?

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.650
Right there.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.860
So the y-intercept is
equal to minus 2.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.770
So this first equation
right here is y is

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.370
equal to x minus 2.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.000
Fair enough.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.480
And this grey area, is
it above or below it?

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.150
It's below it.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.480
You pick any x.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.940
For any x, this is y is
equal to x minus 2.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.090
The grey area is for all
the y's that are

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.060
less than it, right?

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.040
And notice, now the
line is shaded in.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.840
So the line is part of
the solution set.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.930
So at least relative to this, we
know that the grey area is

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.990
all y's that satisfy y is less
than or equal to x minus 2.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.430
Less than because it's below it,
and it's equal to because

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.000
they actually drew
in the line.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.500
But now we have to figure
out the lower bound.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.870
What's the equation
of this line?

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.560
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.650
This one's a little
more interesting.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:27.220
If I increase x by 1, so if
I'm going from this point,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.310
what happens to y?

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.910
y goes down by 2, right?

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.680
1 minus 2.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:39.500
If I increase x by 2, y
goes down by 4, right?

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.740
Minus 4.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.380
So at least in this case, the
slope, change in y, is minus 4

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.550
whenever change in
x is positive 2.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.180
Or it could've been change in
y is minus 2 whenever change

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.740
in x is plus 1, right?

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.590
So it equals minus 2.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.330
And that makes sense.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.710
For every 1 you go over,
the slope goes down 2.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.280
And what's it's y-intercept?

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.440
Let's see, y-intercept is just
right there. y is equal to 3.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.960
So b is equal to 3.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:14.720
So this second graph is y is
equal to minus 2x plus 3.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.630
And then, once again, the shaded
area includes this, but

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:23.200
we have to be greater than
or equal to this graph.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.060
We have to be greater than,
because if you pick any x, the

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.400
y's that satisfy the shaded area
are equal to the graph or

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.350
greater than for any x.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.210
So there we have
our inequality.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.940
So this one, this area, you
could kind of say is y has to

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.250
be greater than or equal
to minus 2x plus 3.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.420
That's from this boundary.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.300
And we also know that y
has to be less than or

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.840
equal to x minus 2.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.450
Now, hopefully, that's
one of the choices.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.610
If we haven't a made
a careless mistake.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.400
Let me see.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.330
All right.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:02.350
y is greater than or
equal to-- OK, so

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.530
this is not the answer.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.670
Neither of these are
the answers.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.890
That's not the answer.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.320
Let me cross that out.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.200
y is greater than or
equal to-- we have

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.860
minus 2x plus 3, right?

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.740
Let me make sure I
got that right.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.620
Minus 2x plus 3.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.520
Yeah, let me see.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.760
Right, so they're tricky.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.100
So the slope on that second
line was minus 2x plus 3.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.840
They got the second
part right.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.500
Maybe I made a careless mistake,
but I don't think

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.660
this is right either.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.770
Let's see if we can rearrange.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.440
So these other two, they put
the x's and the y's on the

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.830
same side, so let's do that.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.250
That top equation, we
can rewrite it.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.890
Add 2x to both sides.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.560
You get 2x plus y is greater
than or equal to 3.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:50.340
And the second equation, if we
were to subtract x from both

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:57.860
sides, you get y minus x is less
than or equal to minus 2.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.390
And now this is interesting.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.490
So there's no minus 2 on the
right-hand side here,

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.050
but what can we do?

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.990
If we multiply both sides
of this equation by

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.770
minus 2, what happens?

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.040
Sorry, multiply both sides of
the equation by minus 1.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.585
You get minus y plus x.

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:17.330
And when you multiply an
inequality by a negative

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.240
number, multiply or divide, you
switch the inequalites.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.700
So it's greater than or equal
to-- and we're multiplying by

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.260
negative 1-- 2.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.890
So it becomes x minus y is
greater than or equal to 2.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.190
So our two equations turn into
2x plus y is greater than or

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.890
equal to 3, which is this one.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.460
And we get x minus y is greater
than or equal to 2,

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.890
which is that one.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.440
And we're done.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.480
It's choice d.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.520
See you in the next video.
