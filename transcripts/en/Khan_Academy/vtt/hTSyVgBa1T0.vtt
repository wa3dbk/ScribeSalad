00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.820
Welcome back.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.690
Hopefully you have a
little intuition now

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.770
of what the curl is.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.070
Now let's actually compute it
because if your sole goal is to

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.990
pass a test and not understand
the nature of the universe,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.820
which I think would be sad, but
if that is your goal you at

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.880
least need to know how to
calculate these things.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.700
But it's even more fun when
you have the intuition.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.420
And then you'll hopefully
never forget it.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.480
We'll take the curl of a
fairly fancy vector field.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.010
One that I have trouble
visualizing but that we can

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.020
mathematically chug through.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.460
So let's say our vector field--
and I'll do a three dimensional

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.480
vector field just to do a
fairly complicated example; I'm

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.505
just going to make it up on the
fly --so let's say in the

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:45.545
x-direction the magnitude of
the field is, I don't know,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:57.670
let's say it's x squared, y,
sine, z, in the x-direction,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.790
plus-- I don't know --let's
make it x, y squared, z in

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.420
the j-direction, or
the y-direction.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.410
And in the z-direction, I don't
know, let's make it cosine of

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.880
x times cosine of y,
in the z-direction.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.460
Now we said that you can view
the curl of this vector field--

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.640
and I have no intuition of
what this vector field looks

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.180
like; I just made this up.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.870
Maybe we'll graph it for fun
just to see how messed up it

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.440
looks --but we said this curl,
you could view it as a cross

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.230
product of our del operator
and the vector field.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.990
Well, when you were using this
engineering notation, when you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.620
have a vector broken down into
it x, y, and z components, or

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.130
it's i, j, and k components,
you can take the determinant of

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.490
that matrix-- when I showed you
how to compute the cross

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.620
product --to figure out
the cross product.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.590
So how do we do this?

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:11.440
So the cross product is going
to be equal to-- I didn't have

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.970
to draw a straight line --so
how you take the cross product

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.680
of this vector field and
the gradient operator?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.990
Well, you write i, j, k on top
like you're taking the cross

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.680
product of any two three
dimensional vectors, and then

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.100
you take the first vector-- but
it's really a vector operator,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.410
but it's this del operator.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.250
And what are the components
of the del operator?

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.270
It's the partial derivative
with respect to x, the partial

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.600
derivative with respect to y,
partial derivative with

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.160
respect to z, right?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.750
Let me just rewrite
the del operator.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.350
You can view it as being equal
to the partial with respect to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.750
x, i plus the partial with
respect to y, j plus the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.630
partial with respect to z, k.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.900
So its x, y, and z components
are the partials with respect

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.390
to x, with respect to
y, with respect to z.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.160
And then the second, where
we're taking this operator

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.375
cross the vector field.

00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:16.500
So what are the components
of the vector field?

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:25.130
I'll probably run out of space,
but it's x squared, y, sine, z.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.940
Then here it's xy squared, z--
I should written all of this

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.040
bigger --and then the third
column, the z component is

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.980
cosine of x times cosine of y.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.800
Just the x, y, and
z components.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.350
And now we are ready to take
the determinant, which will

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.260
probably, well, it'll
probably get pretty

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.990
messy, but let's try it.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:55.710
So this is equal to the i-unit
vector-- let me use a more

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.245
vibrant color --the i-unit
vector times it's

00:03:59.245 --> 00:03:59.500
subdeterminant.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.740
So you cross out it's row and
column, and so you take the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.540
determinant of this expression,
so it's going to be times--

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.130
this times this, but it's
really the partial.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.400
If you multiply the partial
with respect to y operator

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.986
times that expression, you're
really just taking, since it's

00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:17.240
an operator and not an
expression, you're really just

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.150
going to take the partial of
this with respect to y,

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.970
but I'll write it down.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.750
So it's going to be the partial
with respect to y of cosine x,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:37.020
cosine y minus the partial with
respect to z times xy squared,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:45.490
z-- and now we're on to
our j component --plus j.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.800
So now what's the magnitude of
our curl in the j-direction?

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.860
Let's cross out the row
in the column of j.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.580
So it's a partial with
respect to x of this.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.130
So this is maybe messier
than I originally intended.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:05.700
Cosine of x, cosine of y, cross
these columns there, minus

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:20.540
the partial with respect to z
of x squared, y sine of z.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.370
And then finally
our k component.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.100
Oh, and sorry, when you take
the determinant, you use that--

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.180
and this is all kind of a bit
of voodoo --but you put a plus

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.550
here, a minus here, a plus
here, so it's kind of

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.350
this checkered pattern.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.630
To this is plus i, this
should actually be minus j.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.420
Don't want to make that
mistake; this is minus j.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.340
This is just kind of the
algorithm of how do you

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.180
take a determinant.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.730
OK, then finally we have plus
k times the determinant

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.110
of its submatrix.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:06.660
So the partial with respect to
x of this, sorry, we take out

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.040
it's row and column, so xy
squared, z minus the partial

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.190
with respect to y of this.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.990
Why don't we take this row and
columns, and this is the

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:28.780
submatrix of x squared,
y, sine of z.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.870
All right, now let me try
to simplify it, and I'll

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.860
have to get some space.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.960
Hopefully you understood what I
did here and now we got this.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.930
And now I think I can erase
all of this and just so I

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.840
can have some room to
simplify things in.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.540
No, that's not what I wanted
to do; I wanted to do

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.570
it in a darker color.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.910
That's what I wanted to do.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.320
Erase that.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.030
Erase that.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.750
Now we just have to simplify
it, taking a bunch of

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.260
partial derivatives.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.630
What's the partial derivative
of this with respect to y?

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:08.320
Well, x is just a constant, so
it's going to be-- well, we can

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.480
just put the i out front, but
eventually we want to write our

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.350
magnitude before the vector
--so it's i times the partial

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.720
of this with respect to
y with our constant.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.850
Cosine of x is just a constant.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.800
And then what's the derivative
of this with respect to y?

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.090
It's minus sine of y.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:30.550
So we'll write sine of y, and
let's put the minus out front;

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.170
these are what's multiplied.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:39.310
OK, and then we have minus, now
we stick the partial with

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.180
respect-- sorry, actually,
I forgot to do this part.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.510
Let me start over, actually.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.050
So let me just take this
expression and I'll

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.635
multiply it by i.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:55.180
The partial of this with
respect to y is cosine of x

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.590
times minus sine of y-- let's
put the minus out front

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.760
--minus sine of y.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.080
Now minus the partial of
this with respect to z.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.780
Well the partial of this with
respect to z, xy squared

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.110
is just a constant, right?

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.560
So the partial of this
with respect to z

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.530
is just xy squared.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.360
So minus xy squared, and then
we're going to have all of

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.270
that; that's the magnitude
in our i-direction.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.170
And now we have minus-- because
minus in the j-direction

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.490
--what's the partial derivative
of this with respect to x?

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.483
Well, the partial of cosine
of x with respect to

00:08:32.483 --> 00:08:33.779
x is minus sine of x.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.970
And cosine of y is just
a constant, so it just

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.080
carries over, cosine of y.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.240
And then that should be-- oh,
there we go --minus this

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.350
expression, the partial of
this with respect to z.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.780
Well, the derivative of
sine of z with respect

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.960
to z is cosine of z.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.660
This is just a constant,
so it's minus x squared,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.670
y, cosine of z.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.160
And that's the magnitude
in the j-direction.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.500
We're almost there.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.030
And now finally, plus,
what's the partial of

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.990
this with respect to x?

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:17.480
Well, these are just constants,
so it's y squared, z minus--

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.600
once again, we just have a y
term; everything else is a

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.680
constant --so the partial
with respect to y is

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.250
x squared, sine of z.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.962
And that's the magnitude
in our k-direction.

00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:33.300
And we're pretty much done.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.570
I mean we can simplify
it a little bit just

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.280
to make it clean.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.420
And essentially we could just,
I don't have to rewrite it,

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.130
we can just multiply
this by negative 1.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.940
So then this becomes
plus, plus, plus.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.310
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.050
This is the curl of the
vector field v at any

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.450
point x, y, and z.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.590
So that's how you calculate it.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:59.810
You just literally take the
cross product of that del

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.020
operator and your vector field.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.350
And you'll get something fairly
hairy, although this was, I

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.700
think, a hairier than
average problem.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.320
In the next video, we'll do a
little bit of this, but I think

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.120
it'll give you more intuition
and less of just the algorithm

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.020
and the computation
of how do you do it.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.100
So you in the next video.
