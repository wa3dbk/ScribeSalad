00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.465
We're told that quadrilateral
ABCD is a rhombus.

00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:07.670
And what they want us to
prove is that their diagonals

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.340
are perpendicular, that
AC is perpendicular to BD.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.100
Now let's think about everything
we know about a rhombus.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.379
First of all, a rhombus
is a special case

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.690
of a parallelogram.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.620
In a parallelogram, the
opposite sides are parallel.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.630
So that side is
parallel to that side.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.890
These two sides are parallel.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.330
And in a rhombus, not only are
the opposite sides parallel--

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.670
it's a parallelogram--
but also, all of the sides

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.920
have equal length.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.060
So this side is equal
to this side, which

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.170
is equal to that side,
which is equal to that side

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.200
right over there.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.860
Now, there's other
interesting things

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.740
we know about the diagonals
of a parallelogram, which

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.040
we know all rhombi
are parallelograms.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.840
The other way around is
not necessarily true.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.670
We know that for any
parallelogram-- and a rhombus

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.660
is a parallelogram-- that the
diagonals bisect each other.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.210
So for example, let me label
this point in the center.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.885
Let me label it point E.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:04.040
We know that AE is
going to be equal to EC.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.560
I'll put two slashes
right over there.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.290
And we also know that EB
is going to be equal to ED.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.820
So this is all of what
we know when someone just

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.350
says that ABCD is a rhombus,
based on other things

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.300
that we've proven to ourselves.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.000
Now we need to prove that
AC is perpendicular to BD.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.550
So an interesting way to prove
it-- and you can look at it

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.770
just by eyeballing it-- is if we
can show that this triangle is

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.592
congruent to this triangle and
that these two angles right

00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:38.050
over here correspond
to each other,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.290
then they have to be the same.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.831
And they'll be supplementary,
and then they'll be 90 degrees.

00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:43.530
So let's just prove
it to ourselves.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.180
So the first thing we see
is we have a side, a side,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.430
and a side; a side,
a side, and a side.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.108
So we can see that triangle--
let me write it here.

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:56.573
Let me [? do this ?]
in a new color.

00:01:56.573 --> 00:02:08.655
We see that triangle ABE is
congruent to triangle CBE.

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:15.930
And we know that by
side-side-side congruency.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.969
We have a side, a side,
and a side; a side, a side,

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.402
and a side.

00:02:20.402 --> 00:02:21.860
And then once we
know that, we know

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.120
that all the corresponding
angles are congruent.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.380
And in particular, we
know that angle AEB

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.948
is going to be
congruent to angle CEB.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.810
Because they are corresponding
angles of congruent triangles.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.070
So this angle right
over here is going

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.380
to be equal to that
angle over there.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.456
And we also know that
they are supplementary.

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:02.800
Let me write it this way.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.550
They're congruent, and
they are supplementary.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.950
These two are going to
have the same measure,

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.480
and they need to add
up to 180 degrees.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.470
So if I have two things
that are the same thing

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.340
and they add up to 180 degrees,
what does that tell me?

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.850
So that tells me that
the measure of angle AEB

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.140
is equal to the measure
of angle CEB, which

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.730
must be equal to 90 degrees.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.910
They're the same measure,
and they are supplementary.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.710
So this is a right angle, and
then this is a right angle.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.380
And obviously, if
this is a right angle,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.890
this angle down here
is a vertical angle.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.080
That's going to
be a right angle.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.550
If this is a right
angle, this over here

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.883
is going to be a vertical angle.

00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:48.640
And you see the diagonals
intersect at a 90-degree angle.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.120
So we've just proved--
so this is interesting.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.120
A parallelogram, the
diagonals bisect each other.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.350
For a rhombus, where
all the sides are equal,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.610
we've shown that not only
do they bisect each other

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.840
but they're perpendicular
bisectors of each other.
