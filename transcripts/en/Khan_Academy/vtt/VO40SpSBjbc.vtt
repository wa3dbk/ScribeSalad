00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.982
Before we go into the details of the Cuban Missile Crisis, it's important to understand the world's environment

00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:10.249
entering into October of 1962.

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:15.802
In 1959, you have a revolution in Cuba led by Fidel Castro.

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:18.853
And he is heading the Communist party there.

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:23.053
Cuba is now a Communist nation right off of the coast of the United States.

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:29.546
This is the middle of the Cold War. The U.S. believes in a strategy of containment, does not like this.

00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:38.049
So in 1961, the United States, the CIA, the Kennedy Administration, they try using Cuban exiles,

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:39.867
people who have left Cuba,

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:43.867
they try to support them to enter and invade Cuba

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:49.722
at the Bay of Pigs. But, the whole effort wasn't planned properly.

00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:52.968
The support for the Cuban exiles, the counter-revolutionaries, those [who] were

00:00:52.968 --> 00:00:56.831
trying to oust Castro, it was kind of this

00:00:56.831 --> 00:00:59.445
half-hearted effort. And it was this big failure.

00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:05.533
So the Bay of Bigs invasion was a failure in 1961.

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:10.267
And it made John F. Kennedy seem a little bit weak. It made the CIA seem [weak]. It didn't make

00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:14.133
anyone on the American side look all that competent, because of that failure.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.733
On top of that, we're in the middle of the Cold War, remember this.

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:26.600
And at the same time, if you go to what the US was doing around the Soviet Union, it started placing missiles,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.330
starting [in] the late 50's, all the way into 1961 and 1962 ---

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.467
it started placing medium-ranged ballistic missiles in Turkey and in Italy.

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:38.406
These are where they were allocated.

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:42.888
And the significance of that is that now these missiles could reach the major population

00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:47.733
centers of the Soviet Union in really a matter of minutes, in 10 to 20 minutes, I think.

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:51.333
16 minutes was how long most of these stayed airborne.

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:56.200
And in a situation where both sides have nuclear weapons, there was this kind of notion of

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.333
well, maybe if you're able to get to the other guy faster, they wouldn't be able to retaliate,

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:03.400
and maybe you wouldn't have that mutually assured destruction.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.067
So there's this whole idea that you want to get your missiles as close as possible [to your enemies]

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:11.239
so that they could reach the populations centers, the strategic centers of your opponent,

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.357
as quickly as possible.

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:16.069
And if you look up on the Web, you can actually find the actual missile sites,

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.267
and where they were installed, and when they became operational.

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:24.405
These are the ones that were in Italy, kind of right here, near the heel of Italy.

00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:27.200
So you have this environment, the United States was looking a little bit weak

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.069
after the Bay of Pigs invasion.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.133
It looks like they wanted to oust Castro, but they weren't able to do it.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:37.667
They weren't able because they were slightly inept.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:41.564
And at the same time you could imagine that the Soviet Union did not appreciate the United States

00:02:41.564 --> 00:02:46.487
placing these missiles so close to its population centers.

00:02:46.487 --> 00:02:49.273
Missiles that could reach its population centers very easily.

00:02:49.273 --> 00:02:57.467
So now, we fast forward to October of 1962 and the entire Cuban Missile Crisis will occur

00:02:57.467 --> 00:03:05.400
over 13 or 14 days during October of 1962.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.200
So, on the 14th of October we're sending these U2 spy planes over Cuba.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.038
So this right here is a U2 spy plane. That is a U2 spy plane.

00:03:17.038 --> 00:03:19.877
And it takes pictures that look like this. And on the next day, on October 15th, you have the CIA analysts.

00:03:19.877 --> 00:03:23.221
And they're saying, "Wow - that looks like missiles over there.

00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:28.817
This looks like ballistic missiles that are being set up, that are being set up in Cuba".

00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:34.800
And so all of a sudden, it looks like the Soviet Union is using Cuba to do the same thing that

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.400
we used Turkey and Italy for, to set up ballistic missiles, really, right off of our coast --

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.200
and ballistic missiles that could now now reach any of the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.320
strategic population centers, especially on the east coast or the midwest of the United States.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.508
So by the 16th-- So this is literally two days after the pictures were taken.

00:03:54.508 --> 00:03:57.053
The next day, they're analyzing them, [and] they tell the State Department about them.

00:03:57.053 --> 00:04:01.905
[On] the 16th, they tell Kennedy about them, and Kennedy holds a meeting

00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:06.224
of the Executive Committee. It wasn't called "ExComm," just [yet].

00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:09.733
But it was really a subset of special advisors -- a subset of the National Security Council

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:14.333
and other advisors that essentially become the brain trust to figure out

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:19.646
what to do about this forming crisis. Because of all of a sudden you have a state that we don't

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:23.867
like off of our borders -- a Communist state -- a state aligned with the Soviet Union.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:28.562
All of a sudden, it has nuclear missiles. it looks like these are offensive weapons.

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:31.667
These are weapons being designed for a first-strike capability.

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:35.156
Once again, if they're being launched from Cuba, maybe they can attack -- maybe they can obliterate

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:40.333
the US before the US even has an opportunity to respond properly.

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:44.133
So this really freaks out the Kennedy Administration.

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:47.867
And so they start to think about what can they do about it and early on--

00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:48.933
Well, there's a couple--

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:51.155
You could just kind of call and talk to the Soviets about it

00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:54.533
and say: "Hey, we don't like that. Why don't you undo your missiles?"

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:58.067
But they didn't really think that that would have any significant effect on the Soviets.

00:04:58.067 --> 00:05:01.867
Especially, because they probably thought that Kennedy was weak at this point.

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:06.067
And just to understand who was leading the Soviets at this time,

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:10.067
it was Khrushchev. (This is Khrushchev right over here.)

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:13.667
And he had even made remarks to the effect that he thought that Kennedy was young

00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:20.355
and may be naive, and maybe too intellectual to really play a good game of chicken here.

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:25.892
And so the US kind of felt that it had to look strong here. And so the only real

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:32.000
options on the table were: maybe blockade Cuba - and so a blockade could be an 'all out' blockade,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.482
so it would be an economic blockade. But then that's actually considered an act of war

00:05:35.482 --> 00:05:41.217
because you are, to a large degree, starving a country. Another option for the United States,

00:05:41.217 --> 00:05:45.467
(because it was completely viewed as unacceptable that these missiles should be here,

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:49.901
and that they should be deployable from Cuba), the other option would be to do air attacks

00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:55.400
on these missile silos. And then the most extreme

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.885
action would be to actually invade Cuba. And ,obviously that goes in line

00:06:00.885 --> 00:06:05.552
with, the US' general interest of not having a communist regime

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:07.457
so close to its own borders.

00:06:07.457 --> 00:06:11.021
So, this is what Kennedy and his team was wrestling with.

00:06:11.021 --> 00:06:17.318
And really early on in these early days, most of the team was actually advising Kennedy

00:06:17.318 --> 00:06:20.320
that they should do a full-scale invasion of Cuba.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.804
They thought that this was the only thing that the Soviets would take seriously,

00:06:22.804 --> 00:06:25.702
it would show that the US is serious about this.

00:06:25.702 --> 00:06:30.072
And they didn't think that the Soviet Union would really try to put up a fight

00:06:30.072 --> 00:06:32.267
in Cuba, so far away from their own borders.

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:35.933
But Kennedy, probably thinking about it pretty reasonably,

00:06:35.933 --> 00:06:38.338
realized "Well, hey. They might not do anything in Cuba,

00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:42.733
and they might allow us to oust Castro and install a new regime there.

00:06:42.733 --> 00:06:48.200
But they might retaliate, in fact, they probably would retaliate in Europe, but specifically, in Berlin,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.010
probably in Germany as a whole. So, just for the sake of getting these things out of Cuba,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:59.579
we could sacrifice a lot in Europe. And even more, that any type of conflict

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:04.554
between the US and the Soviet Union could easily escalate to a nuclear war".

00:07:04.554 --> 00:07:07.400
So these were all on the table. The US goes on high alert.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.148
It prepares for any of these situations, because they really don't know what's going to happen.

00:07:11.148 --> 00:07:18.741
The Army, the Air Force and the Navy [start] mobilizing. So, on, kind of with hours notice,

00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:23.153
any of those options can, kind of, go into effect.

00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:27.600
By the 22nd, you have the Executive Committee -- (And that just becomes formalized

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.905
as an actual, official group that is advising the President in this capacity.) --

00:07:32.905 --> 00:07:40.467
and on the 22nd, Kennedy finally puts out his first salvo on what is the US' position

00:07:40.467 --> 00:07:41.891
on what's going on here.

00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:46.535
And before this -- just to make things clear -- on the 18th, he did meet,

00:07:46.535 --> 00:07:50.600
he did meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.292
Andrei Gromyko --

00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:54.639
and I'm sure I'm butchering the pronunciations --

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:58.238
and this is where the first time, Kennedy is like "Hey, you've got these offensive weapons..."

00:07:58.238 --> 00:08:00.933
And Gromyko is insisting that "No, they're just defensive weapons".

00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:04.867
And, to most people, defensive weapons would mean things like surface-to-air missiles,

00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:08.803
things that would stop planes from bombings. But not surface-to-surface missiles,

00:08:08.803 --> 00:08:10.333
not something that could attack a country.

00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:14.608
But we'll see, in future letters from Khrushchev, that maybe they actually did perceive

00:08:14.608 --> 00:08:19.195
these missiles as somehow being defensive. But you fast forward.

00:08:19.195 --> 00:08:23.800
That was on the 18th, it kind of made, it made Kennedy and the US frustrated with the

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.938
Russians, because it felt like the Americans are saying,

00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:29.887
"Look, we clearly know you have missiles there", but Gromyko is saying "No, these are just

00:08:29.887 --> 00:08:32.933
defensive weapons - nothing to worry about. Why are you taking this so seriously?"

00:08:32.933 --> 00:08:35.067
The 19th: US goes on high alert.

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:36.737
It starts thinking about all of these options.

00:08:36.737 --> 00:08:42.472
The 22nd: this Committee is formed formally. But more importantly,

00:08:42.472 --> 00:08:46.933
Kennedy gives a speech to state the United States' opinion.

00:08:46.933 --> 00:08:49.400
And I'll just read it right here:

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.152
"To halt this offensive build-up, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment

00:08:54.152 --> 00:08:59.562
under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba

00:08:59.562 --> 00:09:06.267
from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargos of offensive weapons,

00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:11.219
be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers.

00:09:11.219 --> 00:09:14.562
We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life,

00:09:14.562 --> 00:09:19.000
as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948."

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.533
So, the Kennedy administration's position became slightly more nuanced.

00:09:25.533 --> 00:09:29.067
They said "We can't do an all out blockade. 1) That is an act of war;

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:33.904
2) That is, to a large degree, inhumane. Why should we starve the Cuban people?

00:09:33.904 --> 00:09:40.000
What we're gonna do is, kind of a filter on the cargo going into Cuba.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.655
We will only inspect things that we suspect are holding armaments,

00:09:44.655 --> 00:09:48.138
and we will only turn back the ships that are actually doing it."

00:09:48.138 --> 00:09:53.000
But then on the 24th, there is a cable from Khrushchev, and it say,:

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.667
"If you cooly weigh the situation which has developed, not giving away to passions,

00:09:57.667 --> 00:10:01.815
you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot fail to reject the arbitrary

00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:05.867
demands of the United States -- and that the Soviet Union views the blockade

00:10:05.867 --> 00:10:09.933
as an act of aggression, and that their ships will be instructed to ignore it."

00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:13.448
So the game of chicken is beginning to emerge.

00:10:13.448 --> 00:10:15.468
The United States if just saying "Look, this is unacceptable.

00:10:15.468 --> 00:10:17.767
We're gonna stop you from shipping arms to Cuba."

00:10:17.767 --> 00:10:21.533
On the 24th, Khrushchev is saying "Who are you to tell us what to do?"

00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:25.005
and, you know, there's this kind of under current like, "Wait, you've already got stuff set up

00:10:25.005 --> 00:10:30.667
in Italy and Turkey, not too far from us. How can you dare..." -- (you know, and they call it

00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:33.133
a blockade, even though the US is calling it a quarantine) --

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.867
"this is an act of aggression and we will ignore it."

00:10:35.867 --> 00:10:37.133
So both parties are kind of saying,

00:10:37.133 --> 00:10:40.360
"We don't care what you're gonna do. We're gonna do what whatever we have to do"

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.772
And this whole time, both sides are getting tense,

00:10:44.772 --> 00:10:49.067
the whole world is kind of taking sides, they're making public statements about what's right or wrong.

00:10:49.067 --> 00:10:55.400
So, we really are getting very close to the brink of a very major confrontation between

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.869
the Soviet Union and the United States.

00:10:56.869 --> 00:10:59.733
And you know, you can read the book "13 Days - Robert Kennedy",

00:10:59.733 --> 00:11:02.698
there's also the movie "13 Days," which actually is not based on the book.

00:11:02.698 --> 00:11:07.783
But both of them really kind of give the account of what happened over this period.

00:11:07.783 --> 00:11:11.200
But then you fast forward to the 25th and Kennedy essentially replies,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.867
"Look, these are offensive weapons and these require the responses I have announced.

00:11:16.867 --> 00:11:20.467
I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit restoration of the earlier

00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:25.267
situation." Ok, so he's saying - "Look, we have to do this. These are offensive weapons.

00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:28.867
We cannot tolerate these weapons so close to US borders.

00:11:30.445 --> 00:11:32.133
And so, also on the 25th, the quarantine is in effect.

00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:33.600
It does get challenged.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.690
The US does start to inspect some ships. They try to inspect one ship that got away a little bit.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:43.267
So the Soviets, even though they're speaking the game of chicken,

00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:49.439
they are turning back. They did turn back 14 ships. And the best guess is that those 14 ships

00:11:49.439 --> 00:11:51.800
probably did contain some type of armament.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.267
So even though, publicly, everyone is playing a very strong game,

00:11:55.267 --> 00:11:59.667
behind the scenes, there is a little bit of a softening of the stance.

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:06.947
And then you fast forward to the 26th, and Khrushchev essentially sends his first proposal.

00:12:06.947 --> 00:12:12.533
And it's interesting here. Because, in Khrushchev's mind -- (And this is a fascinating letter to read.

00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:16.351
It's a fairly long letter, so I'm not gonna go into the whole thing and you can get it at this URL right

00:12:16.351 --> 00:12:19.400
over here. It's a fascinating letter. Maybe I'll do a whole video where I just read this letter.)

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.200
He kind of goes into the nuance of what he views as a defensive or an offensive weapon.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.733
He implicitly admits that the missiles are there --

00:12:28.733 --> 00:12:31.282
That they're not these benign weapons.

00:12:31.282 --> 00:12:35.333
But, in his letter, he kind of makes the nuance that he'd use them as defensive weapons.

00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:39.733
He says: "Look, you guys attempted to oust Castro already.

00:12:39.733 --> 00:12:44.754
We view Castro as an ally. We think that by placing these weapons here, that you will be less

00:12:44.754 --> 00:12:48.800
likely to be able to oust Castro, because you will be afraid of these weapons."

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:54.455
So, Khrushchev is kind of setting up-- Kruschev is saying, "We don't have the intention of using these to attack

00:12:54.455 --> 00:12:59.401
you for no reason. We're just putting these here to essentially defend one of our allies."

00:12:59.401 --> 00:13:00.701
So he's saying that's the reason.

00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:03.800
That's the reason that they placed those weapons there in the first place.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.667
He's kind of saying "Look, you did Bay of Pigs. You were the ones that took the first shot.

00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:08.267
Now we are defending it."

00:13:08.267 --> 00:13:10.533
That might have been the rationale.

00:13:10.533 --> 00:13:15.133
Another rationale for why they did it -- and it's just, and probably the more strategic rationale --

00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:20.087
is that we already did have these missiles that were pointed at the Soviet Union in

00:13:20.087 --> 00:13:23.800
Turkey and Italy. And the Soviet Union just wanted to have parity.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.133
So, they wanted to put missiles near the US [in] some ally's country, from the Soviet Union's

00:13:29.133 --> 00:13:29.935
point of view.

00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:35.113
So, on the 26th, Khrushchev's first proposa,l that was given through a cable, says:

00:13:35.113 --> 00:13:38.400
"If assurances were given by the President and the Government of the United States

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.870
that the USA itself would not participate..." - so 'assurances'...

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:47.118
(Let me underline this in a different color.) --

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:53.527
"assurances that the USA itself would not participate in an attack on Cuba, and would restrain others

00:13:53.527 --> 00:13:57.400
from actions of this sort" -- probably the Cuban exiles --

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.600
"... if you would recall your fleet, this would immediately change everything.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.267
I am not speaking for Fidel Castro, but I think that he and the government

00:14:04.267 --> 00:14:07.807
of Cuba evidently would declare demobilization and would appeal to the people

00:14:07.807 --> 00:14:10.733
to get down to peaceful labor. Then, too, the question of--"

00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:13.403
(And, you know, the Communists always like talking about "labor.") --

00:14:13.403 --> 00:14:18.372
"then, too, the question of armaments would disappear, since, if there is no threat,

00:14:18.372 --> 00:14:20.467
then armaments are a burden for every people."

00:14:20.467 --> 00:14:23.527
So in this first proposal that came over a cable, he's essentially saying:

00:14:23.527 --> 00:14:28.542
"Look, if you guys just promise not to attack Cuba, if you just make 'assurances' that

00:14:28.542 --> 00:14:31.333
you will not attack Cuba, then we'll essentially undo everything.

00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:35.601
We'll give in to your wishes."

00:14:35.601 --> 00:14:38.667
And this stance right here really does make it look like

00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:42.707
their main interest in having those missiles was, kind of, to protect Cuba --

00:14:42.707 --> 00:14:47.067
so that the US would not try to oust the Communists from there.

00:14:47.067 --> 00:14:52.800
But then on the next day, Khrushchev has a public broadcast

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.133
where he kind of changes his tone a little bit.

00:14:55.133 --> 00:15:01.533
Now he's saying that they would undo the situation in Cuba only if the United States removed

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:03.733
their missiles from Italy and Turkey.

00:15:03.733 --> 00:15:05.369
So, he's sending little mixed messages.

00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:07.622
His first message was kind of a softer stance:

00:15:07.622 --> 00:15:11.400
"Look, you guys just promise not to invade Cuba and we're gonna pull out of Cuba."

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.958
The second stance is saying: "No, no. We're only gonna take our missiles out of Cuba

00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.800
if you take your missiles out of Italy and Turkey."

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.733
And on the same day, another U2 spy plane gets shot down over Cuba.

00:15:24.733 --> 00:15:30.029
This is when both armies are really at, kind of, they're at hair-trigger notice,

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:35.133
it's a really scary situation. And this was actually done by-- It was a local decision by a Soviet commander.

00:15:35.133 --> 00:15:38.333
(And Khrushchev actually did not want this to happen.)

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:43.800
And lucky for, I guess, the world, the US did not use this, alone, as

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.400
a reason to engage in war. They said: "Maybe it's an accident. If this happens again,

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.626
then we'll use it as [a pretext for] war."

00:15:49.626 --> 00:15:54.340
So it was lucky that this did not trigger an immediate war with the Soviets.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:59.333
But the Kennedy Administration still had the question: "Which of these was a more serious,

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:03.800
you know, which of these requests were the Soviets really making?

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.533
This is a more significant request.

00:16:05.533 --> 00:16:07.622
Are they requesting for both?

00:16:07.622 --> 00:16:10.362
And so it was eventually decided, on the 27th, that:

00:16:10.362 --> 00:16:15.215
"Hey, let's just pretend like we didn't even know -- that the Americans didn't even know about

00:16:15.215 --> 00:16:19.067
the second request that asked for more -- and let's just reply to this first request."

00:16:19.067 --> 00:16:22.467
So, you essentially have Kennedy agreeing [with] Khrushchev, and saying:

00:16:22.467 --> 00:16:30.133
"Ok, we'll do your first request. We will agree not to invade Cuba if you remove your missiles."

00:16:30.133 --> 00:16:34.371
And then, essentially, what happens--.
And that puts Khrushchev in a weird situation.

00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:38.400
(Because this is something that he did recommend. But they were ignoring this over here.)

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.800
But through back channels we said "Well, we'll offically agree to this."

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.067
But through back channels the Kennedy administration said: "And we would

00:16:44.067 --> 00:16:47.133
also be on an understanding,

00:16:47.133 --> 00:16:51.467
we will also have an understanding on the missiles in Italy and Turkey."

00:16:51.467 --> 00:16:56.616
That, "Look, this isn't part of the deal, but we see what you're saying and we're probably,

00:16:56.616 --> 00:16:58.933
we're probably going to remove them."

00:16:58.933 --> 00:17:03.200
And what the Soviets also didn't know at that time is that the Americans were planning on --

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.135
that these missiles, to a large degree, by this point in time, were already obsolete.

00:17:07.135 --> 00:17:10.400
Because we already Polaris missiles that were deployable by submarines.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.635
And clearly, submarines can deploy things much closer to the action, and they're much harder to track.

00:17:14.635 --> 00:17:16.887
You can't surveil them and all the rest.

00:17:16.887 --> 00:17:20.133
So the US kind of agreed to it. But they did it secretly.

00:17:20.133 --> 00:17:23.800
And the whole point here is that neither side wanted to look like they're giving in.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.000
Neither side wanted to look weak.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.766
But on the 28th, there was finally an agreement. And so, publicly,

00:17:29.766 --> 00:17:35.667
the first Khrushchev proposal was agreed to by both Khrushchev and the United States.

00:17:35.667 --> 00:17:38.900
Khrushchev agreed to remove --

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.475
to not send any more weapons, and also dismantle the weapons that were there,

00:17:42.475 --> 00:17:46.993
and the Americans agreed that they would not invade Cuba.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.232
So you can imagine the big winner here.

00:17:49.232 --> 00:17:52.901
The big winner here is probably Fidel Castro, because the whole time he's paranoid that

00:17:52.901 --> 00:17:56.733
the US is planning another attack on him. And, at least publicly now, they're saying

00:17:56.733 --> 00:18:00.533
that they cannot invade him. And if they did, it would like they're going back on their word.

00:18:00.533 --> 00:18:02.892
And privately,

00:18:02.892 --> 00:18:06.555
the US agreed to remove its missiles from Turkey and Italy.

00:18:06.555 --> 00:18:09.550
They didn't wanna do this publicly, because then it would like they were being weak.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.118
Then it would like the Soviets were able to do this

00:18:13.118 --> 00:18:17.747
aggressive action. And by doing it, they were able to extract something out of the United States.

00:18:17.747 --> 00:18:20.036
Which is actually the reality. They were able to --

00:18:20.138 --> 00:18:25.154
By doing this action, they were able to get these missiles removed from Turkey and Italy.

00:18:25.154 --> 00:18:27.000
But the United States wanted to look strong.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.333
Kennedy has, well -- there's always an approaching election. Especially after the Bay of Pigs,

00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:33.583
he needed to look like a strong leader.

00:18:33.583 --> 00:18:38.133
And so, to some degree, you have to give Khrushchev credit for this. He kind of swallowed

00:18:38.133 --> 00:18:42.569
his pride and allowed it to publicly look like he lost the negotiation.

00:18:42.569 --> 00:18:46.330
He publicly made it look like he got nothing in return for backing down,

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.933
but in reality he did. He just didn't necessarily get credit for it.

00:18:49.933 --> 00:18:57.000
But this was a big deal. Because this was the closest that the Soviet Union and the US ever got to

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.975
really the brink during the Cold War.
