00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.050
Let's do a few more examples of
seeing if either an atom or

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.990
an entire molecule is chiral.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.640
So here I have a molecule.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.810
Let's see if we can identify
any chiral centers, or any

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.060
chiral atoms, or asymmetric
carbons, all words for the

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.640
same thing, although I guess you
could have chiral centers

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.960
that aren't necessarily carbon,
but it tends to be

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.660
carbon most of the time,
especially in Organic

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.010
Chemistry class.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.160
So if we look here, the one that
kind of jumps out, this

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.460
carbon right here is
bonded to three

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.400
hydrogens and another carbon.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.590
So this is obviously not going
to be a chiral center.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.710
It's bonded to three
of the same group.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.680
These three guys are all bonded
to two hydrogens each,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.830
so they're all bonded to two
of the same group, so they

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.740
can't be chiral centers.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.620
This carbon right here is bonded
to three hydrogens,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.500
once again, three of the same
group, not going to be a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.500
chiral center.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.670
This one looks interesting.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.430
It looks like it could be a good
candidate it for a chiral

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.330
center, or a chiral carbon,
or an asymmetric carbon.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.430
Over here on the left, it's
bonded to a methyl group, so

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.200
this is a methyl group, and here
on the right, it's bonded

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.590
to a butyl group.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.130
Over here, it's bonded to an OH,
and then over here, it's

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.090
bonded to an H, so this is
definitely a chiral carbon.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.530
We could put a little
asterisk here.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.930
That's how they often denote
that this is a chiral carbon.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.510
And if this doesn't make sense
to you, because you might say,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.200
hey, Sal, look, this carbon is
bonded to two other carbons.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.880
Isn't that the same thing?

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.780
But the point here is that
we're not looking at what

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.690
atoms it's directly bonded to.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.670
We're looking at the groups
that it's bonded to.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.720
In this case, this hydrogen
is a group and an atom.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.220
Over here, it's an
entire group.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.670
It's an entire butyl group.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.160
We have four carbons here.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.410
We only have one over here.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.680
Another way to think about it,
we could have drawn this

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.100
molecule like this.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.590
We could have had a carbon in
the center, and maybe this

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.075
methyl group is popping
out like this.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.550
You have your CH3, and then you
would have this hydrogen

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.740
coming out maybe in the plane,
and then behind it, you would

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.930
have the butyl group.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.520
So kind of the back leg of the
tripod, you'd have a butyl,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.810
and what is that?

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.670
That's C4H9, right?

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.550
That's six plus-- C4H9, so it's
C4H9 in the back, and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.480
then above it, you
have your OH.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.480
Above it, in a different color,
you have your OH.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.500
And when you look at it like
this, it looks just like the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.100
other chiral carbons that we had
identified in actually the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.640
last video.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.720
It looks very similar to
something like this.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.500
And when you take its
mirror image,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500
this is the same molecule.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.100
Here, I kind of made it a
little bit more three

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.100
dimensional, but if you take
the mirror image of either

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.160
one, you're going to find that
no matter how you try to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.375
rotate it or shift it, you won't
be able to superimpose

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:06.600
it on its mirror image
for the same reasons

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.060
as the other ones.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.710
And I challenge you
to, if you can.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.690
So this is a chiral carbon.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:22.300
This is a chiral center,
we could say.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.800
Or we could even call it
an asymmetric carbon.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.150
It could be considered
a stereocenter or

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.360
a stereogenic center.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.070
All of those are valid
things to call this

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.760
carbon right there.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.770
And this is also a
chiral molecule.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.030
Now let's look at this blue
example right here.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.280
And if we wanted to name it,
just so we get a little bit of

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.860
review, we could start at this
fluorine right there: one,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.350
two, three, four, five.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.140
This is what?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.600
This is 1,
3-difluorocyclopentane.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.550
So that was a nice
review of naming.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.839
But let's think about whether
we have any chiral centers

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.370
here and whether the molecule
as a whole is chiral.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.930
So the immediate ones that we
can kind of dismiss-- and

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.940
actually let me get rid of this
numbering because I don't

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.850
want you think that there are
somehow three hydrogens there.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.370
That was the number three
hydrogen, number three carbon,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.390
number two carbon, and so on so
forth, But let me get rid

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.065
of them now that we've
named the molecule.

00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:42.800
I don't want to confuse how many
hydrogens we have at any

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.520
of these points.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.930
So let's look at the carbons.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.720
Well, we could immediately
dismiss that carbon, that

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.700
carbon, and that carbon, because
each of those are

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.990
bonded to two hydrogens.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.100
If we wanted to break it out,
they would look like this.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.330
So they're bonded to carbons,
carbons, and then they're

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.750
bonded to hydrogens.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.300
Now, these might be
different groups.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.310
These might be different types
of alkane groups that it's

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.610
bonded to, so that doesn't
necessarily throw it out of

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.210
the running.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.970
But these two, the two hydrogens
that it's bonded to,

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.410
are definitely the same
atom, the same group.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.760
We have an axis of symmetry
through that atom, so it

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.010
cannot be a stereogenic
center.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.220
It cannot be an asymmetric
carbon.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.730
It cannot be a chiral center
or a chiral atom, so we can

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.180
knock those guys out
of the running.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.530
But this guy and that guy
seem pretty interesting.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.960
Because if we were to break it
out a little bit, you could

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.400
break it out like that and break
it out like, so writing

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.380
a CH and actually show the
bond to the hydrogen.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.860
And this guy is bonded to one
hydrogen, one fluorine.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.010
And then if we were to work our
way around the cycle, and

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.580
these cyclic molecules are a
little bit-- it's sometimes a

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.350
little tricky to identify
whether you're bonded to the

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.360
same group or different
groups.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.310
But actually, let me not make
it too messy while we try to

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.340
figure this out.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.820
To figure out whether it's
bonded to the same group,

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.750
let's kind of take a walk around
the cycle, around the

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.630
cyclopentane ring.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.960
If we go this way, if we go on
a counter-- we'll do it in

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.170
different color.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.960
If we go in a counterclockwise
direction from the carbon in

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.610
question, we're going
to hit a CH2.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.020
Then we're going to hit a CH.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.080
So we're going to hit a CH2,
then we're going to hit a CH.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.163
If we go this way, we're going
to hit a CH2 and then we're

00:06:30.163 --> 00:06:31.610
going to hit another CH2.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.980
So this guy is fundamentally--
this bond is bonded to a

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.760
different group than that
bond up there is.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.230
It's also bonded to a hydrogen,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.160
also bonded to a fluorine.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.600
So this is bonded to four
different groups, so this is a

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.980
chiral carbon, so that
is a chiral center.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.870
Now, the exact same argument
can be made for this carbon

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.300
right here.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.610
You can make that exact same
argument, that, look, if you

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.890
were to walk counterclockwise
from this, you'd hit a CH2,

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.050
then a CH2.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.800
If you were to go clockwise,
you'd have CH2, then a CH,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.830
which happens to be connected
to a fluorine.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.730
So you're actually going to
see something different,

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.190
depending whether you're going
down into that group or into

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.970
that group.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.250
And then it's also bonded to a
hydrogen and a fluorine, four

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.180
different groups.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.440
This is also a chiral center.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.510
Another way to think about it,
and it's actually interesting

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.110
to compare it to this molecule
up here, which was not chiral

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.350
and did not have a chiral
center, this molecule up

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.830
here-- let me draw it a little
different to make it a little

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.080
bit more clear.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.400
So this one, I could
draw it like this.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.930
If you have the chlorine like
that, over here, we thought

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.290
about this as a potential chiral
center, and it's kind

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:59.050
of playing the same role as in
that example down here, but

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.110
you see over here, this is not
a chiral center because

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.050
there's actually an axis of
symmetry for this molecule

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.260
that goes through that carbon.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.980
So you can actually just draw an
axis of symmetry that goes

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.910
exactly through that carbon.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.600
The way I drew it, it's not
completely neat, but you can

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.920
see that that is the reflection
of that, if I were

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.020
to draw the bonds actually a
little bit more symmetric.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.050
Over here, if we try to do the
exact same thing, if we try to

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.170
draw an axis of symmetry over
here, if we try to draw an

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.370
axis of symmetry, we can make
that bond to the fluorine go

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.080
through our axis of symmetry,,
we'll see that that still is

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.212
not the reflection of
this because we have

00:08:36.212 --> 00:08:37.330
a fluorine up here.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.320
We don't have a fluorine
over here.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.039
Now, we can do the same
thing with this end.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.230
If you try to do an axis of
symmetry, fluorine up there,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.980
no fluorine over here.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.790
So each of these are definitely
chiral centers,

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:53.700
while this carbon up here
was not a chiral center.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.940
Now, the next question is, well,
this thing's got two

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.880
chiral centers, two
chiral carbons.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.510
It's probably a chiral
molecule.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.440
Everything else we've seen so
far, if you had a chiral

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.130
center, you had a
chiral molecule.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.920
But let's take its
mirror image.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.560
To take its mirror image, let me
clear out some real estate

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.760
over here, So let me
clear out this.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.170
Let me clear it out.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.660
So what's the mirror image
going to look like?

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.000
Let me draw first the mirror.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.800
So the mirror image, you're
going to have a

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.620
fluorine over there.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.920
Then you're going to bond to a
carbon, which is also bonded

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.030
to a hydrogen.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.520
That's going to bond to a CH2.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.670
That's going to bond to a CH.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.390
That's the mirror
image of that,

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.800
which bonds to a fluorine.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.530
That's the mirror
image of that.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.910
And then you go down.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.050
This is the mirror image
of CH2 here.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.320
This is the mirror
image of this.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.640
You connect them.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.080
Now, these are mirror images
of each other.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.020
But they are also the
exact same molecule.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.720
I could just literally move this
guy over to the right,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.650
and it would be superimposed.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.600
They are exactly the same.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.190
So even though we have two
chiral atoms, two chiral

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.770
carbons, the molecule as
a whole is not chiral.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.990
It is a non-chiral molecule.
