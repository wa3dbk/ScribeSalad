00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.250
Let me graph our coordinates
in R2.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.512
So let's see, let me do
it fairly neatly.

00:00:06.512 --> 00:00:09.160
I want to do it neater
than that.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.990
So that is my vertical
coordinate, this is my

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.149
horizontal coordinate.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:16.640
Good enough.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.450
So let's say I have four points
in R2 specified by four

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.445
position vectors.

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:23.390
So this is R2 right here.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.990
So my first position vector
is the zero vector.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.050
So it just specifies the point
right there, so it's 0, 0.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:40.720
My second point is specified the
by the vector say k 1, 0,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.720
so some constant times 0.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.210
Let me write it a little
bit neater than that,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.020
a little bit bigger.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.960
So it's k 1, 0, so that's my
second position vector, which

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.220
would specify that point
right there.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.010
So let me draw my vector
right there.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.190
Let's say my third point
is going to be up here.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.672
As you can, see I'm creating
a rectangle.

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:06.720
Let's say it's specified
by the position vector.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.190
Let me draw the position
vector like that.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.700
And that position vector is
going to be the vector k1.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.020
That's going to be its
horizontal component and then

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.480
k2 is its vertical component.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.005
If we wanted to graph it on the
coordinates, this would be

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:25.140
the k2 coordinate right there.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.870
And let's say that the last
point is this point right

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:39.400
here, and it is specified by
the position vector 0, k2.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.290
And let me define a set.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.770
Let me call that set

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.955
rectangle, say R for rectangle.

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:48.310
Let me just call it Rec.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.680
Let's say that rectangle is
equal to the set of all of the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.260
points when you connect the
points specified by those

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.710
position vectors.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:17.580
So the rectangle formed by
connecting points specified by

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.440
these guys here.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.760
So if we call this vector a,
this is vector b, this is

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.750
vector c, and then this is
vector d right here, so

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.090
rectangle specified
by connecting the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.590
points a, b, c and d.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.500
Now let's say-- so let me draw
what our set rectangle is

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.000
going to be.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.500
It's going to be all of these
points here, all of these

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.960
points there, all of those
points there, and then all of

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.990
those points there, including
our vertices.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.670
So that is my rectangle.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.230
Now, what is the area within
this rectangle?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.610
So this is the area
of rectangle.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.750
What's the area within
this rectangle?

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.680
Well, it's just base
times height.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.330
The base has length k1.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.370
The distance from here to here
is k1, so it's just k1.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.390
And what's the height?

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.470
It's the distance from here
to here, which is just k2.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.820
So it's just k1 times k2.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.310
That's fairly straightforward.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.390
I haven't shown you anything
that fascinating just yet.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.280
But let's say we're going
to transform this set.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.540
We're going to transform this
rectangle and we're going to

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.870
transform it with the
transformation T.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.290
Let me pick a nice
color for T.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.760
Let's say we have the
transformation T.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.540
It is a mapping from R2 to R2,
and it can be represented as--

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.100
so when you apply the
transformation T to some

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:01.960
vector x, it is equal to the
matrix a, b, c, d times your

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.410
vector x, just like that.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.440
Now, let's see what happens
when we apply the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.560
transformation to each
of these points.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.140
We saw many videos ago that if
you want essentially the image

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.880
of our rectangle under this
transformation, you can

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.860
essentially just get the
transformation of each of the

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.200
end points and then connect
the dots in your codomain,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.610
which is also going to be R2.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.820
So we just have to figure out
the transformation of each of

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.020
these guys.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.430
So what is my transformation?

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.740
I'll do it over here.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.670
I'll do it in the colors.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.910
What is the transformation
applied to the zero vector,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.270
applied to point
a right there?

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.860
Well, it's just going to be
a times 0 plus b times 0,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.050
which is just 0.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.010
And then the second term is
going to be c times 0 plus d

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.010
times 0, which is just 0.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.530
That's vector a.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.260
Vector b.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.100
If I apply the transformation
to vector b, vector b is k1,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.740
0, just like that.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.210
If I apply the transformation,
it's going to be a times k--

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.610
so the first entry in the
transformed vector or what

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.880
we're mapping to in our codomain
is going to be a

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.300
times k1 plus b times
0, so it's just ak1.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.980
And then the second entry's
going to be c times k1

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.400
plus d times 0.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.390
So it's going to
be c times k1.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.900
All I'm doing is taking the
matrix vector product of this

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.970
guy and that guy.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.330
And then let's move
on to point c.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:45.330
So the transformation of point
c of k1, k2 is equal to-- or

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.910
the transformation of
vector c, we could

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.760
say, is equal to what?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.980
The first entry's going to be
a times k1 plus b times k2.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.695
a times k1 plus b times k2, and
the second entry's going

00:05:57.695 --> 00:06:00.270
to be c times k1 plus
d times k2.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.220
We have one point left.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.310
The transformation, if we take
the transformation of our

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.730
vector 0, k2, what do we get?

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:22.620
We get a times 0 plus b times
k2, which is just b times k2,

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.900
and then c times 0 plus d times
k2, which is just d

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.780
times k2, just like that.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.260
So let's draw the image of
our rectangle under our

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.735
transformation.

00:06:33.735 --> 00:06:36.760
So let me redraw my axes.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.120
So this is my vertical
axis right there.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.330
This is my horizontal
axis right there.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.250
And so a gets mapped to the
zero vector right there.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:54.440
So this is the transformation
of 0, 0 right like that.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.400
Now, what does the vector
b get transformed?

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.480
The vector b gets transformed
to ak1, ck1, so let me

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.230
draw it like this.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.930
The vector b gets transformed
to something that looks like

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.130
this, where this is the vector--
so this is the

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:20.110
transformation of k1 and 0,
which is equal to ak1, ck1.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.400
We saw that already.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.240
Now, what does this yellow
guy get transformed to?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.490
Let me do the blue one first.
So the blue one gets

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.390
transformed here.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.090
Let me finish here.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.300
So if we come down here,
this is going to

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.340
be ak1 right there.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.090
If we go to the left like that,
that's going to ck1.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.450
That's how we graph it.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.980
Now this last guy, this blue
guy, maybe he looks

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.870
something like this.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.640
This is the transformation of
that vector right there by

00:07:53.640 --> 00:08:00.930
this linear transformation, 0,
k2, which is equal to the

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:10.420
vector bk2 and dk2, so this
point right here is bk2 and

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.320
then this coordinate
right there is dk2.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.660
Now this last guy, this yellow
point, when I transformed it,

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.860
what do I get?

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.700
I get ak1, plus bk2, so ak1 plus
bk2 will get you right

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.620
about there, so that's going
to be its x-coordinate.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.630
And then its y-coordinate
is ck1 plus dk2.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:37.559
So ck1, and then I'm going to
add that much again to it.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.250
So it's going to get me
someplace over here.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.530
So I'm going to add this
distance to this whole

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.400
distance over here, so
I'm going to get

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.670
up here some point.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.620
I'm going to get right
over here.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.180
So that vector's going to look
something like that.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.460
That is the transformation
of k1, k2.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.400
That's the transformation
of that guy.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.180
And then if we connect the
dots, remember, the

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.860
transformation of this set of
this rectangle, or we could

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.000
say the image of this
rectangle under the

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.890
transformation, we just take
each of the points that define

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.310
that rectangle and then
we connect the dots.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.950
We saw that awhile ago.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.000
So let me draw it this way.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.840
This line right here that
connects those two dots will

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.240
be transformed to this line that
connects these two dots

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.950
right there.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.170
This line-- I was going to do
that in a different color.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.640
This line that connects those
two dots is going to be

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.600
transformed to this line that
connects those two dots.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.990
And then we have this line that
connects those two dots

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.230
is going to be transformed to
this line that connects these

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.740
two dots right there.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.610
And then finally, this line that
connects these two dots

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.090
is going to be transformed to
this line that connects these

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.800
two dots right there.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.220
Now, just out of curiosity,
what is-- let

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.380
me just write this.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.510
So this rectangle right
here is the image.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:06.580
We could write this as T of our
rectangle, or if we wanted

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.220
to write it in words, this is
equal to the image of the

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:19.670
rectangle under our
transformation T.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:27.880
Now, what is the area of the
image of our rectangle under

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.570
our transformation?

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.800
What is the area
of this thing?

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.670
What is this area right there?

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.670
Well, we could view this
parallelogram essentially as a

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:45.590
parallelogram generated by this
vector and that vector.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.360
Or if we wanted to write it
another way, if we had a

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.950
matrix, if we had some matrix
whose column vectors are this

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.915
guy and that guy, so let's say,
it's first column vector

00:10:56.915 --> 00:11:03.140
is this guy, so ak1, ck1, And
this one right here, this was

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.780
the transformation of k1, 0.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:12.210
And then its second column
vector is this guy right here,

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:18.810
which was bk2 and dk2.

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:24.330
This parallelogram is a
parallelogram generated by

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.700
these two column vectors.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.610
This was the transformation
right here.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:33.300
This was the transformation
of 0, k2, right?

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.670
And in the last video, we said
that the area of this

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.450
parallelogram is equivalent
to-- let me

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.650
write this right now.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.220
So the area of the
parallelogram, which is the

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.970
same thing as the area of the
image of our original

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.820
rectangle under our
transformation, the area this

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.220
parallelogram is equivalent to
the absolute value-- let me

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.230
call this determinant
right here, let me

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.580
call this I for image.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:07.420
So it's equal to the absolute
value of the determinant of

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.910
the matrix whose column
vectors generate that

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.010
parallelogram.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.800
So it should be equal to the
determinant of the absolute

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.810
value of the determinant of I.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.200
We saw that in the last video.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.720
That's what the area of this
thing is going to be.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.190
Well, what is the determinant
of this?

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.126
Well, this is going to be equal
to-- we've got to keep

00:12:29.126 --> 00:12:30.990
our absolute value signs.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:35.970
So the determinant of this is
ak1 times dk2, so we could

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.480
right this as-- let
me switch colors.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:44.840
We could write it
as k1, k2, ad.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.910
All I did is multiply that term
times that term minus

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.750
this term times that term.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.430
So minus k1, k2, bc.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.930
That's just the definition
of the

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.170
determinant of a 2-by-2 matrix.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.470
We saw this in the last video.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.050
This is nothing new here, or
maybe it might be relatively

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.590
new if you just watched the last
video, but all I'm saying

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.700
is, look, if we want to figure
out this parallelogram, this

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.030
is the parallelogram
generated by that

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.560
vector and that vector.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.840
And if we say that those two
guys are the column vectors of

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.990
some matrix right there, we saw
on the last video that the

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.140
area of this parallelogram is
equal to the absolute value of

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.000
the determinant of
this matrix.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.710
Now, what is the equal to?

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.950
This is equal to-- we can
factor out a k1, k2.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:37.220
So it's the absolute value of
k1, k2 times ad minus bc.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.410
Now what is this equal to?

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:45.530
Well, ad minus bc, that is
the determinant of our

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.590
transformation vector.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.980
So if we say that T of x-- if we
called that vector-- or our

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.610
transformation matrix.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:58.900
If we call this matrix A, if we
call it A, this is equal to

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:05.070
k1, k2 times the determinant
of A, which is a pretty

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.480
interesting takeaway.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.020
What this is telling us is,
look, if I have some region,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.230
or in this case, I just have the
rectangle, but if I have

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.360
some region in my domain and I
apply a transformation, and

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.390
let's say my region
has some area.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.460
Let's say in this case,
it has some area A.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.480
Let me write this
right as area.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.290
This was my original area in
my original region, right?

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.760
And then I apply some
transformation to it where the

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.760
transformation is equal to some
matrix A times any member

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.020
of your domain.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.710
I apply some transformation
to it.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.520
I get some new region.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.170
I get the image of this set
under my transformation.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:57.150
Your new area is going to be
equal to the absolute value of

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.980
the determinant of your
transformation matrix.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.800
That's the determinant of the
transformation matrix.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.365
That's the transformation
matrix.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.050
So it's equal to the
determinant of the

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:17.730
transformation matrix times
the area of your original

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:22.460
rectangle in this case, right?

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.990
This was your original
rectangle.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.500
You take the absolute value,
just because sometimes you

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.540
swap these vectors you might
get a negative sign, so you

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.500
take the absolute value.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.510
But that's a really neat idea.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.630
The determinant of the
transformation matrix is

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:43.020
essentially a scaling
factor on the area

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.420
of a certain region.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.600
Now, I'm not going to prove it
to you here, but you can kind

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.100
of imagine it.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.620
Let's say I have some-- let
me go abstract now.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.960
Let's say I have some region in
R2-- let me do a better--

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.600
let me do a shape that
you might recognize.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.970
Let's say I have something
like that.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.960
Let's say it's an
ellipse, right?

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.210
And this is our domain.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.530
It's R2.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.750
And let's say that the area
here, the area of this region

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.570
right here, is equal to A.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.330
So area is equal to A.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.180
And let's say I have some
transformation T that is a

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:35.800
mapping from R2 to R2 And T is
defined, so T applied to some

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.485
vector x in my domain is equal
to-- well, I already used A,

00:16:39.485 --> 00:16:45.130
so let's say it's equal to some
matrix B times any vector

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.430
in my domain.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.210
If I take the image of this area
under T, so this is my

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.190
domain right here.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.300
Let me do it in the codomain.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.850
Let's say the image of this
under B, let's say it looks

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.860
something like-- or my image
under T-- let's say it looks

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.940
something like this.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.550
I don't know what it's going to
look like, but let's say it

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.800
looks something like this.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:11.060
Let's say it looks something
like that right there, so this

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.490
right here.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.460
So if we call this set-- let
me call it E for ellipse.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.839
That's this whole thing
right here.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.280
This is the ellipse
right there.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.140
This is the image of my
ellipse under the

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.170
transformation T.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.440
If I take every point of this
ellipse, I'll construct this

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.260
right here.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.910
Or I guess maybe just to keep
the analogy straight for this

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.050
example, let's say that the
ellipse is the set of just the

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.820
boundary, but it also applies
actually if you were to fill

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.090
up the whole region.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:46.450
So this is boundary gets
mapped to this

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.380
boundary right here.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.820
But it would have worked
just as well if we

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:49.640
filled up the region.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.900
Since I'm not proving either to
you very rigorously, you'll

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.570
have to accept it as
a leap of faith.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:58.650
So this is the image of this
boundary under our

00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.800
transformation.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.650
And if the area surrounded by
this boundary, or if you could

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:07.570
say the area of this region is
A, then the area here, the

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:13.790
area of the image of our
ellipse under our

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.750
transformation is going to be
equal to the absolute value of

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:22.090
our area, our original area,
right there times the

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:27.565
determinant of our
transformation matrix.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.580
If you find it a little bit of
a big leap to go from just an

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.310
arbitrary rectangle
transformation to maybe these

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.090
more generalized shapes, you
can imagine-- so T is going

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.230
from there to there.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.300
It's always nice to
draw that arrow.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.830
But if you view it as a bit of
a leap to make that jump from

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:52.530
rectangles to curves, you can
imagine this shape to be able

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:58.020
to be constructed by a bunch
of arbitrary rectangles.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.320
So you could essentially fill
this space with a bunch of

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:09.120
arbitrary rectangles like
this, and you could keep

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.970
making them infinitely
small so that you

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.000
completely fill the space.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.730
You completely fill that
space with rectangles.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.180
And if you were to map each of
those rectangles using T, each

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.560
of those rectangles might look
something like this.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.350
Maybe they look something
like this.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.760
I don't know what they'll
look like.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.970
They'll look like a bunch of
parallelograms. Maybe they'll

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.620
look something like that.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.820
I'm not drawing it
that neatly.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.140
They'll look like a bunch of
parallelograms, and they will

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.040
essentially fill this
space right there.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.090
So that's a way you can get your
head around the idea of

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.200
jumping from just the arbitrary
rectangles to these

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.500
arbitrary curves or
shapes or regions.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.310
But this is a pretty neat
outcome, and it's a very

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.850
interesting way to view
a determinant.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.100
A determinant of a
transformation matrix is

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.190
essentially a scaling factor for
area as you map from one

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.560
region to another region, or
as we go from one region to

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.590
the image of that region under
the transformation.
