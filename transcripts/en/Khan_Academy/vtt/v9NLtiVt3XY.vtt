00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.610
A club of nine people wants
to choose a board of three

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.940
officers: a President, a Vice
President, and a Secretary.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.370
How many ways are there
to choose the board

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.430
from the nine people?

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.680
Now, we're going to assume that
one person can't hold

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.760
more than one office.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.910
That if I'm picked for
President, then I'm no longer

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.810
a valid person for Vice
President or Secretary.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.460
So let's just think about the
three different positions.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.750
So you have the President, you
have the Vice President, VP,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.000
and then you have
the Secretary.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.840
Now, let's say that we go for
the President first. It

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.950
actually doesn't matter.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.460
Let's say we were picking the
President slot first and we

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.160
haven't appointed any
other slots yet.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.580
How many possibilities are
there for President?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.360
Well, the club has nine people,
so there's nine

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.990
possibilities for President.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.950
There's going to be nine
possibilities for President.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.090
Now, we're going to pick
one of those nine.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.200
We're going to kind of take them
out of the running for

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.590
the other two offices.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.900
Right?

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.890
Because someone's going to be
President, so one of the nine

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.650
is going to be President.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.300
There's nine possibilities, but
one of the nine is going

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.260
to be President.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.130
So you take that person aside.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.750
He or she is now
the President.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.000
How many people are left
to be Vice President?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.190
Well, now there's only
eight possible

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.510
candidates for Vice President?

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.900
Eight possibilities.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.990
Now he or she also goes aside.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.390
Now how many people are
left for Secretary?

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.210
Well, now there's only seven
possibilities for Secretary.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.720
So if you want to think about
all of the different ways

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.170
there are to choose a board from
the nine people, there's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.550
the 9 for President times the 8
for Vice President times the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.510
7 for Secretary.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.450
You didn't have to
do it this way.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.990
It could've been-- you could've
picked Secretary

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.890
first. Then there would've
been nine choices.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.100
And then you could've picked
Vice President, and there

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.100
would've still been
eight choices.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.680
And then you could've picked
President last, and there

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.800
would've only been
seven choices.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.430
But either way you would've
got 9 times 8 times 7.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:04.400
And that is, let's see, 9 times
8 is 72 times 7 is-- 2

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.130
times 7 is 14, 7 times
7 is 49 plus 1 is 50.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.670
So 504 possible ways to pick
your board out of a club of

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.790
only nine people.
