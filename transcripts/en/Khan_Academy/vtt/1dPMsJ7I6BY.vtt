00:00:09.786 --> 00:00:10.727
In the 16th century,

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:13.043
an Italian mathematician named Cardano

00:00:13.043 --> 00:00:15.651
had a well-known gambling addiction.

00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:17.141
He wrote letters in which he bragged

00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:20.906
about his ability to beat his friends at dice games.

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:22.759
His trick was to place his bets

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.866
using his ideas from mathematics –

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:28.564
instead of hunches or luck.

00:00:28.564 --> 00:00:30.192
He came up with the method of calculating

00:00:30.192 --> 00:00:32.968
the exact probability of random events,

00:00:32.968 --> 00:00:36.391
such as, say, rolling 'snake eyes' – (a pair of 1's).

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:39.807
It is based on a powerful property Cardano noticed.

00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:42.511
Every outcome – no matter how many dice you roll –

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.570
is equally likely.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.566
This allowed him to calculate the probability

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:50.722
by developing what's now called a 'probability space.'

00:00:50.722 --> 00:00:53.785
First, he counts all possible outcomes –

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:55.506
known as the 'sample space.'

00:00:55.506 --> 00:00:59.211
For a single dice, these are the 6 possible faces.

00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:01.881
Then, he defines the event in question –

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:03.338
such as rolling a one –

00:01:03.338 --> 00:01:05.521
which can occur in one way.

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.174
The probability is then found

00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:10.369
by dividing the event by all possible events

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.358
which in this case works out to 1/6.

00:01:13.358 --> 00:01:16.047
Realize the cold, calculating logic here.

00:01:16.047 --> 00:01:17.956
There is no such things as a 'lucky number' –

00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:19.662
no 'divine intervention.'

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:23.840
The probability of rolling any number is exactly 1/6.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.358
Now the same logic applies when we roll multiple dice.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:32.981
Imagine he needed to know the probability of rolling a pair.

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:35.485
First, he'd count the size of the sample space.

00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:36.748
With two dice rolls,

00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:42.056
there are 36 possible outcomes: 6 x 6.

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:47.215
Then, he'd count the number of ways this event can occur.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:50.291
There are six different pairs.

00:01:52.353 --> 00:01:56.992
So, 6 divided by 36 is the probability of rolling a pair –

00:01:56.992 --> 00:01:58.532
also 1/6.

00:01:58.532 --> 00:02:01.088
This simple yet powerful idea allowed Cardano

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:03.199
to bet according to the true probability –

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:04.907
while his opponents placed their bets

00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:08.406
based on hunches and lucky numbers.

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:10.434
Remember, this works with multiple rolls.

00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:11.730
[So,] Imagine we needed to know

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.538
the exact probability of rolling three 1's.

00:02:15.538 --> 00:02:16.884
Simple!

00:02:16.884 --> 00:02:19.404
First, we'd figure out the size of the sample space.

00:02:19.404 --> 00:02:24.533
For three dice, this is 6 x 6 x 6, – or 216.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.886
And there is only one way to roll three 1's,

00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:32.370
so, the probability is 1 divided by 216 (or 1/216).

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.636
This was the trick:

00:02:33.636 --> 00:02:37.492
It was not based on magic, but mathematics.

00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:40.962
Remember, to calculate the probability of a random event –

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:42.242
such as a dice roll –

00:02:42.242 --> 00:02:45.494
you divide the number of ways that event can occur

00:02:45.494 --> 00:02:48.061
by all possible outcomes.
