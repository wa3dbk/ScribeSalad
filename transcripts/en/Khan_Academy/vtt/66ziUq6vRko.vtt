00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.370
This problem asks us, suppose
you isolate an acid from

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.850
clover leaves and know that it
contains only the elements

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.810
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:17.780
Heating 0.513 grams of the
acid in oxygen produces

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.860
points-- let me write these
down or let me underline

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.020
them-- so heating 0.513 grams of
the acid in oxygen produces

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:34.960
0.501 grams of carbon dioxide
and 0.103 grams of water.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.130
What is the empirical formula
for the acid?

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.960
So let's just write
the equation here.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.280
And once again, you can't
balance this equation because

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.860
we don't know how many carbons
or hydrogens or oxygens we

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.700
have in the acid.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.890
But let's just write it
down in general terms.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.610
So we have the acid.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.210
It has x carbons, y hydrogens,
and z oxygens, and we're going

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.760
to heat it in the presence of
an abundance of oxygen.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.610
And when we do that the problem
tells us that this

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.710
produces-- let me do it in
another color-- this produces

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.450
some carbon dioxide
and some water.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.260
And they tell us the amounts
of carbon dioxide and water

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.690
measured in grams, and they
tell us the amount of our

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.630
original substance.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.520
Let me write that here.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.630
So we're heating 0.513 grams
of our original substance.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:41.880
And then that produces 0.501
grams of carbon dioxide, and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.080
0.103 grams of water.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.620
Now we're going to do this
problem very similar to the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.490
way that we've done
the last one.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.590
Remember, we just have figure
out the empirical formula.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.120
We just have to figure out the
ratio, the simplest whole

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.310
number ratios of carbon to
hydrogens to oxygens.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.020
The only thing that makes this
slightly more difficult than

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.360
the last one is we have oxygens
here, and the oxygens

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.220
are kind of mixed in with
the two products.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.260
So we can't just look at the
moles of our two products and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.685
say oh, we must have this
many moles of oxygen.

00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:16.730
What we're going to do here is
we're going to figure out the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.780
moles of carbon dioxide using
this information there.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.120
And that'll tell us the moles of
carbon that must have come

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.970
out of our mystery acid, because
this was the only

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.230
source of carbon
that might have

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.990
generated the carbon dioxide.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.370
Then we're going to use the
water to figure out the moles

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.200
of hydrogen in the product,
which has to be the same as

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.720
the moles of hydrogen in
our mystery substance.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.000
And then we can figure out the
mass of carbon and hydrogen

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.610
out of this 0.513 grams, we'll
be able to figure out because

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.000
we'll know how many moles of
carbon and how many moles of

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.450
hydrogen we started off with.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.420
We'll be able to know their
mass, and then we'll be able

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.880
figure out how many grams of
oxygen we must have had in our

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.790
original substance.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.880
And then we can figure out
the moles from there.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.430
And then figure out
the ratios.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.100
If that confused you, hopefully
just solving through

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.190
it will make a lot more sense.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.810
So first let's just figure out
the moles of carbon in our

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.150
product, and the only product
here that had carbon was the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.200
carbon dioxide.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.380
And that'll tell us how many
moles of carbon we had in our

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.940
original mystery
acid over here.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.310
So we are end up with 0.501
grams of carbon dioxide-- that

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.430
tells us right there.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.500
And we want to convert this into
moles of carbon dioxide.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.550
So we want to multiply this
times moles of carbon dioxide

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.940
per grams of carbon dioxide.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.750
And if you care about
dimensional analysis you know

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.160
that because these grams of
carbon dioxide will cancel

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.580
with these grams of
carbon dioxide.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.000
So how many grams is one
mole of carbon dioxide?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And we've done this
multiple times.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.760
The molar mass of carbon
dioxide-- you have 1 carbon

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.430
plus 2 oxygens, so 16 times 2.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.230
That is 12 plus 32 or 44.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.310
So one mole of carbon dioxide
has 44 grams of carbon

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.610
dioxide, or 44 grams has 1 mole.
but we wrote it moles

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.269
per gram because we want to
cancel out with the grams

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.579
right there.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.300
So let's cancel that out, and
you're going to get 0.501

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.760
divided by 44 moles
of carbon dioxide.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.540
Let's get the calculator out.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:39.970
So we've got 0.501 divided by
44 is equal to 0.-- we have

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.265
three significant digits here,
and this is just a pure number

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:46.190
or pretty close to a pure
number-- so 0.11-- I'll round

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.370
it up to 4-- let me put it on
the side so I don't forget

00:04:51.370 --> 00:05:04.160
this-- so this tells us that we
have 0.0114 moles of carbon

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.340
dioxide in our product.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.280
Now that also tells us for
every molecule of carbon

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.560
dioxide we also have
one atom of carbon.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.730
So however many carbon dioxide
molecules we have, we have

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.390
that same number of carbon.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.970
Remember, a mole is
just a number.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.570
When I say 0.0114 moles I'm
just telling you a number.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.850
So this tells me right there--
I'll stay in blue-- this tells

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.660
me that we also have 0.0114
moles of carbon.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.270
That's what that tells me,
because for every carbon

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.600
dioxide I have a carbon.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.460
And the carbons in the product
all had to come from my

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.950
mystery substance.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.460
So how many grams of this
mystery substance must have

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.410
been carbon?

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.830
Well I had this many
moles of carbon in

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.100
our original reactant.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.800
They all end up over here.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.200
Let's figure out their grams. So
let's multiply-- so times--

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.660
now here we want to do grams per
mole, because we want to

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.160
end up in grams. We want to
cancel out the moles.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.630
We want grams of carbon
per mole of carbon.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.630
And the molar mass of
carbon is 12-- it's

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.330
a good one to memorize.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.170
So we have 12 grams of carbon
per mole of carbon-- we've got

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.880
12 over 1 if you like.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.300
So what does this equal?

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.280
How many grams of carbon are
we dealing with in this

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.150
mystery substance right there?

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.450
Get the calculator back.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.160
So if we multiply-- it's
actually this exact same

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:45.720
number, let's just multiply it
by 12-- so times 12 is 0.137.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.070
So let me write that down.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:59.560
So we have 0.137 grams
of carbon in

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.500
our original reactant.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.010
So of this 0.513 grams
of this mystery acid,

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.570
0.137 grams are carbon.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.010
So that's what we got so far,
so we have two good

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.530
take-aways.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.590
How many moles of carbon we had
over here, and how many

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.180
grams of carbon that
translates to.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.880
Now let's do the same thing
for the hydrogen.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.140
Same drill.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.680
Let's do the hydrogen--
we're using that

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.260
information right there.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:36.020
So we're starting off with 0.103
grams of water, and we

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.060
want to turn this into
moles of water.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:44.270
So let's multiply it times
moles of water

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.180
per grams of water.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.470
Once again, to cancel out the
grams of water, numerator and

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.790
denominator.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.660
And what is the molar
mass of water?

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.340
You have two hydrogens, so it's
2 times 1 plus the molar

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.890
mass of oxygen, which is
16, so it equals 18.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:10.040
So 1 mole of water has 18 grams,
or 18 grams per mole.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.170
But we wrote 18 in the
denominator, because we want

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.070
the grams into the
denominator.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.800
So these cancel out and
we have 0.103 divided

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.090
by 18 moles of water.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.170
Let me get the calculator
back.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:31.640
So we have 0.103 divided
by 18 moles of water.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.460
Let me put this on the side
so I can still see

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.659
it, very bad memory.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:44.900
So this tells us that
we have 0.00572

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:50.600
moles of H2O, of water.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.340
We just converted these grams
into the number of molecules

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.700
that we actually have.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.890
Now if we have this many moles
of H2O, how many moles of

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.360
hydrogen do we have?

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.850
For every molecule of
water we have two

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.400
molecules of hydrogen.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.000
So you multiply that times 2--
so let me do that right here--

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:23.380
so 0.00572 moles of H2O times,
we have 2 moles of hydrogen

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:29.320
for every one mole, I
should say, of H2O.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.740
So we're just going to multiply
this by 2 to get

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.795
moles of hydrogen.

00:09:32.795 --> 00:09:36.420
So let me get back the--
let's multiply it by 2.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:43.600
So times 2 is equal to 0.114.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.880
So this is equal to-- let
me get that back.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.270
I always forget how many
zeros there are, so

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.740
I remember it now.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:10:02.470
OK, so it is equal to 0.0114
moles of hydrogen.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.965
So so far we figured out the
number of moles of carbon in

00:10:05.965 --> 00:10:09.120
our product and its mass that
must have been in the original

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.570
reactant, the mystery
reactant.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.550
And we've done the moles
for the hydrogen.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.550
We have this many moles
of hydrogen.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.870
So we must have started
off with that

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.110
many moles over here.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.470
Let's figure out the
mass of that.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.230
So what is the molar-- we want
to figure out this in grams--

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.590
so times-- the molar mass
of hydrogen, it

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.650
is 1 gram per mole.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.520
So hydrogen's easy--
times 1 gram of

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.000
hydrogen per mole of hydrogen.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.350
I wanted the moles in the
denominator so it cancels out.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.110
Moles cancel with moles.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.710
So we also have-- I'll do it in
that same orange color-- we

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:51.160
also have 0.0114 grams
of hydrogen.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.240
So that's another important
take-away.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.950
Now we have moles of carbon,
moles of hydrogen.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.900
If we can figure out moles of
oxygen in our original acid

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.720
then we can figure out the
smallest whole number ratio

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.580
between them, then we would
be able to find

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.300
our empirical formula.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.580
And to figure out moles of
oxygen we need to first figure

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.850
out how many grams of
oxygen we have here.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.740
And to do that we have a total
of 0.513 grams of this thing.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.840
We subtract out how much of it
is carbon, how much of it is

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.510
hydrogen, and that'll tell
us how much is oxygen.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.690
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.350
So if we want to figure out
how much is oxygen, we

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:40.440
literally just take 0.5-- let me
write 0.513 grams-- let me

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.490
just write this-- minus
the grams of carbon.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.900
So minus 0.137-- let me do in
that same color so you know

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.450
where I'm getting these numbers
from-- minus our grams

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:59.580
of carbon, 0.137 grams of carbon
minus-- I'll do it in

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.130
the same orange color--
minus the-- where's

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.690
our grams of hydrogen?

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:12.280
Minus 0.011-- let me, just so
you get the whole idea.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:18.640
We started off with 513 grams
of acid, whatever it is,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:28.240
minus-- let me write it this way
even better-- CxHyOz minus

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:38.600
our 0.137 grams of carbon,
minus our 0.0114 grams of

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.750
hydrogen, will give us our grams
of oxygen that we're

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.850
dealing with.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.980
So let's figure that out.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.990
Because everything in that
substance, everything in this

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.810
mystery acid right here has
to be either carbon,

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.980
hydrogen, or oxygen.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.820
We know how much is carbon
and hydrogen, the

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.020
leftover has to be oxygen.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:07.220
So we have 0.513 minus 0.137
minus 0.0114 is equal to

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.840
0.36-- I'll just round
it-- 0.365.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:21.570
So this is equal to 0.365
grams of oxygen.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.780
Let me make sure that
I got that right.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.320
Yeah, 0.365 grams of oxygen.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.910
So let's figure out how
many moles this is.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:37.990
So we're starting off, or this
mystery acid has 0.365 grams

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.960
of oxygen, and we want to
convert that to moles.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.480
So times-- we want moles of
oxygen in the numerator, grams

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.800
of oxygen in the denominator,
so they cancel.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.040
And we know the molar mass
for oxygen is 16.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.390
16 grams per mole-- right, the
16 has to match up with the

00:13:54.390 --> 00:14:00.420
grams. So this tells us that
we have 0.365 divided by 16

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.310
grams of oxygen.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.780
So that's the number
right there.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.670
I'll just divide it by 16.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:12.640
So 0.22, I'll say 8
just to round it.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.260
Or 0.0228-- let me put it aside,
I want to make sure I

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.960
don't lose any zeros here.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:26.440
So this tells us that we have
0.0228-- these guys cancel

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.430
out-- moles of oxygen.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.790
We're almost done.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:37.400
We now know, we've now been
able to solve the moles of

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.150
carbon in our original reactant
because all of this

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.840
carbon had to come from here.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.195
We have our moles of hydrogen.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.260
We were able to figure out from
this information because

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.040
all the hydrogen had
to come from here.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.050
And now we know the
moles of oxygen in

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.700
our original reactant.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.760
Our moles, because the leftover
out of this 0.513

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.580
grams had to be oxygen, so we
were able to figure out the

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.920
moles of oxygen.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.100
So let's see if we can figure
out the smallest whole number

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.230
ratio between the three.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.200
So the ratio-- and I'll write
the ratio like this-- we

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.870
have-- let me do it in the same
colors-- we have 0.114

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:24.690
moles of carbon, to--
and then we have

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:30.380
0.0114 moles of hydrogen.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.750
These look nice, they're
actually the same numbers.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:38.280
So we're going to have a 1:1
ratio, to-- then we have the

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:45.840
oxygen, 0.0228 moles
of oxygen.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.180
And this looks like exactly
twice times that.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.160
So if we divide everything, if
we divide-- this is a ratio,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.190
this is another way of writing
the ratio-- if we divide

00:15:54.190 --> 00:16:02.260
everything by 0.114-- let
me be careful here.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.710
This up here was 0.0114
moles of carbon.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.310
So this was a 0 over here.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.170
Let me clear it out.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.942
I want to be nice
and neat here.

00:16:13.942 --> 00:16:17.260
So let me clear this.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.530
I'm always afraid that I'm going
to lose a zero here.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:24.590
Our moles of carbon
was 0.0114.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.530
So let's divide everything by
this amount because that is

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.000
kind of the smallest number of
moles, and that's exactly that

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.910
number there.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.190
Do that in white.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:43.640
So you divide by 0.0114,
0.0114, 0.0114,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.140
and what do you get?

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.030
What does this turn into?

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:51.810
This turns into-- this is just
a 1-- so this is 1 mole of

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.350
carbon for every-- this is
just a 1 right here-- for

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.110
every-- I'll do it in the orange
color-- for every 1

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:05.849
mole of hydrogen-- for every--
this is exactly 2, right?

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.410
228 divided by 140, that's 2.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:13.480
This is exactly 2-- for every
2 moles of oxygen.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.400
So that tells us our empirical
formula for our mystery acid.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.920
It must be-- we don't know the
molecular formula, but we know

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.619
the simplest ratios, whole
number ratios-- it must be 1

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:29.110
carbon for every 1 hydrogen, and
for every 1 carbon and 1

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.800
hydrogen we must
have 2 oxygens.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.540
So it's CHO2.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.660
That is the empirical formula
for our mystery acid.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.830
Hopefully you found that fun.
