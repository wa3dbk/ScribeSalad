00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
Most cells in the human body
just go about their business

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.320
on a daily basis in a fairly
respectable way.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.960
Let's say that I have
some cell here.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.250
This could be maybe a skin cell
or really any cell in any

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.480
tissue in the body.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.370
As that tissue is growing or
it's replacing dead cells, the

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.080
cells will experience mitosis
and replicate themselves, make

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.330
perfect copies of each other.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.680
And then those two maybe will
experience mitosis, and then

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.590
if they realize that, gee, you
know, it's getting a little

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.330
bit crowded.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.840
There are other cells
in my neighborhood.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.880
They'll recognize that, and say,
you know, I'm going to

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.190
stop growing a little bit.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.560
That's called contact
inhibition.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.290
And so they'll just
start growing.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.670
And then let's say one of them
experiences a little defect,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.800
and he says, you know what, gee,
something's a little bit

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.730
wrong with me.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.270
I, the cell, recognize this in
myself, and the cells will

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.250
actually kill themselves.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.770
That's how good of cellular
citizens they are.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.060
They'll kind of make way for
other healthy cells.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.840
So this guy might even kill
himself if he realizes that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.920
there's something
wrong with him.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.110
There's actually a cellular
mechanism that does that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.170
called apoptosis.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.255
And I want to make
this very clear.

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:19.540
This isn't some type of outside
influence on the cell.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.860
The cell itself recognizes that
it's somehow damaged and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.550
it just destroys itself,
so apoptosis.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.870
So that's the regular
circumstance even when there

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.000
is a mutation.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.590
And just to give you an idea,
even if mutations are

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.880
relatively infrequent.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.780
And I don't know the exact
frequencies at

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.940
which mutations occur.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.780
I suspect it's of different
frequencies in different types

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.640
of tissues.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.000
There are on the order
of 100 billion.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.830
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.160
There are on the order of 100
billion new cells in the human

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.750
body per day.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.280
So even if a mutation only
occurs one in a million times,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.860
you're still dealing with
roughly 100,000 mutations, and

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.169
maybe most of the mutations,
maybe they're just some little

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.980
random things that don't
really do a lot.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.990
But if the mutations are a
little bit more severe, the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.480
cell will recognize it
and destroy itself.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.890
And I want to make a very
clear point here.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.510
I'm talking about the cells of
the body or most of the body.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.900
This could be the cells in my
eye or the cells in my brain

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.710
or the cells on my leg.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.100
These aren't my germ cells.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.430
So these mutations, even if the
cell survives, will not be

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.260
passed on to my offspring.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.390
That's an entirely different
discussion when

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.100
we talk about meiosis.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.260
These are all my body cells and
they're replicating, and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.500
we've gone over this
with mitosis.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.480
So any mutations here, they'll
either do nothing, or the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.590
cells might malfunction a little
bit, or the cells might

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.020
hurt themselves or hurt me,
but they're not going to

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.430
affect my offspring.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.230
And I want to make that
point very clear.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.390
Now, you're saying, hey, Sal,
100 billion new cells a day?

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.780
That must mean like every cell
in my body has created, well

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.830
that just gives you an idea of
how many cells we have. We

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.170
actually have on the order of,
and you know it's obviously

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.010
not an exact number, but
actually in the human body,

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.940
there's on the order of
100 trillion cells.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.610
And if you look at it that way,
you say on average, one

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.600
thousandth of your cells
replicate each day, but the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.700
reality is some cells don't
replicate that frequently at

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.950
all and some cells replicate
much more frequently.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.480
Just to take a little side note
here, this gives you an

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.040
appreciation, I think, for the
complexity of the human body.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.940
I mean we think of our own
world economy and world

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.470
society as so complex, it's made
up of 6 billion humans.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.460
We're made up of 100
trillion cells.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.780
Let me rewrite 100 trillion
in billions.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:03.560
100 trillion can be rewritten
as 100,000 billion cells.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.440
And each one of those 100,000
billion cells are these huge--

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.010
I know I shouldn't use the word
huge-- but they're these

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.890
complex ecosystems in and of

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.959
themselves with their nucleuses.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.110
And we'll talk about all the
different organelles they

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.120
have, and we talked about
cellular replication, DNA

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.140
replication and how the
cell replicates.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.190
So these things aren't jokes
and they have all of these

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.580
complex membranes that take
things into them.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.150
They are creatures to
themselves, but they live in

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.550
this complex environment or
society that is each of us.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.020
So that's just a side note just
to appreciate how large

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.790
and how complex we are.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.030
But you can imagine, and this
is how I got off on this

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.090
tangent, if we're making on the
order of 100 billion new

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.140
cells every day, you're going
to have a lot of mutations,

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.820
and maybe some of the mutations,
you know I said

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.030
some of them don't
do anything.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.530
Some of them, the cell
recognizes that the cell is

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.140
just going to be kind of dead
weight so the cell kind of

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.240
eliminates itself.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.370
But every now and then, you have
mutations where the cell

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.220
doesn't eliminate itself and
it also deforms the cell.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.780
So when you have that, let's
say I have some cell here.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.280
I have some cell and it's
got some mutation.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.320
I'll do that mutation with
a little x right here.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.550
That's in its DNA.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.180
Maybe it's got a couple
of mutations.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.510
So one of the mutations keeps
it from experiencing

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.460
apoptosis, or destroying itself,
and maybe one of the

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.090
mutations makes it replicate
a little bit

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.610
faster than its neighbors.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.340
So this cell, through mitosis,
it makes a bunch of copies of

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.130
itself or a ton of
copies of itself.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.490
And this kind of body of cells
that essentially has a defect,

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.060
they're all from one original
cell that kept duplicating and

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.050
then those duplicating, but all
these are defective cells.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.910
If you were to look at them
compared to the tissue around

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.870
it, it would look abnormal
in some way.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.850
Maybe it wouldn't function
properly.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.100
This is called a neoplasm.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.910
Now, a lot of neoplasms,
well they don't have to

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.910
form a body like this.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.570
Sometimes they might somehow
circulate in the body, but

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.200
most of the time they form
this kind of big lump.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.080
And if they get large enough,
they're noticeable.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.230
And that's when we
call it a tumor.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.990
So if this is actually a lump
of kind of differentiated

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.290
tissue that's definitely
abnormal, that's

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.730
what you call a tumor.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.360
So the term neoplasm and
tumor are often used

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.070
interchangeably.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.900
Tumor is the word we use more
in our everyday vocabulary.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.900
Now, if this lump just kind of
grows to a certain size, it's

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.640
just there, it doesn't really
do anything dangerous, it's

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.470
not replicating out
of control.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.380
I guess it's not replicating
a lot faster than its

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.690
neighboring cells and it's
just hanging out, maybe

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.340
growing a little bit, but not in
any significant way harming

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.340
our environment, we
call that a benign

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.780
tumor or a benign neoplasm.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.530
And benign essentially
means harmless.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.155
Benign tumor.

00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:23.810
That means that's good.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.610
You want to hear that.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.380
If you got a lump-- God forbid
you have a lump either way--

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.990
but if you do and it's a benign
tumor, that means that

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.690
lump, it can kind of stick
around, no damage done.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.400
But if these DNA mutations, and
maybe some of these are,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.400
it is benign, but maybe one of
the benign ones has another

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.255
mutation in it that starts
making it grow like crazy.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.320
And not only does it
grow like crazy,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.776
but it becomes invasive.

00:07:51.776 --> 00:07:55.330
And invasive means that
it doesn't care what's

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.630
going on around it.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.480
It just wants to infiltrate
everything.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.080
So let's say that guy
grows like crazy.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.430
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.700
And he starts infiltrating
other

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.280
tissue, so he's invasive.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.810
So super growth,
he's invasive.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.560
So he doesn't care
what's going on.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.430
He's all of a sudden turned into
some type of a cellular

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.420
psychopath.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.550
And even worse, his descendants,
it's not just one

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.980
cell anymore.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.520
He just keeps duplicating and
passing on this kind of broken

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.760
genetic information that makes
it want to replicate.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.610
And then maybe there could be
more and more things that

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:41.520
break down in its I guess
offspring or the DNA that

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.130
comes from its replications.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.390
And actually, that's a good
likelihood, because the same

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.730
parts of its DNA that broke
down, some of the DNA that

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.060
broke down in this guy, some
of the mutations might have

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.040
actually hurt the DNA
replication scheme, so that

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.240
mutations become
more frequent.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.660
So more frequent mutations.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.340
So as these replicate, more and
more mutations appear, and

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.710
then maybe eventually one of
the mutations appears that

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.010
allows these cells to break off
and then travel to other

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.260
parts of the body.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.320
And then those parts of the body
start to take over and

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.190
start taking over all
of the cells.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.500
And this process is called the
cell has-- this is one of the

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.770
hardest words for me to say,
something wrong with my

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.970
brain-- but the cell
has metastasized.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.710
You might have heard the word
metastasis, and that's just

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.470
the notion of these run amok
cells all of a sudden being

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.810
able to travel to different
parts of the body.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.790
And I think you guys know what
we call these cells.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.890
These cells that aren't
respecting their cellular

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.310
neighborhood.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.960
They're growing like crazy.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.690
They don't experience that
contact inhibition.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.940
They're invasive.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.580
They start crowding out
other cells and

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.040
hogging up the resources.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.290
And they keep mutating really
fast because they have all of

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.050
these genetic abnormalities.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.150
And eventually they might even
break away and start

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.940
infiltrating other parts
of the body.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.985
These are cancers
or cancer cells.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.100
And so you might have
an appreciation for

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.100
why this is so hard.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.240
Cancer is such a hard disease
to quote, unquote, cure.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.610
Because it really isn't
just one disease.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.690
It's not like one type of
bacteria or one type of virus

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.440
that you can pinpoint and
say let's attack this.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.800
Cancer is a whole class of
mutations where the cells

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.250
start exhibiting this fast
invasive growth and this

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.620
metastasis.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.520
So you might look at one type of
cancer and be able to say,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.700
hey, let's target the mutation
where the cells look like this

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.020
and you're able to knock
out some of them.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.720
Let me do this in this color.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.300
So maybe you're able to
knock out that guy,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.160
that guy, that guy.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.030
But because their DNA
replication system might be

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.160
broken in some way, they
continue to mutate, so

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.790
eventually you have one version
that's able to not be

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.590
knocked out by whatever
method you get.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.200
And so you have this kind of new
form of cancer, and then

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.180
that new form of cancer is
even harder to kill.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.210
So you can imagine that
cancer is kind of a

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.490
never ending fight.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:20.820
And you kind of have to attack
the general idea behind it.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.770
Chemotherapy and radiation, all
of these type of things.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.390
They try to attack things that
are fast growing because

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.920
that's the kind of
one common theme

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.030
behind all of the cancers.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.810
And we could do a whole playlist
on what cancer is and

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.400
how people are attacking it, but
I wanted to at least show

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.860
you in this video that cancer
really is just a byproduct of

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:46.510
broken mitosis, or even more
specifically, broken DNA

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.540
replication.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:53.100
That we have all of these cells
replicating themselves

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.450
every day on the order of 100
billion, and every now and

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.960
then something breaks.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.650
Usually when they break, either
nothing happens or the

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.010
cell kills itself.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.960
But every now and then, the
cells start replicating even

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.450
though they're broken.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.480
And sometimes they start
replicating like crazy.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.070
If they just replicate, but
they're really not doing any

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.720
harm, it's benign.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.730
But if they start replicating
like crazy, taking over

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.950
resources and spreading through
the body, you're

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.410
dealing with a cancer.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.980
So hopefully, you found
that interesting.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.380
You already know a good bit of
the science that kind of deals

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.680
with what is probably one of
the worst ailments that we

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.470
deal with as creatures.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.150
I mean, obviously, we're not
the only people who can

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.990
experience cancers.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.340
Even plants have cancers.
