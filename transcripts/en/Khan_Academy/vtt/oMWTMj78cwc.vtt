00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
Let's say we have three
matrices, A, B, and C.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.850
And let's say that B and C are
both m by n matrices, and that

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.280
A is a, let's call it
a k by m matrix.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.830
And what I want to do is figure
out whether matrix

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.730
products exhibit the
distributive property.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.340
So let's test out A
times B plus C.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.480
And of course these
are all matrices.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.770
So B, just to make things clear,
the matrix B could be

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.080
represented as just a bunch of
column vectors, B1, B2, all

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.030
the way to Bn.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.630
And the matrix C can also be
represented as just a bunch of

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.160
column vectors.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.860
So could the matrix A,
but I don't have to

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.410
draw that just yet.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410
So the matrix C could just be
represented as a bunch of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.090
column vectors, C1, C2,
all the way to Cn.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.270
Maybe I should've drawn
this taller.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.200
These are column vectors, so
they actually have some

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.510
verticality to them.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.030
I think you've seen that
multiple times.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.830
So what is A times B plus C?

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.760
Well, let's figure out
what B plus C is.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.590
This is equal to A
times B plus C.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.450
When you add B plus C, the
definition of matrix addition

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.810
is, you just add the
corresponding columns.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.030
Which essentially boils
down to adding the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.040
corresponding entries.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.380
So the first column is going
to be equal to B1 plus C1.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.770
The second column is going
to be B2 plus C2.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.850
And you're going to go all the
way to the nth column.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.610
It's going to be Bn plus Cn.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.940
Now by our definition of
matrix-matrix products, this

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.880
product right here is going to
be equal to the matrix, where

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.980
we take the matrix A and
multiply it by each of the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.460
column vectors of this matrix
here, of B plus C.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.680
Which as you can imagine,
these are both m by n.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.250
In fact they both have to have
the same dimensions for this

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.100
addition to be well defined.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.360
So this is going to be
an m by n matrix.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.170
I already you told you
that A is a k by m.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.750
And we know this is well defined
because A has the same

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.190
number of columns as B
plus C has of rows.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.450
So this is well defined.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.220
And this is going to be equal
to-- let me switch colors

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:35.720
again-- A times the column
vector B1 plus C1.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.030
The second column is going to
be A times the column vector

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.580
B2 plus C2.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.790
I'm running out of space.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.740
This is going to be all the
way to A times the column

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.950
vector Bn plus Cn.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.040
This is our definition of
matrix-matrix products.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.560
You just take the first matrix
and you multiply it times each

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.660
of the column vectors of
the second matrix.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.150
And we can say that because
we've already defined

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.420
matrix-vector products.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.015
So what is this thing on
the right equal to?

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:11.280
I'll keep switching colors.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.850
We know that matrix-vector
products exhibit the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.850
distributive property.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.900
I don't even remember when
I did that video.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.200
But we've assumed
it for a while.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.990
It's a very trivial
thing to prove.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.650
So each of these columns is
going to be equal to, let me

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.380
write this way.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.340
This guy right here
can be re-written.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.050
The first column is going to be
A times column vector B1,

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.520
plus A times the column
vector C1.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.430
This term right there
is the same thing as

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.320
that term right there.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.840
The next one is going to
be AB2 plus matrix A

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.910
times the vector C2.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.870
And then the nth column is going
to be the matrix-- keep

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.760
going-- A times the column
vector Bn, plus matrix A times

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.360
the column vector C.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.550
Just like that.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.780
Now we can write this
matrix as the sum of

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.190
two different matrices.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.590
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.390
This is equal to-- let me see,
I'll just write it right

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:28.830
here-- AB1 as the first column,
AB2 as the second

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.400
column, all the way to ABn
as the third column.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.370
So that's these terms
right there.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.030
And then if I were to add to
that the matrix A times vector

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.620
C1, A times the column vector
C2-- these are just the

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.940
different columns of this
matrix-- and we just then have

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.840
the matrix A times the
column vector Cn.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.160
These represent these terms.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.870
So clearly if I add these two
matrices, I just add the

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.810
corresponding column vectors
and I'll get

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.500
this matrix up here.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.490
But what is this equal to?

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.780
This right here, by definition,
this is the matrix

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.870
A times the matrix B.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.070
The definition of matrix
products is you take the first

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.550
matrix and multiply times
the column vectors

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.030
of the second matrix.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.390
And by the same argument, I
guess you could say, this is

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.230
equivalent to A times C.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.250
And all of this-- remember we
just had a bunch of equal

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.380
signs-- is equal to
A times B plus C.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.080
So now we can say definitively
that as long as the products

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.340
are well defined and the sums
are well difined, so they all

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.090
have to have the correct
dimensions, that A times B

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:49.100
plus C is equal to AB plus AC.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.910
So matrix products do exhibit
the distributive property, at

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.350
least in this direction.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.550
And I say that because remember
matrix products are

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.490
not commutative.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.400
So we don't know necessarily
that B plus C times A is

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.060
equivalent to that.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.510
In fact, most of the time
these two things are not

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.000
equivalent.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.610
So we don't know quite yet
that if we reversed this,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.090
whether it's still going
to exhibit the

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.230
distributive property.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.770
So let's try to do that.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.850
And I'll do it a little bit
quicker, because I think you

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.162
know the general
argument here.

00:06:21.162 --> 00:06:25.820
So let's take B plus
C times A.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.700
And I'll just write A as
its column vectors.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.540
A1, A2, all the way to-- A has
m columns if I remember

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.540
correctly, right A has
m columns-- so

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.550
all the way to Am.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.830
And by the definition of matrix
products, this is going

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.570
to be equal to the matrix--
B plus C is

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.600
just a matrix, right?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.450
We can represent it as the
sum of two matrix, but

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.840
it is just a matrix.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.300
So it's B plus C times each of
the column vectors of A.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:09.180
So it's going to be equal to
B plus C times A1, B plus C

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:17.440
times A2, all the way to
B plus C times An.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.560
And, once again, it was many
videos ago that I think we

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:28.380
showed that matrix-vector
products are distributive, so

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.750
we can just distribute
this vector

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.730
along these two matrices.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.400
And if I haven't proven it
yet, it's actually a very

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.560
straightforward prove to do.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:44.890
So we could say that this is
equal to BA1 plus CA2.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.900
That's the first column.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:52.790
The second column is B times A2,
plus C times A2, all the

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:59.595
way to B times An,
plus C times An.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.530
And then what is
this equal to?

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:07.720
I'll write it out.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:13.940
This is equivalent to B times--
this is A1, no this is

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:21.020
an A1 right here-- A1, and then
B times A2, all the way

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:32.210
to BAn plus the vector C times
A1, C times A2, all the way to

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.320
C times An, right?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.570
This guy represents these terms
right there, and this

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.320
guy represents the first
terms in each of

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.640
these column vectors.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.490
And this, by the definition of
matrix products, is just

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:49.370
equivalent to BA, and then this
is just equivalent to CA.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.940
So now we've seen that the
distributive property works

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.130
both ways with matrix-vector
products.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:09:04.840
That B plus C times A is equal
to BA CA, and that A times B

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.170
plus C is equal to AB plus AC.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.250
Now the one thing that you have
to be careful of is that

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.470
these two things are not
equivalent [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.420
We just figured out that this
guy is equal to BA plus CA.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.560
So the distribution works
in both ways.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.160
But when you're dealing with
matrices, it's very important

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.550
to keep your order.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.240
So this is going to be you
have the A second here.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.870
So it is BA plus CA.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.640
You can't say that this is
equal to AB plus AC.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.350
You can't just switch
these up.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.520
Because we've shown multiple
times, or we've talked about

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.010
it multiple times, that matrix
products are not commutative.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.860
You can't just switch the
order of the products.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.990
But we've at least shown
in this video that the

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.050
distributive property
works both ways.
