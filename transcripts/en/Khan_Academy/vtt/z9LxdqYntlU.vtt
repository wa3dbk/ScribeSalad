00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.310
Let's think about what might
happen to the boiling point or

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.550
the freezing point of any
solution if we start adding

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.860
particles, or we start
adding solute to it.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.470
For our visualization, let's
just think about water again.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.550
It doesn't have to be water.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.880
It can be any solvent, but let's
just think about water

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.640
in its liquid state.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.100
The particles are reasonably
disorganized because of their

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.150
kinetic energy, but they still
have that hydrogen bonds that

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.340
wants to make them be
near each other.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.240
So this is in the liquid
state, and they have a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.740
reasonable amount of
kinetic energy.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.120
You know, each of these
particles is moving in some

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.460
direction, rubbing against each
other, bouncing off of

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.490
each other.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.910
Now, to move it into the solid
state, or to freeze it, what

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.250
has to happen?

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.620
The ice has to enter kind of
a crystalline structure.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.710
It has to get pretty organized,
so let's say it has

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.530
to look something like this.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.610
The water molecules are going
to have a regular structure

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.460
where the hydrogen bonds
dominate any kind of kinetic

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.340
movement they want to do, and
all the kinetic movement,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.980
they're just vibrating
in place.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.840
So you have to get a
little bit orderly

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.060
right there, right?

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.310
And then, obviously, this
lattice structure goes on and

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.150
on with a gazillion
water molecules.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.470
But the interesting
thing is that this

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.880
somehow has to get organized.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.540
And what happens if we start
introducing molecules into

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.250
this water?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.130
Let's say the example of
sodium-- actually, I won't do

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.750
any example.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.770
Let's just say some arbitrary
molecule, if I were to

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.070
introduce it there, if I
were to put something--

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.930
let me draw it again.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.350
So now I'll just use that same--
I'll introduce some

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.300
molecules, and let's say they're
pretty large, so they

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.060
push all of these water
molecules out of the way.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.900
So the water molecules are now
on the outside of that, and

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.890
let's have another one that's
over here, some relatively

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.860
large molecules of solute
relative to water, and this is

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.890
because a water molecule
really isn't that big.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.310
Now, do you think it's going
to be easier or harder to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.220
freeze this?

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.040
Are you going to have to remove
more or less energy to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.199
get to a frozen state?

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.979
Well, because these molecules,
they're not going to be part

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.690
of this lattice structure
because frankly, they wouldn't

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.780
even fit into it.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.990
They're actually going to make
it harder for these water

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.495
molecules to get organized
because to get organized, they

00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:22.500
have to get at the right
distance for the hydrogen

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.330
bonds to form.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.600
But in this case, even as you
start removing heat from the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.000
system, maybe the ones that
aren't near the solute

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.440
particles, they'll start to
organize with each other.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.500
But then when you introduce a
solute particle, let's say a

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.740
solute particle is sitting
right here.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.340
It's going to be very hard for
someone to organize with this

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.240
guy, to get near enough for
the hydrogen bond to start

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.470
taking hold.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.280
This distance would make
it very difficult.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.220
And so the way I think about
it is that these solute

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.170
particles make the structure
irregular, or they add more

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.710
disorder, and we'll eventually
talk about

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.000
entropy and all of that.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.500
But they make it more irregular,
and it's making it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.130
harder to get into
a regular form.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.100
And so the intuition is is that
this should lower the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.960
boiling point or make
it-- oh, sorry,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.780
lower the melting point.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:27.440
So solute particles make you
have a lower boiling point.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.300
Let's say if we're talking
about water at standard

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.870
temperature and pressure or at
one atmosphere then instead of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.390
going to 0 degrees, you might
have to go to negative 1 or

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.330
negative 2 degrees, and we're
going to talk a little bit

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.800
about what that is.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.400
Now, what's the intuition of
what this will do when you

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.080
want to go into a gaseous
state, when you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.850
want to boil it?

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.320
So my initial gut was, hey, I'm
already in a disordered

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.390
state, which is closer to what
a gas is, so wouldn't that

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.620
make it easier to boil?

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.040
But it turns out it also makes
it harder to boil, and this is

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.170
how I think about it.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.780
Remember, everything with
boiling deals with what's

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.020
happening at the surface, and
we talked about that in our

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.160
vapor pressure.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.980
So at the surface, we said if
I have a bunch of water

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.390
molecules in the liquid state,
we knew that although the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.000
average temperature might not
be high enough for the water

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.680
molecules to evaporate, that
there's a distribution of

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.480
kinetic energies.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.580
And some of these water
molecules on the surface

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.070
because the surface ones
might be going

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.030
fast enough to escape.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.340
And when they escape into vapor,
then they create a

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.510
vapor pressure above here.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.550
And if that vapor pressure is
high enough, you can almost

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.910
view them as linemen blocking
the way for more molecules to

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.530
kind of run behind them as they
block all of the other

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.930
ambient air pressure
above them.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.980
So if there's enough of them and
they have enough energy,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.180
they can start to push back or
to push outward is the way I

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.410
think about it, so that more
guys can come in behind them.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.910
So I hope that lineman analogy
doesn't completely lose you.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.210
Now, what happens if you were
to introduce solute into it?

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.210
Some of the solute particle
might be down here.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.170
It probably doesn't have much
of an effect down here, but

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.290
some of it's going to be
bouncing on the surface, so

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.020
they're going to be taking up
some of the surface area.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.310
And because, and this is at
least how I think of it, since

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.590
they're going to be taking up
some of the surface area,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.300
you're going to have less
surface area exposed to the

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.200
solvent particle or to the
solution or the stuff that'll

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.080
actually vaporize.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.820
You're going to have a
lower vapor pressure.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.250
And remember, your boiling
point is when the vapor

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.020
pressure, when you have enough
particles with enough kinetic

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.820
energy out here to start
pushing against the

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.340
atmospheric pressure, when the
vapor pressure is equal to the

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.800
atmospheric pressure,
you start boiling.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.100
But because of these guys, I
have a lower vapor pressure.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.170
So I'm going to have to add even
more kinetic energy, more

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.030
heat to the system in order to
get enough vapor pressure up

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.130
here to start pushing back
the atmospheric pressure.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.440
So solute also raises
the boiling point.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.230
So the way that you can think
about it is solute, when you

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.780
add something to a solution,
it's going to make it want to

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.830
be in the liquid state more.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.520
Whether you lower the
temperature, it's going to

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.580
want to stay in liquid as
opposed to ice, and if you

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.000
raise the temperature, it's
going to want to stay in

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.530
liquid as opposed to gas.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.460
I found this neat-- hopefully,
it shows up

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.850
well on this video.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.205
I have to give due credit, this
is from chem.purdue.edu/

00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:34.820
gchelp/solutions/eboil.html, but
I thought it was a pretty

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.690
neat graphic, or at least
a visualization.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.970
This is just the surface of
water molecules, and it gives

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.060
you a sense of just how things
vaporize as well.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.090
There's some things on the
surface that just bounce off.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.970
And here's an example where
they visualized sodium

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.390
chloride at the surface.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.910
And because the sodium chloride
is kind of bouncing

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.120
around on the surface with the
water molecules, fewer of

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.880
those water molecules kind of
have the room to escape, so

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.050
the boiling point
gets elevated.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.080
Now, the question is by how
much does it get elevated?

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.900
And this is one of the neat
things in life is that the

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.730
answer is actually
quite simple.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:17.860
The change in boiling or
freezing point, so the change

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.970
in temperature of vaporization,
is equal to some

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:31.120
constant times the number of
moles, or at least the mole

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.590
concentration, the molality,
times the molality of the

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.200
solute that you're putting
into your solution.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:51.230
So, for example, let's say I
have 1 kilogram of-- so let's

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.790
say my solvent is water.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.840
I'll switch colors.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.110
And I have 1 kilogram of water,
and let's say we're

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.020
just at atmospheric pressure.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:08.040
And let's say I have some
sodium chloride, NaCl.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:14.170
And let's say I have
2 moles of NaCl.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.420
I'll have 2 moles.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:23.480
The question is how much will
this raise the boiling point

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.610
of this water?

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:31.070
So first of all, you just have
to figure out the molality,

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:36.299
which is just equal to the
number of moles of solute,

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:42.159
this 2 moles, divided
by the number of

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.570
kilograms of solvent.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:51.610
So let's say we have 1
kilogram of solvent.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.090
This was, of course, moles.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.820
So our molality is 2
moles per kilogram.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.840
So we just have to figure out
what this constant is, and

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.225
then we'll know the temperature
elevation.

00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:03.430
And actually, that same
Purdue site, they

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.510
gave a list of tables.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.146
I haven't run the experiments
myself.

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:08.760
They have some neat
charts here.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.640
But they say, OK water, normal
boiling point is 100 degrees

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.200
Celsius at standard atmospheric
pressure.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.740
And then they say that the
constant is 0.512 Celsius

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.360
degrees per mole.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.070
So let's just say 0.5.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.320
So it equals 0.5.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.950
So k is equal to 0.5.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.670
And I want to be very clear here
because this is a very--

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.040
I won't say a subtle point, but
it's an interesting point.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.350
So I said that there's 2-- the
molality of-- I just realized

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.030
I made a mistake.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.710
I said the molality of
sodium chloride is 2.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.620
2 moles per kilograms. But
that would be if sodium

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.940
chloride stayed in this
molecular state, if it stayed

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.840
together, right?

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.150
But what happens is that the
sodium chloride actually

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.790
disassociates, and we learned
all about it in

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.430
that previous video.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:04.750
Each molecule or each sodium
chloride pair disassociates

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.810
into two molecules,
into a sodium ion

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.430
and a chlorine anion.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.820
And because of that, because
this disassociates into two,

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.950
the molality is actually going
to be two times the number of

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.670
moles of sodium chloride I have.
So it's going to be two

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.730
times this.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.040
So my molality will
actually be 4.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.890
And this is an interesting
point.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.700
If I was dealing with--
and I wrote it here.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:36.400
So this right here is glucose,
and this is sodium chloride,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.370
or at least sodium chloride
in its crystal form.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:43.080
One molecule, I guess you can
view it, or one salt of it.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.310
I guess you could just view it
as one of these little pairs

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.320
right here.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.780
But the interesting thing is
is you could have the same

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.320
number of moles of sodium
chloride when you view it as a

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.230
compound and glucose.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.730
But glucose, when it goes into
water, it just stays as one

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.460
molecule of glucose.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.990
So a mole of glucose will
disassociate into a mole of

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.170
glucose in water.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.950
Well, I guess it won't
disassociate.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.510
It'll just stay as one mole,
while a mole of sodium

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.490
chloride will turn into
two moles because it

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.480
disassociates.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.890
It turns into two separate
particles.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.780
So in my example, when I start
with a mole of this, I end

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:26.910
up-- actually, once I dissolve
it in water, I ended up with 4

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.890
moles per kilogram of molality,
because this turns

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.280
into two particles.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.600
So given that the molality
is 4 moles.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.240
2 moles of sodium, 2 moles
of chloride per kilogram.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.270
So I just use that constant that
I just got from Purdue.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.100
And I get the change in
temperature is equal to that

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:54.910
constant, 0.5, times 4, which
is equal to 2 degrees.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.440
So my boiling point will be
elevated by 2 degrees.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.970
Now, if I had the same number of
moles, if I had 2 moles of

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.460
glucose dissolved into my water,
I'd only get half as

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.610
much, half as much
of an increase.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.150
Because the molality would
be half as much.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.210
Because it doesn't turn
into two particles.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.720
In some textbooks, you'll
actually see it

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.090
written like this.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:22.990
You'll actually see the same
formula written like change in

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.860
boiling temperature, or vapor
temperature, or whatever you

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.250
want to think, is equal to k
times m times i, where they'll

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.270
say this is the molality
of the compound

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.110
you're talking about.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.880
In this case, this number
would be 2, and i is the

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.330
number of molecules or the
number of things that it

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.640
disassociates into.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.910
So in this case, this
would have been 2.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.520
And that's where we would have
gotten 4 times k, which is

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.020
0.5, which is 2.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.180
In the case of water, this would
be-- oh, sorry, in the

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.390
case of the glucose, this
would still be 2.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.400
But it only turns into one
particle when it goes in the

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.640
water, so that would be 1.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.370
So you would only have a 1
degree increase in the boiling

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.370
point of water.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.460
Now, freezing point
is the same thing.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.500
Change in freezing
point is also

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.180
proportional to the molality.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.800
And you can either say the
molality of the original

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.690
non-in-water compound times
the number of compounds it

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:22.290
disassociates into, although
this k is going to be

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.440
different for freezing than
it is for boiling.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.660
Of course, this k changes at
different pressures and for

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.370
different elements.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.950
But the really big takeaway is
just to realize that even if

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.160
you have a mole of this and a
mole of that, and they're

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.810
going to be dissolved into the
same amount of water, because

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.160
this dissociates into two
particles and this

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.170
disassociates into only one
for every-- or this

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.620
disassociates into two moles for
every mole of the crystal

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.610
you have-- this doesn't
disassociate; it just stays as

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.810
one-- this'll have twice as
large of an effect on the

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:57.300
freezing point change or on the
boiling point elevation

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.320
than the glucose will.
