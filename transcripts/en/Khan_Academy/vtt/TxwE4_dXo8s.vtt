00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.240
So where I left off, we had
this infinite plate.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.900
It's just an infinite plane, and
it's a charged plate with

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.410
a charge density sigma.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.830
And what we did is we said, OK,
well, we're taking this

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.140
point up here that's h units
above the surface of our

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.300
charge plate, and we wanted to
figure out the electric field

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.150
at that point, generated by a
ring of radius r essentially

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.400
centered at the base of where
that point is above.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.830
We want to figure out what is
the electric field generated

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.130
by this ring at that point?

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.450
And we figured out that the
electric field was this, and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.900
then because we made a symmetry
argument in the last

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.110
video, we only care about
the y-component.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.700
Because we figured out that at
the electric field generated

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.510
from any point, the x-components
cancel out,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.295
because if we have a point
here, it'll have some

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:55.560
x-component.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.710
The field's x-component might
be in that direction to the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.650
right, but then you have another
point out here, and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.130
its x-component will
just cancel it out.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.760
So we only care about
the y-component.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.280
So at the end, we meticulously
calculated what the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.110
y-component of the electric
field generated by the ring

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.570
is, at h units above
the surface.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.570
So with that out of the way,
let's see if we can sum up a

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.480
bunch of rings going from radius
infinity to radius zero

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.950
and figure out the total
y-component.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.750
Or essentially the total
electric field, because we

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.490
realize that all the x's cancel
out anyway, the total

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.120
electric field at that point,
h units above the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.930
surface of the plane.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.110
So let me erase a lot of this
just so I can free it up for

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.405
some hard-core math.

00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:54.130
And this is pretty much all
calculus at this point.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.640
So let me erase all of this.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.090
Watch the previous video if you
forgot how it was derived.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.380
Let me even erase that because
I think I will

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.630
need a lot of space.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.220
There you go.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.770
OK, so let me redraw a little
bit just so we never forget

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.390
what we're doing here because
that happens.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.390
So that's my plane that goes
off in every direction.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.050
I have my point above the plane
where we're trying to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.130
figure out the electric field.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.740
And we've come to the conclusion
that the field is

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.640
going to point upward, so
we only care about the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.860
y-component.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.590
It's h units above the surface,
and we're figuring

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.200
out the electric field generated
by a ring around

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.630
this point of radius r.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.010
And what's the y-component
of that electric field?

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.760
We figured out it was this.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.230
So now what we're going to
do is take the integral.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.870
So the total electric field from
the plate is going to be

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.440
the integral from-- that's a
really ugly-looking integral--

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.620
a radius of zero to a
radius of infinity.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.970
So we're going to take a sum of
all of the rings, starting

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.960
with a radius of zero all the
way to the ring that has a

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.620
radius of infinity, because
it's an infinite plane so

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.180
we're figuring out the impact
of the entire plane.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.060
So we're going to take the sum
of every ring, so the field

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.240
generated by every ring, and
this is the field generated by

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.275
each of the rings.

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:29.710
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.340
This light blue is getting
a little monotonous.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:47.050
Kh 2pi sigma r dr over
h squared plus r

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.030
squared to the 3/2.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.280
Now, let's simplify
this a little bit.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.040
Let's take some constants out of
it just so this looks like

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.410
a slightly simpler equation.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:04.795
So this equals the integral from
zero to-- So let's take

00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:06.670
the K-- I'm going to
leave the 2 there.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.370
You'll see why in a second, but
I'm going to take all the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.770
other constants out that we're
not integrating across.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:23.690
So it's equal to Kh pi sigma
times the integral from zero

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.270
to infinity of what is this?

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.930
So what did I leave in there?

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.480
I left a 2r, so we could
rewrite this as-- well,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.560
actually, I'm running
out of space.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:50.470
2r dr over h squared plus r
squared to the 3/2, or we

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.380
could think of it as the
negative 3/2, right?

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.380
So what is the antiderivative
of here?

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.800
Well, this is essentially the
reverse chain rule, right?

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.850
I could make a substitution
here, if you're more

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.390
comfortable using the
substitution rule, but you

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.950
might be able to eyeball
this at this point.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.390
We could make the substitution
that u is equal to-- if we

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.530
just want to figure out the
antiderivative of this-- if u

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.300
is equal to h squared plus
r squared-- h is just a

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.100
constant, right-- then du is
just equal to-- I mean, the du

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:33.610
dr-- this is a constant, so it
equals 2r, or we could say du

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.670
is equal to 2r dr.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:45.490
And so if we're trying to take
the antiderivative of 2r dr

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:53.370
over h squared plus r squared to
the 3/2, this is the exact

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.320
same thing as taking the
antiderivative with this

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.310
substitution.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.680
2r dr, we just showed right
here, that's the same

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.650
thing as du, right?

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.100
So that's du over-- and then
this is just u, right?

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.370
H squared plus r squared is u.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.590
We do that by definition.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.350
So u to the 3/2, which is equal
to the antiderivative

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:20.260
of-- we could write this as
u to the minus 3/2 du.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.960
And now that's easy.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.100
This is just kind of reverse
the exponent rule.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:32.710
So that equals minus 2u to
the minus 1/2, and we

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.530
can confirm, right?

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.750
If we take the derivative of
this, minus 1/2 times minus 2

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.320
is 1, and then subtract 1 from
here, we get minus 3/2.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.440
And then we could add plus c,
but since we're eventually

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.590
going to do a definite
integral, the

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.290
c's all cancel out.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.600
Or we could say that this is
equal to-- since we made that

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:57.950
substitution-- minus 2 over--
minus 1/2, that's the same

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:03.170
thing as over the square
root of h squared

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.570
plus r squared, right?

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.290
So all of the stuff I did in
magenta was just to figure out

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.330
the antiderivative of this, and
we figured it out to be

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:18.270
this: minus 2 over the
square root of h

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.220
squared plus r squared.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.760
So with that out of the way,
let's continue evaluating our

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.020
definite integral.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.170
So this expression simplifies
to-- this is a marathon

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.920
problem, but satisfying-- K--
let's get all the constants--

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:43.320
Kh pi sigma-- we can even take
this minus 2 out-- times minus

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.970
2, and all of that, and we're
going to evaluate the definite

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:53.910
integral at the two boundaries--
1 over the square

00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:00.700
root of h squared plus r squared
evaluated at infinity

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.040
minus it evaluated
at 0, right?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.150
Well, what does this
expression equal?

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.840
What is 1 over the square
root of h squared

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.280
plus infinity, right?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.210
What happens when we evaluate
r at infinity?

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.420
Well, the square root of
infinity is still infinity,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.955
and 1 over infinity is 0, so
this expression right here

00:08:21.955 --> 00:08:23.140
just becomes 0.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.500
When you evaluate it at
infinity, this becomes 0 minus

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.750
this expression evaluated
at 0.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.670
So what happens when
it's at 0?

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.710
When r squared is 0, we get 1
over the square root of h

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.960
squared, right?

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.080
So let's write it all out.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:47.730
This becomes minus 2Kh pi sigma
times 0 minus 1 over the

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.140
square root of h squared.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:09:01.870
Well this equals minus 2Kh pi
sigma times-- well, 1 over the

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.080
square root of h squared, that's
just 1 over h, right?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.130
And there's a minus times
minus 1 over h.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.820
Well, this minus and that
minus cancel out.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.730
And then this h and this 1
over h should cancel out.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.170
And all we're left with, after
doing all of that work, and

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.590
I'll do it in a bright color
because we've done a lot of

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.760
work to get here,
is 2K pi sigma.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.150
So let's see it at
a lot of levels.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.270
First of all, what did
we even do here?

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.010
We might have gotten
lost in the math.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.640
This is the net electric, the
total electric field, at a

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:48.970
point at height h above this
infinite plate that has a

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.390
uniform charge, and the charge
density is sigma.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.250
But notice, this is the electric
field at that point,

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.700
but there's no h in here.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.430
So it essentially is telling
us that the strength of the

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.320
field is in no way dependent on
how high above the field we

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.160
are, which tells us this is
going to be a constant field.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.020
We can be anywhere above
the plate and the

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.540
charge will be the same.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.830
The only thing-- oh, sorry,
not the charge.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.600
The field will be the same, and
if we have a test charge,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.110
the force would be the same.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.000
And the only thing that the
strength of the field or the

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.450
strength of the exerted
electrostatic force is

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.090
dependent on, is the charge
density, right?

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.130
This is Coulomb's constant, pi
is pi, 2pi, and I think it's

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.100
kind of cool that it involves
pi, but that's

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.465
something else to ponder.

00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:39.640
But all that matters is
the charge density.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.210
So hopefully, you found that
reasonably satisfying, and the

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.930
big thing that we learned here
is that if I have an infinite

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:52.500
uniformly charged plate, the
field-- and I'm some distance

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.860
h above that field-- above that
plate, it doesn't matter

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.750
what that h is.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.210
I could be here, I could be
here, I could be here.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.560
At all of those points, the
field has the exact same

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.300
strength, or the net
electrostatic force on a test

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.470
charge at those points has the
exact same strength, and

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.290
that's kind of a neat thing.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.590
And now if you do believe
everything that occurred in

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.980
the last two videos, you can
now believe that there are

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.400
such things as uniform electric
fields and they occur

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.670
between parallel plates,
especially far away from the

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.770
boundaries.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.240
See you soon.
