00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.520
I've been asked to make a video
on algebraic division or

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.770
algebraic long division.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.780
So I'll make a video an
algebraic long division.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.930
I'm just going to
make up a problem.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.760
Let's say we wanted to divide--
we wanted to see how many times

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.700
does-- I'll start with a fairly
straightforward problem.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:27.680
How many times does 2x plus 1
go into-- I don't know-- let's

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:41.720
say it's 8x to the third minus
7x squared plus 10x minus 5.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.730
So what we do is we just take--
actually, just the exact same

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.470
way that you would do with long
division, traditional long

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.390
division of multiple digits.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.640
In the 2x plus 1 expression
you look at, oh, what is

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.880
the highest degree term?

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.860
And that's really all we're
going to pay attention

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.090
to most of the time.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.160
So the first step is you
say, OK, the highest

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.210
degree term is 2x.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.450
How many times does 2x go into
the highest degree term of the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.850
number-- not the number-- the
expression that we're

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.010
dividing into?

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.130
So you say, how many times does
2x go into 8x to the third?

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.950
Well, we could do a little
division on the side, but you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.320
could imagine eventually this
is pretty straightforward.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.860
So if you have 8x to the
third divided by 2x, that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.370
is equal to 4x squared.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.990
So 2x goes into 8x to the
third 4x squared times.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.090
And this is the key thing.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.680
You don't want to write
the 4x squared here.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.930
You want to keep everything
in the correct places.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.730
So when you're dividing numbers
you think of the ones, the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.160
tens, the hundreds, and the
thousands place et cetera.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.860
When you're dividing
polynomials you can kind of

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.180
think of the x to the 0 space.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.860
The x to the 1 space
or the x space.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.050
The x squared space.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.690
The x to the third space.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.560
So, when we say that 2x goes
into 8x to the third 4x squared

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.752
times let's write that
in the x squared spot.

00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:08.410
It goes into it 4x
squared times.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.905
Now, we take that 4x
squared and we multiply

00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:11.990
it by our expression.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.740
I think you're already seeing
that this is very similar

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.180
to long division.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.470
And actually, if x was a
ten, it would be identical

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.530
to long division.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.460
And I'll let you
think about that.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.360
If x was 10 this would
be the thousands place.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.160
This would be 8,000 minus--
although you would have

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.140
negative digits, which doesn't
make a bunch of sense.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.540
But I think you get
what I'm saying.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.730
But anyway, back to this
algebraic long division.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.350
Although I think it is
very important to see the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.630
parallels between this and
traditional long division.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.600
Well, anyway, we said that
2x goes into 8x to the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.440
third 4x squared times.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.080
Now what we can do is we
can multiply 4x squared

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.040
times 2x plus 1.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.060
So 4x squared times 1,
that's 4x squared.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.170
So we can write that in
the x squared's place.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.370
We could write it 4x squared.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.350
And 4x squared times 2x
is 8x to the third.

00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:08.470
This is plus here.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.590
And now, just like we do with
traditional long division, we

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.510
can subtract this from this.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:26.755
So minus 7x squared minus 4x
squared is minus 11x squared.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.205
And then 8x to the third minus
8x to the third is 0, so we

00:03:33.205 --> 00:03:34.680
can ignore that right there.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.410
And if we want, we can bring
down the rest of the number,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.990
but maybe just for fun we'll
bring down the next spot just

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.220
like we do in traditional
long division.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.150
Actually, let me erase
this over here.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.120
Because I think we might find
that real estate useful.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.730
All right, I'm back.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.970
Actually, it doesn't hurt to
bring down the whole thing.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.540
Just so that you understand
what we're doing.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.510
We're saying if you were to
divide 2x plus 1 to this entire

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.690
expression, and you say it
goes in 4x squared times.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.540
Now you can kind of call
it our intermediate

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.910
remainder is what's left.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.800
This is what's left.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.950
You could almost imagine 4x
squared times 2x plus 1 is--

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.190
this is 8x to the third plus 4x
squared plus 0 plus 0 because

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.600
it doesn't contribute any
thing to these spots.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.740
But then what's left over
is this expression.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.920
If you take this minus this
whole expression, you

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.810
get what's left over.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.790
Now we just do the
same thing over.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.100
How many times does 2x--
we just look at the

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.510
highest order term.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.180
How many times does 2x go
into negative 11x squared?

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.420
So let's write it here
on the side again.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.010
Actually, let me do it here.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:58.930
So if we were to take minus
11x squared divided by 2x,

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.780
that is equal to what?

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.488
That is equal to minus 11/2 x.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.390
So 2x goes into minus 11x
squared minus 11/2 x times.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.510
So we'll write that
in our x place.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.870
So minus 11/2.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.750
We could write that as 5.5.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.890
I'll just write it
as a fraction.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.460
Minus 11/2 x.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.250
And now, what is minus
11/2 x times 2x plus 1?

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.020
So minus 11/2 x times
1 is minus 11/2 x.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.220
And we'll want to write
that in the x position.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.130
I'll switch colors just
to not be monotonous.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:49.630
So minus 11/2 x times
1 is minus 11/2 x.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.910
And then, minus 11/2
x times 2x, well, we

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.080
should know that is.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.410
But you can multiply them out.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.220
It'll be minus 11x squared.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.840
I think you see
what we're doing.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.600
After every step we're
canceling out the largest

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.740
degree of the polynomial
we're dividing into.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.270
Fair enough?

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.570
Now let's subtract this
expression from this.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.640
And we'll get kind of our
new intermediary remainder.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.760
And maybe that'll be
the full remainder.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.600
So let's see.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.740
Minus 11x squared
minus 11x squared.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.000
That's 0, so we don't have
to write anything there.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.790
10x minus negative 11/2 x.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.070
Remember, we're subtracting
this negative number from 10x.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.940
So if you're subtracting a
negative number it's like

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.130
adding a positive number.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.330
So you could view this
as 10 plus 11/2.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.890
So 10 plus 11/2, that's
20/2 plus 11/2.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.030
That's 31/2 or 15.5.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.940
I'll just write 31/2 x.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.550
31/2 x.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.830
And then you could say that
there was a 0 here and

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.190
when you subtract 0 from
minus 5 you get minus 5.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:07.420
And now we say, how many times
does 2x go into 31/2 x.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.920
Let's do a little work
on the side here.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.900
So if I have 31/2
x divided by 2x.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.785
Well, the x's will
just cancel out.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.350
This is equal to 31/4.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.730
This is the same thing
as 31 over 2 times 1/2.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.420
So it's 31/4.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.810
So 2x goes into this expression
31/4 times and I'll

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.596
switch colors.

00:07:33.596 --> 00:07:35.990
I'll switch to green.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.060
And that's a positive, right?

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.470
You're dividing a positive
into a positive.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.700
So plus 31/4 times.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.720
And I'm writing that in the--
you could view that in the

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.830
constant space or the
x to the 0 space.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.680
Or the 1 space even.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.070
So it goes into it 31/4 times.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:59.230
31/4 times 1 is 31/4.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.660
And 31/4 times 2x is 31/2 x.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.690
And now we subtract.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.850
This is a plus here.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.340
We subtract the green
expression from the light

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.750
blue expression and
we're left with this.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.110
When you subtract this from
this you're left with 0, so

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.320
nothing shows up there.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.280
And we're left with
minus 5 minus 31/4.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.470
And we can just do a little
bit of fraction work here.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.090
That's equal to, let's see.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:35.520
Minus 5 over 4 is
minus 20 minus 31.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.700
All of that over 4.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.860
So that is equal to what?

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.440
Minus 20, that's
equal to minus 51.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.410
Minus 51/4.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:53.990
So, our answer is 2x plus 1
goes into 8x to the third minus

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:59.140
7x squared plus 10x minus 5--
it goes into it 4x squared

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.100
minus 11/2 x plus 31/4 times.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.320
But there is a remainder,
and this is the remainder.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.460
And so a way to visualize this
or another way to think about

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.860
this problem so it's actually
useful when we're actually

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.270
solving real problems.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.320
And that you just don't view
this as some kind of mechanical

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.650
way to get problems right
on a test that only tests

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.890
algebraic long division.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.390
As another way to write this
relationship you could write

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.390
that-- let me do it
in another color.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.820
I've used many of
my colors already.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:40.800
So you can write that 2x plus
1 times this-- 4x squared.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.000
That's an x.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.950
Minus 11/2 x plus 31/4.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.160
Plus the remainder.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.580
So when you multiply these two
out, and then if you were to

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.980
add the remainder-- 51/4-- that
that would equal-- and let

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.880
me draw a dividing line.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.720
I don't want to confuse you
with all this stuff here.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.380
That would equal this.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.700
That would equal 8x to the
third minus 7x squared

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.130
plus 10x minus 5.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.430
Anyway, I hope that helps.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.500
See you in the next video.
