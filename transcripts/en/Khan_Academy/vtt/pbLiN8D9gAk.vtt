00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.230
A popular R&amp;B band recently
returned from a successful

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.860
three-city tour where
they played to at

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.500
least 120,000 people.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.140
My brain immediately says that's
greater than or equal

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.180
to 120,000.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.600
If they had an audience of
45,000 in Mesa and another

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.950
33,000 in Denver, how
many people attended

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.090
their show in Las Vegas?

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.170
So let's say Las Vegas, I'll
just use l for Las Vegas.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.330
So the number of people who
attended their show in Las

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.080
Vegas plus the number that
attended their show in Mesa,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.100
which is 45,000, plus the number
of people that attended

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.020
their show in Denver, which is
33,000-- those are three

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.210
cities right there, Las Vegas,
Mesa, and Denver-- that has to

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.390
be at least 120,000 people.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.410
Or another way of interpreting
that is greater than or equal

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.890
to 120,000.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.040
So to figure out how many people
attended their show in

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.910
Las Vegas, we just solve for
l on this inequalty.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.960
So if we simplify this left-hand
side, we get the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.060
number of people in Las Vegas
plus-- what's 45,000 plus

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.630
33,000, that is 78,000-- 78,000
is going to be greater

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.520
than or equal to 120,000.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.830
Now to isolate the l on the
left-hand side of the

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.630
inequality, we can subtract
78,000 from both sides.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.790
So minus 78,000, minus 78,000
on the left-hand side, these

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.920
cancel out.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.870
And we're just left with the
number of people who attended

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.440
the show in Las Vegas is going
to be greater than or equal to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.990
120,000 minus 78,000.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.810
So 120,000 minus 80,000 is
40,000, and it's going to be

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.880
another 2,000.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.690
So the number of people who
attended Las Vegas is going to

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.880
be greater than or equal
to 42,000 people.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.310
And we're done, that's it
