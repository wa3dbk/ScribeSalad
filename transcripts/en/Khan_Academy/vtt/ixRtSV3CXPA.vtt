00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.750
The goal in this video is to
essentially prove a pretty

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.920
simple result.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.710
And that's that the ratio
between the volumes-- let me

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.850
write this down-- that the ratio
between the volume at

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.580
state B and the volume at state
A-- so the ratio of that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
volume to that volume-- is equal
to, in our Carnot cycle,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.620
is equal to the ratio between
the volume at state C.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.860
So this volume and
that volume.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.920
So volume at C to
the volume at D.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.930
So this is what I'm about
to embark to prove.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.720
A fairly simple result, that
maybe is even, if you look at

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.090
this, that looks about right.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.780
So if you're happy just knowing
that, you don't have

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.850
to watch the rest
of the video.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.440
But if you are curious how we
get there, I encourage you to

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.400
watch it, although it gets
a little bit math-y.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.460
But I think the fun part
about it, even, it will

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.420
one, satisfy you.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.090
That this is true.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.150
But the other thing is, we'll
be able to study adiabatic

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.890
processes a little bit more.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.820
So just kind of launching off
of that, the whole proof

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.250
revolves around to this step
right here and this step right

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.850
here. when we go from D to A.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.090
So by definition, an adiabatic
process is one where there's

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.060
no transfer of heat.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.530
So our heat transfer in an
adiabatic process is 0.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.010
So if we go back to our original
definitions-- let me

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.650
show you that here.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.150
Right here, at the step
and this step, we have

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.470
no transfer of heat.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.565
So if we go back to there.

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:28.680
Adiabatic-- we're completely
isolated from

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.550
the rest of the world.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.220
So there's nothing to transfer
heat to or from.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.660
So if we go to our definition,
almost, or our first law of

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.540
thermodynamics, we know that the
change in internal energy

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.500
is equal to the heat applied to
the system minus the work

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.660
done by the system.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.530
And the work done by the
system is equal to the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.420
pressure of the system times
some change in volume.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.720
At least, maybe it's a very
small change in volume, while

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.790
the pressure is constant.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.580
But if we're doing a
quasi-static process, we can

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.670
write this.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.710
Pressure, you can view it as
kind of constant for that very

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.920
small change in volume.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.300
So that's what we have there.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.165
Now, if it's adiabatic, we
know that this is 0.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.650
And if that's 0, we can add P
delta V to both sides of this

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.645
equation, and we will get that--
this is only true if it

00:02:22.645 --> 00:02:27.000
were adiabatic-- that delta U,
our change in internal energy,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.530
plus our pressure times
our change in

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.095
volume, is equal to 0.

00:02:34.095 --> 00:02:36.530
And let's see if we can do
this somehow, we can do

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.020
something with this equation to
get to that result that I'm

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.450
trying to get to.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.100
So a few videos ago, I proved
to you that U, the internal

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.050
energy at any point in time--
let me write it here.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.890
The internal energy at any point
in time is equal to 3/2

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.400
times n times R times T.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.440
Which is also equal
to 3/2 times PV.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.520
Now, if I have a change in
internal energy, what can

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.460
change on this side?

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.000
Something must have changed.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.980
Well, 3/2 can't change.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.850
n can't change.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.190
We're not going to change the
number of molecules we have.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.990
The universal gas constant
can't change.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.050
So the temperature
must change.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.930
So there you have it.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.636
You have delta U could be
rewritten as delta-- let me do

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:26.930
it in a different color-- delta
U could be written as

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.810
3/2 n times R times our
change in temperature.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.880
And that's why I keep saying
in this-- especially when

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.770
we're dealing with the situation
where all of the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.440
internal energy is essentially
kinetic energy-- that if you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.925
don't have a change in
temperature, you're not going

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:42.620
to have a change in
internal energy.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.520
Likewise, if you don't have a
change in internal energy,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.030
you're not going to have a
change in temperature.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.620
So let me put this
aside right here.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.850
I'm going to substitute
it back there.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.000
But let's see if we can do
something with this P here.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.920
Well, we'll just resort to
our ideal gas equation.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.470
Because we're dealing with an
ideal gas, we might as well.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.720
PV is equal to nRT.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.970
This should be emblazoned in
your mind, at this point.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.150
So if we want to solve
for P, we get O is

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.700
equal to nRT over V.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.250
Fair enough.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.840
So let's put both of these
things aside, and substitute

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.730
them into this formula.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.580
So delta U is equal
to this thing.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:38.910
So that means that 3/2 nR delta
T plus P-- P is this

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:50.740
thing-- plus nRT over V times
delta V is equal to 0.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.810
Interesting.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.670
So what can we do
further here?

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.080
And I'll kind of tell you where
I'm going with this.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.570
So that tells me, my change in
internal energy over a very

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.660
small delta T-- this tells me
my work done by the system

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.330
over a very small delta V.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.380
And we're saying that, you know,
over each little small

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.160
increments, they're going
to add up to zero.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.740
So let me just go back to
the original graph.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.090
So this is over a very small
delta V right there.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.060
Let me do it in a more
vibrant color.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.560
A very small change,
as we go from there

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.730
to, let's say, there.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.700
We're going to have some
change in our volume.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.590
And you don't see the
temperature here.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.030
So don't try to even imagine,
when we do the integral, that

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.970
we should think of it in
some terms of area.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.410
But we're going to integrate
over the change in

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.820
temperature, as well.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.180
The temperature changes
a little bit

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.400
from there to there.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.540
So what I want to do--
this is, right here,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.360
over a small change.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.250
I want to integrate eventually
over all of the changes that

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.470
occur during our adiabatic
process.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.650
So let's see if we can simplify
this before I break

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.110
out the calculus.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.970
So if we divide both sides
by nRT, what do we get?

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:01.130
So let's divide it by nRT,
let's divide it by nRT.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.770
And we have to do it to both
sides of the equation. nRT.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.850
Well, on this term, the n's
cancel out, the R cancels out.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.110
Over here, this nRT cancels
out with this nRT.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.950
And what are we left with?

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.820
We're left with 3/2-- we have
this 1 over T left-- times 1

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:30.130
over T delta T plus 1 over V
delta V is equal to-- well,

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.650
zero divided by anything
is just equal to 0.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.910
Now we're going to integrate
over a bunch of really small

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.470
delta T's and delta V's.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.250
So let me just change those to
our calculus terminology.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.740
We're going to do an infinite
sum over infinitesimally small

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.410
changes in delta
T and delta V.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:07:01.030
So I'll rewrite this as 3/2 1
over T dt plus 1 over V dv is

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.750
equal to 0.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.860
Remember, this just
means a very, very

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.690
small change in volume.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.840
This is a very, very, very,
small change, an

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.580
infinitesimally small change,
in temperature.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.540
And now I want to do the total
change in temperature.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.240
I want to integrate over the
total change in temperature

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.960
and the total change
in volume.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.880
So let's do that.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.620
So I want to go from always
temperature start to

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.870
temperature finish.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.060
And this will be going
from our volume

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:39.350
start to volume finish.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.630
Fair enough.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.250
Let's do these integrals.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.790
This tends to show up a lot
in thermodynamics, these

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.620
antiderivatives.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.800
The antiderivative of 1 over
T is natural log of T.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:57.190
So this is equal to 3/2 times
the natural log of T.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.870
We're going to evaluate it at
the final temperature and then

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:06.370
the starting temperature, plus
the natural log-- the

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.340
antiderivative of 1 over V is
just the natural log of V--

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:17.120
plus the natural log of V,
evaluated from our final

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.310
velocity, and we're going
to subtract out

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.300
the starting velocity.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.400
This is just the
calculus here.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.540
And this is going to
be equal to 0.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:23.790
Right?

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.610
I mean, we could integrate both
sides-- well, if every

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.010
infinitesimal change is equal to
the sum is equal to 0, the

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.039
sum of all of the infinitesimal
changes are also

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:33.840
going to be equal to 0.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.460
So this is still equal to 0.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.640
See what we can do here.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:45.670
So we could rewrite this green
part as-- so it's 3/2 times

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.170
the natural log of TF minus the
natural log of TS, which

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.320
is just, using our log
properties, the natural log of

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.900
TF over the natural log of TS.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.610
Right?

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.030
When you evaluate, you get
natural log of TF minus the

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.180
natural log of TS.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.160
That's the same thing as this.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:09.820
Plus, for the same reason, the
natural log of VF over the

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.760
natural log of VS. When you
evaluate this, it's the

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.890
natural log of VF minus the
natural log of VS, which can

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.380
be simplified this to this,
just from our logarithmic

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.560
properties.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.220
So this equals 0.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.940
And now we can-- this
coefficient out front, we can

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.320
use our logarithmic
properties.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.990
Instead of putting a 3/2 natural
log of this, we can

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:34.150
rewrite this as the natural log
of TF over TS to the 3/2.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.110
Now we can keep doing our
logarithm properties.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.350
You take the log of something
plus the log of something.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.530
That's equal to the log
of their product.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.520
So this is equal to-- I'll
switch colors-- The natural

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:56.870
log of TF over TS to the 3/2
power, times the natural log

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:03.090
of VF over VS. And this
is a fatiguing proof.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.830
All right.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.730
And all that is going
to be equal to 0.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.010
Now what can we say?

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.040
Well, we're saying that e to the
0 power-- the natural log

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.470
is log base e-- e to the 0 power
is equal to this thing.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.410
So this thing must be 1.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.830
E to the 0 power is 1.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:28.020
So we can say-- we're almost
there-- that TF, our final

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:33.900
temperature over our starting
temperature to the 3/2 power,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.860
times our final volume
over our starting

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.400
volume is equal to 1.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.280
Now let's take this result that
we worked reasonably hard

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.530
to produce.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.940
Remember all of this, we just
said, we're dealing with an

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.450
adiabatic process, and we
started from the principle of

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.890
just what the definition
of internal energy is.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.150
And then we substitute it with
our PV equals nRT formulas.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.090
Although this was kind of PV--
this is internal energy at any

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.290
point is equal to
3/2 times PV.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.920
And then we integrated over all
the changes, and we said,

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.240
look, this is adiabatic.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.410
So the total change-- the sum
of all of our change in

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.780
internal energy and work done
by the system has to be 0,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.560
then we use the property of
log to get to this result.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.850
Now let's do these for both
of these adiabatic

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.890
processes over here.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.110
So the first one we could do is
this one where we go from

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:35.690
volume B at T1 to
volume C at T2.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:40.370
Watch the Carnot cycle video,
if you forgot that.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.860
This was the VB All of these
things up here were at

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.690
temperature 1.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.206
All of the things down here were
at temperature 2 So we're

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:49.480
at temperature 1 up here,
and temperature 2 down

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.940
here, volume C.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.840
So let's look at that.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:57.850
So on that right part, that
right process, our final

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.880
temperature was temperature 2.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.900
So let me write it down.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.710
Temperature 2.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.875
Our initial temperature was
temperature 1, where we

00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:09.110
started off at point
B to the 3/2.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.660
Times-- what was our
final volume?

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.040
Our final volume was our volume
at C divided by the

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.680
volume at B.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.460
And that's going to
be equal to 1.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.600
Neat.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.260
That's the result we got from
this adiabatic process.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.370
We got that formula saying, this
is adiabatic, we did a

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.380
bunch of math, and then we
just substitute for our

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.990
initial and final volumes
and temperatures.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:35.310
Let's do it the same way, but
let's go from D to A.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:42.760
So when you go from D to A,
what's your final temperature?

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.330
Don't want to get you
dizzy going up.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.320
Well your final temperature,
we're going from D to A.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.150
So our final temperature
is T1.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.940
and our final volume
is the volume at A.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.480
Go back down.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.580
So our final temperature
is T1.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.690
Our initial temperature is T2.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:06.430
We're going from D to A to the
3/2 power is times-- let me

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.520
write our form formula there.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.250
Our final volume is
the volume at A.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.630
That's where we moved to.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.380
And we moved from
our volume at D.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.580
And this is going to
be equal to 1.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:16.990
OK.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.110
We're almost there,
if your eyes are

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.310
beginning to glaze over.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.280
But this is interesting.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.490
And if anything, it's a little
bit of fun mathematics to wake

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:26.760
you up in the morning.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.910
So let's see.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.890
We can almost relate
these two things.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.880
We could set them equal to each
other, but it's not quite

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.690
satisfying yet.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.670
Let's take the reciprocal of
both sides of this equation

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.710
right here.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:44.890
So obviously if we take the
reciprocal of this-- and we

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.990
could just say, this is T2
over T1 to the minus 3/2

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:53.670
power, which is the same
thing as T1 over

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.580
T2, to the 3/2 power.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:56.780
Right?

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.000
That's just the reciprocal.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.540
And we're taking both sides to
the negative 1 power, so we're

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.990
going to have to take this
to the negative 1 power.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.635
VB over VC.

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.390
And when you take the reciprocal
of 1, that just

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.530
equals 1, That still equals 1.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.230
Which this also equals, so we
could say, that equals this

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.560
thing over here.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:19.550
So that is equal to T1 over
T2, to the 3/2 power,

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:24.180
times VA over VD.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.600
Now, these things are
equal to each other.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.500
We can get rid of the 1.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.120
These two-- actually, let me
just erase some of this.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.580
I don't want to make it
say not equal to.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.540
They're equal to each other.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.980
They both equal 1.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.960
So they both equal each other.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.960
This thing and this thing
are the same thing.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.700
T1 over T2 to the 3/2, T1
over T2 to the 3/2.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.370
So let's just divide
both sides by that.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.750
Those cancel out.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.190
And what are we left with?

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.380
I think you can see
the finish line.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.140
The finish line is near.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:02.730
We have VB over VC is
equal to VA over VD.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.740
Now that's not quite the result
we wanted, but it takes

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.300
a little bit of simple
arithmetic to get there.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.240
Let's just cross-multiply.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:18.160
And you get VB times VD is
equal to VC times VA.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:30.710
Now if we divide both sides by
VBVC-- actually, let's do it

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.070
the other way.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.350
Let's divide both
sides by VDVA.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.340
What do we get?

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.780
These cancel out, and
these cancel out.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:53.870
And we are left with VB over
VA is equal to VC over VD.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.800
All that work for a nice and
simple result, but that's

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.620
better than doing a lot
of work for a hairy

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.140
and monstrous result.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.440
So that's what we set
out to prove.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.960
That VB over VA is equal
to VC over VD.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.190
And we got it all from the
notion that we're dealing with

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.220
adiabatic process, that our
change in heat is 0.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.080
and we just went to our formula,
or our definition of

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.260
our change in internal energy,
the first law of

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.130
thermodynamics, that if we have
any change in internal

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.450
energy, it must be equal
to the amount of

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.470
work done by the system.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.880
Or at least a negative of the
work done by the system.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.720
When you add them up,
you get to 0.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.120
Then we use that result from a
few videos ago, where we said

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.660
the internal energy at any
point is 3/2 times nRT.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.490
So the change in internal energy
is that times delta T,

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.210
because that's the only
thing that can change.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.890
We used PV equal nRT.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.430
And then we just integrated
along all of the little

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.290
changes in temperature
and volume, as we

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.030
moved along this line.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.700
As we moved along the line,
we took the integral.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.110
We said that had to
be equal to 0.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.110
And we ended up with this
formula over here, and then we

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.010
just applied it to our two
adiabatic processes.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.580
And we went from B to C, and
we went from D to A.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.695
And we got these results.

00:17:02.695 --> 00:17:05.849
And we got to our finish line.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.619
See you in the next video.
