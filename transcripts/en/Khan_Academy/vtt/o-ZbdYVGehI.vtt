00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.300
We need to factor 25x to
the fourth minus 30x

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.280
squared plus 9.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.390
And this looks really daunting
because we have something to

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.600
the fourth power here.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.690
And then the middle term
is to the second power.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.730
But there's something
about this that

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.070
might pop out at you.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.960
And the thing that pops out at
me at least is that 25 is a

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.040
perfect square, x to the fourth
is a perfect square, so

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.980
25x to the fourth is
a perfect square.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.560
And 9 is also perfect square, so
maybe this is the square of

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.230
some binomial.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.560
And to confirm it, this center
term has to be two times the

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.740
product of the terms that you're
squaring on either end.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.920
Let me explain that a
little bit better

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.450
So, 25x to the fourth, that is
the same thing as 5x squared

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.490
squared, right?

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.890
So it's a perfect square.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.560
9 is the exact same thing as,
well, it could be plus or

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.770
minus 3 squared.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.250
It could be either one.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.120
Now, what is 30x squared?

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.770
What happens if we take 5
times plus or minus 3?

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.660
So remember, this needs to be
two times the product of

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.510
what's inside the square, or
the square root of this and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.340
the square root of that.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.420
Given that there's a negative
sign here and 5 is positive,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.330
we want to take the
negative 3, right?

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.770
That's the only way we're going
to get a negative over

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.750
there, so let's just try
it with negative 3.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:35.260
So what is what is 2 times 5x
squared times negative 3?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.920
What is this?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.770
Well, 2 times 5x squared is 10x
squared times negative 3.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.030
It is equal to negative
30x squared.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.570
We know that this is
a perfect square.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.210
So we can just rewrite this as
this is equal to 5x squared--

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.100
let me do it in the
same color.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:09.290
5x squared minus 3 times
5x squared minus 3.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.500
And we saw in the last
video why this works.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.210
And if you want to verify
it for yourself,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.550
multiply this out.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.020
You will get 25x to the fourth
minus 30x squared plus 9.
