00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.963
- [Voiceover] So in the last video,

00:00:01.963 --> 00:00:04.553
I talked about Vector fields,
and here I want to talk

00:00:04.553 --> 00:00:07.058
about a special circumstance
where they come up.

00:00:07.058 --> 00:00:10.094
So imagine that we're sitting
in the coordinate plane,

00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:11.572
and that I draw for you a whole bunch

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:14.885
of little droplets, droplets
of water, and then these are

00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:16.653
going to start flowing in some way.

00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:21.147
How would you describe
this flow mathematically?

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:24.615
So at every given point, the particles

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:25.928
are moving in some different way.

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:28.227
Over here, they're kind of
moving down and to the left.

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:29.947
Here, they're moving kind of quickly up.

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:32.016
Over here, they're
moving more slowly down.

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:34.687
So what you might want
to do is assign a vector

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:37.642
to every single point in space,

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:39.911
and a common attribute of
the way that fluids flow.

00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:43.697
This isn't necessarily
obvious, but if you look

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:46.975
at a given point in space,
let's say like right here,

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:49.290
every time that a particle
passes through it,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.972
it's with roughly the same velocity,

00:00:50.972 --> 00:00:53.072
so you might think over time that velocity

00:00:53.072 --> 00:00:54.399
would change, and sometimes it does.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.241
A lot of times there's some fluid flow

00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:59.530
where it depends on
time, but for many cases

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.737
you can just say, at this point in space,

00:01:02.737 --> 00:01:04.253
whatever particle is going through it,

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:05.807
it'll have this velocity vector.

00:01:05.807 --> 00:01:08.368
So over here, they might
be pretty high upwards,

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.561
whereas here, it's kind of
a smaller vector downwards,

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:16.561
even though, I'll play the
animation a little bit more here,

00:01:17.773 --> 00:01:20.651
and if you imagine doing this
at all of the different points

00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:23.444
in space, and assigning
a vector to describe

00:01:23.444 --> 00:01:26.280
the motion of each fluid
particle at each different point,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.108
what you end up getting is a vector field.

00:01:29.108 --> 00:01:32.216
So this here is a little
bit of a cleaner drawing

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:35.497
than what I have, and as I
mentioned in the last video,

00:01:35.497 --> 00:01:37.984
it's common for these vectors
not to be drawn to scale,

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:39.779
but to all have the
same length, just to get

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:41.764
a sense of direction, and here you can see

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:45.692
each particle is flowing
roughly along that vector,

00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:47.388
so whatever one it's closest to,

00:01:47.388 --> 00:01:49.439
it's moving in that direction.

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.021
And this is not just a really
good way of understanding

00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:54.297
fluid flow, but it goes
the other way around.

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:55.691
It's a really good way of understanding

00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:58.531
vector fields themselves,
so sometimes you might

00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:01.245
just be given some new vector field,

00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:03.826
and to get a feel for what it's all about,

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:06.549
how to interpret it, what
special properties it might have,

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.935
it's actually helpful, even
if it's not meant to represent

00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:11.275
a fluid, to imagine that
it does, and think of all

00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:14.206
the particles, and think of
how they would move along in.

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:18.977
For example, this particular
one, as you play the animation,

00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:22.754
as you let the particles
move along the vectors,

00:02:22.754 --> 00:02:24.644
there's no change in the density.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.661
At no point do a punch
of particles go inward,

00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:28.345
or a bunch of particles go outward,

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:30.305
it stays kind of constant,
and that turns out

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:33.683
to have a certain mathematical
significance down the road.

00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:35.573
You'll see this later on as we study

00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:37.467
a certain concept called divergence.

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:40.872
And over here, you see this vector field,

00:02:40.872 --> 00:02:43.267
and you might want to
understand what it's all about,

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:45.143
and it's kind of helpful
to think of a fluid

00:02:45.143 --> 00:02:48.360
that pushes outward from everywhere,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.624
and is kind of decreasing in
density around the center,

00:02:50.624 --> 00:02:53.747
and that also has a certain
mathematical significance,

00:02:53.747 --> 00:02:56.665
and it might also lead you to
ask certain other questions.

00:02:56.665 --> 00:02:57.936
Like if you look at the fluid flow

00:02:57.936 --> 00:02:59.735
that we started with in this video,

00:02:59.735 --> 00:03:02.083
you might ask a couple
questions about it like

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:04.548
it seems to rotating around some points,

00:03:04.548 --> 00:03:06.808
in this case counter
clockwise, but it's rotating

00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:08.383
clockwise around others still.

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.873
Does that have any kind of
mathematical significance?

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:15.096
Does the fact that there
seem to be the same

00:03:15.096 --> 00:03:16.861
number of particles roughly in this area,

00:03:16.861 --> 00:03:18.518
but they're slowly spilling out there.

00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:20.188
What does that imply for the function

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:23.540
that represents this whole vector field,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.705
and you'll see a lot of this later on,

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.929
especially when I talk
about divergence and curl,

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.938
but here I just wanted to
give a little warmup to that

00:03:29.938 --> 00:03:32.931
as we're just visualizing
multivariable functions.
