00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.377
 

00:00:00.377 --> 00:00:02.960
In this video, I want to talk a
little bit about acceleration.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.090
 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.130
And this is probably
an idea that you're

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.600
somewhat familiar
with, or at least

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.360
you've heard the term
used here or there.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.015
Acceleration is just the
change in velocity over time.

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:25.370
 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.280
Probably one of the most typical
examples of acceleration,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.420
if you're at all
interested in cars,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.000
is that many times
they will give you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510
acceleration numbers, especially
for sport cars, actually

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.350
all cars if you look
up in Consumer Reports,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.600
or wherever they give the
stats on different cars.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.840
They'll tell you something like,
I don't know, like a Porsche--

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.410
and I'm going to make up
these numbers right over here.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.020
So let's say that we
have a Porsche 911.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.960
They'll say that a Porsche 911,
they'll literally measure it

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.672
with a stopwatch, can go
0 to 60 miles per hour.

00:00:58.672 --> 00:01:01.432
 

00:01:01.432 --> 00:01:02.890
And these aren't
the exact numbers,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.819
although I think it's
probably pretty close.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.130
0 to 60 miles per hour
in, let's say, 3 seconds.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.194
 

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:15.610
So, although officially what
they're giving you right here

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.150
are speeds, because
they're only giving you

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.730
magnitude and no
direction, you can

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.355
assume that it's in
the same direction.

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:22.680
I mean, We could
say, 0 miles per hour

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.320
to the east to 60 miles per
hour to the east in 3 seconds.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.740
So what was the
acceleration here?

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.480
So I just told you the
definition of acceleration.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.930
It's change in
velocity over time.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.660
So the acceleration-- and
once again acceleration

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.420
is a vector quantity.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.990
You want to know not only
how much is velocity changing

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.870
over time, you also care
about the direction.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.370
It also makes sense
because velocity

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.580
itself is a vector quantity.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.060
It needs magnitude
and direction.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.210
So the acceleration
here-- and we're

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.210
just going to assume
that we're going

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.720
to the right, 0 miles per
hour and 60 miles per hour

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.834
to the right-- so it's going
to be change in velocity.

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:05.000
So let me just write it
down with different notation

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.583
just so you could
familiarize yourself

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:08.479
if you see it in the
textbook this way.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.780
So change in velocity.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.930
This delta symbol right
here just means "change in."

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.580
Change in velocity over time.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.910
It's really, as I've
mentioned in previous videos,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.980
it's really time is
really a change in time.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.830
But we could just
write time here.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.710
This 3 seconds is
really change in time.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.282
It might have been, if you
looked at your second hand,

00:02:35.282 --> 00:02:37.740
it might have been 5 seconds
when it started, and then my 8

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.850
seconds when it stopped, so
it took a total of 3 seconds.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.910
So time is really a
change in seconds.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.750
But we'll just go with time
right here, or just with a t.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.830
So what's our
change in velocity?

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.780
So our final velocity
is 60 miles per hour.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.700
 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.700
And our original velocity
was 0 miles per hour.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.950
So it's 60 minus
0 miles per hour.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.400
And then, what is our time?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.500
What is our time over here?

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.240
Well, our time is, or we could
even say our change in time,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.260
our change in time is 3 seconds.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.120
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.890
So this gives us 20 miles
per hour, per second.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.310
Let me write this down.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.720
So this becomes,
this top part is 60.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.220
60 divided by 3 is 20.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.460
So we get 20.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.210
But then the units are
little bit strange.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.410
We have miles.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.800
Instead of writing MPH, I'm
going to write miles per hour.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.020
That's the same thing as MPH.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.800
And then we also, in the
denominator, right over here,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.040
have seconds.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.360
Which is a little bit strange.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.030
And as you'll see, the
units for acceleration

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.390
do seem a little bit strange.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.490
But if we think it
through, it actually

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.070
might make a little
bit of sense.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.632
So miles per hour.

00:04:01.632 --> 00:04:03.590
And then we could either
put seconds like this,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.332
or we could write per second.

00:04:06.332 --> 00:04:08.290
And let's just think
about what this is saying,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.040
and then we could get
it all into seconds,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.120
or we could all get into
hours, whatever we like.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.810
This is saying that every
second, this Porsche 911

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.560
can increase its velocity
by 20 miles per hour.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.124
So its acceleration is 20
miles per hour, per second.

00:04:22.124 --> 00:04:24.040
And actually, we should
include the direction,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.200
because we're talking
about vector quantities.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.830
So this is to the east.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.220
So this is east, and then
this is east right over here--

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.670
just so we make sure that
we're dealing with vectors.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.700
You're giving it a
direction, due east.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.350
So every second it can
increase in velocity

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.690
by 20 miles per hour.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.605
So hopefully, with
the way I'm saying it,

00:04:42.605 --> 00:04:43.920
it makes a little bit of sense.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.390
20 miles per hour, per second.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.330
That's exactly what
this is talking about.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.240
Now we could also
write it like this.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.600
This is the same thing
as 20 miles per hour,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.670
because if you take
something and you

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.640
divide by seconds, that's the
same thing as multiplying it

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.070
by 1 over seconds.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.480
So that's miles
per hour-seconds.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.220
 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.320
And although this
is correct, to me

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.410
this makes a little
less intuitive sense.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.750
This one literally says it.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.010
Every second, it's increasing in
velocity by 20 miles per hour.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.424
20 miles per hour increase
in velocity per second.

00:05:20.424 --> 00:05:21.840
So that kind of
makes sense to me.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.150
Here it's saying 20
miles per hour-seconds.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.220
So once again, it's
not as intuitive.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.790
But we can make this so it's
all in one unit of time,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.260
although you don't
really have to.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.240
You can change this
so that you get rid

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.080
of maybe the hours
in the denominator.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.496
And the best way to get rid
of an hour in the denominator,

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:41.080
is by multiplying
it by something

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.110
that has hours in the numerator.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.200
So hour and seconds.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.990
And here, the smaller
unit is the seconds.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.380
So it's 3,600 seconds
for every 1 hour.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.770
Or 1 hour is equal
to 3,600 seconds.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.060
Or 1/3600 of an hour per second.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.060
All of those are legitimate
ways to interpret

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.050
this thing in magenta
right over here.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.030
And then you multiply, do a
little dimensional analysis.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.400
Hour cancels with hour.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:19.330
And then will be
equal to 20/3600.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.840
20/3600 miles per
seconds times seconds.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.560
Or we could say,
miles-- let me write

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.500
it this way-- miles per
seconds times seconds.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.690
Or we could say,
miles per second-- I

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.280
want to do that in
another color-- miles

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.375
per second squared.

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:44.440
 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.030
And we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.700
Divide the numerator
and denominator by 10.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.450
You get 2/360.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.300
Or you could get,
this is the same thing

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:04.210
as, 1/180 miles
per second squared.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.980
And I'll just
abbreviate it like that.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.040
And once again, this 1/180
of a mile, how much is that?

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.457
You might want to
convert to feet.

00:07:11.457 --> 00:07:13.040
But the whole point
in here is, I just

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.830
wanted to show you
that, well, one, how

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.230
do you calculate acceleration?

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.480
And give you a little bit
of a sense of what it means.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.021
And once again, this
right here, when

00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:22.240
you have seconds squared in
the bottom of your units,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.531
it doesn't make a ton of sense.

00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:25.980
But we can rewrite
it like this up here.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:35.650
This is 1/180 miles per second.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.310
And then we divide by
seconds again, per second.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.550
Or maybe I can write
like this, per second,

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.079
where this whole thing
is the numerator.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:47.620
So this makes a
little bit more sense

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.410
from an acceleration
point of view.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.490
1/180 miles per
second, per second.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.400
Every second, this
Porsche 911 is

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:01.400
going to go 1/180 of a
mile per second faster.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.150
And actually, it's
probably more intuitive

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.483
to stick to the miles per
hour, because that's something

00:08:05.483 --> 00:08:07.720
that we have a little
bit more sense on.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.210
And another way to visualize it.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.960
If you were to be
driving that Porsche,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.580
and you were to look at the
speedometer for that Porsche,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.620
and if the acceleration
was constant--

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.030
it's actually not going to
be completely constant--

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.030
and if you look at
speedometer-- let me draw it.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:30.069
So this would be 10,
20, 30, 40, 50, 60.

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:32.360
This is probably not what
the speedometer for a Porsche

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:32.859
looks like.

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:36.520
This is probably more analogous
to a small four cylinder car's

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.530
speedometer.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.740
I suspect the Porsche's
speedometer goes much

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.321
beyond 60 miles per hour.

00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:42.820
But what you would
see for something

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.880
accelerating this fast is,
right when you're starting,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.080
the speedometer
would be right there.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.480
And that every second it would
be 20 miles per hour faster.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.700
So after a second
the speedometer

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.810
would have moved this far.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.310
After another second
the speedometer

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.436
would have moved this far.

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:59.310
And then after another
second the speedometer

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.081
would have moved that far.

00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:02.830
And the entire time
you would have kind of

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.750
been pasted to the
back of your seat.
