00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.190
We're on 76.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.140
In the figure below, line
AB is tangent to

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.000
circle O at point A.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.240
Fair enough.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.040
Secant BD intersects circle
O at points C and D.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.700
Secant just means that
it intersects the

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.800
point at two points.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.590
It's not tangent.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.630
A tangent intersects the circle
at exactly one point.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.020
Secant BD intersects the circle
at points C and D.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:38.850
Measure of arc AC is equal to 70
degrees, and the measure of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.800
arc CD is equal to
110 degrees.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.690
So what do they want
us to figure out?

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.940
What is the measure of ABC?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.650
So what is this angle?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.930
That's what they want
us to figure out.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.080
They want us to figure
out this right here.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.490
That angle.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.690
Let's see what we can do here.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.920
So there's a couple of ways
to think about it.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.940
Well, if you look at it, this
is 70, this is 110, right?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.210
So if you add them, this whole
arc, going for all the way

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.320
around, that's 180 degrees.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.270
So it's actually perfectly
halfway around the circle.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.380
So actually from A to
D is actually a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.010
diameter of the circle.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.760
How do I know that?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.170
Because it goes all the
way around the circle.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.925
The arc length is 180 degrees.

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:37.180
So we can draw-- let me
draw a diameter line.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.710
I don't know if this thing
is drawn to scale.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.230
A to D is actually a diameter
of the circle.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.510
We know that, because that's 180
degrees, the combined arc

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.090
length right there.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.535
And we know, that this line
is tangent at point A.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.180
So that has to be
a right angle.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.050
When you're tangent at point A,
that means your tangent to

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.580
the radius at that point.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.750
Fair enough.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.030
So now let's see what
we can figure out.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.880
We know that this arc
length is 70.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.640
Is there any way to figure out
what this angle right here is?

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.710
Because if we know this angle,
we know this is 90, then we

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.240
could figure out that angle.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.790
And this is something that you
should just learn about

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.730
inscribed angles in a circle.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.670
This is an inscribed angle,
because the vertex touches on

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.460
one of the sides
of the circle.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.700
So an inscribed angle-- and this
is just something good to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.640
memorize, and you could play
around with it to get a little

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.630
bit more intuition about it--
is equal to half of the arc

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.320
length that it intersects.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.790
So this inscribed angle
intersects an arc

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.350
length of 70 degrees.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.410
So this is 35 degrees.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.830
And that's just something
good to know.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.190
That this is going to
be half of whatever

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.510
this arc length is.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:03.370
Now we can figure out x, because
x plus 35 plus 90 is

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.030
equal to 180.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:14.970
You get x plus 35 is equal to
90. x is equal to 90 minus 35

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.660
is 55, which is choice C.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.470
Now there's another way you
can do this, and this is

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.800
another interesting thing
about lines that

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.710
intersect in circles.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.800
It's that this angle measure,
right here, if it's sitting

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.470
outside of the circle-- I think
there might be ones

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.440
sitting inside the circle later
on-- but if it's sitting

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.120
outside of the circle, it's
equal to 1/2 the difference of

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.970
the arc measures that
it intersects.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.980
So for example, it intersects
this arc measure of 70, and it

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.940
also has this arc measure
right here.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.485
When it hits the circle and
intersects at 70 degrees and

00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:02.430
when it exits the circle,
it has this arc measure.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.150
This arc measure we already
figured out.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.290
It's 180 degrees, because
that's 180 degrees.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.850
So you know that this angle
right here, you could say that

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.100
x is equal to 1/2 the difference
of these two arc

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.149
measures, and we can do
that because x is

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.160
outside of the circle.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.100
If x was inside the circle, then
x would be 1/2 the sum of

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.720
the two measures.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.640
So what's the difference?

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.670
It's 180 minus 70.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.910
So that's equal to 1/2 times
110, so that is equal to 55.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.210
So it's nice to see that math
works correctly no matter how

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.190
you do the problem.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.830
Problem 77: In the circle shown
below, the measure of

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.730
arc PR is 140 degrees.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.710
Sure enough.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.530
The measure of angle
RPQ is 50 degrees.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.410
OK, that's 50 degrees.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.360
What is the measure of arc PQ?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.700
What is this arc right there?

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.950
So we could use what we learned
in the last problem.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.760
50 degrees is an inscribed
angle.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.860
So it's going to be half of
the arc length measured in

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.810
degrees, or arc angle, I guess
you could say, of the arc that

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.000
it intercepts.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.880
So this is 50, then this
arc measure is

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.820
going to be 100 degrees.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.630
So what we're trying to figure
out, this arc measure right

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.960
here, it's whatever you
really have left over.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.880
Let's call this x.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:45.570
So we know that x plus 100 plus
140, well, that goes all

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.590
the way around the
circle, right?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.310
That's going to be equal
to 360 degrees.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.120
So you have x plus 240 is
equal to 360 degrees.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.130
Subtract 240 from both sides,
and you get x is

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.080
equal to 120 degrees.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.330
Choice D.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.430
Problem 78: The vertices of
triangle ABC are A is 2 comma

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.370
1, B is 3 comma 4, and
C is 1 comma 3.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.310
If triangle ABC is translated
one unit down-- so one unit

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.890
down means that we're
subtracting 1 from the y's--

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.340
and three units to the left--
so that means you're

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.250
subtracting 3 from the x's-- to
create triangle DEF, what

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.270
are the coordinates of
the vertices of DEF?

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.290
So let's see, we have
A is 2 comma 1.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.830
And that's going to be
translated to point D.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.330
What do they say?

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.570
One unit down.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.270
One unit down means the
y decreases by 1.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.500
So the y-coordinate's going
to be-- decrease that

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.180
by 1, you get 0.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.300
And three units to the left,
that means you decrease the

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.190
x-coordinate by 3.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.260
So 2 minus 3 is negative one.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.170
Actually, just looking at the
choices, we're already done.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.150
D is the only choice that had
a negative 1 comma 0.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.530
But let's look at
the other ones.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.120
Maybe somehow they changed the
lettering or something.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.916
Let's see point B
was 3 comma 4.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.290
So what do we do?

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.850
With x, we said three units
to the left, so that

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.580
becomes point E.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.020
So you take this three
units to left.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.630
You're subtracting 3 from
there, that becomes 0.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.170
If you take the y-coordinate
one unit down,

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.260
that becomes a 3.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.000
So E is 0 comma 3.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.270
So that's still consistent
with this.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.300
And let's just make sure
that the F works.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.625
So C was 1 comma 3.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.530
If we take 3 away, we shift it
to the left by 3, so that's

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.110
taking 3 away from the
x-coordinate, so

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.590
that's minus 2.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.320
And if you're shifting the
y-coordinate down one, that's

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.220
taking 1 from it, so that's 3,
so F is minus 2 comma 2.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.090
And so D was definitely
the answer.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:20.460
Problem 79: If triangle ABC is
rotated 180 degrees about the

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.640
origin, what are the coordinates
of A prime?

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.390
OK, so we're going to rotate
this thing 180 degrees.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.390
And essentially, we can worry
about all the coordinates, but

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.270
they just want to know where A
prime is, so wherever A sits

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.220
after we've rotated it.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.650
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.370
When we've rotated the C, this
is going to be the new C.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.620
It's going to be right there.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.130
B is going to be, when you
rotate it-- I just want to

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.330
make sure I'm doing
this right.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.870
This is almost like a
visualization problem.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:12.310
If you go four to the
right and up three.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.190
So if you were to rotate
it around.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.710
Let's say this little arrow I
drew with the four, if I were

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.450
to rotate that 180 degrees-- I
just want to make sure I do it

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.850
right-- then that's going
to be four this way.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.740
So you're going to
be at that point.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.330
And then instead of three up,
you're going to go three down.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.950
So that's where A prime
is going to be.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.790
Right at that point.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.010
And that's the point minus
five comma minus four.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.440
And that's our answer.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.020
But let's figure out all
of the other points.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:01.360
So B, you go up three and
to the right two.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.870
The new B, you'd go three
down to the left.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:24.560
OK, it would be there.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.530
So that's the new B.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:25.870
Right.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.370
And so that looks right.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.310
That's what the triangle
is going to look like.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.170
This is B prime, this is A
prime, this is C prime.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.010
This is the new triangle when
you rotate it 180 degrees.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.040
That was a challenging
visualization problem, but the

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.620
key thing is just to
keep visualizing

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.900
going around 180 degrees.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.660
So minus five comma
minus four, that's

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.160
choice A for A prime.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:58.930
Problem 80: Trapezoid ABCD below
is to be translated to

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.750
trapezoid A prime, B prime,
C prime, D prime by the

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.610
following motion rule.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.000
What will be the coordinates
of vertex C prime?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.780
OK, so that's all we have
to worry about.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.100
We're at C and we're going to
translate it to some C prime.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.350
What of the coordinates of C?

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:22.220
x is equal to five, and
y is equal to 1.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.210
So what's C prime going
to be equal to?

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.280
C prime, we'll just use
this mapping rule.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.290
You add 3 to the x, so it's
going to be 8, and you

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.000
subtract 4 from the y.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.600
1 minus 4 is minus 3.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.980
8 minus 3.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.880
That's choice D.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.610
And we're all done.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.195
We're all done with the entire
California Standards geometry

00:11:45.195 --> 00:11:48.870
test. And frankly, I started
off grumbling a little bit,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.300
because I thought they were
getting a little bit too

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.740
obsessed with the terminology.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.730
But overall, I think this was a
pretty good test. And if you

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.790
understood every problem on this
exam, I think you know

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.670
your geometry pretty well.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.930
Anyway, see you in the next
video, although this is the

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.380
last in this geometry series.
