00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.200
- [Voiceover] So let's do
another curvature example.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.380
This time, I'll just take
a two-dimensional curve,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.547
so it'll have two different
components, x of t and y of t

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:14.994
and the specific components here will be

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.574
t minus the sine of t,

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:21.684
t minus sine of t,

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:24.267
and then one minus cosine of t.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.000
One minus cosine of t.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.780
This is actually the curve,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.680
if you watched the very
first video that I did

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.797
about curvature introducing
it, this is that curve.

00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:35.618
This is the curve that I said,

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.078
"Imagine that it's a
road and you're driving

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:39.678
"along it, and if your
steering wheel gets stuck,

00:00:39.678 --> 00:00:41.318
"you're thinking of the
circle that you trace out

00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:44.318
"as a result and it
various different points

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:46.498
"you're gonna be turning it
various different amounts,"

00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:50.118
so the circle that your
car ends up tracing out

00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:51.758
would be of varying sizes.

00:00:51.758 --> 00:00:54.198
So if the curvature's high,
if you're steering a lot,

00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:56.708
radius of curvature is
low and things like that.

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:59.657
So here, let's actually compute it.

00:00:59.657 --> 00:01:01.858
And in the last example I walked through

00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:04.926
thinking in terms of the derivative

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:07.798
of the unit-tangent vector
with respect to arc length

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:09.638
but in this case, instead of doing that,

00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:11.538
I just want to show what it looks like

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:15.658
when we take the explicit
formula that looks like

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:18.638
x prime times y double-prime,

00:01:18.638 --> 00:01:21.978
minus y prime times x double-prime,

00:01:21.978 --> 00:01:24.561
and then all of that divided by

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.202
x prime squared plus y prime squared.

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:31.819
And then I'm writing x
prime and y prime and such

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.598
and all of these you should think of as

00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:34.799
taking in the variable t.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.159
I'm must being a little
too lazy to write it.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.999
And you take that to
the three-halves power.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.339
So, this was the formula

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:44.099
and I'm not a huge fan
of memorizing formulas

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:45.639
and then hoping to apply them later.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.339
I really do think the one
thing you should take away

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.499
from curvature is the idea that

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.606
it's the derivative of
the unit-tangent vector

00:01:51.606 --> 00:01:53.039
with respect to arc length

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.139
and if you need to, you can just look up

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:57.040
a formula like this but
it's worth pointing out

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.820
that it makes some things easier

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.320
to compute because
finding the tangent vector

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.356
and everything can be
kind of like reinventing

00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:05.019
the wheel when you already
have the results here.

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:07.012
So, first thing to do is just find

00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:09.578
x prime, y double-prime,

00:02:09.578 --> 00:02:11.339
y prime and x double prime.

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.719
So let's go ahead and write those out.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.519
So the first derivative of x of t

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.719
if we go up here that's t minus sine of t.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.302
So its derivative is
one minus cosine of t.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.359
And the derivative of the y component

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.879
of one minus cosine t,

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:30.962
y prime of t,

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:36.900
is gonna be, derivative
of cosine is negative sine

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.940
so negative derivative of that is sine,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.339
and that one goes to a constant,

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:46.560
and then when we take the second
derivatives of those guys,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.240
so maybe change the color for
the second derivative here,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.073
x double prime of the,

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.819
so now we're taking
the derivative of this,

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:55.959
which actually we just did because

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.979
by coincidence the first derivative of x

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.097
is also the y component

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:02.597
so that also equals sine of t.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.806
And then y double prime is just
the derivative of sine here

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.867
so that's just gonna
be cosine, cosine of t.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.620
So now, when we just
plug those four values

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.405
in for kappa, for our
curvature, what we get

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:24.738
is x prime was one minus cosine of t,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.614
multiplied by y double
prime is cosine of t.

00:03:32.614 --> 00:03:33.614
Cosine of t.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.900
We subtract off from that y prime,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.249
which is sine of t,

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.082
sine of t,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.800
multiplied by x double prime.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.960
So x double prime is also sine of t,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.900
so I could just say

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.576
sine of t squared,

00:03:49.576 --> 00:03:53.743
and the whole thing is
divided by x prime squared

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.953
so x prime was one minus cosine of t,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.700
minus cosine of t,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.117
squared, plus y prime squared

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.300
so y prime was just sine,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.583
so that's just gonna be sine squared of t.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:14.500
And that whole thing to
the power three halves.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.580
And that's your answer, right?

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.720
You apply the formula, you get the answer.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.833
So for example, when I
was drawing this curve

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:25.040
and kind of telling the
computer to draw out

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.620
the appropriate circle,
I didn't go through

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.521
the entire "find the unit tangent vector,

00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:31.961
"differentiate it with respect
with arc length" process,

00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:33.433
even though that's decently easy to do

00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:35.687
in the case of things
like circles or helixes

00:04:35.687 --> 00:04:37.208
but instead I just went to that formula.

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:39.037
I looked it up because I had forgotten

00:04:39.037 --> 00:04:41.979
and I found the radius
of curvature that way.
