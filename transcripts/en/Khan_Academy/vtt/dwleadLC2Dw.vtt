00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
Let's say I'm some type of the Investment Bank.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.580
Can I go out there and I buy a whole bunch of mortgages.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.470
So right here are a whole bunch of people's mortgages.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.510
And when I say buy a mortgage

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.450
it means the home-owners who borrow the money

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.350
instead of the money going to the mortgage broker

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.560
whom the home-owner think they got the loan from the servicer

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.120
who they think they are paying the check to.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.280
Since I now have bought these mortgages,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.010
I've essentially become the lender to the home-owner,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.970
and so the home-owner's morgage payment

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.970
will now come to me the Investment Bank .

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.640
So I do this for a bunch of home-owners right over there.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.550
But I don't want to be the end holder of the paper.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.630
I really want to be the intermediary.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.630
So what I do is I set up a Special Purpose Entity,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.100
which is really just a corporation that I set up.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.520
And I stick all of the mortgages inside

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.300
that Special Purpose Entity.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900
So I stick them all inside of that.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.770
So now the Special Purpose Entity is the owner of the mortgages .

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.340
The investment bank at least starting off

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.810
with all of the shares of the Special Purpose Entity.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.130
And so the Investment Bank could then sell shares.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.710
It could split the Special Purpose Entity

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.400
into a million or ten million shares

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.180
and then sell those shares to investors.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.860
And these shares would be called Mortgage-Backed Securities.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.000
or sometimes MBSes.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.060
There are a part of a general class called Asset-Backed Securities

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.840
because what is going to happen now is that all of this money

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.410
flowing from home-owners will go the mortgages

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.160
which is now on the Specail Purpose Entity.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.850
So all ended up inside the Special Purpose Entities .

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.440
And some of them will default,some of them won't.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.800
But on average this Special Purpose Entity

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.910
will then be able to pay a dividend.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.080
Essentially you can almost fueled on interest

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.280
to the owner of the Mortgage-Backed Security.
