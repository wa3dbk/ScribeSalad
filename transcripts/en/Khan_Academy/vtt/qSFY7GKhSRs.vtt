00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.000
I've already told you multiple
times that big, uppercase U is

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.754
the internal energy
of a system.

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:10.220
And it's really everything
thrown in there.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.490
It's the kinetic energy
of the molecules.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.700
It has the potential energy if
the molecules are vibrating.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.660
It has the chemical energy
of the bonds.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.060
It has the potential energy of
electrons that want to get

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.590
some place.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.200
But, for our sake, and
especially if we're kind of in

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.130
an introductory chemistry,
physics, or thermodynamics

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.229
course, let's just assume that
we're talking about a system

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.570
that's an ideal gas.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.500
And even better, it's a kind
of a monoatomic ideal gas.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.390
So everything in on my system
are just individual atoms. So

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.200
in that case, the only energy in
the system is all going to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.310
be the kinetic energy of each
of these particles.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.080
So what I want to do in this
video-- it's going to get a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.780
little bit mathy, but I think
it'll be satisfying for those

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.880
of you who stick with it-- is
to relate how much internal

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.010
energy there really is in a
system of a certain pressure,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.850
volume, or temperature.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.060
So we want to relate pressure,
volume, or temperature to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.190
internal energy.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.730
Notice all the videos we've done
up until now, I just said

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.420
what's the change in
internal energy.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.810
And we related that to the heat
put into or taken out of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.600
a system, or the work
done, or done to,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.760
or done by the system.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.490
But now, let's just say before
we do any work or any heat,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.445
how do we know how much internal
energy we even have

00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:25.680
in a system?

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.770
And to do this, let's do a
little bit of a thought

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.800
experiment.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.740
There is a bit of a
simplification I'll make here.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.130
But I think you'll find it OK,
or reasonably satisfying.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.210
So let's say-- let me just
draw it-- I have a cube.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.810
And something tells me that I
might have already done this

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.230
pseudo-proof in the physics play
list. Although, I don't

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.090
think I related exactly
to internal energy.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.930
So I'll do that here.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.160
Let's say my system
is this cube.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.180
And let's say the dimensions
of the cube

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.110
are x in every direction.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.010
So it's x high, x wide,
and x deep.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.510
So its volume is, of course,
x to the third.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.389
And let's say I have
n particles in my

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.600
system, capital N.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.480
I could have written lowercase
n moles, but let's just keep

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.260
it straightforward.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.510
I have N particles.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.810
So they're all doing
what they will.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.030
Now, this is where I'm going
to make the gross

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.100
simplification.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.610
But I think it's reasonable.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.210
So in a normal system, every
particle, and we've done this

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.410
before, is just bouncing off
in every which way, every

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.330
possible random direction.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.950
And that's what, when they
ricochet off of each of the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.420
sides, that's what causes
the pressure.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.750
And they're always bumping into
each other, et cetera, et

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.360
cetera, in all random
directions.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.170
Now, for the sake of simplicity
of our mathematics,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.000
and just to be able to do it
in a reasonable amount of

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.120
time, I'm going to make
an assumption.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.340
I'm going to make an assumption
that 1/3 of the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.210
particles are going-- well, 1/3
of the particles are going

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.730
parallel to each of the axes.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.660
So 1/3 of the particles are
going in this direction, I

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.710
guess we could say,
left to right.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.440
1/3 of the particles are
going up and down.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.970
And then 1/3 of the particles
are going forward and back.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.520
Now, we know that this isn't
what's going in reality, but

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.350
it makes our math
a lot simpler.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.640
And if you actually were to do
the statistical mechanics

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.370
behind all of the particles
going in every which way, you

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.350
would actually end up getting
the same result.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.820
Now, with that said, I'm
saying it's a gross

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.590
oversimplification.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.840
There is some infinitesimally
small chance that we actually

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.120
do fall onto a system where
this is already the case.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.860
And we'll talk a little bit
later about entropy and why

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.400
it's such a small probability.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.200
But this could actually
be our system.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.720
And this system would
generate pressure.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.420
And it makes our math
a lot simpler.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.770
So with that said, let's
study this system.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.070
So let's take a sideways view.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.010
Let's take a sideways
view right here.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.800
And let's just study
one particle.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.280
Maybe I should have
done it in green.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.670
But let's say I have
one particle.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.660
It has some mass, m, and
some velocity, v.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.890
And this is one of the capital
N particles in my system.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.190
But what I'm curious is how
much pressure does this

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.010
particle exert on this
wall right here?

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.180
We know what the area of
this wall is, right?

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.260
The area of this wall
is x times x.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.740
So it's x squared area.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.910
How much force is being exerted
by this particle?

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:44.880
Well, let's think about
it this way.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.960
It's going forward, or left
to right just like this.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.240
And the force will be exerted
when it changes its momentum.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.420
I'll do a little bit of review
of kinetics right here.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.800
We know that force is equal to
mass times acceleration.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.700
We know acceleration can be
written as, which is equal to

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:10.630
mass times, change in velocity
over change in time.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.940
And, of course, we know that
this could be rewritten as

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.800
this is equal to-- mass is a
constant and shouldn't change

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.500
for the physics we deal
with-- so it's delta.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.140
We could put that inside
of the change.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.820
So it's delta mv over
change in time.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.730
And this is just change
in momentum, right?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.890
So this is equal to change in
momentum over change in time.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.030
So that's another way
to write force.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.560
So what's the change
in momentum going

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.980
to be for this particle?

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.800
Well, it's going to bump
into this wall.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.180
In this direction, right now,
it has some momentum.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.250
Its momentum is equal to mv.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.420
And it's going to bump into this
wall, and then going to

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.130
ricochet straight back.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.530
And what's its momentum
going to be?

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.990
Well, it's going to
have the same mass

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.220
and the same velocity.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.190
We'll assume it's a completely
elastic collision.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.270
Nothing is lost to heat
or whatever else.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.980
But the velocity is in
the other direction.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.640
So the new momentum is going
to be minus mv, because the

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.380
velocity has switched
directions.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.590
Now, if I come in with a
momentum of mv, and I ricochet

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.950
off with a momentum of
minus mv, what's

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.890
my change in momentum?

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.720
My change in momentum, off of
that ricochet, is equal to--

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.220
well, it's the difference
between these two,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.470
which is just 2mv.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.230
Now, that doesn't give
me the force.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.860
I need to know the change in
momentum per unit of time.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.840
So how often does this happen?

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.410
How frequently?

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.040
Well, it's going to happen
every time we come here.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.020
We're going to hit this wall.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.670
Then the particle is going to
have to travel here, bounce

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.080
off of that wall, and
then come back

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.370
here and hit it again.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.600
So that's how frequently
it's going to happen.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.280
So how long of an interval do
we have to wait between the

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.450
collisions?

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.040
Well, the particle has to
travel x going back.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.300
It's going to collide.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.790
It's going to have to travel
x to the left.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.090
This distance is x.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.890
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.720
This distance right here is x.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.310
It's going to have to
travel x to go back.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.800
Then it's going to have
to travel x back.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.740
So it's going to have to
travel 2x distance.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.060
And how long will it take it
to travel 2x distance?

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.100
Well, the time, delta T, is
equal to, we know this.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.710
Distance is equal to
rate times time.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:29.390
Or if we do distance divided by
rate, we'll get the amount

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.630
of time we took.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.900
This is just our basic
motion formula.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.500
Our delta T, the distance
we have to

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.830
travel is back and forth.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.040
So it's 2 x's, divided
by-- what's our rate?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.720
Well, our rate is
our velocity.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.970
Divided by v.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.260
There you go.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.440
So this is our delta
T right here.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:08:03.680
So our change in momentum per
time is equal to 2 times our

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.620
incident momentum.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.500
Because we ricocheted back with
the same magnitude, but

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.430
negative momentum.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.475
So that's our change
in momentum.

00:08:09.475 --> 00:08:12.890
And then our change in time
is this value over here.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.380
It's the total distance we
have to travel between

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.800
collisions of this wall, divided
by our velocity.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:27.920
So it is, 2x divided by v, which
is equal to 2mv times

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.780
the reciprocal of this-- so
this is just fraction

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.755
math-- v over 2x.

00:08:32.755 --> 00:08:34.010
And what is this equal to?

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.710
The 2's cancel out.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:41.710
So that is equal to mv
squared, over x.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.260
Interesting.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.250
We're getting someplace
interesting already.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.590
And if it doesn't seem too
interesting, just hang on with

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:48.260
me for a second.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.520
Now, this is the force being
applied by one particle, is

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.730
this-- force from one particle
on this wall.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.840
Now, what was the area?

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.090
We care about the pressure.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.610
We wrote it up here.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.890
The pressure is equal to
the force per area.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.160
So this is the force
of that particle.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.570
So that's mv squared
over x, divided by

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.840
the area of the wall.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.730
Well, what's the area
of the wall?

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.200
The area of the wall here,
each sideis x.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.610
And so if we draw the wall
there, it's x times x.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.360
It's x squared.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.390
So divided by the area of
the wall, is x squared.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.250
And what does this equal?

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:52.370
This is equal to mv squared
over x cubed.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.790
You can just say, this is times
1 over x squared, when

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.760
this all becomes x cubed.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.530
This is just fraction math.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.120
So now we have an interesting
thing.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:07.160
The pressure due to this one
particle-- let's just call

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:14.220
this from this one particle--
is equal to m v

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.750
squared over x cubed.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.650
Now, what's x cubed?

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.960
That's the volume of
our container.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.210
Over the volume.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:27.120
I'll do that in a
big V, right?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.130
So let's see if we can relate
this to something else that's

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.630
interesting.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.820
So that means that the pressure
being exerted by this

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.220
one particle-- well, actually
let me just take another step.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.280
So this is one particle
on this wall, right?

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.900
This is from one particle
on this wall.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.890
Now, of all the particles-- we
have N particles in our cube--

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.860
what fraction of them
are going to be

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.170
bouncing off of this wall?

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.730
That are going to be doing
the exact same

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.950
thing as this particle?

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.820
Well, I just said.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.380
1/3 are going to be going
in this direction.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.820
1/3 are going to be
going up and down.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.930
And 1/3 are going to go
be going in and out.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.420
So if I have N total particles,
N over 3 are going

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.195
to be doing exactly what this
particle is going to be doing.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.350
This is the pressure
from one particle.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.850
If I wanted the pressure from
all of the particles on that

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.960
wall-- so the total pressure
on that wall is going to be

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.000
from N over 3 of
the particles.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.990
The other particles aren't
bouncing off that wall.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.700
So we don't have to
worry about them.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.620
So if we want the total pressure
on that wall-- I'll

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.150
just write, pressure
sub on the wall.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.060
Total pressure on the wall is
going to be the pressure from

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:37.400
one particle, mv squared, over
our volume, times the total

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.950
number of particles
hitting the wall.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.750
The total number of particles
is N divided by 3, because

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.270
only 3 will be going
in that direction.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.800
So, the total pressure on that
wall is equal to mv squared,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.790
over our volume of our
container, times the total

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.115
particles divided by 3.

00:11:54.115 --> 00:11:57.610
Let's see if we can manipulate
this thing a little bit.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.420
So if we multiply both sides
by-- let's see what we can do.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:14.390
If we multiply both sides by 3v,
we get pv times 3 is equal

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:21.730
to mv squared, times N, where N
is the number of particles.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.580
Let's divide both sides by N.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:34.270
So we get 3pv over-- actually,
no, let me leave the N there.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:41.240
Let's divide both sides
of this equation by 2.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.520
So we get, what do we get?

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.320
We get 3/2 pv is equal to--
now this is interesting.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.780
It's equal to N, the number of
particles we have, times mv

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.920
squared over 2.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.610
Remember, I just divided
this equation right

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.650
here by 2 to get this.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.280
And I did this for a very
particular reason.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.260
What is mv squared over 2?

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.910
mv squared over 2 is the kinetic
energy of that little

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.140
particle we started off with.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.900
That's the formula for
kinetic energy.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:20.070
Kinetic energy is equal
to mv squared over 2.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.950
So this is the kinetic energy
of one particle.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.890
Now, we're multiplying that
times the total number of

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.280
particles we have, times N.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.890
So N times the kinetic energy of
one particle is going to be

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.490
the kinetic energy of
all the particles.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.430
And, of course, we also made
another assumption.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.160
I should state that I assumed
that all the particles are

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.510
moving with the same velocity
and have the same mass.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.880
In a real situation, the
particles might have very

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.060
different velocities.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.980
But this was one of our
simplifying assumptions.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.850
So, we just assumed they
all have that.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.890
So, if I multiply N times that--
this statement right

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.285
here-- is the kinetic energy
of the system.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.140
Now, we're almost there.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.480
In fact, we are there.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.610
We just established that the
kinetic energy of the system

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.730
is equal to 3/2 times the
pressure, times the volume of

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:13.650
the system.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.270
Now, what is the kinetic
energy of the system?

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.320
It's the internal energy.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.290
Because we said all the energy
in the system, because it's a

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.900
simple ideal monoatomic gas,
all of the energy in the

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.770
system is in kinetic energy.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:30.980
So we could say the internal
energy of the system is equal

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.370
to-- that's just the total
kinetic energy of the system--

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:38.020
it's equal to 3/2 times our
total pressure, times our

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:38.620
total volume.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.070
Now you might say, hey, Sal,
you just figured out the

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.130
pressure on this side.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.960
What about the pressure on that
side, and that side, and

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.730
that side, or on every
side of the cube?

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:46.850
Well, the pressure on
every side of the

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.250
cube is the same value.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.530
So all we have to do is find
in terms of the pressure on

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.420
one side, and that's essentially
the pressure of

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.480
the system.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.590
So what else can we
do with that?

00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:00.700
Well, we know that pv is equal
to nRT, our ideal gas formula.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:06.475
pv is equal to nRT, where this
is the number of moles of gas.

00:15:06.475 --> 00:15:08.410
And this is the ideal
gas constant.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.240
This is our temperature
in kelvin.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.880
So if we make that replacement,
we'll say that

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.140
internal energy can also be
written as 3/2 times the

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.500
number of moles we have, times
the ideal gas constant, times

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.290
our temperature.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.560
Now, I did a lot of work, and
it's a little bit mathy.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.780
But these results are,
one, interesting.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.140
Because now you have a
direct relationship.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.860
If you know the pressure and the
volume, you know what the

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.530
actual internal energy, or
the total kinetic energy,

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.660
of the system is.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.350
Or, if you know what the
temperature and the number of

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.320
molecules you have are, you also
know what the internal

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.630
energy of the system is.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.520
And there's a couple of key
takeaways I want you to have.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.070
If the temperature does not
change in our ideal situation

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.930
here-- if delta T is equal to
0-- if this doesn't change,

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.680
the number particles aren't
going to change.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:04.750
Then our internal energy does
not change as well.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.030
So if we say that there is
some change in internal

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.790
energy, and I'll use this in
future proofs, we could say

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:16.360
that that's equal to 3/2 times
nR times-- well, the only

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.850
thing that can change, not the
number molecules or the ideal

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.350
gas constant-- times
the change in T.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:27.000
Or, it could also be written as
3/2 times the change in pv.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.450
We don't know if either
of these are constant.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.520
So we have to say the change
in the product.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.780
Anyway, this was a
little bit mathy.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.050
And I apologize for it.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.840
But hopefully, it gives you a
little bit more sense that

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.300
this really is just the sum
of all the kinetic energy.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.420
We related it to some of these
macro state variables, like

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.590
pressure, volume, and time.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.640
And now, since I've done the
video on it, we can actually

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.990
use this result in
future proofs.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.220
Or at least you won't complain
too much if I do.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.470
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
