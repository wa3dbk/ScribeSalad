00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.970
Rewrite the expression five
times 9 minus 4-- that's in

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.130
parentheses-- using the
distributive law of

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.980
multiplication over
subtraction.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.550
Then simplify.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.930
So let me just rewrite it.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:24.830
This is going to be 5 times
9 minus 4, just like that.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.100
Now, if we want to use the
distributive property, well,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.710
you don't have to.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.880
You could just evaluate
9 minus 4 and then

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.500
multiply that times 5.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380
But if you want to use the
distributive property, you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.560
distribute the 5.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.090
You multiply the 5 times the 9
and the 4, so you end up with

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:50.175
5 times 9 minus 5 times 4.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.920
Notice, we distributed the 5.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.810
We multiplied it times
both the 9 and the 4.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.680
In the first distributive
property video, we gave you an

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.370
idea of why you have to
distribute the 5, why it makes

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.005
sense, why you don't just
multiply it by the 9.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.010
And we're going to verify that
it gives us the same answer as

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.890
if we just evaluated the 9 minus
4 first. But anyway,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.950
what are these things?

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.310
So 5 times 9, that is 45.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.480
So we have 45 minus--
what's 5 times 4?

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.970
Well, that's 20.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.400
45 minus 20, and that is equal
to 25, so this is using the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.970
distributive property
right here.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.980
If we didn't want to use the
distributive property, if we

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.780
just wanted to evaluate what's
in the parentheses first, we

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.300
would have gotten-- let's go in
this direction-- 5 times--

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.890
what's 9 minus 4?

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.940
9 minus 4 is 5.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.810
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.980
5 times 9 minus 4.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.010
So it's 5 times 5.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.460
5 times 5 is just 25,
so we get the same

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.630
answer either way.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.890
This is using the distributive
law of multiplication over

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.930
subtraction, usually just
referred to as the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.340
distributive property.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.600
This is evaluating the inside
of the parentheses first and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.190
then multiplying by 5.
