00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.610
Use less than or greater than
for this little brackets thing

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.800
to write a true sentence.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.920
So they essentially want us to
say whether 45.675 is greater

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.350
than or less than 45.645.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.060
So let's look at each
of these numbers.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.780
I'm just going to write them
on top of each other.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.090
So the first a number is
forty-five and six hundred and

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.610
seventy-five thousandths and
the second number is

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.730
forty-five and six hundred and
forty-five thousandths.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.920
Now when you look at everything
here, the only

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.670
place where these two numbers
are different is in the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.130
hundredths place.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.980
We have 7 hundredths here and
we have 4 hundredths here.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.790
Everything is the same,
so this number

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.750
is going to be greater.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.580
This number is a greater than
45.645, or six-hundred and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.960
forty-five thousandths.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.250
Let me write that down
just to make sure we

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.980
know what we're doing.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.910
Forty-five and six hundred and
seventy-five thousandths, or

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:24.440
45.675, is definitely greater
than 45.645, or forty-five and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.510
six hundred and forty-five
thousandths.
