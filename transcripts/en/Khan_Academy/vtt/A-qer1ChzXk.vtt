00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.510
Welcome back.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.130
I was running out of time in
the last video and I was

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.630
afraid that I was jumbling up
the problem just to get in

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.700
under the wire.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.780
So I just drew the triangle.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.950
Actually, let me do it over
since I have all the time in

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.380
the world now.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.660
Because I really want
you to get this.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.720
So the original parallelogram
looks like this.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.820
This is a diagonal.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.450
And they tell us that all of
these sides are congruent, so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.070
that means that they're
all the same length.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.500
So this side is equal to the
side is equal to this side,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.050
this side is equal
to this side.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.930
So that also tells you these
are both equilateral

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.730
triangles, all the sides are
equals so all these angles,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.830
this must be 60, this must be
60, this must be 60, this must

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.390
be 60, 60 and 60.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.770
Now what else do we know?

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:12.180
They want us to figure out the
ratio of this diagonal, the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.020
long diagonal to this shorter
diagonal right here.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.300
We know the shorter diagonals
of length 1.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.260
And with parallelograms, you
might already kind of know

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.830
this, and actually we could
prove this to you.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.490
Since all of these lines
are congruent, we know

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.010
that-- we know what?

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.130
What is this angle right here?

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.130
What is half of-- this line
is going to bisect

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.990
both of these angles.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.470
How do we know?

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.040
Well if it didn't bisect
it, all the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.420
sides wouldn't be congruent.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.670
So we know that this side is 30,
this side is 30, this is

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.080
30, this is 30.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.500
And we also know that for any
parallelogram-- actually for

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.940
any rhombus-- the two soon.
diagonals are going to be

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.980
perpendicular bisectors
of each other.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.940
It's not true for any
parallelogram, it's only true

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.940
when the sides are
all congruent.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.750
In this situation, and we
already know this because this

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.830
is a 30 degree angle, this is
a 60 degree angle, so what

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.200
does this have to be?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.496
This has to be a 90 degree
angle because they have

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:22.470
to add up to 180.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.100
So let's just pick numbers.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.570
Let's say that this side is 1,
this side is 1, this side is

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.990
1, this side is 1.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.770
Then this entire diagonal here
would be 1, half of it would

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.540
be 1/2, this would be 1/2,
this would be 1/2.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.490
If we didn't know it was 1/2, we
could just say well this is

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.770
a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.230
So the 30 degree side is
1/2 of the hypotenuse.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.730
And then what else do we know
about 30, 60, 90 triangles?

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.030
The 60 degree side is squares
of 3 times the shorter side.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.180
So this side is going to be
square root of 3 over 2.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.990
And all we did is we realized
that this is

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.310
a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.320
And then we were using the
principle of 30, 60, 90

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.240
triangle to figure out that
the side opposite the 60

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.880
degree side is square
root of 3 over 2.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.770
If that side is square root of
3 over 2, then this is also

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.810
square root of 3 over 2.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.650
So what's this entire length?

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.310
It'd be square root of 3 over
2 plus square root of 3 over

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.300
2, which is equal to
square root of 3.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.260
You add two halves of anything
you get the whole.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.760
So the square roots of 3.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.020
So the purple diagonal is square
roots of 3, and what is

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.640
this-- this was d and c.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.890
This is ac.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.540
So we know that ac is equal
to the square root of 3.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.120
And we also know that d-- I'm
sorry, this is a b-- db is

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.700
equal to 1.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.920
We just defined it as 1.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.220
So the ratio of ac to bd or
db is going to be square

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.420
root of 3 to 1.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.580
And that is choice B.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.910
I hope I didn't confuse you.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.360
Next section-- actually, we just
finished that section.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.820
I'll see you
