00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.440
Welcome back.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.440
When I left off I was rushing
at the end of this problem

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.510
because I tend to rush at the
end of problems when I am

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.160
getting close to the YouTube
10 minute limit.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.680
But I just wanted to review the
end of it because I feel

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.520
like I rushed it.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.660
And then, actually continue with
it and actually solve for

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.970
the angle and then, introduce
a little bit of-- a little

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.280
more trigonometry.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.240
So just to review what we did,
we said momentum is conserved

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.270
and in two dimensions that means
momentum is conserved in

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.650
each of the dimensions.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.040
So we figured out what the
initial momentum of the entire

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.920
system was and we said, well,
in the x direction, the

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.070
initial momentum-- and all the
momentum was coming from the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.440
ball A right.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.110
Because ball B wasn't moving,
so its velocity was 0.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.570
So its momentum was 0.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.300
So ball A in the x direction and
it was only moving in the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.190
x direction.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.390
So it's momentum in the x
direction was 3 meters per

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.610
second times 10 kilogram
meters per second.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.050
And we got 30 kilogram
meters per second.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.960
And then there was no momentum
in the y direction.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.680
And then we knew that well after
they hit each other,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.910
ball A kind of ricochets off
at a 30 degree angle at 2

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.110
meters per second.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.430
We used that information to
figure out the x and y

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.700
components of A's velocity.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.840
So A's velocity in the y
direction was 1 meter per

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.420
second and A's velocity
in the x direction was

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.700
square root of 3.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.090
And we used that information to
figure out A's momentum in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.060
each direction.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.010
We said well, the momentum in
the y direction must be 1

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.600
meter per second times A's mass,
which is 10 kilogram

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.370
meters per second.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.170
Which I wrote-- what
I wrote here.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.800
And then we figured out A's
momentum in the B direction

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.550
and we said well, that's
just going to be square

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.700
root of 3 times 10.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.070
And that's 10 square
root of 3.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.040
And then we used that
information to

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.680
solve for B's momentum.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.070
Because we said well, B's
momentum plus A's momentum in

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.350
the x direction has
to add up to 30.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.680
This was the x direction
before.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.000
And we knew that B's momentum
plus A's momentum in the y

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.220
direction had to add
up to 0, right?

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.430
And so, since y's momentum going
upwards was 10 kilogram

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.580
meters per second, we knew
that B's momentum going

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.550
downwards would also
have to be 10

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.350
kilogram meters per second.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.190
Or you could even say
it's negative 10.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.870
And we figure that out based
on the fact that B

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.450
had half the mass.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.910
That its velocity going down
was 2 meters per second.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.140
And similarly, we knew that
A's momentum in the x

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.770
direction, which was 10 square
root of 3 kilogram meters per

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.830
second, plus B's momentum
in the x

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.730
direction is equal to 30.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.800
And then we just subtracted out
and we got B's momentum in

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.630
the x direction.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.270
And then we divided by B's
mass to get its velocity.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.150
Which we got as 2.54.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.340
So that's where I left off
and we were rushing.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.140
And already, this gives you a
sense of what B is doing.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.770
Although it's broken up into
the x and y direction.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.800
Now if we wanted to simplify
this, if we wanted to kind of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.470
write B's new velocity the same
way that the problem gave

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.490
us A's velocity, right?

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.090
They told us A's velocity was
2 meters per second at an

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.390
angle of 30 degrees.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.010
We now have to use this
information to figure out B's

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.450
velocity and the angle of it.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.150
And how do we do that?

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.890
Well this is just straight up
trigonometry at this point, or

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.360
really just straight
up geometry.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.400
Let me clear all of this.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.680
And let's remember these two
numbers, 2.54 and minus 2.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:30.590
So B, we learned that in the x
direction its velocity-- this

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.260
is all for B-- is equal to 2.54
meters per second and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.900
then y direction, it
was moving down.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.910
We could write this
as minus 2.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.830
But I'll just write this as 2
meters per second downwards.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.480
Right?

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.970
Same thing.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.820
Minus 2 up is the same thing as
2 meters per second down.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.410
So the resulting vector's
going to look

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.240
something like this.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.725
When you add two vectors you
just put them-- put the one's

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:07.350
end at the beginning of the
other-- put them front to end,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.320
like we did here.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.760
And then you add them
together and this is

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.730
the resulting vector.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.230
And I think you're used
to that at this point.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.510
And now we have to figure out
this angle and this side.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.100
Well this side is easy because
this is a right angle, so we

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.810
use Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.530
So this is going to be the
square root of 2.54 squared

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.460
plus 2 squared.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.860
And what's 2.54 squared?

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:40.880
2.54 times-- whoops.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.840
2.54 times 2.54 is
equal to 6.45.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.530
So that's the square root of
6.45 plus 4, which equals the

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.070
square root of 10.45.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.550
And take the square
root of that.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.800
So that's 3.2, roughly.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.200
So the resulting velocity in
this direction, whatever angle

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.550
this is, is 3.2 meters
per second.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.250
And I just used Pythagorean
theorem.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.440
So now all we have to do is
figure out the angle.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.540
We could use really any of the
trig ratios because we know

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.730
all of the sides.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.270
So I don't know, let's
use one that you

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.220
feel comfortable with.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.920
Well let's use sine.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:39.500
So sine of theta is
equal to what?

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.680
SOH CAH TOA.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.820
Sine is opposite over
hypotenuse.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.020
So the opposite side is the y
direction, so that's 2, over

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.530
the hypotenuse, 3.2.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:58.790
So 2 divided by 2 divided by 3.2
is equal to 0.625, which

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.265
equals 0.625.

00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:03.350
So sine of theta equals 0.625.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.510
And maybe you're not familiar
with arcsine yet because I

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.200
don't think I actually have
covered yet in the trig

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.780
modules, although I
will eventually.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.090
So we know it's just the inverse
function of sine.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.170
So sine of theta is
equal to 0.625.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:25.920
Then we know that theta is equal
to the arcsine of 0.625.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.235
This is essentially saying,
when you say arcsine, this

00:06:29.235 --> 00:06:32.090
says, tell me the angle whose
sine is this number?

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.540
That's what arcsine is.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.460
And we can take out Google
because it actually happens

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.310
that Google has a-- let's see.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.680
Google actually-- it's an
automatic calculator.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.590
So you could type in arcsine
on Google of 0.625.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.460
Although I think the
answer they give

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.720
you will be in radians.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.230
So I'll take that answer that
will be in radians and I want

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.300
to convert to degrees, so I
multiply it times 180 over pi.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.850
That's just how I convert
from radians to degrees.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.350
And let's see what I get.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.670
So Google, you see, Google
says 38.68 degrees.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.260
They multiplied the whole
thing times 180 and then

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.630
divided by pi, but that should
be the same thing.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.225
So roughly 38.7 degrees
is theta.

00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:22.090
Hope you understand that.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.430
You could pause it here if
you don't, but let me

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.300
just write that down.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.070
So it's 38 degrees.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.080
So theta is equal
to 38.7 degrees.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.360
So then we're done.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.250
We figured out that
ball B gets hit.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.950
This is ball B and it
got hit by ball A.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.900
Ball A went off in that
direction at a 30 degree

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.880
angle, at a 30 degree angle
at 2 meters per second.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.040
And now ball B goes at 38.--
or we could say roughly 39

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.320
degrees below the horizontal
at a velocity of 3.2 meters

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.700
per second.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.270
And does this intuitively
make sense to you?

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.140
Well if you remember the problem
from before-- and I

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.860
know I erased everything.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.540
Ball A had a mass of 10
kilograms while ball B had a

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.780
mass of 5 kilograms.
So it makes sense.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.210
So let's think about just
the y direction.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.680
Ball A, we figured out, the y
component of its velocity was

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.260
1 meter per second.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.100
And ball B's y component is 2
meters per second downwards.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.060
And does that makes sense?

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.000
Well sure.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.030
Because their momentums
have to add up to 0.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.470
There was no y component of the
momentum before they hit

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.440
each other.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.539
And in order for B to have the
same momentum going downwards

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:41.049
in the y direction as A going
upwards, its velocity has to

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.690
be essentially double, because
its mass is half.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.680
And a similar logic, although
the cosine-- it doesn't work

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.550
out exactly like that.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.450
But a similar logic would mean
that its overall velocity is

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:59.670
going to be faster than the-
than A's velocity.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.680
And so what was I
just-- oh yeah.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.550
My phone was ringing and
I got caught up.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.730
My brain starts to
malfunction.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.100
But anyway, as I was
saying, so just

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.220
intuitively it makes sense.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.330
B has a smaller mass than A, so
it makes sense that-- one,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.460
B will be going faster and
that it gets deflected a

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.350
little bit more as well.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.800
The reason why it seems like
it gets deflected more is

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.095
because its y component
is more.

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:26.200
But anyway, that last piece is
just to kind of hopefully give

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.510
you a sense of what's happening
and I will see you

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.120
in the next video.
