00:00:00.783 --> 00:00:04.087
I have four statements here and I want you to think about which of

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:08.990
of these statements are true and the first statement is an object in motion will slow down

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.237
unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force in the direction of motion - interesting

00:00:14.237 --> 00:00:18.821
second statment, an object in motion will maintain it's speed and direction

00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:24.810
forever, unless acted on by an unbalanced force- also very interesting.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.252
Third statement, an object at rest will stay at rest, unless acted on by an unbalanced

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:36.917
force. And then the fourth statement, an object acted on an by a unbalanced force will always

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:41.426
acclerate in the direction of the unbalanced force

00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:44.303
So, i'll leave you to think about those statements, and figure out

00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:46.392
which of those statements are actually true.

00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:50.471
It might be none of them, it might be all of them, or some combination of them.

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:55.730
Now that's try to think about each of these statements.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.955
So first of all an object in motion will slow down, unless it is acted on

00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:03.407
by an unbalanced force in the direction of motion. Well this, at least, on a first cut

00:01:03.407 --> 00:01:07.598
kind of seems consistant with our everyday experience. If i'm pushing some furniture

00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:12.122
across the room, so let's say that this is, that this is the carpet of my house,

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:17.274
and i'm pushing a television set -let's say it's one of those old school heavy television set-

00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:21.661
(so i'm pushing a television set), the only way that I can keep it in motion is that I keep

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:26.120
pushing on it. So let me draw my force of pushing (my force of pushing). So let's call

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:33.402
that right there the force of Sal pushing the television set. So the only way that

00:01:33.402 --> 00:01:38.784
I can keep (the only way that I can keep) my television set moving seems like if I keep applying

00:01:38.784 --> 00:01:44.221
this pushing force on it. And I were to stop doing that, it seems like it will slow down.

00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:49.367
So on a first cut everday experience, this seems like it would actually maybe be true.

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:55.489
It only seems that way, because i'm actually not accounting all of the forces in this situation.

00:01:55.489 --> 00:02:00.096
There is not just the force of me pushing. There is also the force of friction.

00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:02.597
(There is also the force of friction.)

00:02:02.597 --> 00:02:08.098
So i'll call that, there is also the force of friction. And if I want to keep this

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:14.090
TV moving at a constant veloctiy, my force of pushing (that make that the vectors look

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.772
about the same magnitude, becuase they need to be the same magnitude)

00:02:17.772 --> 00:02:22.285
If I want to keep my television set at a constant velocity in the direction that i'm

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:27.744
pushing, I have to exactly offset the force of (the force of) friction.

00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:34.173
If my force of pushing is less than the force of friction, then the TV set will to decelerate.

00:02:34.173 --> 00:02:39.247
If my force of pushing is larger than the force of friction, then my TV set will accelerate.

00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:44.210
But in the scenario right now, I have an object in motion, but there's actually a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.279
balanced force. My pushing is completely balanced by the force of friction.

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.603
Another scenario, if we were to go to deep space (i'm not even thinking about air resistance

00:02:52.603 --> 00:02:58.173
right here), but if we were to go into space, where, especailly deep space, no planets around, complete

00:02:58.173 --> 00:03:04.077
vacuum, if an object is in motion (if an object is in motion), and there is absolutely

00:03:04.077 --> 00:03:09.146
no forces balanced or otherwise, there are absolutely no forces acting on it,

00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:13.996
then that object is going to stay in motion. The only way it might change its direction

00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:18.281
or decelerate or accelerate is if there is a net force on it.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:22.594
And just by going back to this example, the only reason why it will slow down, if I

00:03:22.594 --> 00:03:27.567
were to stop pushing, is becuase there is a net force on it, the force of friction.

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:30.937
And if you want to think about it, there would probably be very minor amount of

00:03:30.937 --> 00:03:36.295
air resistance. So this actually isn't true. An object in motion does not have to slow down

00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:39.237
,unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.

00:03:39.237 --> 00:03:47.448
An object in motion can stay in motion, as long it is being acted on either by a balanced force, or (i guess)

00:03:47.448 --> 00:03:50.446
a set of forces that balance each other, or no forces at all.

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:57.261
So this is not (that is not) true. An object in motion will maintain it's speed and direction forever

00:03:57.261 --> 00:04:00.290
unless acted on by an unbalanced force.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.939
This is true! This is exactly what's happening right over here in the case of a (I guess) a block

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:13.323
moving through space in a vacuum. If there are no forces acting on it (no net forces acting on it)

00:04:13.323 --> 00:04:18.247
it is not going to change its velocity. Similarly, you could have this situation,

00:04:18.247 --> 00:04:21.951
where you actually have forces acting on it, but they balance each other out.

00:04:21.951 --> 00:04:27.896
In this situation, as long as I can keep pushing forever, and the floor doesn't change, and so the

00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:34.030
friction doesn't change, this thing will keep moving in that direction, theoretically forever.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.416
The only way to change its direction or accellerate in one direction or another direction, would

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:43.187
be to have an unbalanced force. Maybe if my force of pushing were larger than the force

00:04:43.187 --> 00:04:46.869
of friction, or the force of friction were larger than my force of pushing.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:51.091
So this right over here is absoluely true.

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:56.668
Third statement, an object at rest will stay at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced

00:04:56.668 --> 00:05:01.425
force. And this is actually pretty intuative, I think, for people. If you just leave

00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:05.100
something alone (if you just leave something alone) it's just going to stay alone.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.447
It's not going to start spontaneously moving.

00:05:07.447 --> 00:05:13.075
And so, this is true. It's not just the situation where there is no forces; it could also be

00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:17.696
the situation that's it's going to stay at rest, if there are balanced forces acting on it.

00:05:17.696 --> 00:05:22.290
And so the only way you can actually get this thing to come out of that rest position

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.223
is if you have a net force, an unbalanced force.

00:05:25.223 --> 00:05:30.875
If, let's say, this force right here is (is) any amount larger than this force

00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:35.961
right over here, if they don't completely balance out. So this, once again, is true.

00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:44.062
Last statement, an object acted on by an unbalanced force will always accelerate in the direction

00:05:44.062 --> 00:05:49.841
of the unbalanced force. So if I have an object, and there's an unbalanced force, and if we

00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:55.446
net out all the forces, let's say, the direction is in the force's net out and we get a force

00:05:55.446 --> 00:06:00.214
acting in this direction. This is actually true! The object will always accelerate

00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:05.565
if it has an unbalanced force acting on it in that direction, it will accelerate if there's

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:09.542
a net force in that direction. And there's another way of thinking about it.

00:06:09.542 --> 00:06:15.417
If you see an object that is not accelerating, like my TV that's moving at a constant velocity or this thing

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:19.822
that's just traveling through space, if you see something that is not accelerating, that

00:06:19.822 --> 00:06:25.361
means that there must not be an unbalanced force acting on it.

00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:29.159
So could have balanced forces acting on it, or you could have no forces on it at all,

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.385
but you can't have an unbalanced force. So if you have an unbalanced force, the thing will

00:06:32.385 --> 99:59:59.999
be accelerating.
