00:00:00.262 --> 00:00:01.420
- [Tutor] So, a lot of the concepts

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.784
that you learn about in
multi-variable calculus,

00:00:03.784 --> 00:00:06.082
are really all about
ideas that you originally

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:08.313
might've learned in linear algebra,

00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:11.812
and then transferring those to
apply to nonlinear problems.

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:14.349
So for example, I'm gonna
give you a function,

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.494
some kind of function that
takes in a 2D vector, xy,

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:21.806
and it's also going to
spit out a 2D vector,

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:23.879
and the specific one I have in mind,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:28.046
this is just kind of
arbitrary, is x plus sin of y,

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.751
and then, because I'm
a sucker for symmetry,

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:34.501
I'm gonna make it y plus sin of x.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.677
Though of course, this could
be any arbitrary function,

00:00:36.677 --> 00:00:39.108
you don't need that kind of symmetry.

00:00:39.108 --> 00:00:40.997
So, in the last video, I
gave a little refresher

00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:43.229
on how to think about
linear transformations

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.056
and ideas from linear algebra,

00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:47.964
and how you encode a linear
transformation using a matrix,

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:50.409
and kind of visualize it, I use this grid,

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.247
and here, I wanna show what
this function looks like

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:55.413
as a transformation of space.

00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:57.092
As in, I'm gonna tell the computer,

00:00:57.092 --> 00:01:00.080
take every single point
on this blue grid here,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.187
and if that point is xy, I want you

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:04.956
to move it over to the
point x plus sin of y,

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:06.642
y plus sin of x.

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:09.914
And here's what that looks like.

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:13.046
Alright, so things get
really wavy, really curly,

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:15.459
this is not at all a
linear transformation,

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.301
all of the lines don't remain lines,

00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:19.832
they're no longer nice grid
lines that are parallel

00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:22.058
and evenly spaced, in some sense,

00:01:22.058 --> 00:01:24.031
there is much, much more information

00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:25.654
that goes into nonlinear functions

00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:27.810
than into linear functions.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.383
And because this is rather complicated,

00:01:29.383 --> 00:01:31.591
I think it might be easy
to see what's going on

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:34.224
if we just focus on a
single individual point.

00:01:34.224 --> 00:01:38.032
So let me look at a point
like, hmm, let's say,

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:40.615
pi/2 and zero, okay?

00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:46.164
So if that's what I'm
plugging in, x is pi/2,

00:01:46.164 --> 00:01:50.495
so at the top here, x
stays the same, it's pi/2,

00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:52.684
and then sin of y would be sin of zero,

00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:57.035
so that x component is gonna
completely stay the same.

00:01:57.035 --> 00:02:00.747
And then for the bottom,
y, or y is also zero,

00:02:00.747 --> 00:02:04.391
plus sin of x, sin of
pi/2 is one, and just,

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.755
I'll go ahead and write sin of pi/2,

00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:10.922
sin of pi/2, but you can think
of that as just being one.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.054
So what that means on the
transformation over here,

00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:18.419
is if we look at the point
that's at pi/2, zero,

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.098
and pi/2 is a little about 1.5,

00:02:21.098 --> 00:02:22.612
so that's gonna be around here,

00:02:22.612 --> 00:02:25.807
we expect it to move
to the point pi/2, one.

00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:28.785
So it should just move
vertically by one unit,

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:30.725
and if you just focus on that one point

00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:33.624
during the transformation,
notice that's exactly

00:02:33.624 --> 00:02:37.207
what happens, it just
moves vertically one point.

00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:38.525
And of course, things
are quite complicated

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.237
because every point is doing that, right?

00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:41.789
The computer's taking in every point

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.580
and moving it to where it should go.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.201
So, after having given the refresher

00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:46.981
on thinking about linear transformations

00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:49.613
and encoding them with matrices last time,

00:02:49.613 --> 00:02:52.763
something like this might
feel completely intractable.

00:02:52.763 --> 00:02:54.729
You certainly have to
store much more information

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:58.510
than just four numbers to
record where everything goes.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.304
But this function has a nice property,

00:03:00.304 --> 00:03:01.865
a property that we deal with all the time

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:03.570
in multi-variable calculus.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.119
It's what we call locally linear.

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:08.369
Locally linear.

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:13.855
And what that means is if I
was to take our initial setup,

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:15.569
and then zoom in on a given point,

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.101
so I'm gonna zoom in around
this point on the left here,

00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:20.229
and this box, kind of in the upper right,

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.380
just shows the zoomed-in version of that.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.880
And first of all, I'm gonna
add some more grid lines,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.507
so they're really very close grid lines,

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:28.421
we can see from the zoomed-out picture,

00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:30.481
but this just makes it so
that when we're zoomed in,

00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:32.954
we can see a little bit
more of what's going on.

00:03:32.954 --> 00:03:34.956
And now, when I play the animation,

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:37.642
I'm gonna have this yellow
box that's doing the zooming

00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:41.309
follow the point at its center,
so this box will be moving,

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.099
and we're always just gonna
look at what it zoomed in on,

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.932
'kay?

00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:47.693
So it's gonna be following
what's going on around that point

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:49.633
during the transformation.

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:52.424
And we can see, inside
this zoomed version,

00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:55.118
it's still not linear, the
lines get a little bit curved,

00:03:55.118 --> 00:03:57.671
but this looks a lot more
like a linear function,

00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:59.416
it looks a lot more like the grid lines

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:01.643
that started off horizontal and vertical,

00:04:01.643 --> 00:04:04.230
are remaining parallel and evenly spaced.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.096
And in fact, let's say
I zoom in even further,

00:04:07.096 --> 00:04:09.542
to an even smaller yellow
box here, and again,

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:12.016
I'm gonna add in some more
grid lines right around it,

00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:13.373
so they're very, very densely packed.

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:16.405
And this is purely an artifact
of visualizing things,

00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:18.634
I could choose to put
points or lines or anything

00:04:18.634 --> 00:04:21.224
wherever I want, and I just
think showing the grid lines

00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:23.066
and only the grid lines
and where they move,

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:25.366
gives sort of a feel for
what the function is doing.

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:28.613
So this time, when I play
it, and that zooming-in box

00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:31.949
kind of tracks the point
that we're looking at,

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.143
as it goes, the neighborhood around it,

00:04:35.143 --> 00:04:37.567
all of the points around
it, really, really do look

00:04:37.567 --> 00:04:39.434
like a linear function.

00:04:39.434 --> 00:04:41.411
And the more you zoom
in, the more it looks

00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:44.133
precisely like a certain linear function.

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:46.688
Oh, I guess I should've
written an r over here.

00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:47.893
Locally linear.

00:04:47.893 --> 00:04:50.401
So this raises the question,
if we're looking around

00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:54.568
some specific point, which I'll
call x nought and y nought,

00:04:56.224 --> 00:04:58.711
this should correspond in some way

00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:01.256
to the linear transformation
that it looks like around it.

00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:03.305
There should be some kind of matrix,

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:05.997
some two-by-two matrix, that represents

00:05:05.997 --> 00:05:08.747
the linear transformation
that this function,

00:05:08.747 --> 00:05:11.365
this much more complicated
function, looks like

00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:13.074
around that point.

00:05:13.074 --> 00:05:15.728
So this idea of zooming in
is what we mean by local,

00:05:15.728 --> 00:05:17.390
and in the next video, I'm gonna show you

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.693
what this matrix looks like in
terms of partial derivatives

00:05:20.693 --> 00:05:21.967
for our original function.

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:22.800
See you then!
