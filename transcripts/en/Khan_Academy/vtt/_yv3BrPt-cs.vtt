00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
Problem number 1.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.890
Which number has the greatest
absolute value?

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.630
Absolute value is just the
distance that the number is

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.060
from 0, or how large the number
is, regardless of its

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.890
sign or its direction.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.060
So if you kind of visualize it
on a number line, the absolute

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.220
value of minus 17.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.640
Minus 17 is 17 to
the left of 0.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.700
So its absolute value
is just 17.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.340
The absolute value
of minus 13?

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.290
Well, it's 13 to the left of
0, if you imagine it on a

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.360
number line.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.490
So it's just going to be 13.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.730
Absolute value of 15?

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.330
Well, that's just
going to be 15.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.010
It's 15 to the right of
0 on the number line.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.620
I think you see a
pattern here.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.690
When you take the absolute
value of a number, you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.530
essentially just disregard
the sign.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.120
The absolute value of a negative
number is going to be

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.000
positive, and the absolute value
of a positive number is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.870
going to be positive.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.300
The absolute value is always
going to be positive, because

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.210
you're just measuring how far
you are away from 0 on the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.320
number line.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.430
And then finally, the absolute
value of 19 is going to be

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.470
equal to 19.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.780
So the number that has the
greatest absolute value?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.850
Well, the greatest absolute
value is right there, it's 19.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.540
So 19 has the greatest
absolute value.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.890
So it also happens to be the
largest number here.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.430
Just like that.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.250
Problem number 2.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.160
Maybe I'll do this in gray.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.740
Between which two integers
is the value of the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.940
square root of 61?

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.940
So the way you think about this
is that you know there's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.870
some number-- the square root
of 61 is going to be some

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.650
decimal number, I don't know
what it is-- but there's going

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.630
to be some number that if I
square it, is going to be a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.230
little bit lower than 61.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.170
And then some other integer,
if I square it, should be a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.940
little bit greater than 61.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.630
So let's see if we can
figure this out.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.080
So 6 squared is going
to be 36.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.310
And then 7 squared is
going to be 49.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.610
That number is not
dark enough.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.820
Do a darker color.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.060
So this isn't going to
be the case, right?

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.610
Because the square of 61-- or 61
is greater than 49-- so the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.360
square root of 61 is going to
be greater than the square

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.740
root of 49.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.790
Or actually let me write
it this way.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.770
I could rewrite 6 and 7 as the
square root of 36 and the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.880
square root of 49.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.010
I can rewrite 7 and 8 as the
square root of 49 and the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.250
square root of 64, right?

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.850
7 squared is 49, so the square
root of 49 is 7.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.030
8 squared is 64, so the square
root of 64 is going to be 8.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.480
So I just rewrote 7 and 8 as the
square root of 49 and the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.280
square root of 64.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.650
Well, the square root of 61 is
clearly going to be between

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.410
these two numbers, right?

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.560
It's going to be between the
square root of 49 and the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.460
square root of 64.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.750
The 61 is between 49 and 64.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.940
So our answer is B.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.260
Square root of 61 is between
these two numbers, but these

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.670
two numbers are the same
thing as 7 and 8.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.240
Next problem, number 3.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.130
Use the addition problems below
to answer the question.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.000
All right, so they wrote some
addition problems right there.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.070
We're dealing with fractions.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.560
Let's see where this goes.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.360
Based on this pattern, what is
the sum of 1/2 plus 1/4 plus

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.590
1/8 plus 1/16, all the
way to 1/1024?

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.070
So let's see if we can discern
some type of a pattern here.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.260
Maybe I'll do this in red just
to keep things interesting.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.480
So when I took the first
two terms, I got 3/4.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.500
When I took the next two terms,
or not the next two

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.180
terms. When I add another
term to it.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.200
When I add the 1/8 term to this
over here, I got 7/8.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.590
Then when I add a 1/16 to
7/8, I get a 15/16.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.610
So the general pattern here is
that whenever I add it up, my

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.150
denominator and my sum-- I guess
you could call it that

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.390
way-- my denominator is going
to be the same denominator

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.670
that I have right there.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.190
And then my numerator, if I
just look at all of the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.140
pattern here, just turns out to
be 1 less than that, right?

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.270
So when I added 1/2 plus 1/4, I
got 4 in the denominator and

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.150
3 in the numerator.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.690
When I had 1/2 plus 1/4 plus
1/8, 8 in the denominator and

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.260
1 less than that in
the numerator.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.680
When I added it all the way
to 1/16, I got 16 in the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.770
denominator and 1 less
in the numerator.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.720
When I added it all the way
to 32, I got 32 in the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.540
denominator and 1 less
in the numerator.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.280
And this only worked when I'm
adding successive powers of, I

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.720
guess you could call
it 1/2, right?

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.980
This is 1/2, 1/2 squared,
1/2 to the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.880
third, 1/2 to the fourth.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.960
So based on this pattern, what
is the sum if I were to go all

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.910
the way to 1/1024?

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.410
Well, based on this pattern, my
denominator is going to be

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.580
1,024, and my numerator is going
to be 1 less than 1,024.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.740
So it's going to be 1,023.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.790
And that is choice
C right there.
