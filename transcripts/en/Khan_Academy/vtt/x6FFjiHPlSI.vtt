00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.399
We're asked to multiply and express as a simplified rational.

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.297
So when you multiply any rational expressions, it's just like multiplying any fractions.

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:11.796
You multiply the numerators times each other, and the denominators times each other.

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:14.779
So if we multiply the numerators here, and when you multiply--

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.378
When you're just multiplying a bunch of numbers, it doesn't matter what order you do them in.

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:20.479
So we want to multiply in an order that makes it a little bit clearer.

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:22.713
We can multiply the coefficients first.

00:00:22.713 --> 00:00:25.249
We can multiply 3 times 14.

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.916
3 times 14 gives us

00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:29.832
-3 times 10 is thirty-

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:31.781
-3 times 4 is 12-

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.965
It gives us 42.

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:36.765
So that's the 3 and the 14.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:41.748
Then we have an a-squared, 42a-squared.

00:00:41.748 --> 00:00:45.632
Then we have a b.

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:48.116
I'll write these in the order that the letters in the alphabet-- alphabetical order.

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:51.799
And then we have an x-squared -and then we have an x-squared.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.348
So I just changed the order, but I just multiplied all of these things in both numerators.

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:58.081
That's the numerators multiplied.

00:00:58.081 --> 00:00:59.899
Let's do the same thing for the denominators.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.490
So I'll first do the constant -or I should say the coefficients-

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.116
I'll multiply 2 times 18, which is 36.

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:12.167
And then I have an a over here - just one a- 36a

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:16.984
Then I have a just one b over here -times b-

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:21.250
Then I just have one x over here -times x-

00:01:22.173 --> 00:01:25.682
So we've multiplied the two, and now we just need to simplify them.

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:28.237
Let's just think about this a little bit.

00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:30.770
Both 42 and 36 are divisible by 6.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.487
That's their greatest common divisor.

00:01:32.487 --> 00:01:33.986
Let's divide both of them by 6.

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:36.738
42 divided by 6 is 7.

00:01:36.738 --> 00:01:39.422
36 divided by 6 is 6.

00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:43.844
Both a-squared and a are divisible by a, so let's divide them both by a.

00:01:43.844 --> 00:01:46.396
a-squared divided by a is a.

00:01:46.396 --> 00:01:48.895
a divided by a is one.

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:50.664
And just remember, I'm just dividing in both

00:01:50.664 --> 00:01:54.812
--in any of these steps I'm just dividing the numerator and the denominator by the same number.

00:01:54.812 --> 00:01:57.862
And that's not changing the overall value of the expression.

00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:01.443
Then I have a b divided by a b

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:04.526
-well I can divide the numerator and the denominator by b-

00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:09.551
And so, those two characters will cancel out.

00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:11.801
To just 1 and 1.

00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:13.751
You don't even have to write it when you multiply by 1.

00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:15.018
It doesn't change the value.

00:02:15.018 --> 00:02:16.968
And then I have an x-squared divided by x.

00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:18.468
They're both divisible by x.

00:02:18.468 --> 00:02:20.551
x-squared divided by x is x.

00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:22.951
x divided by x is 1.

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:29.236
So, in the numerator we are left with 7ax.

00:02:29.236 --> 00:02:32.002
We can ignore the b, because it's just multiplying by 1 now.

00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:36.301
We have 7 -let me do that same shade of green-

00:02:37.947 --> 00:02:44.324
We have 7 times a times x, in the numerator.

00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:48.306
And then in the denominator, we 6 times 1 times 1 times 1.

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:53.306
We have all sixes.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:57.741
Now I want to be a little bit careful here, because if we want this expression.

00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:02.306
So we have done what they've asked us to do, but this begs a little bit of a question here.

00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:09.724
If we want this expression to truly be the same expression as the product of these two things,

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:12.207
we have to constrain its domain.

00:03:12.207 --> 00:03:15.156
We have to constrain the variable values here.

00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:17.391
Because this expression right over here.

00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:19.474
This is defined for any a's or x's.

00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:22.706
You could put any a or x here, and you will get a value here.

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:26.958
But this product over here, this was not defined for any a's or x's.

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.508
The b's cancel out, but it was not defined for any a's or x's.

00:03:30.508 --> 00:03:38.842
In this situation, if either a or x equal to 0, this expression right over here would be undefined.

00:03:38.842 --> 00:03:42.453
In fact if b was equal to 0, this expression would also be undefined.

00:03:42.453 --> 00:03:46.404
So if you really this to be the exact same expression.

00:03:46.404 --> 00:03:48.088
Say this was a function definition.

00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:54.537
If you want it to be the exact same function definition as this over here, you would have to have the same domain.

00:03:54.537 --> 00:03:56.203
So I'll just write down the domain here.

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:57.590
They have to have the same domain.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.195
If you want them to be the exact same function.

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:02.362
If you don't care about that, then you could just say, ok let's just go with this.

00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:07.203
But you should constrain it if you want it to be an equivalent expression.

00:04:07.203 --> 00:04:16.686
And so in either case, you should constrain the domain to be all real numbers.

00:04:16.686 --> 00:04:17.757
And this is a bit different, because

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:20.659
-- this is essentially like a two variable function.

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.492
If you view a as a possible variable here.

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:41.126
So, all real numbers for a, b and x, except (when) a, b or x is equal to 0.

00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:44.425
So we're just saying that a, b and c can be anything other than 0.

00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:47.625
We're getting it from our original expression, after we multiplied.

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:50.808
We're saying it has to be the same, it has to have the same domain.

00:04:50.808 --> 00:04:54.258
Most algebra classes, they wont make you be this particular about it.

00:04:54.258 --> 00:04:56.636
They'll just say, simplify the expression.

00:04:56.636 --> 00:04:58.270
And you'll just simplify it, and you'll give this answer.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.172
But if you really want it to be the exact same expression, you would really have to have the same domain.
