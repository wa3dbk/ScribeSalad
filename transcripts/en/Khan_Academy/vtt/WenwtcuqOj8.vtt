00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.580
In the last video we touched on
the three states of matter

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.990
that are really most familiar
to our everyday experience.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.410
The solid, the liquid,
and the gas.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.910
And I kind of hinted that there
is a fourth state, which

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.310
I don't cover, because it's
usually not the domain of an

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.560
introductory chemistry course.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.750
But a little bit of a discussion
ensued on the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.340
message board for that video.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.910
So I thought I would at least
touch on that fourth stage.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.580
And that's plasma.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.970
I'll do it in a suitably
bright color.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.040
Plasma.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.110
And people consider it a fourth
state because it has

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.480
some properties of gases.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.430
In some ways it's almost
a subset of gases.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.880
But it also has properties of
conductivity that you normally

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.350
wouldn't associate with a gas.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.100
And just so you know, when you
first hear it you think, oh

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.990
that's a fairly exotic
thing, plasma.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.450
And in the first video, I said
it's only something that

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.690
occurs at high temperatures,
which isn't

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.370
exactly 100% right.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.120
It doesn't have to be at
high temperatures.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.730
I really should have said
that under extenuating

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.670
circumstances where you
have a very strong

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.040
electromagnetic field.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.550
Or something has to happen to
essentially bump the the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.580
electrons, or move the electrons
off of gases that

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.410
would've otherwise have
kept their electrons.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.540
So it's kind of analogous to
what happens in metal.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.170
When we talk about metal bonds,
we talk about this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.470
notion of a sea of electrons.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.150
Let's say if we talked
about iron.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.130
What happens with most metals
is that they have so many

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.220
electrons, and they are so
willing to give them, that the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.990
electrons just kind of float
outside of the atoms

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.250
themselves and create this kind
of big sea of electrons.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.760
And then the atoms
themselves become

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.110
positively charged ions.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.020
Because they essentially
donated some

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.870
electrons to the sea.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.220
So they're attracted to the sea
and that's what makes them

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.480
malleable and even more
importantly what allows them

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.510
to conduct electricity.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.300
But they're all really packed
closely together and it's a

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.710
very dense structure.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.320
Plasma is a situation where if
you take gases, and remember,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.640
in gases things are
pretty far apart.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.700
So you take a bunch of
gases and they have

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.699
high kinetic energy.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.340
Although, they don't have to be,
that could be under very

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.970
low pressure.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.950
But they're moving around and
bumping into each other.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.740
But they're not close
to each other.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.450
They don't have a fixed
structure with each other.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.140
Or they're not rubbing against
each other like in

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.430
the case of a liquid.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.160
But what happens in a plasma, or
one situation is, that you

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.770
apply such a strong
electromagnetic field that the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.460
electrons want to
disassociate.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.130
So let's say these
electrons start

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.220
bumping off of the plasma.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.530
And so a solid has
its own shape.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.300
A plasma will take the shape of
its container like a gas.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.350
And sometimes it is described
as an ionized gas.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.810
And it's described as
ionized because

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.850
electrons are bumped off.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.320
And when the electrons are
bumped off, the otherwise

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.310
neutral atoms now have
positive charges.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.830
And what this allows is,
essentially a conduction of

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.450
electricity.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.960
Because now these electrons
are free to move.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.460
You might say that sounds like
a bizarre state of matter,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.550
where does it exist?

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.930
Well, probably closest to home,
it exists in lightning.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.580
And that's worthy of
an entire video.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.300
But the idea is that you start
having a huge potential

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.765
difference between the clouds
and the ground.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.480
And then because you have this
huge voltage difference

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.710
between the two, you have
electrons that are essentially

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.090
wanting to go into the ground.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.400
You have a build-up of electrons
up here that want to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.270
go into the ground.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.870
They can't because
air is normally

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.390
a fairly bad conductor.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.250
It's an insulator.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.490
But what happens is because
there's so much

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.540
electropotential here, the
electrons that are close in

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.100
the molecules up here, at least
how I visualize it,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.890
their electrons want to escape
from these clouds.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.980
So their electrons start
to want to move

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.300
away in the air molecules.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.130
Whether you're talking about
the air is a mixture of

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.750
oxygen, and nitrogen,
and carbon dioxide.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.780
They start wanting to get
away from the clouds.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.079
So they start disassociating
and start forming

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.950
this ionized air.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.520
And eventually, at some point,
this happens to such a degree

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.210
that you can actually get
conduction from the cloud to

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.610
the ground.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.850
And that conduction is when the
air is in a plasma state.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.550
The conduction allows extremely
high temperatures

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.620
and the electrons to flow all
the way to the ground.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.750
The other common example, you
might see something like this,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.410
well actually not like this, but
at least a plasma state,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.360
is in stars.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.390
And that's because you
have extremely strong

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.400
electromagnetic fields,
extremely high pressure, and

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.480
in that type of environment,
once again, I'm old super over

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.870
simplifying it, you can get to
a state where the electrons

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.580
can get disassociated from
things that otherwise wouldn't

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.620
want to give up their
electrons.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.410
I thought I would touch on
that because it's an

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.470
interesting subject.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.820
And it exists in the universe.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.760
On the universal level, because
stars are pretty much

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.295
all plasma, it is actually the
most common state of matter in

00:05:18.295 --> 00:05:19.000
the universe.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.410
Although in our everyday life,
we probably encounter solids,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.420
liquids and gases a lot more.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.590
And one other thing I want to
maybe clarify from the last

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.300
video is, I talk about
the bonding

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.350
between water molecules.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.180
And let's say we're talking
in the solid state.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.660
So I have an oxygen, a
hydrogen, a hydrogen.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.720
And I have some electrons here,
some electrons here.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.866
Let's say there's another
hydrogen here, an oxygen, and

00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:48.070
a hydrogen.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.840
Maybe there's an oxygen here.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.125
That has hydrogen.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.130
And then this has a hydrogen.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.370
And it has two electrons,
two electron pairs.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.140
So I talked about the notion,
and we talked about it many

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.620
times before.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.140
That oxygen is so much more
electronegative that it hogs

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.350
the electrons.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.100
And so the oxygen side
starts to have a

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.060
partial negative charge.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.900
While the hydrogen side
starts to have a

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.950
partial positive side.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.420
Because with the hydrogen,
essentially all of its

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.730
electrons are hanging out close
to the oxygen, hydrogen

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.590
ends up just becoming like
this proton that's

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.130
floating out there.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.310
Because we said it
doesn't even have

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.180
neutrons in most cases.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.620
So this has a slightly
positive charge.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.400
This one has a positive
charge.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.560
And the positive polar end
of the water molecule is

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.290
attracted to the negative
polar end.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.730
And I called it polar bonds,
and it shows you my memory

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.745
from high school chemistry is
not ideal, I really should

00:06:48.745 --> 00:06:52.280
have called it hydrogen bonds.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.010
So this is a hydrogen bond, and
this is a hydrogen bond.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.810
It's just a matter of
the name I used.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.780
I just want to clarify that
because that is what's

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.480
typically used in your
chemistry class.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.620
I don't want to confuse you.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.680
And that is just the bond that
exists from a partially

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.530
positive hydrogen atom.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.400
Because its electrons are
hanging out near the oxygen.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.980
And a partially negative
oxygen atom

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.200
in the water molecule.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.920
Because it has stolen
all of these

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.580
electrons from the hydrogen.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.680
You draw it like that, it's
called a hydrogen bond.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.960
And hydrogen bonds tend to
form between hydrogen or

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.740
really only a handful of super
electronegative atoms. And

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.500
that's nitrogen, fluorine,
and oxygen.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.230
And these are actually the three
most electronegative

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:54.680
atoms. So the nitrogen, NH3,
when it bonds with hydrogen,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.940
is essentially so
electronegative that you have

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.210
the same situation.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.410
All the electrons hang out here,
so you have a partial

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.770
negative charge, partial
positive on the hydrogen ends.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.840
Same thing with hydrogen
fluorine.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.410
You get the same HF.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.740
You get the same type
of hydrogen bonds.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.280
And so in this case, these guys
would be attracted to the

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.190
nitrogen part of other molecules
and would form

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:19.820
hydrogen bonds.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.340
I just want to get that
out of the way.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.720
And with that done, I think we
can return to some of the

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:31.200
ideas of the last video and
actually do some problems.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.450
Let's take the case
with water.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.780
Actually, let me just state the
problem first. So let's

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.600
say that we have a
