00:00:00.813 --> 00:00:02.867
Let's say that I have five lemons

00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:07.129
so that's [counting to five] ... five lemons

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.238
and I were to ask you: what do I have to multiply times five to get one?

00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:16.974
or in this case: what do I have to multiply times five lemons to get one lemon?

00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:19.467
and so, another question you might ask

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.812
because really multiplication and division are two sides of the same coin

00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:23.312
is

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:27.300
what do I have to divide five by to get to one lemon

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.116
or yellow circle, or whatever I have drawn right over here

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:35.132
Well, if you have five things and you divide by five, you're gonna have five groups of one

00:00:35.132 --> 00:00:39.636
so if you divide by five, you're gonna have [counting to five] ... five groups

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:44.141
So you could say five divided by five is equal to one

00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:49.400
take five things and divide it into five groups then each group is going to have one in them

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.855
or you could say five times one fifth is equal to one

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:56.929
(and I use the dot for multiplication)

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.767
I could also say five times one fifth is equal to one

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.631
these are all really saying the same thing

00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.467
Maybe what's kind of interesting here

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:09.128
(although it's not some huge learning)

00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:12.933
it's really just another way of writing what you already probably know,

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:19.467
is this idea that if I have a number and I multiply times it's multiplicative inverse

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:22.533
(and most of the time when people talk about inverses in mathematics

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.637
they are talking about the multiplicative inverse)

00:01:24.637 --> 00:01:26.465
then I'm going to get one

00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:28.579
so five time one fifth is equal to one

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.389
but that's just because five times one fifth is the same thing as five divided by five

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:35.968
if you were to actually multiply this out

00:01:35.968 --> 00:01:38.476
you actually take five times one fifth

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:44.652
this is equal to five-over-one times one-over-five

00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:47.400
you multiply the numerators: five times one is five

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.133
multiply the denominators: one times five is five

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:56.634
so you have five fifths, and five fifths is the exact same thing as one

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:58.445
So if someone where to ask you a question,

00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:01.789
they say "Hey, I have the number 217

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.535
and I want to multiply it by something, and I want to get one after multiplying it by that something"

00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:12.470
Well then you say - Well look, If I took 217 and divided it by 217 that would get me to one

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.761
and dividing by 217 is the exact same thing as multiplying by one-over-217

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:22.348
multiplying by its multiplicative inverse

00:02:22.348 --> 00:02:25.867
which is, once again, a word that is fancier than the actual concept

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:28.323
you are just multiplying by the inverse of this number

00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:29.519
Another way to think about it is

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.005
if I have five things and I take one fifth of those things, how many things do I have?

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:39.777
Well, if I take one fifth of five things I have exactly one thing right over here

00:02:39.777 --> 00:02:42.377
But the general idea is super-duper-duper simple

00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:47.318
if I have some crazy number ... 8,345

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:50.458
that's actually not so crazy, let's turn it to something in the millions

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:52.071
... and 271 ...

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:52.645
so

00:02:52.645 --> 00:02:55.502
8,345,271

00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:57.647
And I say, what do I have to multiply by

00:02:57.647 --> 00:02:59.642
(and now I use this multiplication symbol right now)

00:02:59.642 --> 00:03:03.461
what do I have to multiply that by in order to get one?

00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:05.969
I just have to multiply it by the inverse of this

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.138
the multiplicative inverse of this

00:03:08.138 --> 00:03:16.199
so one-over-8,345,271
