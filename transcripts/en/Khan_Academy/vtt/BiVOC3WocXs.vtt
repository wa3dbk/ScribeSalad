00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.370
Let's say we need to evaluate
the limit as x approaches 0 of

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:20.340
2 sine of x minus sine of 2x,
all of that over x

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.210
minus sine of x.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.820
Now, the first thing that I
always try to do when I first

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.160
see a limit problem is hey,
what happens if I just try to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.890
evaluate this function
at x is equal to 0?

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.540
Maybe nothing crazy happens.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.090
So let's just try it out.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.340
If we try to do x equals
0, what happens?

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.580
We get 2 sine of 0, which is 0.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.190
Minus sine of 2 times 0.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.960
Well, that's going to be sine
of 0 again, which is 0.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.510
So our numerator is
going to be equal to 0.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.750
Sine of 0, that's 0.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.440
And then we have another
sine of 0 there.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.340
That's another 0, so all 0's.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.590
And our denominator,
we're going to have

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.590
a 0 minus sine of 0.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.200
Well that's also going to be 0.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.340
But we have that indeterminate
form, we have that undefined

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.000
0/0 that we talked about
in the last video.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.720
So maybe we can use
L'Hopital's rule here.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.910
In order to use L'Hopital's
rule then the limit as x

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.880
approaches 0 of the derivative
of this function over

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.880
the derivative of this
function needs to exist.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.060
So let's just apply L'Hopital's
rule and let's just take the

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.470
derivative of each of these and
see if we can find the limit.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.620
If we can, then that's going to
be the limit of this thing.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.750
So this thing, assuming that it
exists, is going to be equal to

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.950
the limit as x approaches 0 of
the derivative of this

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.600
numerator up here.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.380
And so what's the derivative
of the numerator going to be?

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.315
I'll do it in a new color.

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:51.050
I'll do it in green.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.370
Well, the derivative of 2
sine of x is 2 cosine of x.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.160
And then, minus-- well,
the derivative of sine

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.150
of 2x is 2 cosine of 2x.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.440
So minus 2 cosine of 2x.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.210
Just use the chain rule
there, derivative of

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.000
the inside is just 2.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.060
That's the 2 out there.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.405
Derivative of the outside is
cosine of 2x, and we had that

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:16.790
negative number out there.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.610
So that's the derivative of
our numerator, maria, and

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.500
what is the Derivative.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.920
of our denominator?

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.430
Well, derivative of x is just
1, and derivative of sine

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.870
of x is just cosine of x.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.920
So 1 minus cosine of x.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.950
So let's try to
evaluate this limit.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.150
What do we get?

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.180
If we put a 0 up here we're
going to get 2 times cosine

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.610
of 0, which is 2-- let
me write it like this.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.760
So this is 2 times cosine
of 0, which is 1.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.040
So it's 2 minus 2
cosine of 2 times 0.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.480
Let me write it this way.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.580
Actually, let me just
do it this way.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.150
If we just straight up evaluate
the limit of the numerator and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.270
the denominator, what
are we going to get?

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.710
We get 2 cosine of
0, which is 2.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.760
Minus 2 times cosine of--
well, this 2 times 0 is

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.620
still going to be 0.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.850
So minus 2 times cosine
of 0, which is 2.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:15.620
All of that over 1 minus the
cosine of 0, which is 1.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.295
So once again, we get 0/0.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.500
So does this mean that
the limit doesn't exist?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.420
No, it still might exist,
we might just want to do

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.830
L'Hopital's rule again.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.610
Let me take the derivative
of that and put it over

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.490
the derivative of that.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.610
And then take the limit and
maybe L'Hopital's rule

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.700
will help us on the
next [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.610
So let's see if it
gets us anywhere.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.030
So this should be equal to
the limit if L'Hopital's

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.840
rule applies here.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.050
We're not 100% sure yet.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.950
This should be equal to the
limit as x approaches 0 of the

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.690
derivative of that thing over
the derivative of that thing.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.240
So what's the derivative
of 2 cosine of x?

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.485
Well, derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine of x.

00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:04.920
So it's negative 2 sine of x.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.320
And then derivative of cosine
of 2x is negative 2 sine of 2x.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.660
So we're going to have this
negative cancel out with the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.980
negative on the negative 2
and then a 2 times the 2.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.990
So it's going to be
plus 4 sine of 2x.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.790
Let me make sure I
did that right.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.640
We have the minus 2 or the
negative 2 on the outside.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.950
Derivative of cosine of 2x
is going to be 2 times

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.590
negative sine of x.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.270
So the 2 times 2 is 4.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.780
The negative sine of x
times-- the negative

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.060
right there's a plus.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.180
You have a positive sine,
so it's the sine of 2x.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.370
That's the numerator when
you take the derivative.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.260
And the denominator-- this
is just an exercise in

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.830
taking derivatives.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.350
What's the derivative
of the denominator?

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.310
Derivative of 1 is 0.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.790
And derivative negative
cosine of x is just-- well,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.900
that's just sine of x.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.950
So let's take this limit.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.050
So this is going to be equal
to-- well, immediately if I

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.810
take x is equal to 0 in the
denominator, I know that

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.190
sine of 0 is just 0.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.870
Let's see what happens
in the numerator.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.700
Negative 2 times sine of 0.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.740
That's going to be 0.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.880
And then plus 4 times
sine of 2 times 0.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.570
Well, that's still sine of 0,
so that's still going to be 0.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.210
So once again, we got
indeterminate form again.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.900
Are we done?

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.820
Do we give up?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.730
Do we say that L'Hopital's
rule didn't work?

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.550
No, because this could have
been our first limit problem.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.750
And if this is our first limit
problem we say, hey, maybe we

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.680
could use L'Hopital's rule
here because we got an

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.600
indeterminate form.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.990
Both the numerator and
the denominator approach

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.660
0 as x approaches 0.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.110
So let's take the
derivatives again.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.870
This will be equal to--
if the limit exist, the

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.730
limit as x approaches 0.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.685
Let's take the derivative
of the numerator.

00:05:47.685 --> 00:05:51.410
The derivative of negative
2 sine of x is negative

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.100
2 cosine of x.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.850
And then, plus the
derivative of 4 sine of 2x.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.520
Well, it's 2 times
4, which is 8.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.330
Times cosine of 2x.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.320
Derivative of sine of
2x is 2 cosine of 2x.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.270
And that first 2 gets
multiplied by the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.840
4 to get the 8.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.030
And then the derivative of the
denominator, derivative of sine

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.140
of x is just cosine of x.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.880
So let's evaluate
this character.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.620
So it looks like we've made
some headway or maybe

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.160
L'Hopital's rule stop applying
here because we take the limit

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.610
as x approaches 0
of cosine of x.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.650
That is 1.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.220
So we're definitely not going
to get that indeterminate form,

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.120
that 0/0 on this iteration.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.160
Let's see what happens
to the numerator.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.950
We get negative 2
times cosine of 0.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.530
Well that's just negative 2
because cosine of 0 is 1.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.090
Plus 8 times cosine of 2x.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.590
Well, if x is 0, so it's going
to be cosine of 0, which is 1.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.690
So it's just going to be an 8.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.990
So negative 2 plus 8.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.500
Well this thing right here,
negative 2 plus 8 is 6.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.720
6 over 1.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.370
This whole thing is equal to 6.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.850
So L'Hopital's rule-- it
applies to this last step.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.630
If this was the problem we were
given and we said, hey, when we

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.530
tried to apply the limit we get
the limit as this numerator

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.010
approaches 0 is 0.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.790
Limit as this denominator
approaches 0 is 0.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.980
As the derivative of the
numerator over the derivative

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.600
of the denominator, that
exists and it equals 6.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.590
So this limit must
be equal to 6.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.740
Well if this limit is equal to
6, by the same argument, this

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.340
limit is also going
to be equal to 6.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.850
And by the same argument,
this limit has got to

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.090
also be equal to 6.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.770
And we're done.
