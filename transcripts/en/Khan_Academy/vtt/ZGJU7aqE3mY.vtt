00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.150
We're on problem 70.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.410
And they still want us to do
some sequences and series.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.440
What is the n'th term in
arithmetic series below.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.800
Which means that it just
increases by a constant amount

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.500
every term.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.940
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.140
The first term is 3.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.250
And then we increment
it by 4 each time.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.120
Let me write all of this.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.870
3, then we go to 7, then we go
to 11, and then we go to 15,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.100
then we go to 19.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.800
So we go to 3 and we're
adding 4 every time.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.490
So you get the sense that each
term in the sequence is going

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.480
to be 4 times the n'th term.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.860
But that doesn't
quite work out.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.890
Because I've had 4 times-- if
this is the first term, 4

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.720
times the first term is 1.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.280
And 3 is less than 1.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.780
And then 4 times 2 is 8.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.410
And 7 is less than 8.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.880
And 4 times 3 is 12.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.770
But this is 1 less than 12.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.810
So it seems like all these are
1 less than a multiple of 4.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.019
So the n'th term is going
to be 4n minus 1.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.720
And that should work out.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.110
The third term is 4 times
3, 12, minus 1 is 11.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.720
And that's the third term.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440
So it's 4n minus 1,
which is choice D.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.940
Next problem.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.330
Problem 71.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.590
Let me copy and paste it.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.320
Acctually, I'll copy and
paste all of them.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.320
All right.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.190
Which expression represents f
of g of x if f of x is equal

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.220
to x squared minus 1 and g of
x is equal to x plus 3?

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.640
So a lot of times, these
seem daunting.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.500
But when you get used to it,
these become kind of fun

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.270
problems. So f of g of x means,
in f of x , everywhere

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.390
you see an x you have to
replace it with g of x.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:11.160
So f of g of x is equal to
g of x squared minus 1.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.650
Now, all I did is if I said f of
dog, wherever I see an x, I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.220
would replace it.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.820
So f of dog would be dog
squared minus 1.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.920
Whenever I see an x I just
replace it with whatever I

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.000
input in right there.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.600
So they want to know f of g of
x , I stick a g of x there.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.680
So it's going to be g of
x squared minus 1.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.070
But what's g of x?

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.500
Well g of x is x plus 3.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.150
So this is going to be equal to
x plus 3 squared minus 1.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.840
Which is equal to x squared
plus 6x plus 9 minus 1.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.410
Which is equal to x squared
plus 6x plus 8.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.785
Which is choice B.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.630
Next question.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.200
Given that f of x is equal to 3x
squared minus 4 and g of x

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.390
is equal to 2x minus 6,
what is g of f of 2?

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.495
Well here, since they gave us
an actual number, so they

00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:14.220
didn't leave it abstract, we
could figure out what f of 2

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.030
is and then pop it into g.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.240
So what's f of 2?

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.000
Yeah, you should be able to
see that color. f of 2.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.810
Wherever you see an x, you
replace it with 2.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.240
So that equals 3 times
2 squared minus 4.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.420
Which is equal to-- 3 times
2 squared, 2 squared is

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.280
4 times 3 is 12.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.240
Minus 4 is equal to 8.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.190
So f of 2 is equal to 8.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.620
So g of f of 2 is
equal to g of 8.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.280
And what's g of 8?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.850
g of 8, everywhere you see
an x, just pop in an 8.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.850
Is equal to 2 times 8 minus 6.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.270
Is equal to 16 minus 6.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.820
So this is equal to 10.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.670
Choice D.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.920
Problem 73.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.630
If f of x is equal to x squared
plus 2x plus 1 and g

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.890
of x is equal to 3 times x plus
1 squared, which is the

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.990
equivalent form of f
of x plus g of x?

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.990
So essentially they just want us
to add these two functions.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.390
So if we say f of x plus g of
x-- let me do that. f of x--

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.370
and I'll do it in another
color-- plus g of x.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:36.840
Well now we just add them.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.780
What's f of x? f of x is x
squared-- I'll do it down

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.400
here-- x squared
plus 2x plus 1.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.325
That's f of x.

00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:49.220
Then we're going to add
g of x to that.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.332
Oh, I see why it's a little--
they want us-- g of x you kind

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.790
of have to expand this out.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.290
So g of x is 3 times
x plus 1 squared.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.150
Well that's 3 times x squared
plus 2x plus 1.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.370
But then from here we just have
to simplify this all out.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.200
And I'll do that in a
third neutral color.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.810
Brown color.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.000
x squared plus 2x plus 1 plus--
distribute the 3-- 3x

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.970
squared plus 6x plus 3.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.170
And now let's see, you have an
x squared and a 3x squared.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.400
You add those together,
you get 4x squared.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.270
And I have a 2x and
I have a 6x.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.310
Add those together,
I get plus 8x.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.800
And then I have a 1
and I have a 3.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.350
So plus 4.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.390
4x squared plus 8x plus 4.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.180
And that's choice C.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.590
Next problem.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.840
Next page.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.460
All right, let me see.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.510
What do they want
us to do here?

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.970
A math teacher is randomly
distributing 15 rulers with

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.780
centimeter labels and 10 rulers

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.260
without centimeter labels.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.360
All right.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.750
What is the probably the first
ruler she hands out will have

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.770
centimeter labels and the second
ruler will not have

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.440
centimeter labels?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.030
So, OK, let's think about
the first one.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.120
I'll color code it.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.220
So what is the probability that
the first ruler she hands

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.430
out will have centimeter
labels?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.320
So there's a total of
25 total rulers.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.100
15 with centimeters
and 10 without.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.580
At least initially, there's
a total of 25 rulers.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.720
And they want to know the
probability that the first

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.570
ruler she hands out will
have centimeter labels.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.130
So 15 have centimeters.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.240
So the probability
is 15 over 25.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.060
That's the probability
of the first one

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.310
having centimeter labels.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.300
That's that one.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.050
But they want to know, the first
one having centimeter

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.270
labels and the second ruler not
having-- and you can't see

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.050
that highlight color-- and the
second ruler will not have it.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.410
So this is-- so we're going
to have to multiply the

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.210
probability of the first ruler
times the probability that the

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:27.640
second, without labels, and now
this is the key-- given

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.550
that the first ruler
had labels.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.470
Now this might all seem really
complicated with the notation

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.050
but when you think of it
intuitively, it should

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.610
hopefully make some sense.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.050
I've given away-- so the first
ruler there's a 15 out of 25

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.500
chance that I've given
a ruler with labels.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.150
Now on the second ruler, since
both of these things have to

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.720
happen, I can assume that I've
already given away the first

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.590
ruler having labels.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.250
So how many rulers
do I have now?

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.190
Well I definitely have
24 rulers left.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.340
And now, how many of these
do not have labels?

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.000
Well the first ruler I gave
away had a label.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.950
So I still have 10 rulers that
do not have a label.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.015
If you wanted to ask a similar
question, you could say what

00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:16.890
is the probability that the
first two ones that I hand out

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:17.600
have labels?

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.940
That would be 15 over
25 times 14 over 24.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.570
Because the labels would've
been decremented

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.380
after the first one.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.100
Because we're assuming.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.370
We have to say both of
these things happen.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.960
Now we're saying, OK, we're
going to have one less ruler

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.750
but I haven't reduced
the number of

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.294
rulers without labels.

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:35.510
But anyway, let's just
simplify this out.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:42.300
This becomes 15 times 10
divided by 25 times 24.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.700
You can do a lot of canceling
so we don't have multiply--

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.030
let's see, divide that
by 3, get 3.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.610
Divide that by 3, get 5.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.660
Divide that by 5, you get 1.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.910
Divide that by 5 you get 2.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.730
3 times 2 is 6.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.590
So this is equal to 6 over 24.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.530
Which is equal to 1/4.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.313
Which is choice A.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.140
Next problem.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.880
Let's see.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:22.710
Problem 75.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.320
On a certain day the chance of
rain is 80% in San Francisco

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.860
and 30% in Sydney.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.100
Fair enough.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.990
Assume that the chance of rain
in the two cities is

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.000
independent.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.090
What is the probably that it
will not rain in either city?

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.080
So it's going to be the
probability of not rain, not

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:48.800
in San Francisco, times the
probability of not in Sydney.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.710
Because we have to have both of
these things happening and

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.430
they're independent.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.710
So the probabilities will
be multiplying.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.460
So what's the probability
of not

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.480
having rain in San Francisco?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.690
They gave us the chance
of having rain as 80%.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.270
So the probability of not
having rain is 20%.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.160
Or, I like to stick
to the fractions.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.330
20% is 1/5.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.830
There's a 1/5 probability
of not having rain.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.010
What's the probability of not
having rain in Sydney?

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.200
It's 30%.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.100
Actually, I probably should've
stayed in decimal world.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.660
So let's say it's 20% in San
Francisco of not having rain.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.900
The probability of Sydney of
not having rain is 1 minus

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:34.140
30%, or 0.7, which is a 70%
chance of not having rain.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.612
And that is equal to--
2 times 7 is 14.

00:10:36.612 --> 00:10:39.050
We have two numbers behind
the decimal point.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.760
So there's a 14% chance
that it will not

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.390
rain in either city.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.560
And that is choice B.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.880
Next problem.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.220
Well actually I'm out of time.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.060
See you in the next video.
