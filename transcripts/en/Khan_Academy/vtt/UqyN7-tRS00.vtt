00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
 

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.800
Perhaps even more interesting
than finding the inverse of a

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.210
matrix is trying to determine
when an inverse of a matrix

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.950
doesn't exist. Or when
it's undefined.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.865
And a square matrix for which
there is no inverse, of which

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.340
an inverse is undefined is
called a singular matrix.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.970
So let's think about what a
singular matrix will look

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.440
like, and how that applies to
the different problems that

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.140
we've address using matrices.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410
So if I had the other 2
by 2, because that's

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.420
just a simpler example.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.470
But it carries over into really
any size square matrix.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.530
So let's take our
2 by 2 matrix.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.320
And the elements are
a, b, c and d.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.220
What's the inverse
of that matrix?

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.510
This hopefully is a bit of
second nature to you now.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:51.765
It's 1 over the determinant of
a, times the adjoint of a.

00:00:51.765 --> 00:00:53.780
And in this case, you just
switch these two terms. So you

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.200
have a d and an a.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.480
And you make these two
terms negative.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.710
So you have minus
c and minus b.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.420
So my question to you is, what
will make this entire

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.410
expression undefined?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.260
Well it doesn't matter what
numbers I have. If I have

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.740
numbers here that make a
defined, then I can obviously

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.470
swap them or make them negative,
and it won't change

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.030
this part of the expression.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.130
But what would create a problem
is if we attempted to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.410
divide by 0 here.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.100
If the determinant of the
matrix A were undefined.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:40.560
So A inverse is undefined, if
and only if-- and in math they

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.770
sometimes write it if with two
f's-- if and only if the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.460
determinant of A
is equal to 0.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.910
So the other way to view that
is, if a determinant of any

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.720
matrix is equal to 0, then
that matrix is a singular

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.480
matrix, and it has no inverse,
or the inverse is undefined.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.950
So let's think about in
conceptual terms, at least the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.200
two problems that we've looked
at, what a 0 determinant

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.500
means, and see if we can get a
little bit of intuition for

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.580
why there is no inverse.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.830
So what is a 0 determinant?

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.850
In this case, what's a
determinant of this 2 by 2?

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.170
Well the determinant of
A is equal to what?

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.900
It's equal to ad minus bc.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.560
 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.360
So this matrix is singular, or
it has no inverse, if this

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.680
expression is equal to 0.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.990
So let me write that
over here.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:40.380
So if ad is equal to bc-- or we
can just manipulate things,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.350
and we could say if a/b is equal
to c/d-- I just divided

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.230
both sides by b, and divided
both sides by d-- so if the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.200
ratio of a:b is the same as the
ratio of c:d, then this

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.010
will have no inverse.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.230
Or another way we could write
this expression, if a/c-- if I

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.310
divide both sides by c, and
divide both sides by d-- is

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.600
equal to b/d.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.360
So another way that this would
be singular is if-- and it's

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.290
actually the same way.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.570
If this is true, then
this is true.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.630
These are the same.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.150
Just a little bit of algebraic
manipulation.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.690
But if the ratio of a:c is equal
to the ratio of b:d, and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.270
you can think about why
that's the same thing.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.900
The ratio of a:b being
the same thing as

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.610
the ratio of c:d.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.200
But anyway, I don't want
to confuse you.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.180
But let's think about how that
translates into some of the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.350
problems that we looked at.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.900
So let's say that we wanted to
look at the problem-- Let's

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.110
say that we had this matrix
representing the linear

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.920
equation problem.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.000
Well, actually, this would
be either one.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:01.290
So I have a, b, c, d times x,
y Is equal to two other

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.530
numbers that we haven't
used yet, e and f.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.850
So if we have this matrix
equation representing the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.830
linear equation problem, then
the linear equation problem

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:23.360
would be translated a times x
plus b times y is equal to e.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.290
And c times x plus d times
y is equal to f.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.690
And we would want to see where
these two intersect.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.950
That would be the solution,
the vector

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.150
solution to this equation.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.850
And so, just to get a visual
understanding of what these

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.850
two lines look like, let's
put it into the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.200
slope y-intercept form.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.930
So this would become what?

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.190
In this case, y is
equal to what?

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:04.610
y is equal to minus
a/b, x plus e/b.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.620
I'm just skipping some steps.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.630
But you subtract ax
from both sides.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.580
And then divide both sides
by b, and you get that.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.365
And then this equation, if you
put it in the same form, just

00:05:14.365 --> 00:05:15.690
solve for y.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:35.930
You get y is equal to minus
c/d x plus f/y.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.120
So let's think about this.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.720
I should probably change colors
because it looks too--

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.910
Let's think about what these two
equations would look like

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.160
if this holds.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.730
 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.580
And we said if this holds, then
we have no determinant,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.260
and this becomes a singular
matrix, and it has no inverse.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.990
And since it has no inverse, you
can't solve this equation

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.110
by multiplying both sides by
the inverse, because the

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.430
inverse doesn't exist.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.560
So let's think about this.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.410
If this is true, we have no
determinant, but what does

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.200
that mean intuitively in terms
of these equations?

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.540
Well if a/b is equal to c/d,
these two lines will have the

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.380
same slope.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.670
They'll have the same slope.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.150
So if these two expressions are
different, then what do we

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.400
know about them?

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.380
If two lines that have the
same slope and different

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.450
y-intercepts, they're parallel
to each other, and they will

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.170
never, ever intersect.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:46.000
So let me draw that, just so you
get the-- this top line--

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.690
They don't have to be positive
numbers, but since this has a

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.130
negative, I'll draw it
as a negative slope.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.740
So that's the first line.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.310
And its y-intercept
will be e/b.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.830
 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.960
That's this line right here.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.970
And then the second line-- let
me do it in another color-- I

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.800
don't know if it's going to be
above or below that line, but

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.610
it's going to be parallel.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.910
It'll look something
like this.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.750
 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.520
And that line's y-intercept--
so that's this line-- that

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.570
line's y intercept is
going to be f/y.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.370
So if e/b and f/y are different
terms, but both

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.290
lines have the same equation,
they're going to be parallel

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.280
and they'll never intersect.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.780
So there actually would
be no solution.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.800
If someone told you-- just the
traditional way that you've

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.730
done it, either through
substitution, or through

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.920
adding or subtracting the
linear equations-- you

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.450
wouldn't be able to find a
solution where these two

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.470
intersect, if a/b
is equal to c/d.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.040
So one way to view the singular
matrix is that you

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.140
have parallel lines.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.610
Well then you might say, hey
Sal, but these two lines would

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.490
intersect if e/b equaled f/y.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.800
If this and this were the
same, then these would

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.510
actually be the identical
lines.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.730
And not only would they
intersect, they would

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.060
intersect in an infinite
number of places.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.550
But still you would have
no unique solution.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.260
You'd have no one solution
to this equation.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.320
It would be true at all
values of x and y.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.290
So you can kind of view it when
you apply the matrices to

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.970
this problem.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.780
The matrix is singular, if the
two lines that are being

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:29.960
represented are either parallel,
or they are the

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.230
exact same line.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.559
They're parallel and not
intersecting at all.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.450
Or they are the exact same line,
and they intersect at an

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.880
infinite number of points.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.159
And so it kind of makes
sense that the A

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.039
inverse wasn't defined.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.610
So let's think about this in
the context of the linear

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.070
combinations of vectors.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.970
That's not what I wanted
to use to erase it.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:59.250
 

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.970
So when we think of this problem
in terms of linear

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.220
combination of factors, we can
think of it like this.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:15.010
That this is the same thing as
the vector ac times x plus the

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:25.500
vector bd times y, is equal
to the vector ef.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.180
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.110
We're saying, is there some
combination of the vector ac

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.510
and the vector bd that
equals the vector ef.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:39.440
But we just said that if we have
no inverse here, we know

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.890
that because the determinant
is 0.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.400
And if the determinant is 0,
then we know in this situation

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.580
that a/c must equal b/d.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.120
So a/c is equal to b/d.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.050
So what does that tell us?

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.730
Well let me draw it.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.710
And maybe numbers would
be more helpful here.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.950
But I think you'll get
the intuition.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.390
I'll just draw the
first quadrant.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.282
I'll just assume both vectors
are in the first quadrant.

00:10:09.282 --> 00:10:10.835
Let me draw.

00:10:10.835 --> 00:10:17.990
 

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.590
The vector ac.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:20.755
Let's say that this is a.

00:10:20.755 --> 00:10:23.072
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:10:23.072 --> 00:10:24.860
So I'm gonna draw
the vector ac.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:31.540
So if this is a, and this
is c, then the vector

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.870
ac looks like that.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.260
Let me draw it.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.210
I want to make this neat.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.440
The vector ac is like that.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.120
And then we have the arrow.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.950
And what would the vector
bd look like?

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:49.700
 

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.310
Well the vector bd--
And I could draw

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.210
it arbitrarily someplace.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.580
But we're assuming that there's
no derivative-- sorry,

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.660
no determinant.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.330
Have I been saying derivative
the whole time?

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.090
I hope not.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.380
Well, we're assuming
that there's no

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.070
determinant to this matrix.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.010
So if there's no determinant,
we know that

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.510
a/c is equal to b/d.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:16.120
Or another way to view it is
that c/d is equal to d/b.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.930
But what that tells you is that
both of these vectors

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.350
kind of have the same slope.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.580
So if they both start at point
0, they're going to go in the

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.140
same direction.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.500
They might have a different
magnitude, but they're going

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.080
to go in the same direction.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:37.010
So if this is point b, and this
is point d, vector bd is

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.540
going to be here.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.050
And if that's not obvious to
you, think a little bit about

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.080
why these two vectors, if this
is true, are going to point in

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.200
the same direction.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.020
So that vector is going to
essentially overlap.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.040
It's going to have the same
direction as this vector, but

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.260
it's just going to have
a different magnitude.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.730
It might have the
same magnitude.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.480
So my question to you is, vector
ef, we don't know where

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.600
vector ef is.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.190
Well let's pick some
arbitrary point.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.080
Let's say that this is
e, and this is f.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.700
So this is vector ef up there.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.130
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.250
Vector ef, let's
say it's there.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.420
 

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.510
So my question to you is, if
these two vectors are in the

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.310
same direction.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.850
Maybe of different magnitude.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.620
Is there any way that you can
add or subtract combinations

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.140
of these two vectors to
get to this vector?

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.420
Well no, you can scale these
vectors and add them.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.650
And all you're going to do is
kind of move along this line.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.610
You can get to any
other vector.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.800
There's a multiple of one
of these vectors.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.990
But because these are the exact
same direction, you

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.560
can't get to any vector that's
in a different direction.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.050
So if this vector is in a
different direction, there's

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.260
no solution here.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:13:00.530
If this vector just happened to
be in the same direction as

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.980
this, then there would be a
solution, where you could just

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.790
scale those.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.100
Actually, there would be an
infinite number of solutions

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.500
in terms of x and y.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.580
But if the vector is slightly
different, in terms of its

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.320
direction, then there
is no solution.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.310
There is no combination of this
vector and this vector

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.980
that can add you
up to this one.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.385
And it's something for you
think about a little bit.

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.360
It might be obvious to you.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.730
But another way to think about
it is, when you're trying to

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.000
take sums of vectors, any other
vector, in order to move

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.150
it in that direction, you have
to have a little bit of one

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.470
direction and a little bit of
another direction, to get to

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:34.230
any other vector.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.520
And if both of your ingredient
vectors are the same

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.240
direction, there's no way to
get to a different one.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.450
Anyway, I'm probably just being
circular in what I'm

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.240
explaining.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.150
But that hopefully gives you a
little bit of an intuition of

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.800
well, one, you now know what
a singular matrix is.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:57.850
You know when you can not
find its inverse.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.320
You know that when the
determinant is 0, you won't

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:01.800
find an inverse.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.730
And hopefully-- and this was
the whole point of this

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.870
video-- you have an intuition
of why that is.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.050
Because if you're looking at the
vector problem, there's no

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.830
way that you can find-- that
either there's no solution to

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.650
finding the combination of the
vectors that get you to that

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.200
vector, or there are
an infinite number.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.030
And the same thing is
true of finding the

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.090
intersection of two lines.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.480
They're either parallel, or
they're the same line, if the

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.640
determinant is 0.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.850
Anyway, I will see you
in the next video.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:26.500
