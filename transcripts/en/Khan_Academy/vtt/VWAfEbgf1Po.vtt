00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
On a multiple choice test,
problem 1 has 4 choices, and

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.490
problem 2 has 3 choices.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.910
That should be choices.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.770
Each problem has only
one correct answer.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.830
What is the probability of
randomly guessing the correct

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.700
answer on both problems?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.100
Now, the probability of guessing
the correct answer on

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.685
each problem-- these are
independent events.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:23.830
So let's write this down.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:34.380
The probability of correct
on problem number 1 is

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.160
independent.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.300
Or let me write it this way.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.090
Probability of correct on number
1 and probability of

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.136
correct on number 2, on problem
2, are independent.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.650
Which means that the outcome
of one of the events, of

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.650
guessing on the first problem,
isn't going to affect the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.950
probability of guessing
correctly

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.129
on the second problem.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.250
Independent events.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.800
So the probability of guessing
on both of them-- so that

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:22.030
means that the probability of
being correct-- on guessing

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.320
correct on 1 and number 2 is
going to be equal to the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.270
product of these
probabilities.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.480
And we're going to see why that
is visually in a second.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.620
But it's going to be the
probability of correct on

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:43.990
number 1 times the probability
of being correct on number 2.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.310
Now, what are each of
these probabilities?

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.170
On number 1, there are 4
choices, there are 4 possible

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.620
outcomes, and only one of them
is going to be correct.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.040
Each one only has one
correct answer.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.640
So the probability of being
correct on problem 1 is 1/4.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.480
And then the probability of
being correct on problem

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.010
number 2-- problem number 2 has
three choices, so there's

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.960
three possible outcomes.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.810
And there's only one correct
one, so only

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.949
one of them are correct.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.920
So probability of correct
on number 2 is 1/3.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.370
Probability of guessing correct
on number 1 is 1/4.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.020
The probability of doing on both
of them is going to be

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.010
its product.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.450
So it's going to be equal to
1/4 times 1/3 is 1/12.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.305
Now, to see kind of visually
why this make sense, let's

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:31.370
draw a little chart here.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.850
And we did a similar thing for
when we thought about rolling

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.780
two separate dice.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.330
So let's think about
problem number 1.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.750
Problem number 1 has
4 choices, only

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.480
one of which is correct.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.950
So let's write-- so
it has 4 choices.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.810
So it has 1-- let's write
incorrect choice 1, incorrect

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.120
choice 2, incorrect choice 3,
and then it has the correct

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.480
choice over there.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.620
So those are the 4 choices.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.180
They're not going to necessarily
be in that order

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.740
on the exam, but we can just
list them in this order.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:10.160
Now problem number 2
has 3 choices, only

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.900
one of which is correct.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.700
So problem number 2 has
incorrect choice 1, incorrect

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.850
choice 2, and then let's say the
third choice is correct.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.800
It's not necessarily in that
order, but we know it has 2

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.760
incorrect and 1 correct
choices.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.970
Now, what are all of the
different possible outcomes?

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.550
We can draw a little
bit of a grid here.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.550
All of these possible
outcomes.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.220
Let's draw all of
the outcomes.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.630
Each of these cells or each of
these boxes in a grid are a

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.900
possible outcome.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.290
You could-- you're
just guessing.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.350
You're randomly choosing one
of these 4, you're randomly

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.850
choosing one of these 4.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.000
So you might get incorrect
choice 1 and incorrect choice

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.690
1-- incorrect choice in problem
number 1 and then

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.020
incorrect choice in
problem number 2.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.870
That would be that
cell right there.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.150
Maybe you get this-- maybe you
get problem number 1 correct,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.650
but you get incorrect choice
number 2 in problem number 2.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.880
So these would represent all of
the possible outcomes when

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.200
you guess on each problem.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.700
And which of these outcomes
represent

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.570
getting correct on both?

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.800
Well, getting correct on both
is only this one, correct on

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.190
choice 1 and correct on choice--
on problem number 2.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.430
And so that's one of the
possible outcomes and how many

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.510
total outcomes are there?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.930
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, out of 12

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.870
possible outcomes.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.960
Or since these are independent
events, you can multiply.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.910
You see that they're 12 outcomes
because there's 12

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.170
possible outcomes.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.340
So there's 4 possible outcomes
for problem number 1, times

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.050
the 3 possible outcomes for
problem number 2, and that's

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.330
also where you get a 12.
