00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.960
Rewrite the expression 4 times,
and then in parentheses

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.810
we have 8 plus 3, using the
distributive law of

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.960
multiplication over addition.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.880
Then simplify the expression.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.050
So let's just try to solve
this or evaluate this

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.080
expression, then we'll talk
a little bit about the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.720
distributive law of
multiplication over addition,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.100
usually just called the
distributive law.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:34.250
So we have 4 times
8 plus 8 plus 3.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.070
Now there's two ways to do it.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.630
Normally, when you have
parentheses, your inclination

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.020
is, well, let me just evaluate
what's in the parentheses

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.430
first and then worry about
what's outside of the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.110
parentheses, and we can do
that fairly easily here.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.520
We can evaluate what
8 plus 3 is.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.940
8 plus 3 is 11.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.030
So if we do that-- let me do
that in this direction.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.820
So if we do that, we get 4
times, and in parentheses we

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.120
have an 11.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.090
8 plus 3 is 11, and then this
is going to be equal to--

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.820
well, 4 times 11 is just
44, so you can

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.880
evaluate it that way.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.790
But they want us to use the
distributive law of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.510
multiplication.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960
We did not use the distributive
law just now.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.270
We just evaluated
the expression.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.470
We used the parentheses first,
then multiplied by 4.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.330
In the distributive law, we
multiply by 4 first. And it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.080
called the distributive law
because you distribute the 4,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.040
and we're going to think
about what that means.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.200
So in the distributive law, what
this will become, it'll

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.120
become 4 times 8 plus 4 times
3, and we're going to think

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.490
about why that is in a second.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:52.620
So this is going to be equal to
4 times 8 plus 4 times 3.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.920
A lot of people's first instinct
is just to multiply

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.680
the 4 times the 8, but no!

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.110
You have to distribute the 4.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.250
You have to multiply it times
the 8 and times the 3.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.040
This is right here.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.200
This is the distributive
property in action right here.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.139
Distributive property
in action.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.770
And then when you evaluate it--
and I'm going to show you

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.190
in kind of a visual way
why this works.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.680
But then when you evaluate it,
4 times 8-- I'll do this in a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.010
different color-- 4 times 8 is
32, and then so we have 32

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.780
plus 4 times 3.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.840
4 times 3 is 12 and 32 plus
12 is equal to 44.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.040
That is also equal to 44, so
you can get it either way.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.860
But when they want us to use
the distributive law, you'd

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.130
distribute the 4 first.
Now let's think

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.290
about why that happens.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.670
Let's visualize just
what 8 plus 3 is.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.400
Let me draw eight
of something.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.930
So one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.380
seven, eight, right?

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.380
And then we're going to add to
that three of something, of

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.710
maybe the same thing.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.880
One, two, three.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.760
So you can imagine this is what
we have inside of the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.350
parentheses.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.240
We have 8 circles
plus 3 circles.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.900
Now, when we're multiplying this
whole thing, this whole

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.120
thing times 4, what
does that mean?

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.330
Well, that means we're just
going to add this to itself

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.690
four times.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.750
Let me do that with
a copy and paste.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.470
Copy and paste.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.860
Let me copy and then
let me paste.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.410
There you go.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.240
That's two.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.780
That's one, two, three, and then
we have four, and we're

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.460
going to add them
all together.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.690
So this is literally what?

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.020
Four times, right?

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.290
Let me go back to the
drawing tool.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.630
We have it one, two, three, four
times this expression,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.750
which is 8 plus 3.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.750
Now, what is this
thing over here?

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.120
If you were to count all of this
stuff, you would get 44.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.710
But what is this thing
over here?

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.140
Well, that's 8 added to
itself four times.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.800
You could imagine you're
adding all of these.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.120
So what's 8 added to
itself four times?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.279
That is 4 times 8.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:22.780
So this is 4 times 8,
and what is this

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.710
over here in the orange?

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.030
We have one, two, three,
four times.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.330
Well, each time we have three.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.620
So it's 4 times this
right here.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.580
This right here is 4 times 3.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.620
So you see why the distributive
property works.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.170
If you do 4 times 8 plus 3, you
have to multiply-- when

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.570
you, I guess you could imagine,
duplicate the thing

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.450
four times, both the 8 and the
3 is getting duplicated four

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.000
times or it's being added to
itself four times, and that's

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.290
why we distribute the 4.
