00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.790
Before we move on past the
method of undetermined

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.140
coefficients, I want to make and
interesting and actually a

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.400
useful point.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.170
Let's say that I had the
following nonhomogeneous

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.830
differential equation: the
second derivative of y minus 3

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.220
times the first derivative minus
4y is equal to-- now

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.650
this is where gets interesting--
3e to the 2x

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:41.870
plus 2 sine of x plus-- let me
make sure that I'm doing the

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.780
same problems that I've
already worked

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.400
on-- plus 4x squared.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.640
So you might say,
wow, this is a

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.350
tremendously complicated problem.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.730
I have the 3 types of functions
I've been exposed

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.180
to, I would have so many
undetermined coefficients, it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.020
would get really unwieldy.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.410
And this is where you need
to make a simplifying

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.110
realization.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.560
We know the three particular
solutions to the following

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.410
differential equations.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.870
We know the solution to the
second derivative minus 3

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.750
times the first derivative
minus 4y.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.890
Well, this is this the
homogeneous, right?

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.000
And we know that the solution to
the homogeneous equation--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.865
we did this a bunch of times--
is C1e to the 4x plus C2e to

00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:30.180
the minus x.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.150
We know the solution to-- and
I'll switch colors, just for a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.820
variety-- y prime prime minus 3y
prime minus 4y is equal to

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.310
just this alone: 3e to the 2x.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.470
And we saw that that particular
solution there, y

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.920
particular, was minus
1/2 e to the 2x.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.600
And we did this using
undetermined coefficients.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.560
We did that a couple
of videos ago.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.070
And then let me just write this
out a couple of times.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.940
We know the solution to
this one, as well.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.130
This was another particular
solution we found.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.160
I think it was two videos ago.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.700
And we found that the particular
solution in this

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.060
case-- and this was a fairly
hairy problem-- was minus 5/17

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.020
x plus 3/17.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.000
Sorry.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.250
The particular solution was
minus 5/17 sine of x plus 3/17

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.545
cosine of x.

00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:43.910
And then finally this last
polynomial, we could call it.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.430
We know the solution when that
was just the right-hand side.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.560
That was this equation.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.040
And there we figured out-- and
this was in the last video.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.460
We figured out that the
particular solution in this

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:08.240
case was minus x squared
plus 3/2 x minus 13/8.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.650
So we know the particular
solution when 0's on the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.240
right-hand side.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.230
We know it when just 3e to the
2x is on the right-hand side.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.820
We know it just when 2 sine of
x is on the right-hand side.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.650
And we know it just when
4x squared is on

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.790
the right-hand side.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.650
First of all, the particular
solution to this

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.540
nonhomogeneous equation, we
could just take the sum of the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.330
three particular solutions.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.800
And that makes sense, right?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.235
Because one of the particular
solutions, like this one when

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:35.710
you put it on the left-hand
side, it will

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.480
just equal this term.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.640
This particular solution, when
you put it in the left-hand

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.230
side, will equal this term.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.760
And finally, this particular
solution, when you put it on

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.670
the left-hand side, will
equal the 4x squared.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.250
And then you could add the
homogeneous solution to that.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.020
You put it in this side
and you'll get 0.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.160
So it won't change the
right-hand side.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.900
And then you will have the most
general solution because

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.260
you have these two constants
that you can solve for

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.180
depending on your initial
condition.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.890
So the solution to this
seemingly hairy differential

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.980
equation is really just the sum
of these four solutions.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.209
Let me clean up some space
because I want everything to

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.410
be on the board at
the same time.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:27.230
So the solution is going
to be-- well, I

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.480
want that to be deleted.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.210
I'll do it in baby blue.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.400
Is going to be the solution to
the homogeneous C1e to the 4x

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.580
plus C2e to the minus x
minus 1/2 e the to 2x.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.220
And I'll continue this line.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:05:01.670
Minus 5/17 sine of x plus 3/17
cosine of x minus x squared

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.030
plus 3/2 x minus 13/8.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.140
And it seems daunting.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.170
When you saw this, it probably
looked daunting.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.030
This solution, if I told you
this was a solution and you

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.400
didn't know how to do
undetermined coefficients,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.740
you're like, oh, I would never
be able to figure out

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.690
something like that.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.930
But the important realization is
that you just have to find

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.420
the particular solutions for
each of these terms and then

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.170
sum them up.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.170
And then add them to the general
solution for the

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.255
homogeneous equation,
if this was a 0 on

00:05:29.255 --> 00:05:30.130
the right-hand side.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.410
And then you get the general
solution for this fairly

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:42.860
intimidating-looking second
order linear nonhomogeneous

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.940
differential equation with
constant coefficients.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.610
See you in the next video, where
we'll start learning

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.460
another method for solving
nonhomogeneous equations.
