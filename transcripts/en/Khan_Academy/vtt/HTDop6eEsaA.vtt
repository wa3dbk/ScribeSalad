00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.200
SAL: Two videos ago we learned
about half-lives.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.750
And we saw that they're good if
we are trying to figure out

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.020
how much of a compound we have
left after one half-life, or

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.830
two half-lives, or
three half-lives.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.250
We can just take 1/2 of the
compound at every period.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.940
But it's not as useful if we're
trying to figure out how

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.960
much of a compound we have after
1/2 of a half-life, or

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.610
after one day, or 10 seconds,
or 10 billion years.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.030
And to address that issue in the
last video, I proved that

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.720
it involved a little bit
of sophisticated math.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.490
And if you haven't taken
calculus, you can really just

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.220
skip that video.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.990
You don't have to watch it
for an intro math class.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.180
But if you're curious, that's
where we proved

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.950
the following formula.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.050
That at any given point of
time, if you have some

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.220
decaying atom, some element,
it can be described as the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.220
amount of element you have at
any period of time is equal to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.080
the amount you started off
with, times e to some

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.280
constant-- in the last
video I use lambda.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.450
I could use k this time--
minus k times t.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.670
And then for a particular
element with a particular

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.980
half-life you can just solve for
the k, and then apply it

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.660
to your problem.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.030
So let's do that in this video,
just so that all of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.110
these variables can become a
little bit more concrete.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.790
So let's figure out the general
formula for carbon.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.660
Carbon-14, that's the one that
we addressed in the half-life.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.530
We saw that carbon-14 has a
half-life of 5,730 years.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.200
So let's see if we can somehow
take this information and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.390
apply it to this equation.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.500
So this tells us that after
one half-life-- so

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.360
t is equal to 5,730.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.930
N of 5,730 is equal to the
amount we start off with.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.320
So we're starting off with,
well, we're starting off with

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.590
N sub 0 times e to the minus--
wherever you see the t you put

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:01.180
the minus 5,730-- so minus
k, times 5,730.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.860
That's how many years
have gone by.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.660
And half-life tells us that
after 5,730 years we'll have

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.690
1/2 of our initial
sample left.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.050
So we'll have 1/2 of our
initial sample left.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.580
So if we try to solve
this equation for

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.000
k, what do we get?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.180
Divide both sides by N naught.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.110
Get rid of that variable, and
then we're left with e to the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.620
minus 5,730k-- I'm just
switching these two around--

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.075
is equal to 1/2.

00:02:29.075 --> 00:02:32.060
If we take the natural log of
both sides, what do we get?

00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:38.220
The natural log of e to
anything, the natural log of e

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.540
to the a is just a.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.170
So the natural log of this is
minus 5,730k is equal to the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.030
natural log of 1/2.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.950
I just took the natural
log of both sides.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.940
The natural log and natural
log of both sides of that.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.400
And so to solve for k, we could
just say, k is equal to

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.170
the natural log of 1/2 over
minus 5,730, which we did in

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.030
the previous video.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.860
But let's see if we can do that
again here, to avoid--

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.560
for those who might
have skipped it.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.590
So if you have 1/2, 0.5, take
the natural log, and then you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:29.580
divide it by 5,730, it's a
negative 5,730, you get 1.2

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.380
times 10 to the negative 4.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.830
So it equals 1.2 times
10 to the minus 4.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.250
So now we have the general
formula for carbon-14, given

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.480
its half-life.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.990
At any given point in time,
after our starting point-- so

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.940
this is for, let's call this for
carbon-14, for c-14-- the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.560
amount of carbon-14 we're going
to have left is going to

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.690
be the amount that we started
with times e to the minus k. k

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.070
we just solved for.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.930
1.2 times 10 to the minus 4,
times the amount of time that

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.360
has passed by.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.700
This is our formula for
carbon, for carbon-14.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.650
If we were doing this for some
other element, we would use

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.610
that element's half-life to
figure out how much we're

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.660
going to have at any given
period of time to figure out

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.170
the k value.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.880
So let's use this to
solve a problem.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.680
Let's say that I start off
with, I don't know, say I

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:34.530
start off with 300 grams
of carbon, carbon-14.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.150
And I want to know, how much do
I have after, I don't know,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.250
after 2000 years?

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.510
How much do I have?

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.940
Well I just plug into
the formula.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.900
N of 2000 is equal to the amount
that I started off

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:02.670
with, 300 grams, times e to the
minus 1.2 times 10 to the

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.990
minus 4, times t, is times
2000, times 2000.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.330
So what is that?

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.230
So I already have that 1.2 times
10 the minus 4 there.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.920
So let me say, times 2000
equals-- and of course, this

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.790
throws a negative out there,
so let me put the negative

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.730
number out there.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.060
So there's a negative.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.130
And I have to raise
e to this power.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.430
So it's 0.241.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.790
So this is equal to N of 2000.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.110
The amount of the substance I
can expect after 2000 years is

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:42.630
equal to 300 times e to
the minus 0.2419.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.370
And let's see, my calculator
doesn't have an e to the

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.660
power, so Let me just take e.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.900
I need to get a better
calculator.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.840
I should get my scientific
calculator back.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.830
But e is, let's say 2.71-- I
can keep adding digits but

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.130
I'll just do 2.71-- to the 0.24
negative, which is equal

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:13.830
to 0.78 times the amount that I
started off with, times 300,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:21.550
which is equal to 236 grams. So
this is equal to 236 grams.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.480
So just like that, using this
exponential decay formula, I

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.140
was able to figure out how
much of the carbon I have

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.890
after kind of an unusual
period of time, a

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.540
non-half-life period of time.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.080
Let's do another
one like this.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.170
Let's go the other way around.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.430
Let's say, I'm trying
to figure out.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:48.980
Let's say I start off with
400 grams of c-14.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.440
And I want to know how long--
so I want to know a certain

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.790
amount of time-- does it
take for me to get to

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.380
350 grams of c-14?

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.040
So, you just say that 350
grams is how much

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.870
I'm ending up with.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.570
It's equal to the amount that I
started off with, 400 grams,

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.430
times e to the minus k.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.160
That's minus 1.2 times 10 to
the minus 4, times time.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.190
And now we solve for time.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.620
How do we do that?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.840
Well we could divide
both sides by 400.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.960
What's 350 divided by 400?

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.180
350 by 400.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.340
It's 7/8.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.230
So 0.875.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:37.780
So you get 0.875 is equal to e
to the minus 1.2 times 10 to

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.100
the minus 4t.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.890
You take the natural
log of both sides.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.460
You get the natural log of
0.875 is equal to-- the

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.100
natural log of e to anything is
just the anything-- so it's

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:54.990
equal to minus 1.2 times
10 to the minus 4t.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:00.280
And so t is equal to this
divided by 1.2 times 10

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.130
to the minus 4.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:07.560
So the natural log, 0.875
divided by minus 1.2 times 10

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.650
to the minus 4, is equal to the
amount of time it would

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.620
take us to get from
400 grams to 350.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.535
[PHONE RINGS]

00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:17.930
My cell phone is ringing,
let me turn that off.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.350
To 350.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.120
So let me do the math.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.030
So if you have 0.875, and we
want to take the natural log

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:37.120
of it, and divide it by minus
1.-- So divided by 1.2e 4

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.480
negative, 10 to the
negative 4.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.169
This is all a negative number.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.250
Oh, I'll just divide it by this,
and then just take the

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.290
negative of that.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.170
Equals that and then I have
to take a negative.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:55.410
So this is equal to 1,112 years
to get from 400 to 350

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.440
grams of my substance.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.970
This might seem a little
complicated, but if there's

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.890
one thing you just have to do,
is you just have to remember

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.570
this formula.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.160
And if you want to know where
it came from, watch the

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.230
previous video.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.370
For any particular element you
solve for this k value.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.000
And then you just substitute
what you know, and then solve

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.230
for what you don't know.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.030
I'll do a couple more of these
in the next video.
