00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.988
- Hello, everyone. In
these next few videos,

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:03.571
I'm going to be talking
about something called,

00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:04.998
the Jacobian,

00:00:04.998 --> 00:00:08.070
and more specifically,
it's the Jacobian matrix,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.628
or sometimes the associated determinant,

00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:11.843
and here, I just want to talk

00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:14.123
about some of the background
knowledge that I'm assuming,

00:00:14.123 --> 00:00:15.864
because to understand the Jacobian,

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:16.851
you do have to have a little bit

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:19.524
of a background in linear
algebra, and in particular,

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:22.136
I want to make sure that
everyone here understands

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:26.814
how to think about matrices
as transformations of space,

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:27.973
When I say transformations,

00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:29.519
here, let me just get
kind of a matrix on here.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.186
I'll call it two one
and negative three one.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.359
You'll see why I'm coloring
it like this in just a moment.

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:38.854
When I say, how to think about this

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:40.716
as a transformation of space,

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:42.589
I mean, you can multiply a matrix

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.116
by some kind of two-dimensional vector,

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:47.349
some kind of two-dimensional x y,

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:50.228
and this is going to give us
a new two-dimensional vector.

00:00:50.228 --> 00:00:52.812
This is going to bring us
to, let's see in this case,

00:00:52.812 --> 00:00:53.645
it'll be,

00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:59.936
I'll write kind of two
one negative three one,

00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:01.328
where what it gives us

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:04.661
is two x plus negative three times y,

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:09.444
and then, one x plus one times y.

00:01:11.963 --> 00:01:14.879
Right? This is a new
two-dimensional vector

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:17.445
somewhere else in space,

00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:19.299
and even if you know how to compute it,

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.763
there's still room for a
deeper geometric understanding

00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:24.763
of what it actually means
to take a vector x y

00:01:24.763 --> 00:01:27.808
to the vector two x plus negative three y

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:30.238
and one x plus one y.

00:01:30.238 --> 00:01:31.862
There's also still a deeper understanding

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:36.422
in what we mean when we call
this a linear transformation,

00:01:36.422 --> 00:01:38.422
a linear transformation.

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.643
What I'm going to do is just show you

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.872
what this particular
transformation looks like

00:01:43.872 --> 00:01:46.298
on the left here, where every single point

00:01:46.298 --> 00:01:48.832
on this blue grid, I'm
going to tell the computer,

00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:51.969
"Hey, if that point was x
y, I want you to take it

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.676
to two x plus negative
three y, one x plus one y.

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:57.917
Here's what it looks like.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.148
Let me just kind of play it out here.

00:02:00.148 --> 00:02:02.059
All of the points in space move,

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.443
and you end up in some final state here.

00:02:04.443 --> 00:02:06.475
There are a couple
important things to note.

00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:08.467
First of all, all of the grid lines

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:10.747
remain parallel and evenly spaced,

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:11.843
and they're still lines.

00:02:11.843 --> 00:02:13.627
They didn't get curved in some way,

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:15.059
and that's very, very special.

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.084
That is the geometric
way that you can think

00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:20.499
about this term, this idea
of a linear transformation.

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.484
I kind of like to think about
it that lines stay lines,

00:02:23.484 --> 00:02:25.699
and in particular the grid lines here,

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:27.067
the ones that started off

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:29.870
as kind of vertical and horizontal,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.822
they still remain parallel,

00:02:31.822 --> 00:02:34.650
and they still remain evenly spaced.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.841
The other thing to notice here is

00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:37.962
I have these two vectors highlighted:

00:02:37.962 --> 00:02:39.994
the green vector and the red vector.

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:42.002
These are the ones that started off,

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:43.425
if we kind of back things up,

00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:45.105
these are the ones that started off

00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:47.438
as the basis vectors, right?

00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:50.274
Let me kind of make a
little bit more room here.

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:52.691
The green vector is one zero,

00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:56.742
one in the x-direction,
zero in the y-direction,

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:59.286
and then that red vertical vector here,

00:02:59.286 --> 00:03:00.286
is zero one,

00:03:02.283 --> 00:03:03.116
zero one.

00:03:06.246 --> 00:03:08.565
If we notice where they land,

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:10.437
under this transformation,

00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:11.511
when the matrix is multiplied

00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:14.666
by every single vector in space,

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:16.704
the place where the green vector lands,

00:03:16.704 --> 00:03:18.672
the one that started off as one zero,

00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:20.672
has coordinates two one,

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:23.536
and that corresponds very
directly with the fact

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.993
that the first column of
our matrix is two one.

00:03:26.993 --> 00:03:29.481
Then, similarly, over
here, the second vector,

00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:31.369
the one that started off as zero one,

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.225
ends up at the coordinates
negative three one,

00:03:34.225 --> 00:03:36.106
and that's what corresponds with the fact

00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:40.032
that the next column
is negative three one.

00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:41.831
It's actually relatively simple to see

00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:43.759
why that's going to be true.

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.201
Here, I'll go ahead and
multiply this matrix

00:03:46.201 --> 00:03:47.538
that we had that was ...

00:03:47.538 --> 00:03:48.902
See now it's kind of easy to remember

00:03:48.902 --> 00:03:49.820
what the matrix is, right?

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.285
I can just kind of read it off here

00:03:51.285 --> 00:03:53.785
as two one negative three one,

00:03:55.477 --> 00:03:58.309
but just to see why it's
actually taking the basis vectors

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.324
to the columns like this,

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:03.907
when you do the
multiplication by one zero,

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:09.784
notice how it's going to take us to,

00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:12.183
so it's two times one, that'll be two,

00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:14.119
and then, negative three times zero,

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.088
so that'll just be zero,

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:18.040
and over here, it's one times one,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.327
so that's one, and then, one times zero,

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.577
so again we're adding zero.

00:04:23.608 --> 00:04:25.320
The only terms that actually matter

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.840
because of the zero down here,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.408
was everything in that first column.

00:04:29.408 --> 00:04:32.926
Similarly, if we take that same matrix,

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:35.176
two one negative three one,

00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:39.545
and we multiply it by zero one over here,

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:41.795
by the second basis vector,

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:46.151
what you're going to get,

00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:48.917
is two times zero, so zero,

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:51.588
plus that element in that second column,

00:04:51.588 --> 00:04:53.964
and then, one times zero, so another zero,

00:04:53.964 --> 00:04:57.561
plus one times one, plus that one.

00:04:57.561 --> 00:04:59.561
Again, it's kind of like
that zero knocks out

00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:02.394
all of the terms in other columns.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.524
Then, like I said, geometrically,

00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:07.308
the meaning of a linear transformation

00:05:07.308 --> 00:05:10.380
is that grid lines remain
parallel and evenly spaced.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.932
When you start to think
about it a little bit,

00:05:11.932 --> 00:05:14.237
if you can know where
the screen vector lands

00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:15.947
and where the spread vector lands,

00:05:15.947 --> 00:05:17.659
that's going to lock into place

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.332
where the entire grid has to go.

00:05:20.332 --> 00:05:22.350
Let me show you what I mean
and how this corresponds with,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.116
maybe, a different
definition that you've heard

00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:27.099
for what linear transformation means.

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.309
If we have some kind of function L,

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:31.500
and it's going to take in a
vector and spit out a vector,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.985
it's said to be linear if
it satisfies the property

00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:38.796
that when you take a
constant times a vector,

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:42.379
what it produces is
that same constant times

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.320
whatever would have
happened if you applied

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.651
that transformation to the
vector, not scaled, right,

00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:49.244
so here you're applying
that transformation

00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:50.684
to a scaled vector,

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:51.652
and evidently, that's the same

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:54.308
as scaling the
transformation of the vector.

00:05:54.308 --> 00:05:57.412
Similarly, second property of linearity

00:05:57.412 --> 00:06:00.003
is that if you add two vectors,

00:06:00.003 --> 00:06:01.964
it doesn't really matter if you add them

00:06:01.964 --> 00:06:04.740
before or after the transformation.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.740
If you take the sum of the vectors

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.404
then apply the transformation,

00:06:08.404 --> 00:06:10.619
that's the same as first
applying the transformation

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.319
to each one separately,

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.902
and then adding up the results.

00:06:18.383 --> 00:06:20.319
One of the most important consequences

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.639
of this formal definition of linearity,

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.712
is that it means if you take your function

00:06:25.712 --> 00:06:28.629
and apply it to some vector x y,

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.564
I can split up that vector

00:06:35.564 --> 00:06:38.693
as x times the first basis vector,

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:40.026
x times one zero

00:06:42.762 --> 00:06:43.595
plus y,

00:06:46.303 --> 00:06:49.970
let's see y, times that
second basis vector,

00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:51.644
zero one,

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.893
and because of these two
properties of linearity,

00:07:00.893 --> 00:07:02.140
if I can split it up like this,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.172
it doesn't matter if I
do the scaling and adding

00:07:04.172 --> 00:07:05.748
before the transformation,

00:07:05.748 --> 00:07:07.452
or if I do that scaling and adding

00:07:07.452 --> 00:07:08.996
after the transformation,

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:13.176
and say that it's x times
whatever the transformed version

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:14.426
of one zero is,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.904
and I'll show you
geometrically what this means

00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:20.288
in just a moment, but
I kind of want to get

00:07:20.288 --> 00:07:22.839
all the algebra on the screen,

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:25.839
plus y times the transformed version

00:07:28.471 --> 00:07:30.263
of zero one,

00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:31.096
zero one.

00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:34.870
To be concrete, let's actually put in

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.591
a value for x and y here,

00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:40.196
and try to think about that
specific vector geometrically.

00:07:40.196 --> 00:07:44.898
Maybe I'll put in something
like vector two one.

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:46.170
If we look over on the grid,

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.170
we're going to be focusing
on the point that's over here

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.011
at two one, and this particular point.

00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:52.563
I'm going to play the transformation,

00:07:52.563 --> 00:07:55.635
and I want you to follow this
point to see where it lands,

00:07:55.635 --> 00:07:58.552
and it's going to end up over here.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.458
Okay, so, in terms of the old grid, right,

00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:03.778
the original one that we started with,

00:08:03.778 --> 00:08:05.914
it's now at the point one three.

00:08:05.914 --> 00:08:07.594
This is where we've ended up,

00:08:07.594 --> 00:08:09.949
but importantly, I want you
to notice how it's still

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:14.389
two times that green vector
plus one times that red vector.

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:16.221
It's satisfying that
property that it's still

00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:18.437
x times whatever the transformed version

00:08:18.437 --> 00:08:20.310
of that first basis vector is,

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.525
plus y times the transformed version

00:08:22.525 --> 00:08:24.858
of that second basis vector.

00:08:25.996 --> 00:08:27.458
That's all just a little overview,

00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:28.403
and the upshot,

00:08:28.403 --> 00:08:30.354
the main thing I want you
to remember from all of this

00:08:30.354 --> 00:08:32.842
is when you have some kind of matrix,

00:08:32.842 --> 00:08:35.154
you can think of it as a
transformation of space

00:08:35.154 --> 00:08:37.474
that keeps grid lines
parallel and evenly spaced.

00:08:37.474 --> 00:08:39.498
That's a very special
kind of transformation.

00:08:39.498 --> 00:08:42.081
That is a very restrictive
property to have

00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:45.784
on a function from 2-D
points to other 2-D points.

00:08:45.784 --> 00:08:47.816
The convenient way to encode that,

00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:50.744
is that the landing spot
for that first basis vector,

00:08:50.744 --> 00:08:52.777
the one that started off
one unit to the right,

00:08:52.777 --> 00:08:55.457
is represented with the
first column of the matrix,

00:08:55.457 --> 00:08:57.848
and the landing spot for
the second basis vector,

00:08:57.848 --> 00:08:59.960
the one that was pointing one unit up,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.877
is encoded with that second column.

00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:05.681
If this feels totally unfamiliar,

00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:06.961
or you want to learn more about this,

00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:09.801
it's something that I've made
other videos on in the past,

00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:12.065
but in terms of understanding
the Jacobian matrix,

00:09:12.065 --> 00:09:13.147
where we're going with this,

00:09:13.147 --> 00:09:15.225
and kind of getting a
geometric feel for it,

00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:16.554
that short overview that I gave

00:09:16.554 --> 00:09:19.457
should be enough to get us going.

00:09:19.457 --> 00:09:21.129
With that, I will see you next video.
