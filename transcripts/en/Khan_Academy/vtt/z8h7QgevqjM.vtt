00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.530
Let's systematically name some
carboxylic acids, so let's add

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:10.170
a molecule that looked
like this.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.070
Clearly a carboxylic acid,
we have a carboxyl

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.100
group right over here.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.590
Now to name it systematically,
we do it just the way we've

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.030
named our simple alkenes.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.330
When we first learned how to
name any organic molecule, you

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.890
look for the longest
carbon chain.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.430
And the longest carbon chain
is one, two, three, four

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.960
carbons, so our prefix will
be but-, so it's butan.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.350
Instead of calling it butane,
instead of writing this e

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.480
here, we know this is a
carboxylic acid, it has this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.760
carboxyl group, so
we butanoic acid.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.260
And you might wonder, don't we
have to specify where the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.220
carboxyl group is?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.710
And if you look at how
carboxylic acids are arranged,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.870
you can tell that the carboxyl
group is always going to be at

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.080
one end of a carbon chain, so
you don't have to specify.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.110
In fact, you always want to
start numbering at wherever

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.570
the carboxyl carbon is.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.200
So if you have to number these,
this would be the one

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.050
carbon, the two, the three,
and the four.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.770
So you don't have to specify a
number for the carboxyl group.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.170
Let's do another one.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.830
Let's say we had something
that looked like this.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.190
Let me put another carbon on
there, just like that, and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.840
let's say that there's
a methyl group.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.010
Now clearly, a carboxylic
acid, but to name it

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.100
systematically we just want to
find the longest carbon chain.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.560
So we have one, two, three,
four, five, six carbons, so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.250
our prefix will be hex-,
so it's hexan.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.660
It's clearly not just a hexane,
it's a hexanoic acid,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.020
it has this carboxyl
group right here.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.560
This is hexanoic acid.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.490
And we're not done, because we
still have this methyl carbon

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.440
right over here, and it is on
the-- we always want to start

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.340
numbering at this
carbonyl carbon.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.750
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.930
It is at the number three
carbon, so this is 3 methyl

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.670
hexanoic acid.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.900
Let's do one more.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.540
Let's say we had a molecule
that looked like this.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.650
That's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.270
Then we have our carboxyl group
just like that, and

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.870
let's say that we had a double
bond right over there.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.170
What would we call this?

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.780
Well, once again, look for
the longest carbon chain.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.290
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons, so

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.060
the prefix is hept-,
so it's heptan.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.610
And actually let me be careful,
this isn't an alcane.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.440
This has a double
bond right here.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.050
So it's hepten.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.140
If this was just an alkene, we
would just called heptene, but

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.660
we're not going to put this last
e here, because this is

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.660
the carboxylic acid.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.290
And to specify where that double
bond is, we need to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.200
start numbering, and we
start numbering at

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.210
the carbonyl carbon.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.000
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.070
So you could either name this
3 hepten, and I haven't

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.550
finished it yet, I haven't put
this final e over here.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.150
Or you could name it hept
3 ene, just like that.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.480
This is the more typical one
that you would see, because it

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.920
tells you we have a double bond,
and it starts at the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.030
number three carbon, goes from
the three to the four carbon.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.920
But this isn't just a regular
alkene, this is

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.180
a carboxylic acid.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.540
So instead of writing that final
e, for an alkene, we

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.990
write it as we have a carboxyl
group right here, so this is 3

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.520
heptenoic acid.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.210
And we are done.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.490
Actually if you wanted to get
really fancy on this one right

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.940
over here, you could see that
these two carbons that are on

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.850
the double bond, so this carbon
and this carbon, it's

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.302
kind of a range like this.

00:04:22.302 --> 00:04:24.390
Let me draw it like this.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.320
They both have other hydrogens
off there that we didn't draw,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.450
they're implicitly there.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.270
But if you wanted to rewrite or
redraw this molecule, you

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.220
could draw it like this.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.080
You have two carbons,
just like this.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.670
This one has a hydrogen popping
up like that; that one

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.760
has a hydrogen popping
down like that.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.370
And then this carbon over
here has this big

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.280
functional group over here.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.410
We'll call that R.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.990
And then this one over here--
I'll do it in green-- has this

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.570
other functional group, has
these three carbons.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.980
We can call that R prime.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.530
And if you look at it this way,
the functional groups are

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.360
on opposite sides of
the double bond.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.680
They're away from each other.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:12.500
So if you wanted to, you could
also call this trans 3

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.860
heptenoic acid.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.660
And this will specify
that these guys

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.610
are on opposite ends.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.510
But this is only if you're
assuming that I drew it in the

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.780
actual three dimensional
configuration in some way.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.140
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
