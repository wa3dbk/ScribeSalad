00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.720
Let's say I've got some subspace
of Rn called V.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.370
So V is a subspace of Rn.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.920
And let's say that
I know its basis.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.732
Let's say the set.

00:00:14.732 --> 00:00:17.410
So I have a bunch of-- let me
make that bracket a little

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.970
nicer-- so let's say the set of
the vectors v1, v2, all the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.180
way to vk, let's say that this
is equal to-- this is the

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.630
basis for V.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.880
And just as a reminder, that
means that V's vectors both

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.360
span V and they're linearly
independent.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.080
You can kind of see there's a
minimum set of vectors in Rn

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.420
that span V.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.660
So, if I were to ask you what
the dimension of V is, that's

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.490
just the number of vectors
you have in your

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.900
basis for the subspace.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.180
So we have 1, 2 and we
count to k vectors.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.290
So it is equal to k.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.140
Now let's think about, if we
can somehow figure out what

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.000
the dimension of the orthogonal

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.070
complement of V can be.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.330
And to do that, let's
construct a matrix.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.980
Let's construct a matrix
whose column vectors

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.690
are these basis vectors.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.115
So let's construct a matrix
A, and let's say

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:18.790
it looks like this.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.090
First column is v1.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.370
This first basis vector
right there.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.390
v2 is the second one, and then
you go all the way to vk.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.360
Just to make sure we remember
the dimensions, we have k of

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.790
these vectors, so we're going
to have k columns.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.580
And then how many rows
are we going to have?

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.710
Well, as a member of Rn, so
these are all going to have n

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.560
entries in each of these
vectors, there's going to be

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.600
an n-- we're going to have
n rows and k columns.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.740
It's an n by k matrix.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.780
Now, what's another way of
expressing the subspace V?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.570
Well, the basis for V is-- or
V is spanned by these basis

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.770
vectors, which is the
columns of these.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.360
So if I talk about the span--
so let me write out this-- V

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.030
is equal to the span of
these guys, v1, v2,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.970
all the way to vk.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.380
And that's just the same thing
as the column space of A.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.620
Right?

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.520
These are the column vectors,
and the span of them, that's

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.190
equal to the column
space of A.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.030
Now, I said a little while ago,
we want to somehow relate

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.220
to the orthogonal
complement of V.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.590
Well, what's the orthogonal
complement of the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.690
column space of A?

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.230
The orthogonal complement of
the column space of A, I

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.130
showed you-- I think it was two
or three videos ago-- that

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.420
the column space of A's
orthogonal complement is equal

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.690
to-- you could either view
it as the null space of A

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.650
transpose, or another way
you call it is the left

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.070
null space of A.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.870
This is equivalent to the
orthogonal complement of the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.760
column space of A, which is
also going to be equal to,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.700
which is also since this piece
right here is the same thing

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.560
as V, you take it's orthogonal
complement, that's the same

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.240
thing as V's orthogonal
complement.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.340
So if we want to figure out
there orthogonal complement

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.590
of-- if we want to figure out
the dimension-- if we want to

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.370
figure out the dimensional of
the orthogonal complement of

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.230
V, we just need to figure out
the dimension of the left null

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.210
space of A, or the null space
of A's transpose.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.555
Let me write that down.

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:38.030
So the dimension-- get you
tongue-tied sometimes-- the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.280
dimension of the orthogonal
complement of V is going to be

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.600
equal do the dimension
of A transpose.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.160
Or another way to think of it
is-- sorry, not just the

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.350
dimension of A transpose, the
dimension of the null space of

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.600
A transpose.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.620
And if you have a good memory,
I don't use the word a lot,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.160
this thing is the nullity--
this is the

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.700
nullity of A transpose.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.640
The dimension of your null
space is nullity, the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.079
dimension of your column
space is your rank.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.610
Now let's see what
we can do here.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.079
So let's just take A transpose,
so you can just

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.230
imagine A transpose
for a second.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.140
I can just even draw it out.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:33.890
It's going to be a k by n matrix
that looks like this.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.760
These columns are going
to turn into rows.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.240
This is going to be v1
transpose, v2 transpose, all

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.270
the way down to vk transpose
vectors.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.640
These are all now row vectors.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.820
So we know one thing.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.120
We know one relationship between
the rank and nullity

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.470
of any matrix.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.720
We know that they're equal to
the number of columns we have.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:10.910
We know that the rank of A
transpose plus the nullity of

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.520
A transpose is equal
to the number of

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.280
columns of A transpose.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.460
We have n columns.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.635
Each of these have n entries.

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:19.120
It is equal to n.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.800
We saw this a while ago.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.970
And if you want just a bit of a
reminder of where that comes

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.060
from, when you take a-- if I
wrote A transpose as a bunch

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.480
of column vectors, which I can,
or maybe let me take some

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.060
other vector B, because I want
to just remind you where this,

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.480
why this made sense.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.290
If I take some vector B here,
and it has got a bunch of

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.840
column vectors, b1, b2, all the
way to bn, and I put it

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.090
into reduced row echelon form,
you're going to have some

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.730
pivot columns and some
non-pivot columns.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.100
So let's say this is
a pivot column.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.490
You know, I got a 1 and a bunch
of 0's, let's say that

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.510
this is one of them, and then
let's say I got one other one

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.400
that's out, and it would be a 0
there, it's a 1 down there,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.610
and everything else is
a non-pivot column.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.580
I showed you in the last video
that your basis for your

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.350
column space is the number of
pivot columns you have. So

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.300
these guys are pivot columns.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.400
The corresponding column vectors
form a basis for your

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.310
column space.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.290
I showed you that in
the last video.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.550
And so, if you want to know the
dimension of your column

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.190
space, you just have to
count these things.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.440
You just count these things.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.490
This was equal to the number of,
well, for this B's case,

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.080
the rank of B is just equal to
the number of pivot columns I

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.230
have. Now the nullity is the
dimension of your null space.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.830
We've done multiple problems
where we found the null space

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.850
of matrices.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.840
And every time, the dimension,
it's a bit obvious, and I

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.760
actually showed you this proof,
it's related to the

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.990
number of free columns you have,
or non-pivot columns.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.040
So, if you have no pivot
columns, then you are -- if

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.370
all of your columns are pivot
columns, and none of them have

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.170
free variables or are
associated with free

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.740
variables, then you're null
space is going to be trivial.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.540
It's just going to have
the 0 vector.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.240
But the more free variables
you have, the more

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.800
dimensionality your
null space has.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.810
So the free columns correspond
to the null space, and they

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.100
form actually a basis
for your null space.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.420
And because of that, the basis
for your null space vectors,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.520
plus the basis for your column
space, is equal to the total

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.040
number of columns you have. I
showed that to you in the

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.410
past, but it's always good
to remind ourselves

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.760
where things come from.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.100
But this was just
a bit of a side.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.260
I did this with a separate
vector B.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.220
Just to remind ourselves
where this thing

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.820
right here came from.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.750
Now, in the last video, I showed
you that the rank of A

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.040
transpose is the same thing
is the rank of A.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.540
This is equal to, this part
right here, is the same thing

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.790
as the rank of A.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.990
I showed you that in
the last video.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.510
When you transpose a matrix, it
doesn't change its rank, or

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.090
it doesn't change the dimension
of its column space.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.350
So we can rewrite this
statement, right here, as the

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:07.130
rank of A plus the nullity of A
transpose is equal to n, and

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.840
the rank of A is the same thing
as the dimension of the

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.470
column space of A.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.290
And then the nullity of A
transpose is the same thing as

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:21.580
the dimension of the null space
of A transpose-- that's

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.100
just the definition of nullity--
they're going to be

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.310
equal to n.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.700
Now what's the dimension--
what's the column space of A?

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.620
The column space of A, that's
what's spanned by these

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.429
vectors right here, which
were the basis for V.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:37.464
So this is the same thing
as the dimension of V.

00:08:37.464 --> 00:08:40.179
The column space of A is the
same thing as the dimension of

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.270
my subspace V that I started
this video with.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.460
And what is the null space
of A transpose?

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.880
The null space of A transpose,
we saw already, that's the

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.160
orthogonal complement of V.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.670
So I could write this as plus
the dimension of the

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.050
orthogonal complement
of V is equal to n.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.770
And that's the result
we wanted.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:17.670
If V is a subspace of Rn, that n
is the same thing as that n,

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.890
then the dimension of V plus
the dimension of the

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:26.490
orthogonal complement of V is
going to be equal to n.
