00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:10.409
Imagine two people who share an important secret

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:11.977
have to split up.

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.411
This requires them to communicate

00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:19.053
private information from a distance.

00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:21.240
However, an eavesdropper named Eve

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.653
also wants this information,

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:25.856
and has the ability to intercept their messages.

00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:27.718
So, Alice decides to communicate

00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:31.636
using letters written in some kind of secret code.

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:33.954
The following analogy is helpful.

00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:36.421
First, Alice locks her message in a box,

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:38.026
using a lock that only she and Bob

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:39.951
know the combination to.

00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:42.669
This is known as 'encryption.'

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:45.768
Then, the locked message is sent to Bob.

00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:47.982
When Bob receives the box, he opens it

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:51.221
using the code they shared in advance.

00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:54.792
This is called 'decryption.'

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:57.866
Cryptography begins when we abandon physical locks

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.183
and use 'ciphers' instead.

00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:02.862
Think of [ciphers] as virtual locks.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.837
Ciphers allow Alice and Bob to scramble

00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:06.534
and descramble their messages

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:08.222
so that they would appear meaningless

00:01:08.222 --> 00:01:11.289
if Eve intercepted them.

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.956
Cryptography has been around for thousands of years.

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:15.977
It has decided wars, and is at the heart of

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:18.917
the worldwide communication network today.

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:20.817
The fascinating story of cryptography

00:01:20.817 --> 00:01:23.824
requires us to understand two very old ideas

00:01:23.824 --> 00:01:28.134
related to number theory and probability theory.
