00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.290
Welcome back.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.580
I'm just trying to show you as
many examples as possible of

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.560
solving exact differential
equations.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.210
One, trying to figure
out whether the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.350
equations are exact.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.650
And then if you know they're
exact, how do you figure out

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.470
the psi and figure out
the solution of the

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.650
differential equation?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:27.820
So the next one in my book is
3x squared minus 2xy plus 2

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:40.400
times dx, plus 6y squared minus
x squared plus 3 times

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.060
dy is equal to 0.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.040
So just the way it was
written, this isn't

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.330
superficially in that form
that we want, right?

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.370
What's the form that we want?

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.120
We want some function of x and
y plus another function of x

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.530
and y, times y prime, or
dy dx, is equal to 0.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.570
We're close.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.410
How could we get this equation
into this form?

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.580
We just divide both sides of
this equation by dx, right?

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.110
And then we get 3x squared
minus 2xy plus 2.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.530
We're dividing by dx, so that
dx just becomes a 1.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.830
Plus 6y squared minus
x squared plus 3.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.360
And then we're dividing by dx,
so that becomes dy dx, is

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.190
equal to-- what's
0 divided by dx?

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.430
Well it's just 0.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.200
And there we have it.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.800
We have written this
in the form that we

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.580
need, in this form.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.260
And now we need to prove to
ourselves that this is an

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.390
exact equation.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.670
So let's do that.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.660
So what's the partial of M?

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.180
This is the M function, right?

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.380
This was a plus here.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.980
What's the partial of this
with respect to y?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.450
This would be 0.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.980
This would be minus 2x,
and then just a 2.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.070
So the partial of this with
respect to y is minus 2x.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.490
What's the partial of
N with respect to x?

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.550
This would be 0, this
would be minus 2x.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.470
So there you have it.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.620
The partial of M with respect
to y is equal to the partial

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.170
of N with respect to x.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.870
My is equal to Nx.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.650
So we are dealing with
an exact equation.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.020
So now we have to find psi.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.360
The partial of psi with respect
to x is equal to M,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.840
which is equal to 3x squared
minus 2xy plus 2.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.890
Take the anti-derivative with
respect to x on both sides,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.510
and you get psi is equal to x
to the third minus x squared

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.740
y-- because y is just a
constant-- plus 2x, plus some

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.270
function of y.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.530
Right?

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.620
Because we know psi is a
function of x and y.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.220
So when you take a derivative,
when you take a partial with

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.920
respect to just x, a pure
function of just y would get

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.510
lost. So it's like the constant,
when we first

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.620
learned taking anti-derivatives.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.880
And now, to figure out psi, we
just have to solve for h of y.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.340
And how do we do that?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.110
Well let's take the partial
of psi with respect to y.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.140
That's going to be equal
to this right here.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.520
So The partial of psi with
respect to y, this is 0, this

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.815
is minus x squared.

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:33.210
So it's minus x squared-- this
is o-- plus h prime of y, is

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.290
going to be able to what?

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.520
That's going to be equal
to our n of x, y.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.970
It's going to be able to this.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.080
And then we can solve
for this.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.580
So that's going to be equal
to 6y squared minus x

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.096
squared plus 3.

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:47.610
You can add x squared
to both sides to get

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.760
rid of this and this.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.290
And then we're left with h
prime of y is equal to 6y

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.650
squared plus 3.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.850
Anti-derivative-- so h of y is
equal to what is this-- 2y

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.260
cubed plus 3y.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.920
And you could put a plus c
there, but the plus c merges

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.080
later on when we solve the
differential equation, so you

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.040
don't have to worry
about it too much.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.459
So what is our function psi?

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.920
I'll write it in a new color.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:30.240
Our function psi as a function
of x and y is equal to x to

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:38.150
the third minus x squared
y plus 2x.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.800
Plus h of y, which we
just solved for.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.030
So h of y is plus 2y to
the third plus 3y.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.870
And then they're could be a plus
c there, but you'll see

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.890
that it doesn't matter much.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.390
Actually I want to do something

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.690
a little bit different.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.780
I'm not just going to chug
through the problem.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.740
I want to kind of go back
to the intuition.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.120
Because I don't want this to
be completely mechanical.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.310
Let me just show you what the
derivative-- using what we

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.810
knew before you even learned
anything about the partial

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.090
derivative chain rule-- what is
the derivative of psi with

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.340
respect to x.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.770
What is the derivative of
psi with respect to x?

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.760
Here we just use our implicit
differentiation skills.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.520
So the derivative of this-- I'll
do it in a new color-- 3x

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.810
squared minus-- now we're going
to have to use the chain

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.190
rule here-- so the derivative
of the first expression with

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.570
respect to x is-- well, let me
just put the minus sign and I

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:44.510
could put like that-- so it's
2x times y plus the first

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.080
function, x squared times the
derivative of the second

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.260
function with respect to x.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.710
Well that's just
y prime, right?

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.430
It's the derivative of y with
respect to y is 1, times the

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.890
derivative of y with respect to
x, which is just y prime.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.740
Fair enough.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.940
Plus the derivative of this with
respect to x is easy, 2.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.020
Plus the derivative of this
with respect to x.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.710
Well let's take the derivative
of this with respect to y

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.580
first. We're just doing implicit
differentiation of

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.770
the chain rule.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:18.480
So this is plus 6y squared.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.320
And then we're using the chain
rule, so we took the

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.390
derivative with respect to y.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.500
And then you have to multiply
that times the derivative of y

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.450
with respect x, which
is just y prime.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.280
Plus the derivative of this
with respect to why is 3

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.350
times-- we're just doing the
chain rule-- the derivative of

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.410
y with respect to x.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.550
So that's y prime.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.700
Let's try to see if we
can simplify this.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:51.550
So we get this is equal to 3x
squared minus 2xy plus 2.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.320
So that's this term, this
term, and this term.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:04.700
Plus-- let's just put the y
prime outside-- y prime

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.240
times-- let's see, you have a
negative sign out here-- minus

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:18.730
x squared plus 6y
squared plus 3.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.780
So this is the derivative of
our psi as we solved it.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.670
Look at this closely and notice
that that is the same--

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.170
hopefully it's the same--
as our original problem.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.630
What was our original problem
that we started working with?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:45.440
The original problem was 3x
squared minus 2xy plus 2, plus

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.010
6y squared minus x square
plus 3, times y

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.070
prime, is equal to 0.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.650
So this was our original
problem.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.170
And notice that the derivative
of psi with respect to x just

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.020
using implicit differentiation
is exactly this.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.970
So hopefully this gives you a
little intuition of why we can

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:11.980
just rewrite this equation as
the derivative with respect x

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.720
of psi, which is a function
of x and y, is equal to 0.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.120
Because this is the derivative
of psi with respect to x.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.870
I wrote out here.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.830
It's the same thing-- this
right here-- right?

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.710
So that equals 0.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.310
So if we take the
anti-derivative of both sides,

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.620
we know that the solution of
this differential equation is

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.909
that psi of x and y is equal
to c as the solution.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.780
And we know what psi is, so we
just set that equal to c, and

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.470
we have the implicit-- we have a
solution to the differential

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.490
equation, I'll just
define implicitly.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.890
So the solution-- you don't have
to do this every time.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:50.010
This step right here you
wouldn't have to do if you're

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.190
taking a test, unless
the teacher

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.440
explicitly asked for it.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.170
I just wanted kind of make sure
that you know what you're

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.420
doing, that you're not just
doing things completely

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.000
mechanically.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.280
That you really see that the
derivative of psi really does

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.560
give you-- we solved for psi.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.490
And I just wanted to show you
that the derivative of psi

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.980
with respect to x, just using
implicit differentiation and

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.700
our standard chain rule,
actually gives you the left

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.450
hand side of the differential
equation, which was our

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.640
version of problem.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.600
And then that's how we know that
that the derivative of

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.730
psi with respect x is equal
to 0, because our original

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.390
differential equation
was equal to 0.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.950
You take the anti-derivative of
both sides of this, you get

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.510
psi is equal to C, is
the solution of the

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.210
differential equation.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.190
Or if you wanted to write it
out, psi is this thing.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.215
Our solution to the differential
equation is x to

00:09:36.215 --> 00:09:42.530
the third, minus x squared y,
plus 2x, plus 2y to the third,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:51.060
plus 3y, is equal to c, is the
implicitly defined solution of

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.940
our original differential
equation.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.050
Anyway I've run out
of time again.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.440
I will see you in
the next video.
