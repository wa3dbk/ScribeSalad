00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:10.800
Rewrite the equation 6x^2 + 3 = 2x - 6 in standard form and identify a, b, and c.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.585
So standard form for a quadratic equation is ax squared plus bx plus c is equal to zero.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:23.333
So essentially you wanna get all of the terms on the left-hand side,

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:29.585
and then we want to write them so that we have the x terms...where their exponents are in decreasing order.

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:33.502
So we have the x squared term and then the x term and then we have the constant term.

00:00:33.502 --> 00:00:35.477
So let's try to do this over here.

00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:37.677
So let me rewrite our original equation.

00:00:37.677 --> 00:00:43.190
We have 6x squared plus 3 is equal to 2x minus 6.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.692
So essentially we wanna get everything on the left-hand side.

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:51.333
so I could subtract 2x from both sides, so I could subtract 2x from both sides,

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.815
so let me just...I'll take one step at a time.

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:56.462
So I can subtract 2x from both sides.

00:00:56.462 --> 00:01:01.015
And then I'll get...and I'm gonna write it in descending order for the exponents on x.

00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:04.302
So the highest exponent is x squared. So I'll write that first.

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:10.671
6x squared, and then we have minus 2x, and then we have plus 3 is equal to...

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:14.492
the 2 'x's on the right cancel out...equal to negative 6.

00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:20.000
And now, to get rid of this negative 6 on the right-hand side, we can add 6 to both sides.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.318
So let's add 6 to both sides...

00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:32.431
...and then this simplifies to 6x squared, minus 2x, plus nine is equal to...zero.

00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:35.877
So let's make sure we're already in standard form.

00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:40.775
All of our terms, our non-zero terms are on the left-hand side, we've done that.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:43.010
We have a zero on the right-hand side, we've done that.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.559
And, we have the x squared term first, then the x to the first power term, then the constant term.

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:51.323
x squared, then x to the first, then the constant term.

00:01:51.323 --> 00:01:53.575
So we are in standard form.

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:58.252
And so we can say that a is equal to 6, a is equal to 6.

00:01:58.252 --> 00:02:04.031
We could say that b is equal to, and this is key, it's not just the 2, it's the negative 2.

00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:10.087
B is equal to negative 2, 'cause notice this says plus bx, but over here we have minus 2x.

00:02:10.087 --> 00:02:14.600
So the b is a negative 2 here. B is negative 2.

00:02:14.600 --> 99:59:59.999
And then c, c is going to be, c is going to be 9.
