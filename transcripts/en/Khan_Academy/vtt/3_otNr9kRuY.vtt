00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.820
Find the probability
of flipping exactly

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.900
two heads on 3 coins.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.340
So to figure out this
probability, a good place to

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.430
start is just to think about all
of the different possible

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.180
ways that we can flip 3 coins.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.370
So we could get all tails.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.770
Tails, tails, tails.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.020
We could get tails,
tails, heads.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.280
We could get tails,
heads, tails.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.760
We could get tails,
heads, heads.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.340
We could get heads,
tails, tails.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.960
We could get heads,
tails, heads.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.900
We could get heads,
heads, tails.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.730
And then we could
get all heads.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.850
We could get all heads
over here.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.380
So there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8 possible outcomes.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.000
8 possible outcomes.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.960
Now how many of the
outcomes involve

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.180
flipping exactly 2 heads?

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.260
Let's see, that's all tails.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.300
That's 1 head, 1 head.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.920
This has 2 heads right there.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.670
That's 1 head.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.210
This is 2 heads right
over there.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.840
Then this is 2 heads
right over here.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.270
And then this is 3 heads,
so that doesn't count.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:30.010
So there are 3 outcomes
with exactly 2 heads.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.490
So, let me spell
heads properly.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.730
2 heads.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:44.690
So the probability of flipping
exactly 2 heads-- And the word

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.410
exactly is important, because
if you didn't say exactly,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.895
then maybe 3 heads, when you
flip 2 heads, so we have to

00:01:49.895 --> 00:01:50.920
say exactly 2 heads.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.090
So you don't include
the situation

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.220
where you get 3 heads.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.330
So the probability of flipping
exactly 2 heads is equal to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.700
the 3 outcomes with 2 heads
divided by the 8 possible

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.670
outcomes, or 3/8.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.340
So it is equal to 3/8.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.470
And we are done.
