00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.730
I now want to solve some
inequalities that also have

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.550
absolute values in them.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.900
And if there's any topic in
algebra that probably confuses

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.260
people the most, it's this.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.890
But if we kind of keep our head
on straight about what

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.620
absolute value really means, I
think you will find that it's

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.650
not that bad.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.810
So let's start with a nice,
fairly simple warm-up problem.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.370
Let's start with the absolute
value of x is less than 12.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.740
So remember what I told
you about the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.420
meaning of absolute value.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.890
It means how far away
you are from 0.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.390
So one way to say this is, what
are all of the x's that

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.120
are less than 12 away from 0?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.370
Let's draw a number line.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.120
So if we have 0 here, and we
want all the numbers that are

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.100
less than 12 away from 0, well,
you could go all the way

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.570
to positive 12, and you could go
all the way to negative 12.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.820
Anything that's in between these
two numbers is going to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.360
have an absolute value
of less than 12.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.550
It's going to be less
than 12 away from 0.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.020
So this, you could say, this
could be all of the numbers

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.310
where x is greater
than negative 12.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.220
Those are definitely going to
have an absolute value less

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.050
than 12, as long as they're
also-- and, x has to

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.520
be less than 12.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.170
So if an x meets both of these
constraints, its absolute

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.890
value is definitely going
to be less than 12.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.050
You know, you take the absolute
value of negative 6,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.860
that's only 6 away from 0.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.670
The absolute value of negative
11, only 11 away from 0.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.520
So something that meets both
of these constraints will

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.630
satisfy the equation.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.440
And actually, we've solved it,
because this is only a

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.810
one-step equation there.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.670
But I think it lays a good
foundation for the next few

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.030
problems. And I could actually
write it like this.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.280
In interval notation, it would
be everything between negative

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.880
12 and positive 12, and not
including those numbers.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.690
Or we could write it like this,
x is less than 12, and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.100
is greater than negative 12.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.180
That's the solution
set right there.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.420
Now let's do one that's a little
bit more complicated,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.340
that allows us to think
a little bit harder.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.480
So let's say we have the
absolute value of 7x is

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.260
greater than or equal to 21.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.710
So let's not even think about
what's inside of the absolute

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.020
value sign right now.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.180
In order for the absolute
value of anything to be

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.260
greater than or equal to
21, what does it mean?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.040
It means that whatever's inside
of this absolute value

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.640
sign, whatever that is inside of
our absolute value sign, it

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.840
must be 21 or more
away from 0.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.910
Let's draw our number line.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.010
And you really should visualize
a number line when

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.970
you do this, and you'll never
get confused then.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.660
You shouldn't be memorizing
any rules.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.860
So let's draw 0 here.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.980
Let's do positive 21, and let's
do a negative 21 here.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.470
So we want all of the numbers,
so whatever this thing is,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.400
that are greater than
or equal to 21.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.860
They're more than
21 away from 0.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.920
Their absolute value
is more than 21.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.000
Well, all of these negative
numbers that are less than

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.090
negative 21, when you take their
absolute value, when you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.750
get rid of the negative sign,
or when you find their

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.160
distance from 0, they're all
going to be greater than 21.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.110
If you take the absolute value
of negative 30, it's going to

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.900
be greater than 21.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.070
Likewise, up here, anything
greater than positive 21 will

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.440
also have an absolute value
greater than 21.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.160
So what we could say is 7x needs
to be equal to one of

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.530
these numbers, or 7x needs to
be equal to one of these

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.930
numbers out here.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.230
So we could write 7x needs to
be one of these numbers.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.580
Well, what are these numbers?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.810
These are all of the numbers
that are less than or equal to

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:20.070
negative 21, or 7x-- let me do a
different color here-- or 7x

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.160
has to be one of
these numbers.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.290
And that means that 7x has to
be greater than or equal to

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.070
positive 21.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.870
I really want you to
kind of internalize

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.460
what's going on here.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.590
If our absolute value is greater
than or equal to 21,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.480
that means that what's inside
the absolute value has to be

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.370
either just straight up greater
than the positive 21,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.070
or less than negative 21.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.170
Because if it's less than
negative 21, when you take its

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.110
absolute value, it's going to
be more than 21 away from 0.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.090
Hopefully that make sense.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.120
We'll do several of these
practice problems, so it

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.190
really gets ingrained
in your brain.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.650
But once you have this set up,
and this just becomes a

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.960
compound inequality, divide both
sides of this equation by

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.130
7, you get x is less than
or equal to negative 3.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.590
Or you divide both sides of
this by 7, you get x is

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.710
greater than or equal to 3.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.520
So I want to be very clear.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.920
This, what I drew here, was
not the solution set.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.070
This is what 7x had
to be equal to.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.470
I just wanted you to visualize
what it means to have the

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.460
absolute value be greater
than 21, to be more than

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.470
21 away from 0.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.950
This is the solution set. x
has to be greater than or

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.570
equal to 3, or less than
or equal to negative 3.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.370
So the actual solution set to
this equation-- let me draw a

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.870
number line-- let's say that's
0, that's 3, that is negative

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.365
3. x has to be either greater
than or equal to 3.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.620
That's the equal sign.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.000
Or less than or equal
to negative 3.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.960
And we're done.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.500
Let's do a couple
more of these.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.520
Because they are, I think,
confusing, but if you really

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.490
start to get the gist of what
absolute value is saying, they

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.930
become, I think, intuitive.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.840
So let's say that we have
the absolute value-- let

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.570
me get a good one.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:32.310
Let's say the absolute value of
5x plus 3 is less than 7.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.780
So that's telling us that
whatever's inside of our

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.030
absolute value sign has to be
less than 7 away from 0.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.360
So the ways that we can be less
than 7 away from 0-- let

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.770
me draw a number line-- so the
ways that you can be less than

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.870
7 away from 0, you could be less
than 7, and greater than

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.740
negative 7.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.910
Right?

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.970
You have to be in this range.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.240
So in order to satisfy this
thing in this absolute value

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.590
sign, it has to be-- so the
thing in the absolute value

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.170
sign, which is 5x plus 3--
it has to be greater than

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:16.310
negative 7 and it has to be less
than 7, in order for its

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.060
absolute value to
be less than 7.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.680
If this thing, this 5x plus 3,
evaluates anywhere over here,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.810
its absolute value, its
distance from 0, will

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.420
be less than 7.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.270
And then we can just
solve these.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.810
You subtract 3 from
both sides.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.160
5x is greater than
negative 10.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.010
Divide both sides by 5. x is
greater than negative 2.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.200
Now over here, subtract
3 from both sides.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.960
5x is less than 4.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.300
Divide both sides by 5, you
get x is less than 4/5.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.560
And then we can draw
the solution set.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.270
We have to be greater than
negative 2, not greater than

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.120
or equal to, and
less than 4/5.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.230
So this might look like a
coordinate, but this is also

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.590
interval notation, if we're
saying all of the x's between

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.770
negative 2 and 4/5.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.780
Or you could write it all of the
x's that are greater than

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.140
negative 2 and less than 4/5.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.160
These are the x's that satisfy
this equation.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.810
And I really want you
to internalize this

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.110
visualization here.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:28.830
Now, you might already be seeing
a bit of a rule here.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.110
And I don't want you to just
memorize it, but I'll give it

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.590
to you just in case
you want it.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.809
If you have something like f of
x, the absolute value of f

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:41.409
of x is less than, let's
say, some number a.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:41.730
Right?

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.600
So this was the situation.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.810
We have some f of
x less than a.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.080
That means that the absolute
value of f of x, or f of x has

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.600
to be less than a away from 0.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.960
So that means that f of x has to
be less than positive a or

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.730
greater than negative a.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:05.090
That translates to that, which
translates to f of x greater

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:10.460
than negative a and f
of x less than a.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.280
But it comes from
the same logic.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.540
This has to evaluate to
something that is less than a

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.380
away from 0.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.280
Now, if we go to the other side,
if you have something of

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.810
the form f of x is
greater than a.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.660
That means that this thing has
to evaluate to something that

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.730
is further than a away from 0.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.330
So that means that f of x is
either just straight up

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:40.720
greater than positive a, or f of
x is less than negative a.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:40.880
Right?

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.380
If it's less than negative a,
maybe it's negative a minus

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:50.980
another 1, or negative
5 plus negative a.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.525
Then, when you take its
absolute value, it'll

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:53.730
become a plus 5.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.490
So its absolute value is going
to be greater than a.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.300
So I just want to-- you could
memorize this if you want, but

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.760
I really want you to think about
this is just saying, OK,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.100
this has to evaluate, be less
than a away from 0, this has

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.440
to be more than a away from 0.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.310
Let's do one more, because
I know this can be

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.780
a little bit confusing.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.040
And I encourage you to watch
this video over and over and

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.490
over again, if it helps.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:23.020
Let's say we have the absolute
value of 2x-- let me do

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.040
another one over here.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.810
Let's do a harder one.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:31.460
Let's say the absolute value
of 2x over 7 plus 9 is

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.460
greater than 5/7.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:40.370
So this thing has to evaluate to
something that's more than

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.090
5/7 away from 0.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.610
So this thing, 2x over 7 plus
9, it could just be straight

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.740
up greater than 5/7.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.220
Or it could be less than
negative 5/7, because if it's

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.180
less than negative 5/7, its
absolute value is going to be

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.840
greater than 5/7.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:04.970
Or 2x over 7 plus 9 will be
less than negative 5/7.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.540
We're doing this case
right here.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.290
And then we just solve both
of these equations.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.750
See if we subtract-- let's just
multiply everything by 7,

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.290
just to get these denominators
out of the way.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.730
So if you multiply both sides by
7, you get 2x plus 9 times

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.800
7 is 63, is greater than 5.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.750
Let's do it over here, too.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:32.630
You'll get 2x plus 63 is
less than negative 5.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.010
Let's subtract 63 from both
sides of this equation, and

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.200
you get 2x-- let's see.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.470
5 minus 63 is 58, 2x
is greater than 58.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.230
If you subtract 63 from both
sides of this equation, you

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:59.040
get 2x is less than
negative 68.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.345
Oh, I just realized I
made a mistake here.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:04.090
You subtract 63 from both sides
of this, 5 minus 63 is

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.350
negative 58.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.970
I don't want to make a careless
mistake there.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.420
And then divide both
sides by 2.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.180
You get, in this case, x is
greater than-- you don't have

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.910
to swap the inequality, because
we're dividing by a

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:22.440
positive number-- negative 58
over 2 is negative 29, or,

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:29.110
here, if you divide both sides
by 2, or, x is less than

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.520
negative 34.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.180
68 divided by 2 is 34.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.160
And so, on the number line,
the solution set to that

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.880
equation will look like this.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.470
That's my number line.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.460
I have negative 29.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.890
I have negative 34.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.380
So the solution is, I can either
be greater than 29, not

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.550
greater than or equal to, so
greater than 29, that is that

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:06.470
right there, or I could be
less than negative 34.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.410
So any of those are going to
satisfy this absolute value

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:11.660
inequality.
