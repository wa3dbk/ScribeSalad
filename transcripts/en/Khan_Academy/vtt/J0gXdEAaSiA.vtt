00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.470
Let's try to come up with the
reaction of when we have this

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.120
molecule right here reacting
with sodium methoxide in a

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.595
methanol solution, or with
methanol as the solvent.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.030
Just so we get a little practice
with naming, let's

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.710
see, this is one, two,
three, four carbons.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.600
So it has but- as a prefix and
no double bond or triple

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.890
bonds, so it's butane.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.470
And we have a chloro
group here.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.990
So if we start numbering
at the side

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.630
closest to it, one, two.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.880
So it's 2-chlorobutane.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.220
Let's think about what
might happen here.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.420
The first thing-- let
me just redraw the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.430
molecule right there.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.760
The first thing you need to
realize is this sodium

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.960
methoxide is a salt.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.870
When it's not dissolved,
it's made up of a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.650
positive sodium cation.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.660
Let me draw them right here.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.580
It's a positive sodium
cation and a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.860
negative methoxide anion.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.060
Let me draw the methoxide
part right here.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.380
It normally would have just
two pairs, but now we have

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.360
three pairs here.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.276
The oxygen has an
extra electron.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.715
Actually, let me draw
another electron

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:32.450
as the extra electron.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.050
This'll be useful for
our mechanism.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.330
It could be any of them.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.930
The oxygen has an
extra electron.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.320
It has a negative charge.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.720
In solid form, when they're not
dissolved, they had formed

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.080
an ionic bond and they form
a crystal-like structure.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.470
It's a salt, but when you
dissolve it in something, in a

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.130
solution, in this case, we have
methanol as the solution,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.170
they will disassociate
from each other.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.940
And what you have right here is
this methoxide right here.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.040
This is a very, very,
very strong base.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.729
This right here is
a strong base.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.970
And if you use the Lewis
definition of a base, that

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.650
means it really, really, really
wants to give away this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.880
electron to something else.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.570
If you use the Bronsted-Lowry
definition, this means that it

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.900
really, really, really wants
to take a proton off of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.030
something else.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.160
In this situation, that is
exactly what it will do.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.440
I'll actually give you the most
likely reaction to occur

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.020
here, and we'll talk about other
reactions, and why this

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.660
is the most likely reaction
in future videos.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.310
So it wants to nab a proton.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.500
It is a strong base.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.040
It wants to give away
this electron.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.590
Let's say that it gives away
this electron to this hydrogen

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.880
right over here.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.340
Now, this hydrogen already
had an electron.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.780
If it's getting an electron from
the methoxide anion, the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.410
methoxide base, then it can give
away its electron to the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.360
rest of the molecule.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.970
It can give away this electron
to the rest of the molecule.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.010
Now, carbon won't need
the electron.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.350
Carbon doesn't want to have
a negative charge.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.920
Maybe simultaneously that
electron goes to that carbon

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.810
right over there.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.900
But once again, this carbon
doesn't want it.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.920
It already has four bonds, but
what we see is we have this

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.990
chloro here.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.160
This is a highly electronegative
group.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.540
The chlorine is very
electronegative, so the whole

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.500
time, the chlorine was already
tugging on this

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.200
electron right here.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.310
Now, all of a sudden, it's all
happening simultaneously, when

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.680
an electron becomes available
to this carbon, this carbon

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.240
doesn't need this electron
anymore.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.630
The chlorine already wanted it,
so now the chlorine can

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.700
take the electron.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.550
And just like that, in exactly
one step, let's think about

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.080
what happened.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.630
If all of these simultaneous
reactions occurred, what are

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.280
we left with?

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.170
Let me redraw my two
chlorobutanes.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.839
I'm going to have to
change it now.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:24.180
So now, the chlorine
has disappeared.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.000
So we clear it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.780
That's disappeared.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.700
The chlorine has now left.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.000
This chlorine is now up here.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.700
It has left.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.360
It had this electron right over
there, which is right

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.450
over there.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.070
The other electron it was paired
with that was forming a

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.025
bond with is now also
on the chlorine.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.710
It becomes a chloride anion.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.780
Let me draw the rest of
the valence electrons.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.210
One, two, three, four, five,
six, and it has the seventh

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.040
one right here.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.670
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, so it now

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.370
has a negative charge.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.810
This electron up here-- let me
clear this part out as well.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.590
Now, this electron right here,
this magenta electron, this is

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.560
now given to this carbon.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.030
Let me draw it here.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.000
That magenta electron is now
given to that carbon.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.170
And if we look at the other
end, the one that it was

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.780
paired with, that it was bonded
with, it still is

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.190
bonded with it, so that green
electron is now still on that

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.250
carbon and now they
are bonded.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.705
Now, they're forming
a double bond.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.190
This all of the sudden has
become an alkene and now the

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.960
methoxide took the hydrogen.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.810
Let me redraw the methoxide.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:59.670
OCH3, the oxygen had one,
two, three, four, five.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.190
It had six.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.370
Actually, it had seven valence
electrons, one with the carbon

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.470
and then all of these
six unpaired ones.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.170
Neutral oxygen has six.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.880
But now it gave one of them
away to a hydrogen.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:21.900
It gave that green electron
there to the hydrogen-- I'll

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.240
make this hydrogen the same
color-- to this hydrogen right

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.890
over here, so now
this hydrogen is

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.350
now bonded with it.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.930
So what are we left with?

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.710
We have a chloride anion,
so this is chloride.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.200
We now have methanol.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.770
This was a strong base.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.840
Now it has become its
conjugate acid.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:57.900
So now we have methanol, which
is the same as the solvent, so

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.660
it's now mixed in.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.720
And now we're left off
with one, two,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.330
three, four, still four.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:12.550
We still have four carbons,
but now it's an alkene.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.400
We have a double bond, so we
could call this but-2-ene, or

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.310
sometimes called 2-butene.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.570
Let's think about what
happened here.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.370
It all happened simultaneously.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.920
Both reactants were present.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.750
There was actually only one
step so this is the

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.300
rate-determining step.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.610
If we would try to name
it, it would probably

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.170
have a 2 in it someplace.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.360
And something got eliminated.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.660
The chloride, or I guess you
could call it the chloro

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.120
group, got eliminated.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.610
It left.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.780
It was a leaving group
in this situation.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:51.350
So this was eliminated, and this
type of reaction where

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.680
something is eliminated and
both of the reactants are

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.110
participating in the
rate-determining step, and we

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.640
only had one step here so that
was the rate-determining step,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.400
is called an E2 reaction.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.336
And once again, E stands
for elimination.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.740
And the 2 stands for that both
reactants were involved in the

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.790
rate-determining step.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.680
We had one reactant
and two reactants.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.410
They were both involved with
the rate-determining step.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.290
E2, just like Sn2.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.390
It's obviously not the same
reaction, but in Sn2, we had

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.290
substitution.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.420
The leaving group left,
nucleophile came.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.360
It was substitution using
a nucleophile so that's

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.440
the S and the n.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.309
And then the 2 was we
had both reactants.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.799
It was all happening
simultaneously.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.370
I'll leave you there.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.390
We're going to go into more
detail on the different types

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.760
of each reactions, which ones
are favored, and then we'll

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.950
talk a little bit about E1.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.820
You could maybe guess what
that's going to be based on

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.920
our experience with
Sn2 and Sn1.
