00:00:00.592 --> 00:00:01.425
- [Voiceover] Hey guys.

00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:04.209
Before talking about the
vector form for the quadratic

00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:06.917
approximation of multivariable functions,

00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:11.084
I've got to introduce this
thing called the Hessian matrix.

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:16.645
Essentially what this is,
is just a way to package

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:19.498
all the information of the
second derivatives of a function.

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:23.249
Let's say you have some kind
of multivariable function

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.965
like the example we had in the last video,

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:29.198
e to the x halves multiplied by sine of y,

00:00:29.198 --> 00:00:31.006
so some kind of of a
multivariable function.

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.101
What the Hessian matrix
is, and it's often denoted

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:37.101
with an H, but a bold
faced H, is it's a matrix,

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:41.120
incidentally enough, that contains all

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.358
the second partial derivatives of f.

00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:46.821
The first component is gonna
be, the partial derivative

00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:50.466
of f with respect to x twice
in a row, and everything

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.413
in this first column is
kind of like you first do it

00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:56.294
with respect to x, because
the next part is the second

00:00:56.294 --> 00:00:59.788
derivative where first you
do it with respect to x

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:03.001
and then you do it with respect to y.

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.134
That's the first column of the matrix.

00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:10.115
Then up here it's the partial
derivative where first you do

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:13.935
it with respect to y and then
you do it with respect to x,

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:15.497
and then over here it's
where you do it with

00:01:15.497 --> 00:01:18.193
respect to y both times in a row.

00:01:18.193 --> 00:01:22.026
Partial with respect to
y both times in a row.

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.408
Let's go ahead and actually compute this

00:01:24.408 --> 00:01:25.997
and think about what this would look like

00:01:25.997 --> 00:01:28.363
in the case of our specific function here.

00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:30.609
In order to get all the second
partial derivatives we first

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.869
should keep a record of the
first partial derivatives.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.697
The partial derivative
of f with respect to x.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:41.056
The only place x shows up is
in this e to the x halves.

00:01:41.056 --> 00:01:44.712
Bring down that 1/2 e to
the x halves and sine of y

00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:47.734
just looks like a constant
as far as x is concerned.

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:48.942
Sine of y.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.582
Then the partial derivative
with respect of y.

00:01:51.582 --> 00:01:55.362
Partial derivative of f with respect to y.

00:01:55.362 --> 00:01:57.830
Now e to the x halves
looks like a constant

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.626
and it's being multiplied by
something that has a y in it,

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:02.416
e to the x halves.

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:04.530
The derivative of sine of
y, since we're doing it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.280
with respect to y is cosine of y.

00:02:09.184 --> 00:02:11.659
These terms won't be included
in the Hessian itself

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.114
but we're just keeping a record of them

00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:16.309
because now when we go
into fill in the matrix,

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.115
this upper left component,
we're taking the second partial

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:22.142
derivative where we do it with
respect to x then x again.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.352
Up here is when we did
it with respect to x,

00:02:25.352 --> 00:02:27.536
if we did it with respect
to x again we bring down

00:02:27.536 --> 00:02:32.291
another 1/2 so that becomes
1/4 by e to the x halves

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:36.953
and that sine of y just
still looks like a constant.

00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:38.890
Then this mixed partial
derivative where we do it with

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.631
respect to x then y, so we
did it with respect to x here.

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:44.642
When we differentiate
this with respect to y,

00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:48.809
the 1/2 e to the x halves
just looks like a constant

00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:53.958
but then derivative of sine
of y ends up as cosine of y.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.459
Then up here, it's gonna be
the same thing but let's see

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.593
when you do it in the other direction,

00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:03.010
when you do it first
with respect to y then x.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.193
Over here we did it
first with respect to y.

00:03:05.193 --> 00:03:07.603
If we took this derivative
with respect to x,

00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:10.079
you'd have the 1/2 would
come down, so that would be

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.246
1/2 e to the x halves
multiplied by cosine of y

00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:17.667
because that's just looks
like a constant since

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:19.736
we're doing it with respect
to x the second time.

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:24.625
That would be cosine of y,
and it shouldn't feel like a

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:27.537
surprise that both of these
terms are not to be the same.

00:03:27.537 --> 00:03:29.298
With most functions that's the case.

00:03:29.298 --> 00:03:30.375
Technically not all functions.

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:32.297
You can come up with some crazy things

00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:34.246
where this won't be
symmetric, where you’ll

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:36.951
have different terms in the
diagonal, but for the most part

00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:39.580
those you can expect to be the same.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.458
In this last term here where
we do it with respect to

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:44.558
y twice, we now think of taking
the derivative of this whole

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:48.206
term with respect to y, that
e to the x halves looks like

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:52.373
a constant and derivative of
cosine is negative sine of y.

00:03:56.118 --> 00:03:59.653
This whole thing, a matrix,
each of whose components

00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:01.940
is a multivariable
function, is the Hessian.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.080
This is the Hessian of f,
and sometimes bold write it

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.633
as Hessian of f specifying
what function its of.

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:12.410
You could think of it as
a matrix valued function

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.061
which feels kind of weird
but you plug in two different

00:04:15.061 --> 00:04:17.195
values, x and y, and you'll get a matrix,

00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:19.420
so it's this matrix valued function.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.814
The nice thing about
writing it like this is that

00:04:20.814 --> 00:04:22.631
you can actually extend
this so that rather

00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:24.866
than just for functions
that have two variables,

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:27.610
let's say you had a function,
kind of like clear this up,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.675
let's say u had a function
that had three variables

00:04:29.675 --> 00:04:32.263
or four variables or any number.

00:04:32.263 --> 00:04:35.202
Let's say it was a
function of x, y, and z,

00:04:35.202 --> 00:04:38.514
then you can follow this
pattern and following down

00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:40.787
the first column here the
next term that you would get

00:04:40.787 --> 00:04:44.106
would be the second
partial derivative of f,

00:04:44.106 --> 00:04:46.529
where first you do with respect to x,

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:48.617
and then you do it with respect to z.

00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:51.584
Then over here it would be
the second partial derivative

00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:55.417
of f, where first you
did it with respect to y

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.567
and then you do it with respect to z,

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:03.157
I'll clear up even more room here,

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:05.013
because you'd have another
column where you'd have the

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.661
second partial derivative,
where this time everything first

00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:12.054
you do it with respect to z
and then with respect to x.

00:05:12.054 --> 00:05:14.910
Then over here you'd have
the second partial derivative

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.627
where first you do it with respect

00:05:16.627 --> 00:05:19.092
to z and then with respect to y.

00:05:19.092 --> 00:05:20.790
Then there is the very
last component you'd have

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.919
the second partial derivative
where first you do it with

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.014
respect to, well, I guess you
do it with respect to z twice.

00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:31.114
This whole thing, this three
by three matrix would be

00:05:31.114 --> 00:05:33.999
the Hessian of a three variable function.

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.798
You can see how you could
extend this pattern where if it

00:05:35.798 --> 00:05:38.349
was a four variable function
you'd get a four by four matrix

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.830
of all of the possible
second partial derivatives.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.769
If it was a 100 variable function

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:45.555
you would have a 100 by 100 matrix.

00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:47.827
The nice thing about having
this is then we can talk

00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:50.158
about that by just referencing the symbol

00:05:50.158 --> 00:05:51.594
and we'll see in the
next video how this makes

00:05:51.594 --> 00:05:54.300
it very nice to express,
for example the quadratic

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.055
approximation of any kind
of multivariable function

00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:59.525
not just a two variable
function and the symbols

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.095
don't get way out of hand
'cause you don't have to

00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:03.446
reference each one of these
individual components.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.131
You can just reference
the matrix as a whole

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.794
and start doing matrix operations.

00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:09.379
I will see you in that next video.
