00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.860
In the last video, I showed the
Laplace transform of t, or

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.410
we could view that as t the
first power, is equal to 1/s

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.410
squared, if we assume that
s is greater than 0.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.100
In this video, we're going to
see if we can generalize this

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.270
by trying to figure out the
Laplace transform of t to the

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.660
n, where n is any integer power
greater than 0, so n is

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.575
any positive integer
greater than 0.

00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:29.120
So let's try it out.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.060
So we know from our definition
of the Laplace transform that

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.930
the Laplace transform of t to
the n is equal to the integral

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.080
from 0 to infinity of our
function-- well, let me write

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.270
t to the n-- times, and this is
just the definition of the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.420
transform, e to the
minus st, dt.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.280
And similar to when we figured
out this Laplace transform,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.570
your intuition might be that,
hey, we should use integration

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.240
by parts, and I showed
it in the last video.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.769
I always forget it, but I just
recorded it, so I do happen to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.860
remember it.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.000
So the integration by parts
just tells us that the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.920
integral of uv prime is equal to
uv minus the integral of--

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.060
I view this as kind of the
swap-- so u prime v.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.175
So this is just our integration
by parts formula.

00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:26.720
If you ever forget it, you can
derive it in about 30 seconds

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.380
from the product rule.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.630
And I did it in the last video
because I hadn't used it for

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.330
awhile, so I had
to rederive it.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.460
So let's apply it here.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.850
So what do we want to
make our v prime?

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.530
It's always good to use the
exponential function, because

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.140
that's easy to take the
antiderivative of.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.540
So this is our v prime, in which
case our v is just the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.130
antiderivative of that.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.490
So it's e to the minus
st over minus s.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.550
If we take the derivative of
this, minus s divided by minus

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.660
s cancels out, and you
just get that.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.080
And then if we make our u-- let
me pick a good color here.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.940
If we make this equal to our
u, what's our u prime?

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.700
u prime is just going to be n
times t to the n minus 1.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.280
Fair enough.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.010
So let's apply the integration
by parts.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.330
So this is going to
be equal to uv.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.730
u, I'll use this t to the n, so
u is t to the n, that's our

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.880
u, times v, which is e-- let me
write this down-- so it's

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.075
minus-- there's a minus sign
there, so we put the minus.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:36.510
Let me do it in that color.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.555
I'm just rewriting this.
e to the minus st/s.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.725
So that's the uv term
right there.

00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:50.180
Let me make that clear.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.820
And let me pick a
good color here.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.090
So this term right here is
this term right here.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.040
And, of course, I'm going to
have to evaluate this from 0

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.615
to infinity, so let me write
that: 0 to infinity.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.420
I could put a little bracket
there or something, but you

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.990
know we're going to have
to evaluate that.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.560
And then from that, we're
going to have to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.460
subtract the integral.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.410
And let me not forget
our boundaries.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:20.520
0 to infinity of u prime is n
times t to the n minus 1--

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.450
that's our u prime-- times v
times minus-- so let me put

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.220
this minus out here-- so minus
e to the minus st/s.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.470
And then all of that.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.700
Of course, we have our dt, and
you have a minus minus.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.540
These things become pluses.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.430
Let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.760
So we get our Laplace transform
of t to the n is

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.100
equal to this evaluated at
infinity and evaluated at 0.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.800
So when you've evaluate-- what's
the limit of this as t

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.430
approaches infinity?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.900
As t approaches infinity, this
term, you might say, oh, this

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.690
becomes really big.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.610
And I went over this
in the last video.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.800
But this term overpowers it,
because you're going to have e

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.980
to the minus infinity, if
we assume that s is

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.470
greater than 0.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.960
So if s is greater than 0, this
term is going to win out

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.970
and go to 0 much faster
than this term is

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.750
going to go to infinity.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.770
So when you evaluate it at
infinity, when you evaluate

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.730
this at infinity, you're
going to get 0.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.020
And then you're going to
subtract this evaluated at 0.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.600
This evaluated at 0, when it's
evaluated at 0 is just minus 0

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.960
to the n times e to the minus
s times 0/s Well, this

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.980
becomes 0 as well.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.220
So this whole term evaluated
from 0 to infinity is all 0,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.720
which is a nice, convenient
thing for us.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.100
And then we're going to have
this next term right there.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.470
So let's take out the constant
terms. This n

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.150
and this s are constant.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.335
They are constant with
respect to t.

00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:06.990
So you have plus n/s times the
integral from 0 to infinity of

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:16.740
t to the n minus 1 times
e to the minus st, dt.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.670
Now, this should look reasonably
familiar to you.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.010
What's the definition of
the Laplace transform?

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.290
The Laplace transform of any
function is equal to the

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.750
integral from 0 to infinity of
that function times e to the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.030
minus st, dt.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.390
Well, when we have an e to the
minus st, dt, we're taking the

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.500
integral from 0 to infinity,
so this whole integral is

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.310
equal to the Laplace transform
of this, of t

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.930
to the n minus 1.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.530
So just that easily, because
this term went to 0, we've

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.130
simplified things.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:04.110
We get the Laplace transform
of t to the n is equal to--

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.830
this is all 0-- it's equal to
n/s-- that's right there--

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.640
times this integral right here,
which we just figured

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.000
out was the Laplace transform
of t to the n minus 1.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.070
Well, this is a nice,
neat simplification.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.090
We can now figure out the
Laplace transform of a higher

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.645
power in terms of the one power
lower that, but it still

00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:25.975
doesn't give me a generalized
formula.

00:06:25.975 --> 00:06:31.060
So let's see if we can use this
with this information to

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.480
get a generalized formula.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.790
So the Laplace transform of just
t-- so let me write that

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.030
down; I wrote that at the
beginning of the problem.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.270
We get the Laplace transform, I
could write this as t to the

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.510
1, which is just t, is equal
to 1/s squared, where s is

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.050
greater than 0.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.420
Now, what happens if
we take the Laplace

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.480
transform of t squared?

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.160
Well, we can just use this
formula up here.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.460
The Laplace transform of t
squared is equal to 2/s times

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.760
the Laplace transform of t,
of just t to the 1, right?

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.580
2 minus 1.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.550
So times the Laplace transform
of t to the 1.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.520
Well, t, we know what that is.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.510
This is equal to 2/s times this,
times 1/s squared, which

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.520
is equal to 2/s to the third.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.310
Interesting.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.820
Let's see if we can
do another one.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.950
What is-- I'll do it in the
dark blue-- the Laplace

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.660
transform of t to the third?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.370
Well, we just use this
formula up here.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.200
It's n/s.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.880
In this case, n is 3.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.630
So it's 3/s times the Laplace
transform of t to the n minus

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.570
1, so t squared.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.770
We know what the Laplace
transform of this one was.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.400
This is just this right there.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.980
So it's equal to 3/s
times this thing.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.610
And I'm going to actually write
it this way, because I

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.390
think it's interesting.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.560
So I'll write the numerator.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:13.310
Times 2 times 1/s over s
squared, which is-- we could

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:18.020
write it as 3 factorial
over-- what is this? s

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.270
to the fourth power.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.340
Let's do another one.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.940
And I think you already are
getting the idea of

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.470
what's going on.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.750
The Laplace transform of t to
the fourth power is what?

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:40.270
It's equal to 4/s times the
Laplace transform of t the

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.710
third power.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.169
And that's just 4/s
times this.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:50.150
So it's 4/s times 3 factorial
over s to the fourth.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.790
So now 4 times 3 factorial,
that's just 4 factorial over s

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.120
to the fifth.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.490
And so you can just get
the general principle.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.100
And we can prove this
by induction.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.235
It's almost trivial based on
what we've already done.

00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:14.710
That the Laplace transform of
t to the n is equal to n

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:21.740
factorial over s to
the n plus 1.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.250
We proved it directly for this
base case right here.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.290
This is 1 factorial over
s to the 1 plus 1.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.610
And then if we know it's true
for this, we know it's going

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.940
to be true for the
next increment.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.850
So induction proof is almost
obvious, but you can even see

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:38.970
it based on this.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.330
If you have to figure out the
Laplace transform of t to the

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.500
tenth, you could just keep
doing this over and over

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.000
again, but I think you see the
pattern pretty clearly.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.940
So anyway, I thought that was
a neat problem in and of

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.730
itself, outside of the fact,
it'll be useful when we figure

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.620
out inverse and Laplace
transforms. But this is a

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.640
pretty neat result.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.730
The Laplace transform of t to
the n, where n is some integer

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.480
greater than 0 is equal to n
factorial over s to the n plus

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.690
1, where s is also
greater than 0.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.290
That was an assumption we had to
make early on when we took

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.250
our limits as t approaches
infinity.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.390
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
