00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.470
In the last video we defined
internal energy as literally

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.470
all the energy that's
in a system.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.340
That's kind of the most
inclusive version,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.190
at least in my head.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.840
So that's my system, it's
some type of container.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.100
And I have a bunch of
particles in here.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.630
It's literally the sum of
the kinetic energies

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.820
of all these particles.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.280
If they had potential
energies, we'd

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.240
throw that in there.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.260
If they have electrical
potential, we'd

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.460
throw that in there.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.680
If they have bonds with each
other, the energies in that

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.840
bond, we would throw
it in there.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.710
It's everything.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.540
It's all inclusive.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.550
And, I told you in the last
video it's unintuitive that U

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.890
stands for internal energy.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.720
But I kind of think that, you
know, U, it contains the

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.550
universe of energy.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.980
You know, that's just for
me to memorize it.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.340
Don't think too deeply into
what I just said.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.830
But this is internal energy.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.320
If you show me a system, it
has some internal energy.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.890
It's a function of its state.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.070
I don't care how it got to that
state, but if you told me

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.580
a system at a certain state,
maybe with a certain pressure,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.280
or a certain volume, or at a
certain temperature-- although

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.550
if you give me pressure and
volume that should be enough--

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.940
I can tell you what its
internal energy is.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.840
Especially if you tell me the
type of molecule I have, and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.930
things like that.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.990
Now we also said in the last
video that because internal

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.640
energy is all the energy in
the system, it can't be

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.260
randomly created or destroyed.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.050
It can just be transformed
from one form to another.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.600
So if I have a change in
internal energy, it can only

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.060
be due to-- well, it can be
due to more than what I'm

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.620
describing.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.220
But in our simple world where
all of the energy in a

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.520
system-- and maybe we're dealing
with gases, because

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.080
that's normally what you deal
with in a first-year chemistry

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.290
course-- it's going to be the
heat that could be added to

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.860
the system, plus the work
done on the system.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.830
And like I said in the last
video, sometimes they'll say,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.260
instead of plus the work done
on the system, sometimes

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.020
they'll say, minus the work
that the system does.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.970
Either way.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.680
And here I just want to make
another side discussion here,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.880
because I decided to write
it without the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.810
little deltas here.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.330
And the reason why I did that
is if you were to write this

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.560
equation, which you will see,
you'll see it in textbooks,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.460
teachers will do it-- nothing
inherently criminal about

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.320
that-- but I just do that
because it clears in my mind

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.840
what heat and what work are
relative to internal energy.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:31.630
If I were to write delta U is
equal to heat delta Q plus

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.340
delta W to me this implies that
at some point I had some

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.330
amount of heat in my system,
and then I have a different

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.860
amount of heat in my system,
and I took the difference

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.780
between the two and I got
a change in heat.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.860
So this implies that heat is
somehow an inherent macrostate

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.880
of the system, and that's
not the case.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.440
I can tell you what the
internal energy

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.540
of this system is.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.100
I can tell you its pressure.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.600
I can tell you its volume.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.390
I can tell you its
temperature.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.340
These are all macrostates
of the system.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.040
I don't know how it got to this
situation, but I can tell

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.800
you about it.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.880
I cannot tell you what the
heat is of this system.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.690
And that might be a little
unintuitive, because if I ask

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.330
you, hey I have a cup of coffee,
what's the heat of it?

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.920
You might say, oh, it's, you
know, you might give me the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.450
temperature.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.940
Because in our everyday language
we use things like

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.790
heat and temperature
interchangeably.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.920
But in thermodynamics, heat
is a transfer of energy.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.080
A way to think about it
is, if internal energy

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.510
is your bank account.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.195
So you could say change
in bank account.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.370
And it really is like
the energy bank

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.690
account of a system.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.660
If you have a change in a bank
account, you had some deposits

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.770
or withdrawals.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.480
And heat and work are really
just deposits or withdrawals

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.550
into our energy bank account.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.570
Heat is one kind.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.790
Maybe heat is like
a wire transfer.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.640
So you could say it's wire
transfers to your account.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.570
Transfers to your account
plus check deposits.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:24.840
Now it makes a lot of sense to
say, you could say, what is my

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.360
value of my bank account?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.630
Or you could say what is my
change in my bank account?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.860
You take two snapshots of
your bank account at

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.140
two different times.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.170
But would it make sense to say--
you know, I could say I

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.420
wire transferred $10, right?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.220
So I could say, this statement
would be plus $10.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.080
And I could say that I
wrote $20 in checks,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.710
minus $20 in checks.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.630
In which case, my change
in my bank account

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.440
would be minus $10.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.160
Now would it make sense
for me to say

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.930
change in wire transfer?

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.810
That implies that when I started
off maybe my bank

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.390
account had $100 in it
and now it has $90.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.240
When my bank account had $100
in it, did it have any wire

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.010
transfer amount?

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.000
No, wire transfer was how money
was deposited or taken

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.920
away from my account.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.780
Likewise, it didn't have a
checking deposit account, so I

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.080
can't really-- it just seems
weird to me to say change in

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.280
wire transfer is $10, or change
in check deposits is

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.340
$20 or minus $20.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.370
Would you say, I made a
$10 wire transfer and

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.970
I paid $20 in checks.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.050
So I had a net change in
my bank account of $10.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.280
Likewise, I say how much work
was done to me or I did, which

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.610
is essentially a deposit or
withdrawal of energy.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.900
Or I could say much heat was
given to me or how much heat

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.160
was released, which is another
way of depositing or

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.360
withdrawing energy from my
energy bank account.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.920
So that's why I like
to stick to this.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.400
And I like to stay
away from this.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.940
And just like I said, you can't
say how much heat is in

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.920
the system.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.270
So someone will say, oh, how
much heat is in this?

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.560
You cannot say that.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.460
There's no heat state variable
for that system.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.370
You have internal energy.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.150
The closest thing to heat,
we'll talk about it in a

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.860
future video, is enthalpy.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.430
Enthalpy is essentially a way of
measuring how much heat is

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.120
in a system, but we won't talk
about that just now.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.940
And you can't say how much
work is in a system.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.140
You can't say, oh I have x
amount of work in a system.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.190
The system can do work or have
work done to it, but there's

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.710
not a certain amount of work,
because that energy in the

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.180
system could be all used for
work, it could all be used for

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.470
heat, it could all be used for
a ton of different things.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.760
So you can't say those things.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.030
And that's why I don't like
treating them like state

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.940
variables, or state functions.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.530
So with that said, this
is our definition.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.760
Let's do a couple of
simple problems,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.840
just to give you intuition.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.040
And I really want to make
you comfortable.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.560
My real goal is to make you
comfortable with, when to know

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.320
to use plus or minus
on the work.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.000
And the best way to do it is not
to memorize a formula, but

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.520
just to kind of think about
what's happening.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.490
So let's say that I have some
system here and, I don't know,

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.540
it's a balloon.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.770
And let's say that I have no
change in internal energy.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.990
Internal energy is 0.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.100
And for our purposes we can kind
of view it as the kinetic

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.350
energy of the particles
haven't changed.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.200
And let's say by expanding a
bit, by my balloon expanding a

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.420
bit-- I did some work.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.730
I'll do this in more detail
in the next video.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:35.940
So the system does 10
joules of work.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.840
My question is, how much heat
was added or taken away from

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.090
the system?

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.615
So the way I can think about
it-- you don't even have to

00:07:46.615 --> 00:07:49.160
write the formula down, or you
can write it-- you could say,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.370
look, the internal energy, the
amount of energy in the system

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.050
hasn't changed.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.430
The system did 10
joules of work.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.510
So that's energy going
out of the system.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.100
It did 10 joules.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.980
So 10 joules went out
in the form of work.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.640
If the internal energy did not
change, then essentially 10

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.790
joules of energy had to
go into the system.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.800
10 joules had to go
into the system.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.280
If it didn't, the internal
energy would have gone down by

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.020
the amount of work we had.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.490
And the only way, if is this is
the net work, the only way

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.920
that we're talking about, that
we can add energy outside of

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.000
work, is through heat.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.810
So 10 joules of heat must
have been added.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:36.860
So we can write 10 joules
of heat added to system.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.690
Now let's look at that from
the point of view of the

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.450
actual formula.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:49.720
If we have delta U is equal to
heat added, plus work done to

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.970
the system, then we would
say, OK, this was 0.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.190
It's equal to the heat
added to the system.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.060
Remember, in this way we're
saying this is the heat done,

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.610
or the work done,
to the system.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.420
W is work done.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.600
Now, the system did work
to something else.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.180
It didn't have work
done to it.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.540
So if this is work done to the
system, and it did work, then

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.040
this is going to
be a minus 10.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.820
Minus 10 joules.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.260
And then you solve both
sides of this.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:31.220
You add 10 to both sides and
you get 10 is equal to Q,

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.460
which is exactly what
we got up here.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.200
But this can get confusing
sometimes, because you're

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.570
like, oh, is this heat
that the system did?

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.180
Is this heat that was added to
the system or taken away?

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:48.080
The convention tends to be
that this is heat added.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.280
But then sometimes
it's confusing.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.080
Is this the work done to the
system or work done by?

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.750
And that's why I like just
doing it this way.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.660
If the system does work
it loses energy.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.330
If the system has work done
to it, it gains energy.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.280
So let's do another problem.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.350
I mean, I could have done this
exact same thing using the

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.650
other formula that you'll
sometimes see.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:14.860
Delta U is equal to Q minus the
work that the system does

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.520
by the system-- Work
done by the system.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.980
And in this case, once
again, change in

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.710
internal energy was 0.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.990
That is equal to heat
added to the system,

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.320
minus the work done.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.560
So minus-- I told you at the
beginning of the problem that

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.590
the system did 10 joules of
work-- so minus the work done.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.790
Minus 10 joules.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.080
We get the same situation
up here from

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.690
two different formulas.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.420
And we got 10 is equal to Q.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.850
Either way, the heat added to
the system is 10 joules.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.170
Let's do one more.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:11:02.370
Let's say that, I don't know,
5 joules of heat taken away

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.620
from system.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:16.260
And let's say that 1 joule
of work done on system.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.170
So maybe we're compressing the
balloon on the system.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:25.150
What is our change in
internal energy?

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.140
Let's just figure
out our change.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.190
So the way I think of it is 5
joules of heat taken away from

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.990
the system, that's going
to reduce our internal

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.930
energy by minus 5.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.070
And if 1 joule work is done onto
the system, we're putting

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.740
energy into it so that'll
be plus 1.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.950
So minus 5, plus 1, is
going to be minus 4.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.780
Or enter our change in internal

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.450
energy is minus 4 joules.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.970
Now we could have done that a
little bit more formally with

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.400
the formula, change in internal
energy is equal to

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:03.720
heat added to the system, plus
work done on the system.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.680
So it's equal to heat
added to the system.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.530
We had 5 joules heat taken away,
so this is minus 5, plus

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.990
work done on the system.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.180
We have 1 joule of work done
on the system, and there we

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.880
get, once again, minus 4.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.540
Now, I could have written that
same formula the other way.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:27.340
I could have said change in
internal energy is equal to

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.950
heat added to the system minus
the work that the system does.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.530
I want to do this both ways,
because I don't want you to

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.380
get confused, either way you
see it on problems or in

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.410
school, or maybe you take one
class that does it one way and

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.425
one class that does
it the other.

00:12:40.425 --> 00:12:43.210
If you use it this way,
what was the heat

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.340
added to the system?

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.440
We had heat taken away,
so it's minus 5.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.890
So minus the work that the
system does, how much work

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.250
does the system do?

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.720
Well, the system had 1 joule
of work done to it.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.550
So it did itself minus
1 joules of work.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.110
So it's minus minus 1.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.130
I want to be clear, when I use
this formula, this is work

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.060
done by system, done by.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.720
This is work done to.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.000
The system had work
done to it.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.700
So it had minus 1 joules of work
done by the system, so

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.970
these become pluses, and you
get back to a minus 4.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.550
Do whatever's intuitive
for you.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.510
For me, this tends to be the
most intuitive, where you

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.550
don't even use a formula.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.990
We just think, if I'm doing
work, I'm using up energy.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.550
If I get work done to me, I'm
being handed over energy.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.200
If I have heat taken away from
me, I'm giving away energy.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.300
If I have heat added to me,
I'm getting energy.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.100
See you in the next video.
