00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.320
We know from the last few videos

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:11.460
we have light exiting a slow medium. Let's say I have light ray exiting a slow medium there

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.090
Let me draw. This is its incident angle right over there

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.540
Though it's not the true mechanics of light, you can imagine a car was coming from

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.210
a slow medium to a fast medium; it was going from the mud to the road

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.400
If the car was moving in the direction of this ray, the left tires would get out of the mud

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.330
before the right tires and they are going to be able to travel faster

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.590
So this will move the direction of the car to the right

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.490
So the car will travel in this direction, like that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.350
where this angle right over here is the angle of refraction

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.750
This is a slower medium than that. This is the fast minimum over here

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.440
We get theta 2 is going to be greater than theta 1

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.740
What I want to figure out in this video is

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.720
is there some angle depending on the two substances that the light travels in

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.860
where if this angle is big enough--because we know that this angle is always

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.490
is always larger than this angle

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.400
that the refraction angle is always bigger than the incident angle

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.840
moving from a slow to a fast medium

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.580
Is there some angle--if I approach it right over here

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.900
Let's call this angle theta 3

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.210
Is there some angle theta 3

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.550
where that is large enough that the reflected angle is going to be 90 degrees

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.470
if that light is actually never going to escape into the fast medium?

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.340
And if I had a incident angle larger than theta 3, like that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.210
So whatever that is, the light won't actually even travel along the surface

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.980
it definitely won't escape. It won't even travel on surface. It will actually reflect back

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.190
So you actually have something called total internal reflection

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.990
To figure that out, we need to figure out at what angle theta three

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:25.020
do we have of a fraction angle of 90 degrees?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.020
That incident angle is going to be called our critical angle

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.790
Anything larger than that will actually have no refraction

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.180
It's actually not going to escape the slow medium

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.280
It's just going to reflect at the boundary back into the slow medium

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.070
Let's try to figure that out and I'll do it with an actual example

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.720
So let's say I have water. This is water

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.310
It has an index of refraction of 1.33

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.580
And let's say I have air up here

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.560
And air is pretty darn close to a vacuum

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.970
And we saw this index of refraction 1.00029 or whatever

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:11.260
Let's just for sake of simplicity say its index of refraction 1.00

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:21.530
For light that's coming out of the water

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.120
I want to find some critical angle. I'll call it theta critical

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.950
and so if I have any incident angle less than this critical angle, I'll escape

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.600
At that critical angle, I just kind of travel at the surface

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.280
Anything larger than that critical angle, I'll actually have total internal reflection

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.700
Let's think about what this theta, this critical angle could be

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.410
So I'll break out Snell's Law again

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.990
We have the index of refraction of the water

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:16.720
1.33 times the sine of our critical angle

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.670
is going to be equal to the index of refraction of the air which is just one

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.470
times the sine of this refraction angle, which is 90 degrees

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.350
Now what is the sine of 90 degrees? To figure that out, you need to think about the unit circle

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.130
You can't just do the soh-cah-toa

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.990
This is why the unit circle definition is useful

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.610
Think of the unit circle

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.820
You go 90 degrees. We are now here on the unit circle

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.490
And the sine is the y coordinate. On a unit circle, that is 1

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.240
So the y coordinate is 1. So this right over here is going to be 1

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.520
So to figure this out, we can divide both sides by 1.33

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:16.170
So we get the sine of our critical angle is going to be equal to be 1 over 1.33

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.390
If you want to generalize it, this is going to be the index of refraction--

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.530
this right here is the index of refraction of the faster medium

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.750
That right there we can call that index of refraction of the faster medium

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.600
This right here is the index of refraction of the slower medium. So it's ns

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.530
Because the sine of 90 degrees is always going to simplify to 1

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.680
when you're finding that critical angle

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.840
So I'll just keep solving before we get our calculator out

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.880
We take the inverse sine of both sides

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:57.580
And we get our critical angle. It's going to be the inverse sine 1 / 1.33

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.110
Let's get our handy TI-85 out again

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:11.960
We just want to find the inverse sign of 1 / 1.33

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:43.230
which tells us if we have light leaving water at an incident angle of more than 48.8 degrees

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.280
it actually won't even be able to refract; it won't be able to escape into the air

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.410
It's actually going to reflect at that boundary

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.980
If you have angles less than 48.8 degrees, it will refract

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.810
So if you have an angle right over there

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.250
it will be able to escape and reflect a little bit

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.330
And then right at 48.8, right at that critical angle

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.710
you're gonna have refraction angle of 90 degrees

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.130
or really just travel at the surface of water

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.910
And this is actually how fiber-optic cables work. Fiber-optic cables are just--

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.580
You can view them as glass pipes

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:29.600
And the light is traveling and the incident angles are so large here

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.250
that the light would just keep reflecting within the fiber-optic

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.580
So this is the light ray

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.090
If they travel at larger than the critical angle

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.640
so instead of escaping into the surrounding air or whatever

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.610
it'll keep reflecting within the glass tube

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.150
allowing that light information to actual travel

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.331
Anyway, hopefully you found that reasonably interesting

00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:55.000
