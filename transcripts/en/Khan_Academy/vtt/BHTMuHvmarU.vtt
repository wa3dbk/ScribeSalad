00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
 

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.900
I think most of us have a sense
that payday loans are

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.010
probably not the best source for
a loan, that they probably

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.420
charge a lot of money to those
people who need that cash

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.135
really badly.

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.750
And what I want to do in this
video is one, explain what

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.090
they are but even more do
a little bit of math to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.570
understand really how bad of
an interest that they do

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.100
charge,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.730
So the way that works is let's
say that I need to buy my wife

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.050
a nice gift for her birthday
that's tomorrow and I want to

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.970
borrow $500.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.600
So I want to borrow $500.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.510
I would suspect that most people
aren't borrowing it for

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.700
some type of a gift, they're
desperate to make the rent or

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.540
pay the utilities or buy food
or who knows what else, but

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.750
whatever your reason, you need
to borrow $500 and I would

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.690
suspect that you have very
little in your bank account,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.900
otherwise you wouldn't go
to the payday lendor.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.820
And they say all right Sal,
we're open to lending you $500

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.170
and we're not going to do all
of this deep research on how

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.500
good of a credit you are and
all of that, but we want a

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.170
couple of things.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.570
One, we want to know your pay
stub and your pay date.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.590
 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.760
They're going to want to see
your pay stub, they're going

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.220
to they want to know when you're
going to get paid, so I

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.590
guess we call it your payday.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.400
And they might want some
recent bank statements.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.380
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.050
And the whole reason why they
want these things is they want

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.430
to know you know even though
your credit might be horrible,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.340
then you're going to get your
salary or you're going to to

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.320
get a payment from your employer
probably in two weeks

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.500
on your payday, and then you're
going to be good to pay

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.230
back to the $500.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.000
And to ensure this, so one
they're going to make sure

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.900
that you have a job, that in
your pay stub maybe you make

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.830
$1,000 every two weeks or maybe
you make $2,000 every

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.220
two weeks so that you're
good for this.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.230
So maybe you maybe make $1,500
every two weeks, so they like

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.250
to see that.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.480
Maybe your payday is two weeks
from the day that you're

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.699
borrowing it, borrowing
the money.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:15.790
So two weeks from today.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.820
And then your bank statement
shows that your bank kind of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.410
goes up $1,500 and you pay the
rent and the food and then it

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.960
goes back close to zero, then it
goes up to $1,500 but they

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.100
want to see that this $1,500
is hitting periodically.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.170
And they say, you know,
we're going to give

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.310
you the $500 today.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.445
You need to write us a check.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:42.330
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.370
We want you to write a check for
not $500, for every $100

00:02:47.370 --> 00:03:00.370
you borrow, I want you to
pay us back another $25.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.690
So $25 extra.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.370
And at first you might say,
that's not bad, that's 25%

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.430
interest. It's high, maybe it
compares to some interest,

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.360
some credit cards.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.050
But this isn't 25% a year, this
is 25% for two weeks.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.900
And at the end of this video,
we're going to do the map on

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.790
what that actually turns
into on an APR, or an

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.410
effective APR basis.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.560
And these numbers are not crazy,
these are actually very

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.960
typical for payday loans.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.780
So if I'm borrowing $500, I
have to give them back the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.570
$500 in two weeks plus
$25 for every $100.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.540
So I'm borrowing $500, so I'm
going to have to do plus five

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.390
times 25 five or $125.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.760
So I'm going to write them a
check for $500 plus a $125 so

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.880
that's $625.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.850
I'm going to write a check, but
obviously I don't have the

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.650
money in my bank account right
now, otherwise I wouldn't even

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.240
be going to the payday loan.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.520
What I'm going to do on
the date, I'm going to

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.310
forward-date this check.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.180
I'm going to put the date, let's
say this is the first of

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.070
the month, instead of let's say,
it's January 1, I'm going

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.520
to put January 16 and whatever
year I might be doing it.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.709
So I've forwarded it, this
is two weeks from today.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.780
Two weeks in the future, and
then I'm going to sign the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.780
check and I'll write it's for
a payday loan and I'll write

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.910
$625 etc. etc., then I have my
little information here.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.220
And I'm going to give them this
check and what they're

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.370
going to say is we're not going
to cash this, we're just

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.510
going to keep this nice little
check for us and when your

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.520
payday hits you have
an option.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:58.250
You can come back to us and give
us $625 in cash and then

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.510
we will give you back this check
that is uncashed or if

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.950
you don't show up, we are just
going to cash this check.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.070
So one of these two things
are going to happen.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.670
But effectively, if you didn't
lie to them, they're going to

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.870
essentially charge you $625
and you can imagine it is

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.890
risky for the lender or because
these are people with

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.130
you know be maybe shady pay
stubs and obviously they're

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.970
desperate, so they weren't
good at managing their

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.700
finances, but they're doing
their best to ensure that once

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.950
that payday comes in, once
that's that payment from the

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.300
employer comes in, that they
get first dibs was on the

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.200
money before the person can
pay their rent or their

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.790
utilities or their food.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.030
And so that's the general
idea behind it.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.550
Now we start off saying this
probably not a good idea and

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.980
you got a sense of that, because
we're essentially

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.070
paying 25% interest for every
two weeks, not for every year.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.580
But let's think about what
that is on an APR basis.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.040
So let's say we're paying $25
for every $100, that's really

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.700
25 per cent.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.640
When you say per cent, that
root means hundred, right?

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.940
Century, 100 years.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.220
So per cent, it literally
means per 100.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.590
25 per 100, so this is literally
25% interest or we

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.655
could write it the traditional
way, this is 25%

00:06:14.655 --> 00:06:18.625
interest per two weeks.

00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:21.970
 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.750
So if we were just calculate a
simple APR, a simple annual

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:36.690
percentage interest rate, and
you might want to watch the

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.820
video on that to understand that
that just takes your 25%

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.490
and then multiplies by the
number of periods in the year.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.860
So we have 52 weeks per year,
but this is every two weeks,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.750
so instead of multiplying it
by 52 weeks, we're going to

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.450
multiply by there's 26 two-week
periods in the year.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:03.535
So times 26 two-week
periods per year.

00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:08.360
And this is 25% per two weeks.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.950
When you multiply this out, this
is equal to-- let's get

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.325
the calculator out-- I'll just
multiply the numbers, I won't

00:07:16.325 --> 00:07:16.920
do the decimals.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:27.320
25 times 26 equal to 650%.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.900
We're paying an APR of 650%.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.900
So if you thought the credit
card companies were charging a

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.660
lot of interest, charging you
a mid teens interest rate or

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.240
20% rate, this is 650%.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.890
It's an order of magnitude
or two above what even credit

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.780
cards charge.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.300
So this is a really, really,
crazy annual percentage rate

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.340
and this was just a simple
annual percentage rate where

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.670
we multiplied it by 26, this
isn't the effective annual

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.685
percentage rate, or the actual
mathematically correct one.

00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:01.680
To do that, we would actually
have to take-- and you might

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.040
want to watch the video on
this-- if you were to let that

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.150
just compound, and you can
imagine if you're the payday

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.380
lender, you are essentially
getting that compounding if

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.000
you keep lending your money
out and if you lend the

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.940
interest you get from the last
person, and you lend that out

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.130
the same rate.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.590
To figure out that effective
annual percent rate, you do

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:23.100
1.25, 25% plus 1 to
the 26th power.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.570
We have 26 of these
periods in a year.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.160
And what is that going
to be equal to?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.980
So we have 1.25 to
the 26th power.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.370
And then we get this crazy
number, we're going to want to

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.770
subtract a 1 from it, not
that it's going to

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.710
change much of our math.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:50.450
So minus 1, and we get, well
let me be very clear--

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.550
essentially this is 329
times our money.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.550
So this if this was a one here,
that would be 100%.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.720
So let me just be clear, this
number right here that number

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.990
right there is such a high
number it's hard to fathom.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.140
If you were to actually let
money compound at this rate,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.490
and usually they would make
you at least roll over the

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.080
principal, so this may or may
not be accurate but that

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.550
actual payday lender, if they
actually are able to roll over

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.330
the money at this rate, they're
going to have 329

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.140
times their money.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.610
Or if you write it as
a percent, it would

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:29.410
literally be 32,987.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:33.900
Literally, 32,987%.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.560
Or after a year, you'll
essentially have to pay

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.480
roughly 330 times your money
back to the payday lender.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.680
And obviously they don't let
you compound like that, but

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.590
this just gives you a sense
of how ridiculous this

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.550
interest rate is.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.430
I mean, you might have heard
of the term usury.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.960
 

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.560
In the past, usury really meant
any kind of interest,

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.390
but now in our current cultural
context we associate

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.630
it with just an unreasonable
level of interest and that

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.450
threshold might be different
for some people.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.050
Some people might say it's
unreasonable to pay 20%, or

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.610
30% interest, or 40% annual
interest. But I think everyone

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:15.840
would agree that whether you
look at 650% or 33,000%, these

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.330
are usurious and reasonable
interest rates.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.310
So you really, at all costs,
