00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.910
In the last video, I said that
we started off with the change

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.119
in distance, so we
said that we know

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.369
the change in distance.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.350
These are the things
that we are given.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.610
We're given the acceleration,
we're given the initial

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.910
velocity, and I asked you how
do we figure out what the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.070
final velocity is?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.290
In the last video-- if you don't
remember it, go watch

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.960
that last video again-- we
derived the formula that vf

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.640
squared, the final velocity
squared, is equal to the

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.180
initial velocity squared
plus 2 times

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.680
the change in distance.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.320
You'll sometimes just see it
written as 2 times distance,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.570
because we assume that the
initial distance is at point

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.470
0, so the change in distance
would just

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.540
be the final distance.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.620
We could write it either way,
and hopefully, at this point,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.600
you see why I keep switching
between change in

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.060
distance and distance.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.740
It's just so you're comfortable
when you see it

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.630
either way.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.330
This is for the situation
when we didn't

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.230
know what the vf was.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.330
Let's say we want to solve
for time instead.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.470
Once we solve for the final
velocity, we could actually

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.620
solve for time, and I'll show
you how to do that, but let's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.460
say we didn't want to go through
this step-- how can we

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.560
solve for time directly, given
the change in distance, the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.140
acceleration, and the
initial velocity?

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.620
Let's go back once again to
the most basic distance

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.040
formula-- not the distance
formula, but how distance

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.290
relates to velocity.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.010
We know that-- I'll write it
slightly different this time--

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:44.130
the change in distance over the
change in time is equal to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.520
the average velocity.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.030
We could have rewritten this as
the change in distance is

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.780
equal to the average velocity
times the change in time.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.130
This is change in time and
change in distance.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.510
Sometimes we'll just see this
written as d equals-- let me

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.440
write this in a different
color, so we have some

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.640
variety-- velocity times time,
or d equals rate times time.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.010
The reason why I have change in
distance here, or change in

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.310
time, is that I'm not assuming
necessarily that we're

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.920
starting off at the point
0 or at time 0.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.340
If we do, then it just turns out
to the final distance is

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.920
equal to the average velocity
times the final time, but

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.950
let's stick to this.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.720
We want to figure out time
given this set of inputs.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.200
Let's go from this equation.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.670
If we want to solve for time,
or the change in time, we

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.730
could just could divide both
sides by the average

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.600
velocity-- actually, no,
let's not do that.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.180
Let's just stay in terms
of change in distance.

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:08.740
I've wasted space too fast,
so let me clear

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.670
this and start again.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:23.750
We're given change in distance,
initial velocity,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.780
and acceleration, and we want
to figure out what the time

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.810
is-- it's really the change in
time, but let's just assume

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.070
that we start time 0, so it's
kind of the final time.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.230
Let's just start with the simple
formula: distance, or

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.790
change in distance-- I'll use
them interchangeably, with a

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.990
lower case d this time-- is
equal to the average velocity

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.320
times time.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.570
What's the average velocity?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.730
The average velocity is just the
initial velocity plus the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.230
final velocity over 2.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.565
The only reason why we can just
average the initial and

00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:09.410
the final is because we're
assuming constant

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.240
acceleration, and that's very
important, but in most

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.840
projectile problems, we do have
constant acceleration--

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.890
downwards-- and that's
gravity.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.899
We can assume, and we can do
this-- we can say that the

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.070
average of the initial and the
final velocity is the average

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.080
velocity, and then we multiply
that times time.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.700
Can we use this equation
directly?

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.310
No. we know acceleration, but
don't know final velocity.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.040
If we can write this final
velocity in terms of the other

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.060
things in this equation, then
maybe we can solve for time.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.960
Let's try to do that: distance
is equal to-- let me take a

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.250
little side here.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.870
What do we know about
final velocity?

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.850
We know that the change in
velocity is equal to

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.620
acceleration times time,
assuming that time

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.900
starts a t equals 0.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.040
The change in velocity is the
same thing is vf minus vi is

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.860
equal to acceleration
times time.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.250
We know that the final velocity
is equal to the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.860
initial velocity plus
acceleration times time.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.550
Let's substitute that
back into what I was

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.890
writing right here.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:28.170
We have distance is equal to the
initial velocity plus the

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.530
final velocity, so let's
substitute this expression

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.435
right here.

00:05:32.435 --> 00:05:36.835
The initial velocity, plus, now
the final velocity is now

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:41.910
the initial velocity, plus
acceleration times time, and

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:48.000
then we divide all of that
by 2 times time.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.610
We get d is equal to-- we have
2 in the numerator, we have 2

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:02.510
initial velocity, 2vi's plus
at over 2, and all

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.600
of that times t.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.730
Then we can simplify this.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.380
This equals d is equal to-- this
2 cancels out this 2, and

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.260
then we distribute this t across
both terms-- so d is

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:24.820
equal to vit plus-- this term
is at over 2, but then you

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.300
multiply the t times here, too--
so it's at squared over

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:34.190
2 plus at squared over 2.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.480
We could use this formula
if we know the change in

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.490
distance, or the distance-- this
actually should be the

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.190
change in distance, and the
change in time-- is equal to

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.030
the initial velocity times time
plus acceleration times

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.860
squared divided by 2.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.860
Let me summarize all of the
equations we have, because we

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.630
really now have in our arsenal
every equation that you really

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.400
need to solve one dimensional
projectile problems-- things

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.080
going either just left, right,
east, west, or north, south,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.000
but not both.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.340
I will do that in
the next video.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.060
Let's summarize everything
we know.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.970
We know the change in distance
divided by the change in time

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.730
is equal to velocity-- average
velocity, and it would equal

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.830
velocity if velocity's not
changing, but average when

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.597
velocity does change-- and we
have constant acceleration,

00:07:29.597 --> 00:07:31.700
which is an important
assumption.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.870
We know that the change in
velocity divided by the change

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.500
in time is equal to
acceleration.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:47.300
We know the average velocity is
equal to the final velocity

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.650
plus the initial velocity
over 2, and this assumes

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.900
acceleration is constant.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.870
If we know the initial velocity,
acceleration, and

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.540
the distance, and we want to
figure out the final velocity,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:20.300
we could use this formula: vf
squared equals vi squared plus

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.603
2a times-- really the change in
distance, so I'm going to

00:08:25.603 --> 00:08:27.500
write the change in distance,
because that sometimes matters

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.890
when we're dealing with
direction-- change in

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.299
distance, but so you'll
sometimes just

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:34.919
write this as distance.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.970
Then we just did the equation--
I think I did this

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.440
in the third video, as well,
early on-- but we also learned

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:47.870
that distance is equal to the
initial velocity times time

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:53.230
plus at squared over 2.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.230
In that example that I did a
couple of videos ago, where we

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.160
had a cliff-- actually,
I only have a minute

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.890
left in this video.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.880
I will do that in the
next presentation.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.270
I'll see you soon.
