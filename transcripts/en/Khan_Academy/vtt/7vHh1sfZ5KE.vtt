00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.360
Let's make our circle a little
bit more complicated now.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.370
So let's say I have a battery
again, and let me do it in a

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.810
different color just
for variety.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.273
That's the positive terminal,
that's the negative terminal.

00:00:13.273 --> 00:00:18.660
Let's say I have this perfect
conductor, and let's say I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.450
have one resistor and I
have another resistor.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.440
I don't know, just
for fun, let's

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.690
throw in a third resistor.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.310
And we know, of course, that
the convention is that the

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.820
current flows from positive to
negative, that that's the flow

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.390
of the current.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.810
And remember, current is just
the charge that flows per unit

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.800
of time or the speed
of the charge flow.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.610
But we know, of course, that in
reality what is happening,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.580
if there's any such thing as
reality, is that we have a

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.590
bunch of electrons here that,
because of this voltage across

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.020
the battery terminals, these
electrons want to really badly

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.410
get to the positive terminal.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.560
And the higher the voltage, the
more they really want to

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.250
get to this positive terminal.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.770
So what's going to happen
in this circuit?

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.030
Actually, let me label
everything.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.830
So let's call this R1,
let's call this R2,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.530
let's call this R3.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.100
The first thing I want you to
realize is that between

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.550
elements that the voltage
is always constant.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.110
And why is that?

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.440
Well, we assume that this is a
perfect conductor-- let's say

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.650
this little segment
right here, right?

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.100
And so it's a perfect
conductor.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.620
Well, let's look at
it at this end.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.440
So you have all these
electrons.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.060
This is a perfect conductor,
so there's nothing stopping

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.050
these electrons from
just distributing

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.220
themselves over this wire.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.060
Before you encounter an element
in the circuit or

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.550
device or whatever you want to
call that, you can view this

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.070
ideal conducting wire just from
a schematic point of view

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.180
as an extension of the
negative terminal.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.920
And similarly, you can view
this wire right here, this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.380
part of the wire, as
an extension of

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.570
the positive terminal.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.410
And the reason why I want to
say that is because it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.190
actually turns out that it
doesn't matter if you measure

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.520
the voltage here.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.050
So let's say if I take a measure
of the voltage across

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.500
those two terminals using what
we call a voltmeter.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.470
And I'll later do a whole video
on how voltmeters work,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.550
but remember, when we measure
voltage, we have to measure it

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.180
at two points.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.880
And why is that?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.430
Because voltage is a potential
difference.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.790
It's not some kind of
absolute number.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.430
It's a difference between
essentially how bad do

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.510
electrons want to get
from here to here.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.980
So if we measure the voltage
between those two points, it

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.680
would be the exact same thing as
if we measured the voltage

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.810
between these two points.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.530
Theoretically.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.660
As we know, no wires really
have no resistivity.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.360
All wires have a little bit,
but when we draw these

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.840
schematics, we assume that the
wires are perfect conductors

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.000
and all the resistance takes
place in the resistor.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.840
So that's the first thing I want
you to realize, and it

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.780
makes things very-- so, for
example, everywhere along this

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.460
wire, this part of the wire,
the voltage is constant.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.040
Everywhere along this wire,
the voltage is constant.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.965
Let me erase some of this,
because I don't want this to

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:11.215
get too messy.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.830
That's a big important
realization when you later

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.190
become an electrical engineer
and have much

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.375
harder problems to solve.

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:20.625
Let me erase all of this.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.730
Let me erase all of that.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.110
Let me redraw that, because we
can't have that gap there,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.040
because if there was that gap,
current wouldn't flow.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.440
That's actually-- well, I'll
draw later how you can draw a

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.170
switch, but a switch is
essentially a gap.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.330
It looks like a gap in the
circuit that you can open or

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.990
close, right?

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.640
Because if you open it,
no current will flow.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.610
If you close it, current
will flow.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.820
OK, so you now know
that the voltage

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.220
between devices is constant.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.790
The other thing I want to
convince you is that the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.920
current through this entire
circuit is constant, and that

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.910
applies to any circuit
in series.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.990
Now, what do I mean by series?

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.340
Series just means that
everything in the circuit is

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.880
after one another, right?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.470
If we take the convention and
we say current flows in this

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.710
direction, it'll hit this
resistor, then the next

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.100
resistor, then the
next resistor.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.420
At no point does the circuit
branch off and have to choose

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.590
whether I want to go down
path A or path B.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.000
So this circuit is completely
in series, and there's a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.800
couple ways I can convince you
that the current-- let's call

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:24.850
the current here I1.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.730
Let's call this current
here I2.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.150
Let's call this current
here I3.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.215
I could draw another
one here, I3.

00:04:35.215 --> 00:04:37.550
So there's a couple of ways
I can convince you that I1

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.780
equals I2, I3.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.540
One is I could just say if you
experimentally tried it out

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.910
using an ammeter, which measures
current, you would

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.230
see that they are identical.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.460
But the other way to think about
it, and this time I'm

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.230
going to actually talk about the
electrons, so let's talk

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.790
about things going in this
direction, is-- so these

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.070
electrons, through this wire,
they can go as fast as they

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.400
want to go, right?

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.570
The speed of light or close to
the speed of light since they

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.430
have very, very,
very low mass.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.980
And we'll go into relativity
one day.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.220
But once they get to this
resistor, they start bumping

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.560
into things, and
they slow down.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.840
This resistor is a bit of
a bottleneck, right?

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.620
So as fast as they're traveling
here, they have to

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.720
slow down here.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.510
And if they slow down here, they
have to slow down here,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.280
because if they kept going
superfast here and then they

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.660
slowed down here, then they
would start building up here,

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.650
and that just doesn't make
sense, because we know that

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.260
they're evenly spread
out, et cetera.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.330
And similarly, they might exit
this resistor at a certain

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.650
speed and then slow down even
further as they bump into

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.070
resistors here, but if they're
going even slower at this

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.540
point, then there would be
a bottleneck here, so

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.330
essentially, they would have to
go at that rate throughout

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.020
the whole thing.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.890
And another way to think about
it is the resistance is kind

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.090
of a probabilistic thing.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.752
I know when you think on a macro
level, you say, oh, it

00:05:50.752 --> 00:05:51.260
has this resistance.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.490
It just slows it down.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.980
But the longer there's a
resistor, it increases the

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.350
probability that some of the
electrons are going to bump

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.810
into something and create
a little bit of heat,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.240
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.850
So when you put resistors in
series, what you're actually

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.540
doing is increasing the
probability that more

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.700
electrons will bump into
more things, right?

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.910
Say there's an electron that
travels-- say, somehow through

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.455
freak luck, it doesn't bump
into anything as it goes

00:06:17.455 --> 00:06:18.790
through here's because it's
going really fast, but then it

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.900
bumps into something
here, right?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.160
It only increases the
probability that something

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.240
bumps into it.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.200
So there's a bunch of ways you
can think about it, and I

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.880
encourage you to let me
know if there's other

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.840
ways that help you.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.510
But the current through
this entire

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.130
series circuit is constant.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.750
Now if we say that, what
else can we say?

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.240
Well, if the current here--
let's say the current through

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.490
here is I1.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.620
If the current through here is
I1, what is going to be the

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.470
voltage if I measured it
from here to here?

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.060
What is this voltage here?

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.570
I measured it with
a voltmeter.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.465
Well, V1 is going to be
equal to I1 times R1.

00:07:01.465 --> 00:07:03.310
I don't know why I put an R.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.380
That's a 1, not an I.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.790
I1 times R1, right?

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.720
And similarly, if I measured the
voltage from here to here,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.570
that voltage is going to be
equal to I2 times R2.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.080
Let's say this is where I3 is.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:31.320
So the voltage, if I were to
measure it from here to here--

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.560
But anyway, if we look at the
voltage from here to here,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.850
it's going to be I3 times R3.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.930
So what we see is that the
voltage across the entire

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:51.490
circuit, which I can write as
V-total, is going to be equal

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.790
to the potential drops, the
total potential drop across

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.420
each of these devices.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.980
So the way to think about it
is that-- well, let's think

00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.450
about the electrons.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.950
The electrons here, they really
want to get here.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.270
But after they've bumped around
a little bit and they

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.600
get here, they've experienced
some potential drop.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.390
So the electrons here actually
are a little bit less

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.710
eager to get here.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.460
And then once they've gone
through here, maybe they're

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.960
just tired of bumping
around so much.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.480
And once they're here, they're
a little bit less

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.060
eager to get here.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.200
So there's a voltage drop across
each device, right?

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.220
So the total voltage is equal
to the voltage drop across

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.100
each of the devices.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.822
And now let's go back to the
convention, and we'll say that

00:08:31.822 --> 00:08:33.570
the current is going
in that direction.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:41.970
The total voltage drop is equal
to V1 plus V2 plus V3,

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:49.110
so the total voltage drop
is equal to I1 R1 plus

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:55.080
I2 R2 plus I3 R3.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.420
And what's the total
voltage drop?

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.310
Well, that's equal to the total
current through the

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.330
whole system.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:06.660
I-total, or we just call it I,
times the total resistance is

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:15.540
equal to I1 R1, plus
I2 R2 plus I3 R3.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.140
Well, we know that all
the I's are the same.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.120
Hopefully, you can take it as,
just conceptually it makes

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.120
sense to you that the current
through the entire circuit

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.170
will be the same.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.970
So all these I's are
the same, so we can

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.520
just cancel them out.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.680
Divide both sides by that I.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:34.230
We assume it's non-zero, so I,
I, I, I, and then we have that

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.200
the total resistance of the
circuit is equal to R1

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.600
plus R2 plus R3.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.590
So when you have resistors in
series like this, the total

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.420
resistance, their combined
resistance, is just

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.840
equal to their sum.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.030
And that was just a very
long-winded way of explaining

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.600
something very simple, and
I'll do an example.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.580
Let's say that this voltage
is-- I don't know.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.650
Let's say it's 20 volts.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:07.760
Let's say resistor 1 is 2 ohms.
Let's say resistor 2 is

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:16.930
3 ohms, and let's say resistor
3 is 5 ohms. So what is the

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.670
total resistance through
this circuit?

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.130
Well, the total resistance is
2 ohms plus 3 ohms plus 5

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.580
ohms, so it's equal to 10 ohms.
So total resistance is

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.370
equal to 10 ohms.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.440
So if I were to ask you what is
the current going through

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.550
this circuit?

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.980
Well, the total resistance is
10 ohms. We know Ohm's law:

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.180
voltage is equal to current
times resistance.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.740
The voltage is just
equal to 20.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.700
20 is equal to the current
times 10 ohms, right?

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.380
We just added the resistances.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.730
Divide both sides by 10.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:53.410
You get the current is
equal to 2 amps or 2

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.510
coulombs per second.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.710
So what seemed like a very
long-winded explanation

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.510
actually results in something
that's very, very,

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.070
very easy to apply.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.100
When resistors are in series,
we just add them up.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.350
I will see you in
the next video.
