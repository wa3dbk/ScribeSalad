00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.320
What I want to do in this video is prove to ourselves

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.989
that vertical angles really are equal to each other,

00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:09.218
their measures are really equal to each other.

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:14.234
So let's have a line here and let's say that I have another line over there,

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:19.389
and let's call this point A, let's call this point B, point C,

00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:23.568
let's call this D, and let's call this right over there E.

00:00:23.568 --> 00:00:26.494
And so I'm just going to pick an arbitrary angle over here,

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:31.231
let's say angle CB --what is this, this looks like an F--

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.132
angle CBE. What I want to do is if I can prove that angle

00:00:35.132 --> 00:00:39.126
CBE is always going to be equal to its vertical angle

00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:42.655
--so, angle DBA-- then I'd prove that vertical angles

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:45.395
are always going to be equal, because this is just a generalilzable

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:47.299
case right over here.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:56.076
So what I want to prove here is angle CBE is equal to, I could say

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:58.909
the measure of angle CBE --you will see it in different ways--

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.395
actually this time let me write it without measure

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:02.485
so that you get used to the different notations.

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:07.349
I will just say prove angle CBE is equal to angle DBA.

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:12.455
Is equal to angle DBA.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:15.627
So the first thing we know...the first thing we know

00:01:15.627 --> 00:01:17.392
so what do we know?

00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:24.600
We know that angle CBE, and we know that angle DBC are supplementary

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.000
they are adjacent angles and their outer sides, both angles,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.867
form a straight angle over here.

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:37.533
So we know that angle CBE and angle --so this is CBE--

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:45.133
and angle DBC are supplementary. I will just write "sup" for that.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.754
They are supplementary.

00:01:46.754 --> 00:01:53.375
Which means that angle CBE plus angle DBC

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:57.152
is equal to 180 degrees. Fair enough.

00:01:57.182 --> 00:02:01.298
We also know --so let me see this is CBE, this is what we care about

00:02:01.298 --> 00:02:03.800
and we want to prove that this is equal to that--

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.733
we also know that angle DBA

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.000
--we know that this is DBA right over here--

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.933
we also know that angle DBA and angle DBC are supplementary

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:22.867
this angle and this angle are supplementary,

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:26.333
their outer sides form a straight angle, they are adjacent

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.133
so they are supplementary

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:33.733
which tells us that angle DBA, this angle right over here,

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:39.000
plus angle DBC, this angle over here, is going to be

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.467
equal to 180 degrees.

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:47.800
Now, from this top one, this top statement over here,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.133
we can subtract angle DBC from both sides

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:59.933
and we get angle CBE is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.067
that's this information right over here, I just put

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:04.000
the angle DBC on the right side

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.200
or subtracted it from both sides of the equation

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.333
and this right over here, if I do the exact same thing,

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:14.400
subtract angle DBC from both sides of the equation,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.467
I get angle DBA is equal to 180 degrees

00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:21.133
--let me scroll over to the right a little bit--

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:26.400
is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.200
So clearly, angle CBE is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.000
angle DBA is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.800
so they are equal to each other!

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.200
They are both equal to the same thing

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.800
so we get, which is what we wanted to get,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.067
angle CBE is equal to angle DBA.

00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:53.667
Angle CBE, which is this angle right over here,

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:56.267
is equal to angle DBA

00:03:56.267 --> 00:03:58.867
and sometimes you might see that shown like this;

00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:01.533
so angle CBE, that's its measure, and you would say that

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.733
this measure right over here is the exact same amount.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:06.087
And we have other vertical angles

00:04:06.087 --> 00:04:08.754
whatever this measure is, and sometimes you will

00:04:08.754 --> 00:04:10.733
see it with a double line like that,

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:12.267
that you can say that THAT is going to be the same

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:15.133
as whatever this angle right over here is.

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:17.667
You will see it written like that sometimes, I like to use colors

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:20.200
but not all books have the luxury of colors,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.933
or sometimes you will even see it written like this

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:23.733
to show that they are the same angle;

00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:25.333
this angle and this angle

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:26.333
--to show that these are different--

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:29.667
sometimes they will say that they are the same in this way.

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:33.498
This angle is equal to this vertical angle, is equal to its vertical

00:04:33.498 --> 00:04:34.785
angle right over here

00:04:34.785 --> 00:04:37.400
and that this angle is equal to this angle that is opposite

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.800
the intersection right over here.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.333
What we have proved is the general case

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:44.133
because all I did here is I just did two general intersecting lines

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:47.800
I picked a random angle, and then I proved that it is equal

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.452
to the angle that is vertical to it.
