00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.385
Let's say I have
some matrix A.

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:05.500
Let's say it's an n-by-k
matrix, and I have the

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.450
equation Ax is equal to b.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.540
So in this case, x would have to
be a member of Rk, because

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.960
we have k columns here, and
b is a member of Rn.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.680
Now, let's say that it just so
happens that there is no

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:35.460
solution to Ax is equal to b.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.100
What does that mean?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.730
Let's just expand out A.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.200
I think you already know
what that means.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.210
If I write a like this, a1, a2,
if I just write it as its

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.250
columns vectors right there,
all the way through ak, and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.750
then I multiply it times x1,
x2, all the way through xk,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.690
this is the same thing as
that equation there.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.760
I just kind of wrote out
the two matrices.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.650
Now, this is the same thing as
x1 times a1 plus x2 times a2,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.870
all the way to plus xk times ak
is equal to the vector b.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.330
Now, if this has no solution,
then that means that there's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.430
no set of weights here on the
column vectors of a, where we

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.060
can get to b.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.560
Or another way to say it is, no
linear combinations of the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.500
column vectors of a will
be equal to b.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:39.290
Or an even further way of saying
it is that b is not in

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.880
the column space of a.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.720
No linear combination of these
guys can equal to that.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.000
So let's see if we can
visualize it a bit.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.370
So let me draw the column
space of a.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.460
So maybe the column space of
a looks something like this

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.360
right here.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.392
I'll just assume it's
a plane in Rn.

00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:02.300
It doesn't have to be a plane.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.340
Things can be very general, but
let's say that this is the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.615
column space.

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:09.560
This is the column space of a.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.300
Now, if that's the column space
and b is not in the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.800
column space, maybe we
can draw b like this.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.180
Maybe b, let's say this is the
origin right there, and b just

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.250
pops out right there.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.560
So this is the 0 vector.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.990
This is my vector b, clearly
not in my column spaces,

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.070
clearly not in this plane.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.540
Now, up until now, we would
get an equation like that.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.900
We would make an augmented
matrix, put in reduced row

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.990
echelon form, and get a line
that said 0 equals 1, and we'd

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.430
say, no solution, nothing
we can do here.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.870
But what if we can do better?

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.885
You know, we clearly can't
find a solution to this.

00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:43.610
But what if we can find
a solution that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.570
gets us close to this?

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.030
So what if I want to find some
x, I'll call it x-star for

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.090
now, where-- so I want to find
some x-star, where A times

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:07.340
x-star is-- and this is
a vector-- as close as

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:16.560
possible-- let me write this--
as close to b as possible.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.450
Or another way to view it, when
I say close, I'm talking

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.830
about length, so I want to
minimize the length of-- let

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.670
me write this down.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:38.260
I want to minimize the length
of b minus A times x-star.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.990
Now, some of you all
might already know

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.840
where this is going.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.130
But when you take the difference
between 2 and then

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.250
take its length, what
does that look like?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.172
Let me just call Ax.

00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:55.820
Ax is going to be a member
of my column space.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.415
Let me just call that v.

00:03:57.415 --> 00:04:00.610
Ax is equal to v.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.660
You multiply any vector in Rk
times your matrix A, you're

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.040
going to get a member of
your column space.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.019
So any Ax is going to be
in your column space.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.850
And maybe that is the vector v
is equal to A times x-star.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.860
And we want this vector to get
as close as possible to this

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.890
as long as it stays--
I mean, it has to be

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.160
in my column space.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.020
But we want the distance between
this vector and this

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.040
vector to be minimized.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.470
Now, I just want to show you
where the terminology for this

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.370
will come from.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.510
I haven't given it its
proper title yet.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.840
If you were to take this
vector-- let just call this

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.980
vector v for simplicity-- that
this is equivalent to the

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.240
length of the vector.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.350
You take the difference between
each of the elements.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:02.980
So b1 minus v1, b2 minus v2,
all the way to bn minus vn.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.650
And if you take the length of
this vector, this is the same

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.150
thing as this.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.100
This is going to be equal
to the square root.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.600
Let me take the length
squared, actually.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.690
The length squared of this is
just going to be b1 minus v1

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:21.900
squared plus b2 minus v2 squared
plus all the way to bn

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.870
minus vn squared.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.500
And I want to minimize this.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.180
So I want to make this value the
least value that it can be

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.990
possible, or I want to get the
least squares estimate here.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.550
And that's why, this last minute
or two when I was just

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.720
explaining this, that was just
to give you the motivation for

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:52.810
why this right here is called
the least squares estimate, or

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.180
the least squares solution,
or the least squares

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.160
approximation for the equation
Ax equals b.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.200
There is no solution to this,
but maybe we can find some

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.140
x-star, where if I multiply A
times x-star, this is clearly

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.900
going to be in my column space
and I want to get this vector

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.010
to be as close to
b as possible.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.180
Now, we've already seen in
several videos, what is the

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.090
closest vector in any
subspace to a vector

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.200
that's not in my subspace?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.940
Well, the closest vector to
it is the projection.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.120
The closest vector to b, that's
in my subspace, is

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.540
going to be the projection of
b onto my column space.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.940
That is the closest
vector there.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:47.530
So if I want to minimize this,
I want to figure out my

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:57.380
x-star, where Ax-star is equal
to the projection of my vector

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.460
b onto my subspace or onto
the column space of A.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.780
Remember what we're
doing here.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.010
We said Axb has no solution, but
maybe we can find some x

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.310
that gets us as close
as possible.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.920
So I'm calling that my least
squares solution or my least

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.940
squares approximation.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.340
And this guy right here is
clearly going to be in my

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.210
column space, because you take
some vector x times A, that's

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.520
going to be a linear combination
of these column

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.420
vectors, so it's going to
be in the column space.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.880
And I want this guy to be as
close as possible to this guy.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.900
Well, the closest vector in my
column space to that guy is

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.720
the projection.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.840
So Ax needs to be equal
to the projection of b

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.440
on my column space.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.890
It needs to be equal to that.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.090
But this is still pretty
hard to find.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.620
You saw how, you know, you took
A times the inverse of A

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.160
transpose A times A transpose.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.990
That's hard to find that
transformation matrix.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.110
So let's see if we can find an
easier way to figure out the

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.870
least squares solution, or kind
of our best solution.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.470
It's not THE solution.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.900
It's our BEST solution
to this right here.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.290
That's why we call it the least
squares solution or

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.070
approximation.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.130
Let's just subtract b from
both sides of this and we

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.230
might get something
interesting.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:24.390
So what happens if we take Ax
minus the vector b on both

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.360
sides of this equation?

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.690
I'll do it up here
on the right.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.925
On the left-hand side we
get A times x-star.

00:08:30.925 --> 00:08:32.720
It's hard write the x and
then the star because

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.970
they're very similar.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.460
And we subtract b from it.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.610
We subtract our vector b.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:46.020
That's going to be equal to the
projection of b onto our

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.980
column space minus b.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.210
All I did is I subtracted
b from both

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.800
sides of this equation.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.585
Now, what is the projection
of b minus our vector b?

00:08:58.585 --> 00:09:01.490
If we draw it right here, it's
going to be this vector

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.480
right-- let me do it in
this orange color.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.860
It's going to be this
right here.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.410
It's going to be that vector
right there, right?

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.910
If I take the projection of b,
which is that, minus b, I'm

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.490
going to get this vector. you
we could say b plus this

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.350
vector is equal to
my projection

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.490
of b onto my subspace.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.880
So this vector right
here is orthogonal.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.580
It's actually part of the
definition of a projection

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:34.460
that this guy is going to be
orthogonal to my subspace or

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.360
to my column space.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.390
And so this guy is orthogonal
to my column space.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:47.930
So I can write Ax-star minus
b, it's orthogonal to my

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.260
column space, or we could
say it's a member of the

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.070
orthogonal complement
of my column space.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:00.660
The orthogonal complement is
just the set of everything,

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.240
all of the vectors that are
orthogonal to everything in

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.050
your subspace, in your column
space right here.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.990
So this vector right here
that's kind of pointing

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.280
straight down onto my plane
is clearly a member of the

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.210
orthogonal complement
of my column space.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.730
Now, this might look familiar
to you already.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.670
What is the orthogonal
complement of my column space?

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.320
The orthogonal complement of
my column space is equal to

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:31.920
the null space of a transpose,
or the left null space of A.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.330
We've done this in many,
many videos.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:40.240
So we can say that A times my
least squares estimate of the

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.860
equation Ax is equal to
b-- I wrote that.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:49.010
So x-star is my least squares
solution to Ax is equal to b.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:55.010
So A times that minus
b is a member of the

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.770
null space of A transpose.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.370
Now, what does that mean?

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:05.020
Well, that means that if I
multiply A transpose times

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:12.470
this guy right here, times
Ax-star-- and let me, no I

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.740
don't want to lose the vector
signs there on the x.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.880
This is a vector.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.420
I don't want to forget that.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.710
Ax-star minus b.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.210
So if I multiply A transpose
times this right there, that

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.630
is the same thing is that,
what am I going to get?

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.400
Well, this is a member of the
null space of A transpose, so

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.400
this times A transpose has
got to be equal to 0.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.350
It is a solution to A transpose
times something is

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:40.120
equal to the 0 vector.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.440
Now.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.770
Let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:57.750
We get A transpose A times
x-star minus A transpose b is

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:02.900
equal to 0, and then if we add
this term to both sides of the

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:11.180
equation, we are left with A
transpose A times the least

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:17.230
squares solution to Ax
equal to b is equal

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:23.050
to A transpose b.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.500
That's what we get.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.220
Now, why did we do
all of this work?

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.050
Remember what we started with.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:34.180
We said we're trying to find a
solution to Ax is equal to b,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.430
but there was no solution.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:46.080
So we said, well, let's find
at least an x-star that

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:53.360
minimizes b, that minimizes
the distance

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.000
between b and Ax-star.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.680
And we call this the least
squares solution.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.730
We call it the least squares
solution because, when you

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.320
actually take the length, or
when you're minimizing the

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.200
length, you're minimizing the
squares of the differences

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.890
right there.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.240
So it's the least squares
solution.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.310
Now, to find this, we know
that this has to be the

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.710
closest vector in our
subspace to b.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.840
And we know that the closest
vector in our subspace to b is

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:25.040
the projection of b onto our
subspace, onto our column

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.720
space of A.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.550
And so, we know that A--
let me switch colors.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:37.070
We know that A times our least
squares solution should be

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:45.250
equal to the projection of b
onto the column space of A.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.030
If we can find some x in Rk that
satisfies this, that is

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.665
our least squares solution.

00:13:50.665 --> 00:13:53.820
But we've seen before that
the projection b is

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.090
easier said than done.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.660
You know, there's a
lot of work to it.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.390
So maybe we can do
it a simpler way.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.020
And this is our simpler way.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.270
If we're looking for this,
alternately, we can just find

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.710
a solution to this equation.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.270
So you give me an Ax equal to
b, there is no solution.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.070
Well, what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to multiply

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.230
both sides of this equation
times A transpose.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.440
If I multiply both sides of this
equation by A transpose,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:27.070
I get A transpose times Ax is
equal to A transpose-- and I

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.790
want to do that in the same
blue-- A-- no, that's not the

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:37.340
same blue-- A transpose b.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.330
All I did is I multiplied
both sides of this.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:45.470
Now, the solution to this
equation will not be the same

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.750
as the solution to
this equation.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.380
This right here will always
have a solution, and this

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:56.190
right here is our least
squares solution.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.880
So this right here is our
least squares solution.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.630
And notice, this is some matrix,
and then this right

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.760
here is some vector.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.410
This right here is
some vector.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.220
So long as we can find a
solution here, we've given our

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.450
best shot at finding a solution
to Ax equal to b.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.990
We've minimized the error.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.440
We're going to get Ax-star,
and the difference between

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.420
Ax-star and b is going
to be minimized.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.590
It's going to be our least
squares solution.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.870
It's all a little bit abstract
right now in this video, but

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.780
hopefully, in the next video,
we'll realize that it's

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.690
actually a very, very
useful concept.
