00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.680
So I have got this block of wood here that has a mass of 5 kilograms

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.830
and it is sitting on some dirt and we are near the surface of the earth

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:16.720
and the coefficient of static friction between this type of wood and this type of dirt is 0.60

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.030
and the coefficient of kinetic friction between this type of wood and this type of dirt is 0.55

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.630
This was measured by someone else long ago

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.060
or you found it in some type of a book someplace

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.300
And let's say we push on this side of the block with a force of a 100 N

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.440
What is going to happen?

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.250
So the first thing you might realize is if there is no friction

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.310
if this was a completely frictionless boundary and there is

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.640
no air resistance, we are assuming that there is no air resistance in this example

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.320
That in this dimension, in the horizontal dimension

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.220
there would only be one force here, this 100 N force

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.810
It would be completely unbalanced and that would be the net force

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.350
and so you would have a force going in that direction of a 100 N on a mass of 5 kilograms

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.540
Force = Mass times acceleration

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.580
acceleration and force are vector quantities

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.110
So you would have the force divided by the mass

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.640
would give you 20 meters per second of acceleration in the rightward direction

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.950
That is if there were no friction

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.040
but there is friction in this situation

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.160
So let's think about how we'll deal with it

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.950
So the coefficient of friction tells us

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.740
So this right here is the ratio between the magnitude of the force

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.460
that I have called the budging force

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.820
The amount of force you need to apply to get this thing to budge

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.670
to get this thing to start moving. So we can start using the coefficient of kinetic friction

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.200
It's the ratio between that and the magnitude of the force of contact

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.100
between this block and the floor or ground here

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.040
And the magnitude of that force of contact is the same thing

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.410
as the normal force that the ground is applying on the block

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.810
the magnitude of the normal force the ground is applying on the block

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.150
Then once its moving

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.650
then we can say that this is going to be--this will then be equal to

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.710
this over here will be equal to the force of friction

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.140
So this is the force that really overcome friction

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.360
and this over here will be equal to the force of friction

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.280
The magnitude of the force of friction over the force of contact

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.720
the contact force between those two, so over the normal force

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.140
and it makes sense

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.030
that the larger the contact force

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.050
the more that these are being pressed together

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.210
the little at the atomic level, they kind of really get into each others grooves

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.430
the more budging force you would need

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.620
or the more friction force would go against your motion

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.650
And in either situation

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.920
the force of friction is going against your motion

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.320
So even if you push it in that way

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.420
sounds like force of friction is all of a sudden going to help you

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.160
So let's think about what the necessary force will we need

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.500
to overcome the force of friction right here in the static situation

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.960
So the force of gravity on this block

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.760
is going to be the gravitational field which is 9.8 m/s^2 times 5 kilograms

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.550
9.8 m/s times 5 kilograms gives 49 kilogram meters per second or 49 newtons down

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.390
This is the force, the magnitude of the force due to gravity

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.540
the direction is straight down towards the center of the earth

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.140
The normal force, and that force is there because this block is not accelerating downwards

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.390
So there must be some force that completely balances off the force of gravity

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.030
And in this example, it is the normal force

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.100
So it is acting 49 newtons upward

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.060
and so these net out. And that's why this block does not accelerate upwards or downwards

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.970
So what we have is the budge the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.050
magnitude of the budging force, needs to be equal to, over the magnitude of the normal force

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.620
well this thing right over here is going to be 49 newtons

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.810
Is equal to 0.60

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.370
Or we could say that the magnitude of the budging force

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.700
is equal to 49 newtons times the coefficient of static fiction

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:06.710
Or that's 49 newtons times 0.60

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.910
And remember coefficient of friction are unitless

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.040
So the units here are still going to be in newtons

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:22.580
So this 49 times .6 gives us 29.4 newtons

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:30.550
This is equal to 29.4 newtons

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.520
So that's the force that's started to overcome static friction

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.790
which we are applying more than enough of

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.920
so with a 100 newtons, we would just start to budge it

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.100
and right when we are in just in that moment

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.190
where that thing is just starting to move

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.580
the net force--

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.670
so we have a 100 newtons going in that direction

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.090
and the force of static friction is going to go in this direction--

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.580
maybe I could draw it down here to show it's coming from right over here

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.970
The force of static friction is going to be 29.4 newtons that way

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.650
and so right when I am just starting to budge this

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.030
just when that little movement--

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.930
because once I do that, then all of a sudden it's moving

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.180
and then kinetic friction starts to matter, but just for that moment

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.930
just for that moment I'll have a net force of 100 - 29.4

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:28.660
to the right, so I have a net force of 70.6 N

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.820
for just a moment while I budge it

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.250
So just exactly while I'm budging it

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.380
While we're overcoming the static friction, we have a 70.6 N net force in the right direction

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.980
And so just for that moment, you divide it by 5 kg mass

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.430
So just for that moment, it will be accelerating at 14.12 m/s^2

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:00.280
So you'll have an acceleration of 14.1 m/s^2 to the right

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.250
but that will just be for that absolute moment, because once I budge it

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.420
all of a sudden the block will start to be moving

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.880
And once it's moving, the coefficient of kinetic friction starts to matter

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.880
We've got the things out of their little grooves

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.160
and so they're kind of gliding past each other on the top, although there still is resistant

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.550
So once we budge it, we'll have that acceleration for just a moment

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.550
Now all of a sudden, the coefficient of kinetic friction comes to play

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.080
And the force of friction, assuming we're moving

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.120
the magnitude of the force of friction will always go against our movement

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.460
is going to be--remember, our normal force is 49 N

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.850
So we can multiply both sides of this times 49

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:57.780
We get 49 N times 0.55 which is equal to 26.95 N

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.400
This is the force of friction; this is the magnitude

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.400
and it's going to go against our motions

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.690
So as soon as we start to move in that direction, the force of friction

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.480
is going to be going in that direction

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.050
So once we start moving, assuming that I'm continuing to apply this 100 newtons of force

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.280
what is the net force? So I have 100 N going that way

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.180
and I have 26.95 going that way

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.080
Remember, with vectors, I don't have to draw them here

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.890
I can draw all of their tails start at the center of mass of the

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.810
object. I can draw them whatever, but remember this is acting on the object

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.140
If we want to be precise, we can show it on the center of mass because

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.940
we can view all of these atoms as one collective object

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.150
But anyway, what is the net force now?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.420
We have 100 N to the right; we have 26.95 to the left

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.750
100 minus 26.95

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.600
100 N that I'm applying to the right

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.260
- 26.95 N which is the force of friction to the left always acting against us

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.410
means that there's a net force to the right of 73.05

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:10.840
So once we're moving, we have a net force to the right of 73.05 N

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:18.070
This is the net force and it's acting to the right

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.850
Right after we budge it, how quickly will this accelerate?

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:32.700
Well, 73.05 divided by the mass, divided by 5 kg, gives us 14.61

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:40.430
So the acceleration once we're moving is going to be 14.61 m/s squared

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.450
to the right

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.190
So I really want to make sure you understand what's happening here

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.270
We always have enough force to start budging it

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.510
but right when we budged it

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.430
we overcome the static friction for just a moment

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.810
our acceleration was slower

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.900
because we're overcoming that static friction

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.900
but once we budged it and once it's moving

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.600
and assuming that we're continuing to apply a constant force over here

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.480
then all of a sudden, the force of friction since

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.400
we're kind of bump it along the top now and not stuck in their grooves

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.570
we're now using the coefficient of kinetic friction

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:22.780
And so once it's moving, the net force becomes greater in the rightward direction because

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.590
you can kind of view that force of friction will become less once it starts moving

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.820
And so now the force of friction went down a little bit to 26.95 N

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:38.630
And so now we're accelerating to right at a slightly faster rate 14.61 m/s^2

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.860
So right when you budge it, it accelerates at 14.1 m/s^2

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.870
but just for a moment, almost unnoticeable moment once it starts moving

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.780
Then you're going to be going to the right with this constant acceleration
