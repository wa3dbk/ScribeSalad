00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.860
Let's see if we can apply some
of our new tools to solve

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.880
some line integrals.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.990
So let's say we have a line
integral along a closed curve

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.690
-- I'm going to define the path
in a second -- of x squared

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:24.240
plus y squared times
dx plus 2xy times dy.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.230
And then our curve c is
going to be defined by

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.726
the parameterization.

00:00:31.726 --> 00:00:39.820
x is equal to cosine of t,
and y is equal to sine of t.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.940
And this is valid for
t between 0 and 2 pi.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.110
So this is essentially a
circle, a unit circle,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.440
in the xy plane, and we
know how to solve these.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.610
Let's see if we can use some of
our discoveries in the last

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.180
couple of videos to maybe
simplify this process.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.310
So the first thing you might
say, hey, this looks like a

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.850
line integral, but you have a
dx and dy, I don't

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.850
see a dot dr here.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.850
It's not clear to me that
this is some type of even

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.870
a vector line integral.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.400
I don't see any of vectors.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370
What I want to do first, and
the reason why I wanted to show

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.150
you this example, is just to
show you that this is just

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.980
another form of writing really
a vector line integral.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.160
To show you that you just have
to realize if I have some are

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.900
r of t -- this is our curve.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.476
I don't even write these
functions in there.

00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:33.660
I'm just going to write
it's x of t times i

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.660
plus y of t times j.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.160
We've seen several videos now
that we can write dr dt as

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.910
being equal to dx dt times
i plus dy dt times j.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.960
We've seen this multiple times.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.600
And we've seen multiple times
we want to get the differential

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.210
dr, we can just multiply
everything times dt.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.560
And normally I just put a
dt here and a dt there

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.440
and get rid of this dt.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.940
But if you multiply everything
times dt, if you view the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.740
differentials as actual
numbers, you can multiply and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.840
normally you can treat
them like that.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.780
Then you just get rid
of all of the dt's.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.020
So dr you could imagine is
equal to dx times the unit

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.200
vector i plus dy times
the unit vector j.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.020
So put that aside, and
you might already

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.160
see a pattern here.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.650
So if we define our vector
field f, f of xy, as being

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:43.500
equal to x squared plus y
squared, i plus 2xy j,

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.720
what is this thing?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.600
What is this thing over here?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.920
Well, what is f dot
dr going to be?

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.090
Dot products, you just multiply
the corresponding components

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.710
of our vectors and
then add them up.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.620
So it's going to be if you take
this f and dot it with that dr

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.790
you're going to get the i
component, x squared plus y

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.480
squared times that dx plus --
I'll do it in the pink again --

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.150
plus the y component, the j
component 2xy times that dy.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.590
That's the dot product.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.760
And notice, this thing
right here is identical to

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.270
that thing right there.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.310
So our line integral, just to
put it in a form that we're

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.880
familiar with, this is the same
exact thing as the line

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.483
integral over this curve c,
this closed curve c, of this f

00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:51.820
-- maybe I'll write it in that
magenta color, or actually it's

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.990
more of a purple or pink
color -- f dot this dr.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.050
That's what this line integral
is, it's just a different

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.840
way of writing it.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.330
Now that you see it, in the
future if you see in kind of

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.850
this differential form, you'll
immediately know OK, there's

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.430
one vector field that this is
its x component, this is its y

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.860
component, dotting with the dr.
This is the x component of dr

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.810
or the i component, and this is
the y component or the j

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.570
component of the dr. So you
immediately know what the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.010
vector field is that we're
taking a line integral of.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.210
This is the x, that's the y.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.850
Now, let's ask
ourselves a question.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.070
Is f conservative?

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:40.660
So is f equal to the gradient
of some scalar field, we'll

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.480
call it capital F --
is this the case?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.860
So let's assume it is and see
if we can solve for a scalar

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.010
field whose grade
it really is f.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.770
Then we know that f
is conservative.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.470
And then if f is conservative,
and this is the whole reason we

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.380
want to do it, that means that
any closed loop, any line

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.090
integral over a closed curve of
f is going to be equal

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.560
to 0 and we'd be done.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.060
So if we can show this then the
answer to this question or this

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.480
question is going to be 0.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.180
We don't even have to mess with
the cosine of t's and the

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.440
sign of t's and all that.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.620
Actually, we don't even have
to take antiderivatives.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.380
So let's see if we can find
an f whose gradient is

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.740
equal to that right there.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.200
So in order for f's gradient to
be that, that means that the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.410
partial derivative of our
capital F with respect to x has

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.140
got to be equal to
that right there.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.820
It's got to be equal to x
squared plus y squared.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.410
And it also tells us that the
partial derivative of capital

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:52.175
F with respect to y has
got to be equal to 2xy.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.020
And just as a review, if I have
the gradient of any function,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.215
of any scalar field is equal to
the partial of f with respect

00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:07.460
to x times i plus the
partial of capital F with

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.850
respect to y times j.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.350
So that's why I'm just
pattern matching.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.060
I'm just saying well, gee, if
this is the gradient of that,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.780
then this must be that, which I
wrote down right here, and this

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.090
must be that, which
I wrote down here.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.310
So let's see if I can find
an f that satisfies both

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.390
of these constraints.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.255
So we could just take the
antiderivative with respect to

00:06:33.255 --> 00:06:39.230
x on both sides -- remember,
you just treat y like a

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.440
constant or y squared like a
constant -- it's just a number.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.220
So then we could say that f is
equal to the antiderivative of

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.840
x squared is x to
the third over 3.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.335
And then the antiderivative
of y squared -- remember,

00:06:56.335 --> 00:06:57.980
this is with respect to x.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.000
So you just treat
it like a number.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.930
That could just be the
number k, or this

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.890
could be the number 5.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.820
So this is just going
to be that times x.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.640
So plus x times y squared.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.500
And then there could be
some function of y here.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.050
So plus some, I don't know,
I'll call it g of y.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.210
Because there could have been
some function of y here.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.700
If it's a pure function of y,
when you take the derivative or

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.270
the partial with respect to x,
this would have disappeared.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.790
So it would reappear when we
take the antiderivative.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:35.150
And just to be clear, let me
make it clear that f is going

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.280
to be a function of x and y.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.415
So we just have the, I
guess you could say

00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:40.830
the antiderivative
with respect to x.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.110
Let's see if we take the
antiderivative with respect

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.930
to y and then we can
reconcile the two.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:51.260
So based on this, f of xy, f of
xy is going to have to look

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.280
like -- so let's take the
antiderivative with

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.035
respect to y here.

00:07:55.035 --> 00:07:57.540
So remember, you just treat x
like it's just some number --

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.210
it could be a k, it could
be an m, it could be a 5.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.610
It's just some number.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.260
So if x is just some
-- the antiderivative

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.960
of 2y is y squared.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.230
And if x is just a number
there, the antiderivative of

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:11.820
this with respect to y is
just going to be xy squared.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.590
Don't believe me?

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.720
Take the partial of this
with respect to y.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.590
Treat x like a constant
you'll get 2 times xy

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.150
with no exponent there.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.660
And, of course, if you took the
antiderivative with respect to

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.580
x, there might be some
function of x here.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.130
We were just basing it
off of that information.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.850
Now given that, this
information says f of xy

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.480
is going to have to look
something like this.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.940
This information tells us f
of xy's going to have to

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.320
look something like that.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.430
Let's see if there is an
f of xy that looks like

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.470
both of them essentially.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.780
So let's see.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.740
On this one we have xy
squared here, we have

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.990
an xy squared there.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.940
So good.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.110
That looks good.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.770
And it over here we have an f
of x -- we have something

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.450
that's a pure function of x.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.550
And here we have something
that is a pure function of x.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.990
So these two things could
be the same thing.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.170
Then here we have a pure
function of y that might be

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.630
there, but it didn't really
show up anywhere over here.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.610
So we could just say hey,
that's going to be 0.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.460
0 is a pure function of y.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.870
You could have something
called g of y is equal to 0.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:24.230
And then we get that capital F
of xy is equal to x to the

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:30.020
third over 3 plus xy squared.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.980
And the gradient of this is
going to be equal to f.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.230
And we've already
established that.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.810
But just to hit the point home,
let's take the gradient of it.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.540
Just if you don't believe this
little stuff that I did right

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.790
there, let's take the gradient.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.280
The gradient of f is equal to,
and sometimes people put a

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.450
little vector there
because you're getting

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.460
a vector out of it.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.290
You could put a little vector
on top of that gradient sign.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.760
The gradient of f is
going to be what?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.625
The partial of this with
respect to x times i.

00:09:57.625 --> 00:09:59.320
So the partial of this
with respect to x.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.500
The derivative here is
3 divided by 3 is 1.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.590
So it's just x squared plus the
derivative of this with respect

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:15.370
to x is y squared times i plus
the partial with respect to y.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.986
Well, the partial with respect
to y of this 0, partial with

00:10:17.986 --> 00:10:22.340
respect to y of this is
2xy or 2xy to the first.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.890
So it's 2xy times j.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:31.180
And this is exactly equal to f,
our f that we wrote up there.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:36.470
So we've established that f can
definitely be written -- f is

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.790
definitely the gradient of some
potential scalar

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.750
function there.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:49.390
So f is conservative, and that
tells us that this closed loop

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.530
integral, line integral, of f
is going to be equal to 0.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.220
And we are done.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.890
We could even ignore the actual
parameterization of the path.
