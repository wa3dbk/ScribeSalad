00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.280
A card game using 36 unique
cards, four suits, diamonds,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.880
hearts, clubs and spades-- this
should be spades, not

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.730
spaces-- with cards numbered
from 1 to 9 in each suit.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.190
A hand is chosen.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.910
A hand is a collection of 9
cards, which can be sorted

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.410
however the player chooses.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.260
Fair enough.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.590
How many 9 card hands
are possible?

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.300
So let's think about it.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.080
There are 36 unique cards-- and
I won't worry about, you

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.990
know, there's nine numbers in
each suit, and there are four

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.020
suits, 4 times 9 is 36.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.420
But let's just think of the
cards as being 1 through 36,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.330
and we're going to pick
nine of them.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.960
So at first we'll say, well
look, I have nine slots in my

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.000
hand, right?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.460
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.720
Right?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.430
I'm going to pick nine
cards for my hand.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.930
And so for the very first card,
how many possible cards

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.130
can I pick from?

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.769
Well, there's 36 unique cards,
so for that first slot,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.760
there's 36.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.680
But then that's now
part of my hand.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.710
Now for the second slot,
how many will there be

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.980
left to pick from?

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.390
Well, I've already picked
one, so there will only

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.980
be 35 to pick from.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.010
And then for the third
slot, 34, and then

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.800
it just keeps going.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.700
Then 33 to pick from, 32,
31, 30, 29, and 28.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.800
So you might want to say that
there are 36 times 35, times

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.950
34, times 33, times 32, times
31, times 30, times 29, times

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.020
28 possible hands.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.660
Now, this would be true
if order mattered.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.010
This would be true if
I have card 15 here.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.360
Maybe I have a-- let me put it
here-- maybe I have a 9 of

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.040
spades here, and then I
have a bunch of cards.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.870
And maybe I have-- and
that's one hand.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.800
And then I have another.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.070
So then I have cards one,
two, three, four,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.230
five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.350
I have eight other cards.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.500
Or maybe another hand is I have
the eight cards, 1, 2, 3,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.370
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and then I
have the 9 of spades.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.440
If we were thinking of these
as two different hands,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.670
because we have the exact same
cards, but they're in

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.390
different order, then what I
just calculated would make a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.850
lot of sense, because we
did it based on order.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.070
But they're telling us that
the cards can be sorted

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.220
however the player chooses,
so order doesn't matter.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.900
So we're overcounting.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.270
We're counting all of the
different ways that the same

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.810
number of cards can
be arranged.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.500
So in order to not overcount, we
have to divide this by the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.150
ways in which nine cards
can be rearranged.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.350
So we have to divide this by
the way nine cards can be

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.160
rearranged.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.330
So how many ways can nine
cards be rearranged?

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.520
If I have nine cards and I'm
going to pick one of nine to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.150
be in the first slot, well, that
means I have 9 ways to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.690
put something in
the first slot.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.050
Then in the second slot, I have
8 ways of putting a card

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.710
in the second slot, because I
took one to put it in the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.170
first, so I have 8 left.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:16.390
Then 7, then 6, then 5, then
4, then 3, then 2, then 1.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.050
That last slot, there's only
going to be 1 card

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.110
left to put in it.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.610
So this number right here,
where you take 9 times 8,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.530
times 7, times 6, times 5, times
4, times 3, times 2,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.610
times 1, or 9-- you start with
9 and then you multiply it by

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.230
every number less than 9.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.340
Every, I guess we could say,
natural number less than 9.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.480
This is called 9 factorial,
and you express it as an

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.660
exclamation mark.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.890
So if we want to think about all
of the different ways that

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.640
we can have all of the different
combinations for

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.160
hands, this is the number of
hands if we cared about the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.010
order, but then we want to
divide by the number of ways

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.640
we can order things so that
we don't overcount.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.260
And this will be an answer
and this will

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.230
be the correct answer.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.620
Now this is a super, super
duper large number.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.010
Let's figure out how large
of a number this is.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:11.060
We have 36-- let me scroll to
the left a little bit-- 36

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:24.040
times 35, times 34, times 33,
times 32, times 31, times 30,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.870
times 29, times 28,
divided by 9.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.900
Well, I can do it this way.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.610
I can put a parentheses--
divided by parentheses, 9

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.900
times 8, times 7, times 6, times
5, times 4, times 3,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.030
times 2, times 1.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.180
Now, hopefully the calculator
can handle this.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.770
And it gave us this number,
94,143,280.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.680
Let me put this on the side,
so I can read it.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:05:01.950
So this number right here
gives us 94,143,280.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.750
So that's the answer
for this problem.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.650
That there are 94,143,280
possible 9 card

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.680
hands in this situation.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.840
Now, we kind of just
worked through it.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.060
We reasoned our way
through it.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.280
There is a formula for this
that does essentially the

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.730
exact same thing.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.380
And the way that people denote
this formula is to say, look,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:32.060
we have 36 things and we are
going to choose 9 of them.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.370
Right?

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.070
And we don't care about order,
so sometimes it'll be written

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.440
as n choose k.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.520
Let me write it this way.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.520
So what did we do here?

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.670
We have 36 things.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.010
We chose 9.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.580
So this numerator over here,
this was 36 factorial.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.970
But 36 factorial would go all
the way down to 27, 26, 25.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:52.810
It would just keep going.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.860
But we stopped only
nine away from 36.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.190
So this is 36 factorial, so
this part right here, that

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.070
part right there, is not
just 36 factorial.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:09.000
It's 36 factorial divided by
36, minus 9 factorial.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.990
What is 36 minus 9?

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.570
It's 27.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.580
So 27 factorial-- so let's
think about this-- 36

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.540
factorial, it'd be 36 times
35, you keep going all the

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.960
way, times 28 times 27, going
all the way down to 1.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.750
That is 36 factorial.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.970
Now what is 36 minus 9

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.210
factorial, that's 27 factorial.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.760
So if you divide by 27
factorial, 27 factorial is 27

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.370
times 26, all the
way down to 1.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.600
Well, this and this are
the exact same thing.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.820
This is 27 times 26, so that
and that would cancel out.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.960
So if you do 36 divided by 36,
minus 9 factorial, you just

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.980
get the first, the largest nine
terms of 36 factorial,

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.070
which is exactly what
we have over there.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.950
So that is that.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.730
And then we divided
it by 9 factorial.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.320
And this right here is
called 36 choose 9.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.270
And sometimes you'll see this
formula written like

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.700
this, n choose k.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.230
And they'll write the formula as
equal to n factorial over n

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.890
minus k factorial, and also in
the denominator, k factorial.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.420
And this is a general formula
that if you have n things, and

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.840
you want to find out all of the
possible ways you can pick

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.950
k things from those n things,
and you don't

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.170
care about the order.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.390
All you care is about which k
things you picked, you don't

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.100
care about the order in which
you picked those k things.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.240
So that's what we did here.
