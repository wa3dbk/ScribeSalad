00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.090
A contractor is purchasing
some stone

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.780
tiles for a new patio.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.140
Each tile costs $3,
and he wants to

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.470
spend less than $1,000.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.340
And it's less than $1,000, not
less than or equal to $1,000.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.750
The size of each tile
is one square foot.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.890
Write an inequality that
represents the number of tiles

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.800
he can purchase with
a $1,000 limit.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.930
And then figure out how large
the stone patio can be.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.425
So let x be equal to the number
of tiles purchased.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.600
And so the cost of purchasing
x tiles, they're going to be

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.520
$3 each, so it's
going to be 3x.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.200
So 3x is going to be the total
cost of purchasing the tiles.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.270
And he wants to spend
less than $1,000.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.990
3x is how much he spends
if he buys x tiles.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.880
It has to be less than $1,000,
we say it right there.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.060
If it was less than or equal to,
we'd have a little equal

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.160
sign right there.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.190
So if we want to solve for x,
how many tiles can he buy?

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.850
We can divide both sides of
this inequality by 3.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.710
And because we're dividing or
multiplying-- you could

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.010
imagine we're multiplying by
1/3 or dividing by 3 --

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.600
because this is a positive
number, we do not have to swap

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.010
the inequality sign.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.110
So we are left with x is less
than 1,000 over three, which

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.090
is 333 and 1/3.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.530
So he has to buy less than 333
and 1/3 tiles, that's how many

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.690
tiles, and each tile
is one square foot.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:55.640
So if he can buy less than 333
and 1/3 tiles, then the patio

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.320
also has to be less than 333
and 1/3 square feet.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.500
Feet squared, we could
say square feet.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.270
And we're done.
