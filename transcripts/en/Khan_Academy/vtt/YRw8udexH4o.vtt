00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.240
OK, hopefully, my
tool is working now.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.490
But anyway, so we were saying
when x is equal to minus 0.001,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.590
so we're getting closer and
closer to 0 from the negative

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.140
side, f of x is equal
to minus 1,000, right?

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.750
You can just evaluate
it yourself, right?

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.800
And as you see, as x approaches
0 from the negative direction,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.590
we get larger and larger-- or I
guess you could say smaller and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.110
smaller negative
numbers, right?

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.690
You get-- you know, if it's
minus 0.0001, you'd get minus

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.730
10,000, and then minus 100,000,
and then minus 1 million, you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.040
could imagine the closer and
closer you get to zero.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.440
Similarly, when you go from the
other direction, when you say

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.650
what is-- when x is 0.01, there
you get positive 100, right?

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:54.890
When x is point-- the thing is
frozen again-- when it's 0.001,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.420
you get positive 1,000.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.270
So as you see, as you approach
0 from the negative direction,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.210
you get larger and larger
negative values, or I guess

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.420
smaller and smaller
negative values.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.440
And as you go from the positive
direction, you get larger

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.190
and larger values.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.700
Let me graph this just to give
you a sense of what this graph

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190
looks like because this is
actually a good graph to know

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.320
what it looks like
just generally.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.510
So let's say I have the x-axis.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.530
This is the y-axis.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.570
Change my color.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.090
So when x is a negative number,
as x gets really, really,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.320
really negative, as x is like
negative infinity, this

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.890
is approaching zero, but
it's still going to be a

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.330
slightly negative number.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.040
And then as we see from what we
drew, as we approach x is equal

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
to 0, we asymptote, and we
approach negative

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.090
infinity, right?

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.850
And similarly, from positive
numbers, if you go out to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.210
the right really far, it
approaches 0, but it's

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.980
still going to be positive.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.400
And as we gets closer and
closer to 0, it spikes up, and

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.450
it goes to positive infinity.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.770
You never quite get
x is equal to 0.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.260
So in this situation, you
actually have as x approaches--

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.320
so let me give you a different
notation, which you'll

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.380
probably see eventually.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.800
I might actually do a separate
presentation on this.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:28.940
The limit as x approaches 0
from the positive direction,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.180
that's this notation
here, of 1/x, right?

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.260
So this is as x approaches 0
from the positive direction,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.585
from the right-hand side, well,
this is equal to infinity.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:56.120
And then the limit as x-- this
pen, this pen-- the limit as x

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.340
approaches 0 from the
negative side of 1/x.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.460
This notation just says
the limit as I approach

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.420
from the negative side.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.120
So as I approach x equal 0 from
this direction, right, from

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.560
this direction, what happens?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.530
Well, that is equal
to minus infinity.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.110
So since I'm approaching
a different value when I

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.500
approach from one side
or the other, this limit

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.130
is actually undefined.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.625
I mean, we could say that from
the positive side, it's

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:27.660
positive infinity, or from the
negative side, it's negative

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.310
infinity, but they have to
equal the same thing for

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.800
this limit to be defined.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.390
So this is equal to undefined.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.590
So let's do another problem,
and I think this should

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.810
be interesting now.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.350
So let's say, just keeping that
last problem we had in mind,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:04:03.160
what's the limit as x
approaches 0 of 1/x squared?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.270
So in this situation,
I'll draw the graph.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.620
That's my x-axis.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.140
That's my y-axis.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.400
So here, no matter what value
we put into x, we get a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.560
positive value, right?

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.370
Because you're going
to square it.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.360
If you put minus-- you could
actually-- oh, let me do it.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.830
It'll be instructive, I think.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.940
Once again, obviously you
can't just put x equal to 0.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.330
You'll get 1/0,
which is undefined.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.220
But let's say 1 over x squared.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.400
What does 1 over x
squared evaluate to?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:46.250
So when x is 0.1, 0.1 squared
is 0.01, so 1/x is 100.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.600
Similarly, if I do minus 0.1,
minus 0.1 squared is positive

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.440
0.01, so then 1 over that
is still 100, right?

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.630
So regardless of whether we put
a negative or positive number

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.380
here, we get a positive value.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.070
And similarly, if I put-- if we
say x is 0.01, if you evaluate

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.540
it, you'll get 10,000, and if
we put minus 0.01, you'll get

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.920
positive 10,000 as well, right?

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.420
Because we square it.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.240
So in this graph, if you were
to draw it, and if you have a

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.060
graphing calculator, you
should experiment, it

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.720
looks something like this.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.480
I can see this dark blue.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.680
So from the negative side, it
approaches infinity, right?

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.180
You can see that.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.000
As we get to smaller and
smaller-- as we get closer and

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.860
closer to 0 from the negative
side, it approaches infinity.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:43.280
As we go from the positive
side-- these are actually

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.050
symmetric, although I didn't
draw it that symmetric-- it

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.390
also approaches infinity.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.780
So this is a case in which
the limit-- oh, that's

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.380
not too bright.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.720
I don't know if you can see --
the limit as x approaches 0

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.850
from the negative side of 1
over x squared is equal to

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:11.240
infinity, and the limit as x
approaches 0 from the positive

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.070
side of 1 over x squared is
also equal to infinity.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.550
So when you go from the
left-hand side, it

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.560
equals infinity, right?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.860
It goes to infinity
as you approach 0.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.360
And as you go from the
right-hand side, it

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.030
also goes to infinity.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.800
And so the limit in general
is equal to infinity.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.520
And this is why I got excited
when I first started

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.100
learning limits.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.770
Because for the first time,
infinity is a legitimate answer

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.950
to your problem, which, I don't
know, on some metaphysical

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.660
level got me kind of excited.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.750
But anyway, I will do more
problems in the next

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.950
presentation because you can
never do enough limit problems.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.610
And in a couple of
presentations, I actually give

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.670
you the formal, kind of
rigorous mathematical

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.890
definition of the limits.
