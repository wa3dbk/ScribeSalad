00:00:00.302 --> 00:00:04.177
In this video, I want to introduce you to the idea of a list,

00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:06.327
of a list in python.

00:00:06.496 --> 00:00:09.154
It is one of the most powerful data structures in Python,

00:00:09.231 --> 00:00:12.116
and it really is just a sequence of a bunch of other stuff.

00:00:12.193 --> 00:00:14.679
So a list in Python would look something like this:

00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:16.986
So this would be a list of integers,

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:23.594
Maybe 1 , -7, 0, 0, 5 and 10

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:26.661
And we can have some variable refer to it,

00:00:26.723 --> 00:00:29.505
so that we can refer back to it later on in the program,

00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.713
so maybe we say a is equal to all of this.

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:34.490
And if we run this in the interpreter,

00:00:34.552 --> 00:00:35.898
or if we run this in a program,

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.121
now we can refer to the elements of a,

00:00:38.198 --> 00:00:40.944
and you do that by, so let's say I have a

00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:43.829
(let me write in the same pink color)

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.407
You do that by referring to the index of the element inside of the list.

00:00:47.453 --> 00:00:50.828
So, if I say a and then in brackets, I put a zero here.

00:00:50.828 --> 00:00:54.118
This says the 0th element in a,

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.381
0th elment...

00:00:55.427 --> 00:00:57.090
and the general convention in Python,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.013
and this is true of most programming languages,

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:03.938
is what some people would consider the first item in an array, or inside of a list

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:09.378
you would call it the 0th item, or the index of this item right here, is 0.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.054
So, if you were to type this in an interpreter,

00:01:11.054 --> 00:01:12.452
or if you were to type it in a program,

00:01:12.514 --> 00:01:16.758
it would evaluate as this item right over here.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.718
It would be this item, right over there.

00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:21.371
And let me do another example:

00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:23.146
If I were say a of..

00:01:23.192 --> 00:01:23.982
I shouldn't say a of...

00:01:24.044 --> 00:01:26.963
If I were to say the second element...

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.970
in the second element in a

00:01:29.032 --> 00:01:32.485
this would be 0th element, first element, second element.. It would be

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:35.351
this zero, right over there.

00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:37.777
So, that's how you refer to elements in a list.

00:01:37.884 --> 00:01:40.615
you can maybe already imagine doing interesting things with that.

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:41.844
But, what is really cool with lists ...

00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:44.606
is that they don't have to all be the same data type.

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:46.166
They could be all integers,

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.287
or all floats...

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.732
or all strings...

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:50.192
but you could mix it up.

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:51.897
So you could... you could...

00:01:51.974 --> 00:01:54.032
Actually, You could take a right over here,

00:01:54.094 --> 00:01:56.889
and you could redefine one of the elements

00:01:56.935 --> 00:01:58.413
so you could say...

00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:00.513
you could say a.....

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.906
you could say let's reset......

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.690
(do it in that same pink color)

00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:08.068
Let's reset the.......the...

00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:08.645
(I don't know...)

00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:10.824
let's say the fourth element..

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:12.932
Let's reset the fourth element in a

00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:14.732
to be equal to...

00:02:14.732 --> 00:02:17.979
to be equal to.."this text"

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:20.256
So literally "this text".

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:22.777
Literally "this text"

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:24.071
and so If you did that..

00:02:24.117 --> 00:02:26.343
if you set the fourth element be "this text"

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.049
and then you and your program say print..

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.998
print a..print a

00:02:31.998 --> 00:02:35.376
then a... would look like this.

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:37.434
The 0th element wouldn't change.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.396
Still be 1

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.460
The first element will stll be -7

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:44.078
The...the...so this is the 0 first..this...this...this..

00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:47.077
This two index element would still be 0

00:02:47.138 --> 00:02:48.879
This will be the third.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.369
So this is 0th index.

00:02:50.415 --> 00:02:52.638
First, second, third, fourth.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:54.333
to replace the fourth element.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.448
So the fourth element will now be "this text"

00:02:56.448 --> 00:03:01.069
It will now be...this....will now be "this text"

00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:04.925
...the second...we wanna try out with Python intrepreter

00:03:04.987 --> 00:03:07.350
and the last element will still be.....

00:03:07.427 --> 00:03:09.649
The last element will still be 10.

00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:12.574
and this will completely valid to do in Python.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.953
You can mix data type.

00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:17.365
In fact, you could even...if you..after..after you did this,

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:20.038
you could even say..that..a

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:23.409
Let's redefine the 0th element of a..

00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.587
to be another list.

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.984
To be the list -1, -2.

00:03:29.045 --> 00:03:32.733
and if you did this, then this 0th element over here,

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:36.133
will in the list, the 0th element will now refer to this thing.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.000
So the list would now look like this.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.600
So the first element or the 0th element I should say will be this thing.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.600
Negative 1, negative 2.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.554
And then you'd have you're negative seven, zero, zero, this text

00:03:50.554 --> 00:03:53.600
and then you'll have your 10, just like that.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.933
So you define it this way and literally replaces or the 0th element will now refer to this data structure

00:03:59.933 --> 00:04:04.133
over here and you could maybe already imagine useful ways to use this in programs

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:06.800
and if you can't don't worry about it. We'll see useful ways.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.000
Now there is one thing I want to make very clear here

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.267
is that, when I... Let's say that I have... Let me define some new...

00:04:14.267 --> 00:04:19.333
Let's say that I have some list that I have the variable b referred to

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:25.800
and let's say I make this list: 7, 13, 15.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.267
So that's my list.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:31.600
And let's say that I... the next line in my program or maybe using the python interpetrator.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.000
I say that c is equal to b.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.800
And sometimes you might be tempted to do this is, hey I want to have a copy of b.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.933
And what I wanna make clear is that this point, c and b are actually pointing at the same thing.

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:47.000
They are referring to the same thing, so if you think about what's happening.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.667
There are some entity in memory that looks like this: 7, 13, 15.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:58.067
And when you execute this, when you execute this first line over here that says

00:04:58.067 --> 00:05:00.333
that look, b is going to definetly refer to that.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:05.733
If the variable b refers to this entity and when you say c is equal to b,

00:05:05.733 --> 00:05:11.200
this is actually saying that c is going to refer to the same thing that b is referring to.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.133
So c is also going to refer to this exact same thing.

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:21.733
C is not a copy of it, we didn't make a copy of it and make c refer to that.

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:27.267
And what's relevant here is if we now change c we are also going to change or if we change

00:05:27.267 --> 00:05:30.600
what c is refering to we'll also change what b is referring to.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.867
And I'll show you that in a second with the interpetator, but let me show you what I'm talking about.

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:43.067
So this point, I say that c...If I... the next line I say that c, the 0th element in c needs to be equal

00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:44.175
to 1.

00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:49.052
And if I were to tell you then print c you would get.

00:05:49.052 --> 00:05:54.400
You would get 1, 13 and 15.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.467
But if you were to say print b you would also get 1, 13 and 15.

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:03.600
And that's because this call right over here or this statement right over here

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.467
it changes what the 0th element in this list refers to.

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:12.333
So it won't refer to 7 anymore it will refer to 1.

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:19.400
So now if you say b of 0, this will be equal to 1 and not 7.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.400
So you might say:" Well Sal okay, I understand that, so if set a variable equal to another variable

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.267
that refers to a list they are actually refering to the same list and if I change one of the items in

00:06:28.267 --> 00:06:31.267
the list that this is referring to is actually changing what this is referring to.

00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:33.467
So how could I copy lists?"

00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:35.000
How could I actually copy it.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.933
And there you use the notion that can actually and I'll write right over here if you actually want to

00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:45.000
copy things you would do this.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.533
You would write c is equal to b and this might look a little funny for you

00:06:50.533 --> 00:06:56.267
but you put this colon sign over here and what this does is it tells you copy everything in b

00:06:56.267 --> 00:06:58.933
from the beginning of b all the way to the end of the b.

00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:12.159
So you could write c is equal to b and then you could say 0 all the way up to but not including

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:13.800
the second element.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:23.800
So this right over here, this would create a new list that is the 0th and only the first element.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.467
It won't include the second element.

00:07:25.467 --> 00:07:30.600
So in this case, what you do... So this one right over here would create a new list that looks like this.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.933
That creates... That looks like... If we assume we haven't changed b and if we assume this was

00:07:36.933 --> 00:07:42.467
our definition of b, then it will create a new list that looks like this and c will now refer to this

00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:43.800
new list.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.600
So c will now refer to this new list.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.533
So it created a copy of the first two elements, 0th element and first, not the seconth element.

00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:54.067
You would have to put 3 here if you wanted the second element,

00:07:54.067 --> 00:07:56.867
so up to but not including the second element.

00:07:56.867 --> 00:07:59.200
If you wanted all of the elements to copy you would do this.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.267
So this is simply saying from the beginning all the way to the end.

00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:06.000
So it would create... It would create a separate list...

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.867
It would create a separate list that looks just like b, but it is a separate one.

00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:16.533
And then c could refer to that and now if you change c you won't change b.

00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:21.533
So enough of just talking about it, let's actually play with it on our interpetrator.

00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:23.667
Cuz this is the fun stuff right over here.

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:30.333
So let's say that we have... Let's say that... Let me get rid some of this text that I have here

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:32.267
So you don't get confused.

00:08:32.267 --> 00:08:34.000
So let's say I define some list.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:46.800
A is equal to 1, 2 -- I'll write this way -- 1, 2, negative 7, 9, 11.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.533
So I've defined and could even verify that.

00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:51.467
Print a, you can see it right there.

00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:53.600
We can change one of the elements in a.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.600
We can say... Let's change the first element and remember, when we say we have an index 1

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.733
we are not talking about this one here this is the 0th element.

00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:03.467
So we are changing this one right over here.

00:09:03.467 --> 00:09:05.600
So let's change that.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.933
Let's just for fun... Let's change that to a string.

00:09:08.933 --> 00:09:15.067
So "Sal's String*.

00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:18.533
And now let's see what a looks like. Print a.

00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:24.800
So notice, it took this, this is the index one, this is the first, 0th element, 1st element.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.600
It changed the first element to "Sal's String" and we see it right there.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.333
Now let's do something interesting.

00:09:30.333 --> 00:09:32.733
Let's set b equal to a.

00:09:32.733 --> 00:09:38.800
And let's print... Let's print b. So it looks like a.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.133
And let me do something else.

00:09:40.133 --> 00:09:48.467
Let me... Let c equal to a and then do what I talked about, so let me make c equal to a copy of a.

00:09:48.467 --> 00:09:51.533
So let's print c. Print c.

00:09:51.533 --> 00:09:55.333
So b and c looked the same, but they are two different things.

00:09:55.333 --> 00:10:00.133
C is a copy of a or c is a copy of the thing that a is referring to.

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:04.533
B is the thing that a is referring to and to see that, let's change the first element

00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:06.467
of both b and c.

00:10:06.467 --> 00:10:08.467
so if you change the first element of b.

00:10:08.467 --> 00:10:14.000
So b of... the 0th element in b. Let's just make that, I don't know. Let's make that equal to...

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.498
Let's make it equal to 0.

00:10:18.498 --> 00:10:22.467
Now if we print b you see the first element is 0.

00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:27.133
And what you'll also see is that if you print a, the first element will be 0 now.

00:10:27.133 --> 00:10:29.800
Cuz they were referring to the same thing.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.600
So it said, whatever b is referring to make it, the very 0th element, make that equal to 0.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.267
Well a was referring to the same thing so it also became 0.

00:10:38.267 --> 00:10:42.067
But c is referring to a copy so c should not have changed.

00:10:42.067 --> 00:10:47.333
C did not change. The 0th element here did not change a bit.

00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:51.200
So I'll leave you there. Lists are super powerful, there's a ton of functions you can do

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.533
with lists, In fact, I'll expose you to a few right here.

00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:56.867
So that is a, you can add elements to a.

00:10:56.867 --> 00:11:01.333
So you could say a dot append and you can add something to the end of a.

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:09.800
So you could add "new element" and if you do that it should add it to the end of a.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.467
So let's look at a.

00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:12.600
It added that element.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.867
Well b is referring to the same thing so let's see what b looks like.

00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:16.200
It has a new element.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.200
C is referring to a copy of the old a, so let's see what that looks like.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.267
Didn't add it there, cuz it didn't add it to the copy.

00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:26.933
It added only to what a was referring to which is the same thing b is referring to

00:11:26.933 --> 00:11:30.800
and there is a ton of useful functions that we'll explore them as we do more and more

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.467
programs, more more example problems,

00:11:33.467 --> 00:11:38.467
but there is a bunch of useful functions or methods that lists have to be able to manipulate them

00:11:38.467 --> 99:59:59.999
and change them in different ways.
