00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.703
So let's review how we got to where we are right now.

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:06.283
In 1789 you have the Revolution in France.

00:00:06.283 --> 00:00:11.016
This makes the French very proud, a lot of nationalistic pride.

00:00:11.016 --> 00:00:13.591
It also makes the rest of Europe a little worried.

00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:17.851
They're all monarchies, they don't like this idea of overthrowing your kings.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:22.169
And so during this revolutionary period you have a series of wars with the rest of Europe.

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.968
Revolutionary France does, essentially, the French Revolutionary Wars.

00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:30.033
And during that period Napoleon becomes quite famous as the French

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.431
and maybe the best European military commander.

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:37.337
So, now Napoleon is starting to become essentialy a hero in France.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:40.555
And by 1799 he is able to come to power in a coup d'état

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:43.709
with a couple of other people and then he outmaneuvers them

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:46.986
and then by 1804 he becomes the emperor Napoleon

00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:51.157
and in this whole period he is now trying to expand the Empire

00:00:51.157 --> 00:00:55.304
so these were the Revolutionary Wars, and these you can consider right over here

00:00:55.304 --> 00:00:59.903
are the Napoleonic Wars and the pic of the French Empire under Napoleon

00:00:59.903 --> 00:01:02.595
happens in 1812 and the real downfall

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:05.608
if you ask my opinion and many other people

00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:07.181
would be when he invaded Russia

00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:10.145
that really decimated the French Grand Armée

00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:13.966
and we saw in the last video that by April 1814,

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:18.305
the 6th coalition was finally succesfull against Napoleon

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:21.251
and then he was exiled

00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:28.109
to the island of Elba where we're taking up the story

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.687
he only hung out there for a little under 10 months

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:34.897
he was separated from his family

00:01:34.897 --> 00:01:38.262
so that even though he was put in charge of this litle island

00:01:38.262 --> 00:01:40.499
it wouldn't have been what he wanted

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.819
and he obviously was an ambitious person on top of that

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.843
He caught wind of what was happening in France.

00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:48.239
Louis the 18th was there, the nobility returned

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.301
they weren't treating the old Army veterans well which made him suspect

00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:55.983
that he may be able to retake control somehow

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:58.392
On top of that the French Empire

00:01:58.392 --> 00:02:01.502
was being shrunken back to its original boundaries

00:02:01.502 --> 00:02:04.835
which made many people in France a lot less proud so Napoleon

00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:06.924
started to sense that maybe he could do something.

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:09.994
On top of that, he caught wind that people might not

00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:14.287
leave him in Elba because he is Napoleon and they were afraid that he may come back

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:17.284
so they might banish him to someplace even more remote,

00:02:17.284 --> 00:02:21.122
or there might be some attempts to assassinate him

00:02:21.122 --> 00:02:25.690
So with that in mind, being who he is, and being as creative as he is

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.307
he's able to somehow escape from Elba, he's able to get a boat,

00:02:29.307 --> 00:02:33.021
land on the Southern shores of France. The French

00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:36.847
authorities are able to catch wind of this, they send the military

00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:39.718
to engage with him, this is the French military

00:02:39.718 --> 00:02:40.963
to essentially confront

00:02:40.963 --> 00:02:45.669
capture, kill Napoleon on the Southern shores of France

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.326
and when he sees them, he dismounts from the horse that he's got,

00:02:49.326 --> 00:02:52.888
he walks up to them completely unarmed and he says,

00:02:52.888 --> 00:02:55.970
"go ahead, shoot your emperor"

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.908
which is in my mind a fairly gutsy move to do

00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:02.370
And they rally around him and he's able to actually take control

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.427
of the army that was sent to capture or kill him

00:03:06.427 --> 00:03:08.472
and he starts marching to Paris

00:03:08.472 --> 00:03:13.480
He starts marching to Paris, and Louis the 18th, the brave man that he is

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.661
catches wind of this and escapes

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:23.635
and so by March of 1815 Napoleon is able to retake control

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:25.804
of Paris and essentially, France.

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:29.587
And this is the beginning of what is known as the Hundred Days.

00:03:29.587 --> 00:03:38.235
It actually is about a 111 days, but it doesn't sound that good.

00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:43.036
So between March 1815, and July 1815

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:46.502
You can imagine, even before Napoleon was able to reach Paris

00:03:46.502 --> 00:03:51.491
word got around about what was going on

00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:54.513
That Napoleon was back, they didn't like it

00:03:54.513 --> 00:03:58.003
They essentially announced that they wouldn't stand by there

00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.521
and that were going to form a new coalition to stop him

00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:04.001
So Napoleon had two options once he gets in Paris,

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:08.003
He could essentially sit and wait

00:04:08.003 --> 00:04:13.554
wait for the combined forces of Europe to reorganize and then attack him.

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:17.388
Or he could go on the offensive,

00:04:17.388 --> 00:04:20.800
he could attack before they had a chance to fully regroup

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.842
you can imagine, he viewed this as being his best shot

00:04:24.842 --> 00:04:30.219
so he starts going after the combined forces of Great Britain

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.454
and Prussia in what is now Belgium

00:04:33.454 --> 00:04:36.840
And over there is where he engaged in probably some of the most

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.224
decisive battles, the most decisive one was the battle of Waterloo

00:04:43.224 --> 00:04:46.810
which is possibly one of the most famous battles in history

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.455
maybe due to also the Abba song about it

00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:53.833
and that is where he met the Duke of Wellington on the British side,

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:57.778
and Blücher on the Prussian side

00:04:57.778 --> 00:05:01.274
Napoleon had seventy or eighty thousand troops

00:05:01.274 --> 00:05:04.758
The other side had a hundred and twenty/thirty thousand troops

00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:10.373
A extremely bloody battle, more than forty/fifty thousand people killed,

00:05:10.373 --> 00:05:13.352
injured, missing on and on and on.

00:05:13.352 --> 00:05:15.655
But in the end, Napoleon lost and many historians,

00:05:15.655 --> 00:05:18.093
there's different reasons for why he lost

00:05:18.093 --> 00:05:20.920
he actually did a pretty good job considering the scenario

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.315
the ground because of the weather was very muddy

00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:26.702
and actually was not good for being on the offense

00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:28.651
It was very good conditions for being on the defense

00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:32.308
And you know, Napoleon was essentially trying to take out

00:05:32.308 --> 00:05:37.155
these somewhat remnant armies before the Coalition,

00:05:37.155 --> 00:05:43.745
the 7th Coalition essentially had a chance to fully get back to full force

00:05:43.745 --> 00:05:46.930
But he loses at Waterloo, there are a few skirmishes after that,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.761
but the French retreat back to Paris

00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:53.312
At this point Napoleon sees the writing on the wall

00:05:53.312 --> 00:05:55.602
He's not completely delusional

00:05:55.602 --> 00:05:58.681
He sees that if they were able to, especially if the Prussians

00:05:58.681 --> 00:06:00.294
are able to get him again, they might not let him live

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:02.645
They might really do something crazy

00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:04.830
with him, so he surrenders himself to the British

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.415
And then they exile him to the isle of Saint Helena

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:14.343
which is one of the very remote island which is afraid to be exiled to

00:06:14.343 --> 00:06:17.228
to begin with. An just to give a sense of how remote it is

00:06:17.228 --> 00:06:19.208
This right over here

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:22.029
is the South West coast of Africa

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:23.690
This is Africa right over here.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.072
Saint Helena is right out over here

00:06:27.072 --> 00:06:29.164
Almost in the middle of the Atlantic

00:06:29.164 --> 00:06:31.497
between Africa and South America

00:06:31.497 --> 00:06:33.065
And that's where Napoleon would

00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:34.841
live out the rest of his life

00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:36.711
In a very uncomfortable situation

00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:39.447
much worse than what he had going on in Elba

00:06:39.447 --> 00:06:41.303
Separated from everyone else.

00:06:41.303 --> 00:06:44.916
And then he dies in 1821

00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:46.801
The official cause and this is what many historians

00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:48.491
do believe actually happened

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.443
Is that he died of stomach cancer

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:54.397
Bu there are many theories that there might

00:06:54.397 --> 00:06:56.848
have been some type of assassination

00:06:56.848 --> 00:06:58.350
Some slow arsenic poisoning

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.917
There was a lot of arsenic in his tissues

00:07:00.917 --> 00:07:04.508
His body was unusually well preserved after his death

00:07:04.508 --> 00:07:04.509
That's one of the things arsenic does

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:08.794
Some people think that it might have been

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:10.538
an inadvertent arsenic poisoning

00:07:10.538 --> 00:07:12.081
because of the environment that he was in

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.061
Of the conditions he might have been in,

00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:14.224
of the paint in the walls,

00:07:14.224 --> 00:07:18.778
but either way, he really lived roughly

00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:21.117
throught the last six years

00:07:21.117 --> 00:07:24.300
in pretty unpleasant conditions, and then

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.054
died of stomach cancer.

00:07:28.054 --> 00:07:32.054
And that was essentially the final end of Napoleon
