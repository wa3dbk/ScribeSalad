00:00:00.113 --> 00:00:02.179
We're asked to divide.

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.362
And we're dividing six plus three i by seven minus 5i.

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:10.200
And in particular, when I divide this, I want to get another complex number.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.023
So I want to get some real number plus some imaginary number,

00:00:15.023 --> 00:00:16.600
so some multiple of i's.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.067
So let's think about how we can do this.

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:20.108
Well, division is the same thing --

00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:26.271
and we rewrite this as six plus three i over seven minus five i.

00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:27.971
These are clearly equivalent;

00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:33.200
dividing by something is the same thing as a rational expression where that something is in the denominator,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.400
right over here.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.532
And so how do we simplify this?

00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:42.469
Well, we have a tool in our toolkit that can make sure that we don't have an imaginary or complex number in the denominator.

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.267
And that's the complex conjugate.

00:00:45.267 --> 00:00:48.483
If we multiply both the numerator and the denominator of this expression

00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:51.067
by the complex conjugate of the denominator,

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:55.933
then we will have a real number in the denominator.

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.067
So let's do that.

00:00:57.067 --> 00:01:00.800
Let's multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of this.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.400
So seven PLUS five i. Seven plus five i is the complex conjegate of seven minus five i.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.067
So we're going to multiply it by seven plus five i over seven plus five i.

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:16.400
And anything divided by itself is going to be one

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000
(assuming you're not dealing with zero; zero over zero is undefined).

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.152
But seven plus five i over seven plus five i is one.

00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:24.800
So we're not changing the value of this.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.067
But what this does is it allows us to get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator.

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:31.333
So let's multiply this out.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.578
Our numerator --

00:01:32.578 --> 00:01:38.467
we just have to multiply every part of this complex number times every part of this complex number.

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:43.000
You can think of it as FOIL if you like; we're really just doing the distributive property twice.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.667
We have six times seven, which is forty two.

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:58.867
And then we have six times five i, which is thirty i. So plus thirty i.

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:09.710
And then we have three i times seven, so that's plus twenty-one i.

00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:12.375
And then finally we have three i times five i.

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:14.351
Three times five is fifteen.

00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:17.439
But we have i times i, or i squared, which is negative one.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.369
So it would be fifteen times negative one, or minus 15.

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.159
So that's our numerator.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.282
And then our denomenator is going to be --

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:33.067
Well, we have a plus b times a minus b. (You could think of it that way.

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:36.333
Or we could just do what we did up here. Actually, let's just do what we did up here

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:39.242
so you don't have to remember that difference of squares pattern and all that.)

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:42.000
Seven times seven is forty-nine.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.667
Let's think of it in the FOIL way, if that is helpful for you.

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:52.153
So first we did the 7X7. And we can do the outer terms. 7 X 5i is +35i.

00:02:52.153 --> 00:02:57.133
Then we can do the inner terms. -5i X 7 is -35i.

00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:59.490
These two are going to cancel out.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.250
And then -5i X 5i is -25i^2 ("negative twenty five i squared").

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.893
-25i^2 is the same thing as -25 times -1, so that is +25.

00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:11.333
Now let's simplify it.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:14.235
These guys down here cancel out.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:19.831
Our denominator simplifies to 49 + 25 is 74.

00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:23.000
And our numerator: we can add the real parts,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.238
so we have a 42 and a -15.

00:03:27.238 --> 00:03:32.933
Let's see: 42 - 5 would be 37, minus another 10 would be 27.

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:35.829
So that is 27.

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:42.494
And then we're going to add our 30i, plus the 21i --

00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:50.210
so 30 of something plus another 21 of that same something is going to be 51 of that something,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.148
in this case that something is the imaginary unit; it is i.

00:03:55.148 --> 00:03:57.200
(We'll do this in magenta; o, I guess that's orange.)

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.652
So this is +51i.

00:04:00.652 --> 00:04:05.467
And I want to write it in the form of "a+bi," the traditional complex number form.

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:12.006
So this right over here is the same thing as 27/74,

00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:32.347
27/74 + 51/74 times i. (I'm going to write that i in that same orange color.)

00:04:32.347 --> 00:04:34.359
And we are done.

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:37.084
We have a real part, and we have an imaginary part.

00:04:37.084 --> 00:04:41.000
If this last step confuses you a little bit, just remember, if it's helpful for you

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.862
that this is the same thing.

00:04:42.862 --> 00:04:45.267
We're essentially multiplying both of these terms times 1/74.

00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:47.533
We're dividing both of these terms by 74.

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:52.267
And we're distributing the 1/74 times both of these, I guess is one way to think about it.

00:04:52.267 --> 00:04:54.404
And that's how we got this thing over here,

00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:57.723
where we have a nice real part and a nice imaginary part.
