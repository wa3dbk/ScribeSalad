00:00:00.732 --> 00:00:02.072
Let's continue with our

00:00:02.072 --> 00:00:04.546
orange juice producing example

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:06.238
In this situation I want to think about

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:09.432
what a rational quantity of orange juice might be

00:00:09.432 --> 00:00:11.541
what would be a rational quantity

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:12.994
of orange juice to produce

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:14.725
given a market price

00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:15.705
So let's say that

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:20.115
the market price right now is

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:21.973
50 cents a gallon

00:00:21.973 --> 00:00:23.253
and I'm going to assume that

00:00:23.253 --> 00:00:24.887
there are many producers here

00:00:24.887 --> 00:00:26.756
so we're going to have to be price takers

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:27.817
and obviously we want to charge

00:00:27.817 --> 00:00:29.345
as much as we can per gallon

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.824
but if we charge even a penny

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:33.318
over 50 cents a gallon

00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:34.389
then people are going to buy

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:35.254
all of their orange juice

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:36.160
from other people

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.965
so this is the price that we can charge

00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:40.614
50 cents per gallon

00:00:40.614 --> 00:00:41.682
So, if we think about it

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:43.896
in terms of marginal revenue

00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:45.827
per incremental gallon

00:00:45.827 --> 00:00:47.383
well that first incremental gallon

00:00:47.383 --> 00:00:48.908
we're going to get 50 cents

00:00:48.908 --> 00:00:50.000
the next incremental gallon

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.652
we're going to get 50 cents for that one

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:52.584
and the next one

00:00:52.584 --> 00:00:53.470
we're going to get 50 cents as well.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.535
for the first thousand gallons

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:55.458
we're going to get 50 cents

00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:56.807
for each of those gallons

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:58.302
for the first 10 thousand gallons

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:00.058
we'll get 50 cents per gallon

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:01.554
So, our marginal revenue curve

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:04.391
will look something like this

00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:07.124
Our marginal revenue is a flat curve

00:01:07.124 --> 00:01:09.319
right at 50 cents a gallon

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.638
so that is our marginal revenue

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:14.528
at 50 cents

00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:18.090
at a market price of 50 cents per gallon

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.467
now in this situation

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:20.849
what's a reasonable quantity

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.212
that we would want to produce?

00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:23.512
Now there's two dynamics here

00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:29.466
we want to produce as much as possible

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:32.682
so that we can spread our fixed cost

00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:37.337
over those gallons

00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:39.371
that's one way of thinking about it

00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:41.501
or, another way of thinking about it is

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:43.216
we have a certain amount of fixed cost

00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:46.306
we are spending $1000 no matter what

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:47.504
so why don't we try to get

00:01:47.504 --> 00:01:49.435
as much revenue as possible

00:01:49.435 --> 00:01:52.055
to try to make up for those fixed costs

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:53.036
or if we think about it

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:54.655
in terms of average fixed cost

00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:57.017
the more quantity that we produce

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:59.516
the component of the cost for that

00:01:59.516 --> 00:02:00.769
from the fixed cost

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:02.652
goes down and down and down

00:02:02.652 --> 00:02:04.322
so we want to have as much as possible

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:05.913
to spread our fixed costs

00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:08.761
now the one thing that we do need to think about is

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.726
especially once we kind of get beyond the little dip

00:02:11.726 --> 00:02:13.286
in the marginal cost curve

00:02:13.286 --> 00:02:15.123
and as we produce more and more units

00:02:15.123 --> 00:02:18.551
the marginal cost is going up higher and higher and higher

00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:20.117
we don't want to produce so much

00:02:20.117 --> 00:02:22.885
that the cost of producing that incremental unit

00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:25.296
the marginal cost of that incremental unit

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:28.908
is more than the marginal cost of that actual

00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:31.074
or the marginal cost of that incremental unit

00:02:31.074 --> 00:02:33.004
is not higher than the marginal revenue

00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:35.802
that we're getting on that incremental unit

00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:45.685
so, until marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost

00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:47.263
or another way to think about it

00:02:47.263 --> 00:02:51.846
you don't want marginal cost

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:53.726
and this is after we go to this little dip here

00:02:53.726 --> 00:02:55.605
we're trying to do as much as possible

00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:57.636
marginal cost is going higher and higher and higher

00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.641
we don't want to produce this much right over here

00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:03.659
because here the cost for that extra gallon is higher

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.210
than what we're going to get for that extra gallon

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.950
looks like that cost for that extra gallon

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.430
might be 53 cents

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.664
while we're only gonna get 50 cents

00:03:10.664 --> 00:03:11.733
for that extra gallon

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.800
so every extra gallon we produce over here

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.240
we're going to be losing money

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.457
so you don't want marginal cost

00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:23.339
to be greater than marginal revenue

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.282
so when you look at the curves like this

00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:26.284
and make sense to just say

00:03:26.284 --> 00:03:30.063
when does marginal revenue equal marginal cost?

00:03:30.063 --> 00:03:32.183
and that's this point right over here

00:03:32.183 --> 00:03:35.046
and that is the rational amount to produce

00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:37.881
so that is 9000 units

00:03:37.881 --> 00:03:39.832
so we're going to be at this line over here

00:03:39.832 --> 00:03:43.365
we're gonna produce 9000 gallons of juice

00:03:43.365 --> 00:03:45.059
our revenue that we're going to get

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.862
is going to be the rectangle of the area

00:03:47.862 --> 00:03:52.383
that is high as the price we're getting per unit

00:03:52.383 --> 00:03:54.615
times the number of units

00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:57.203
so this is gonna be the total revenue we get

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:58.547
if we were to shade this in

00:03:58.547 --> 00:03:59.595
I'm not gonna shade this in

00:03:59.595 --> 00:04:01.808
because it's going to make my whole diagram messy

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.712
and what's our total cost?

00:04:03.712 --> 00:04:06.815
well, we have our average total cost right here

00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:09.791
this is our average total cost at 48 cents

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.356
that's the little green triangle here

00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:14.733
so it's 48 cents per unit

00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:16.771
times the total number of units

00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:21.168
our cost, the area in this rectangle

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:22.349
so if I were to shade this in

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.406
this little slightly smaller rectangle

00:04:24.406 --> 00:04:27.073
and so our profits are the difference between the two

00:04:27.073 --> 00:04:30.799
our total revenue is the area under the rectangle

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:34.690
that has this marginal revenue line as its upper bound

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.253
and our cost is the rectangle

00:04:36.253 --> 00:04:38.059
that has our average total cost

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:39.586
this line right over here

00:04:39.586 --> 00:04:40.820
as its upper bound

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.389
so our profits in this circumstance

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.090
are going to be the area right over here

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.159
the height is the difference between our marginal cost

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.788
which is the same as our marginal revenue

00:04:52.788 --> 00:04:53.838
and our total cost

00:04:53.838 --> 00:04:56.149
so the heigh is going to be

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:58.043
this two cents right over here

00:04:58.043 --> 00:05:00.023
we're taking the difference of 50 and 48

00:05:00.023 --> 00:05:01.608
so it's gonna be 2 cents

00:05:01.608 --> 00:05:03.238
and then, the quantity produced

00:05:03.238 --> 00:05:05.977
is going to be 9000 units

00:05:05.977 --> 00:05:07.630
so 9000

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.674
we're making 2 cents per unit

00:05:09.674 --> 00:05:11.857
remember, our average cost

00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:14.401
our average total cost is 48 cents per unit

00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:15.882
we're selling that 50 cents per unit

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:17.267
so we're making 2 cents per unit

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:18.313
that's not 20

00:05:18.313 --> 00:05:20.318
we're making 2 cents per unit

00:05:20.318 --> 00:05:26.560
2 cents times 9000 units gives us

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.993
that's 18000 cents, or 180 dollars of profit

00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:35.049
now what I want you to think about

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:36.802
and we'll answer this in the next video

00:05:36.802 --> 00:05:41.956
is does it make sense to sell units at all

00:05:41.956 --> 00:05:44.146
and if so, how many units should we sell

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:45.837
if, and here is the question

00:05:45.837 --> 00:05:50.326
if the market price is lower

00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:52.792
than your average total cost

00:05:52.792 --> 00:05:54.053
so does it make sense

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:57.473
and how many units does it make sense to produce

00:05:57.473 --> 00:06:05.519
let's say if the market price were 45 cents per unit

00:06:05.519 --> 99:59:59.999
does it make sense for us to produce
