00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.220
A jogger and a walker set out
at 9:00 AM from the same

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.080
point, headed in the
same direction.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.660
The average speed of the jogger
is 1 mile per hour

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.080
slower than twice the
speed of the walker.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.140
So that's going to be an
equation right there.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.420
The average speed of the jogger
is 1 mile per hour

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.170
slower than twice the
speed of the walker.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.740
And then they say, in 2 hours,
the jogger is 3 miles ahead of

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.200
the walker.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.350
That's going to be
another equation.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.240
In 2 hours, the jogger is 3
miles ahead of the walker.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.250
Find the rate of the jogger.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.580
So let's write down that first
statement in equation form.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.610
The average speed of the jogger,
let's call that the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.450
speed of the jogger.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.380
That's the average speed of the
jogger is 1 mile per hour

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.700
slower than twice the
speed of the walker.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.550
So that's equal to 2 times
the speed of the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.940
walker, minus 1, right?

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.370
It's 1 mile per hour slower
than twice the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.700
speed of the walker.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.730
So that's that first
statement.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.920
And then they say, in 2 hours,
the jogger is 3 miles ahead of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.200
the walker.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.890
So if we go 2 hours
into the future.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.780
So in 2 hours, the second
statement is the jogger is 3

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.370
miles ahead of the walker.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.100
So we could say that the
distance that the jogger has

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.550
traveled, so the distance of
the jogger, is 3 miles more

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.685
than the distance
of the walker.

00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:34.510
It is equal to the distance
of the walker plus 3.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.130
That's all I'm saying.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.670
This is how far the
jogger's traveled.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.710
He's traveled 3 miles more
than the walker.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.640
Now right now I have two
equations with four unknowns.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.750
That's not cool.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.320
But they've given us
some information.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.840
They said this has happened
after 2 hours.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.830
So we can express the distances
they've traveled in

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.900
terms of the speed
they traveled at.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.310
Just as a bit of a review,
distance is equal to rate

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.560
times time.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.740
In this situation,
the time is 2.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.470
The rate is the speed
of each person.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.270
So we can figure out
the distance.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.560
So if you want to know the
distance that the jogger

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.010
traveled, that's just going to
be 2 hours times the speed of

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.020
the jogger.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.270
So it's just going to
be 2 times the speed

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.510
of the jogger, right?

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.580
Distance is equal to
rate times time,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.280
or time times rate.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.260
Either way.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.450
What's the distance
of the walker?

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.350
Well, it's going to be 2
hours times the speed

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.890
of the walker, right?

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.750
Distance is equal to
rate times time.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.880
So now we can rewrite this
equation in terms of the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.850
speeds of the jogger
and the walker.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.670
So this equation right here.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.100
We can rewrite it as, instead of
writing the distance of the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.460
jogger, we could write 2 times
the speed of the jogger--

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.230
that's that right there-- is
equal to-- instead of writing

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.800
the distance of the walker, we
could write 2 times the speed

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.900
of the walker, make sure that's
a subscript-- speed of

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.770
the walker plus 3.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.830
Now we have two equations and
two unknowns, and it looks

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.410
pretty tempting to eliminate
one of the variables.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.660
In particular, we have a 2 times
the speed of the walker,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.605
we have a 2 times the speed
of the walker here.

00:03:17.605 --> 00:03:21.040
What we can do is we can
multiply this second equation

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.230
by negative 1 and then
add the 2's.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.720
Then these guys will
cancel out.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.300
So let's do that.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.380
Actually let's do it
even a better way.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.780
Let's multiply the top equation
by negative 1 and

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.840
then add them.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.020
So let's multiply the top
equation by negative 1.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.250
This becomes a negative times
the speed of the jogger.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.270
This becomes a negative 2 times
the speed of the walker.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.260
Negative 1 times negative 1
times negative 1 is plus 1.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.040
And now if we add these
two equations.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.690
These two guys are going
to cancel out.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.990
And what do we get?

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.650
We get 2 times the speed of the
jogger minus the speed of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.120
the jogger.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.160
Well that's just going
to be the speed

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.850
of the jogger, right?

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.420
2 of something minus
1 of something is

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.430
just 1 of that thing.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.760
These two guys cancel out.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.740
That was the whole point behind
multiplying the top

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.280
equation by negative 1.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.840
Then you have 1 plus 3, so the
speed of the jogger is 4.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.580
And we're done.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.090
That's all they want
us to find.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.360
Find the rate of the jogger.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.860
And we just figured it out.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.260
If we also wanted to figure out
the rate of the walker, we

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.360
could substitute back into this
top equation right here,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.580
or the original version of it,
which was the speed of the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.350
jogger is equal to 2 times the
speed of the walker minus 1.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.880
We know the speed of the jogger
is 4, so you get 4 is

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.340
equal to 2 times the speed
of the walker minus 1.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.480
Add 1 to both sides, you get 5
is equal to 2 times the speed

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.530
of the walker.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.590
Divide both sides by 2, and
you get the speed of the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.080
walker is 2-1/2 miles
per hour.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.120
But we didn't even
have to do that.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.420
This was the answer that the
problem was looking for.
