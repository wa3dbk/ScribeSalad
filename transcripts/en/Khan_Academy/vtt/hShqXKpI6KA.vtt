00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.830
16 fluid ounces plus 3 pints
plus 4 quarts is equal to how

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.640
many gallons?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.140
Now the one unfamiliar thing
here that we haven't seen

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.940
before is this 16
fluid ounces.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.090
We've seen ounces before,
but not fluid ounces.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.280
And to make things confusing,
they're actually very

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.970
different things.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.030
Fluid ounces are a measure
of a volume.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.420
Fluid ounces measure volume,
just like cups and pints and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.570
quarts and gallons do.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.200
While ounces measure weight.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.250
And this might make it
kind of confusing,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.690
or maybe less confusing.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.310
But it also happens that a
fluid ounce of water, at

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.360
standard temperature and
pressure, is going to weigh a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.680
little bit more than
an actual ounce.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.820
So that's why they're
kind of close.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.330
A fluid ounce of water is not
that different in weight than

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.880
an ounce, but they're two

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.100
fundamentally different things.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.060
This is volume.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.310
This is weight.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.630
Now a fluid ounce, there's
many ways you

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.280
could think of this.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.680
One is that you have 8-- let me
write it here-- you have 8

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.130
fluid ounces per cup.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.420
Or, since there are 2 cups per
pint, you also have 16 fluid

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.810
ounces per pint.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.940
You could view it either way.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.960
Or you could say that you have
32 fluid ounces per quart.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.340
Or you can multiply that times
4, and that's how many fluid

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.060
ounces you have per gallon.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.230
Ounces, which is a unit
of weight, you have

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.430
16 ounces per pound.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.460
And since I told you that a
fluid ounce is a little bit

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.850
more that an ounce, you can kind
of figure out that, hey,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.780
a pint of water, at standard
temperature and pressure and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.790
all of that, will weigh
a little bit more.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.060
Almost a pound, or actually a
little bit more than a pound,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.200
but roughly equal to a pound.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.340
So that's something that
might make things

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.640
simpler, or more difficult.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.630
Now let's actually tackle
the problem.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.820
So we have 16 fluid ounces.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.890
I just told you that there are
16 fluid ounces per pint.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.780
So 16 fluid ounces, let
me write over here.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:27.280
So 16 fluid ounces times-- now
we want the fluid ounces to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.280
cancel out, so we want fluid
ounces in the denominator

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.100
times fluid ounces.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.420
Now how many fluid ounces
are there per pint?

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.670
We want a pint in the numerator
so that this and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.830
this cancel out.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.810
We just saw it, there are 16
fluid ounces per pint, or that

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.010
1/16 of a pint per
fluid ounce.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.910
Either way.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.360
But we see this and this
will cancel out.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.350
And so 16 over 16, because 16
times 1, divided by 16, 1

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.060
equal to 1 pint.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.640
And we know that.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.230
16 fluid ounces equal a pint.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.340
If we have 16 fluid ounces right
over here, this is 1

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.150
pint right over there.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.760
So we have 1 pint plus another
3 pints, so if we were to add

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.690
all of this part right here
together, 1 pint plus 3 pints

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.940
is 4 pints.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.553
Now we have 4 pints, let's
convert to quarts.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.980
Now we know that there are
2 pints per quart.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.980
Or we can view it this way, we
want the pints to cancel out,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:38.550
or 1 quart is 2 pints, or
1/2 quart per pint.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.700
And we wrote it this way instead
of 2 over 1 because we

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.015
wanted the quarts in the
numerator, and the pints in

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:45.780
the denominator, so that that,
and that, cancel out.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.580
And it makes sense.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.650
If you're converting a smaller
unit to a larger unit you're

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.700
going to have fewer of them.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.680
So you're essentially
dividing by 2.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.200
So 4 times 1/2, or 4 divided
by 2, is equal to 2 quarts.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.560
So this whole piece right here,
these 4 pints, are equal

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.200
to 2 quarts.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.060
That's 2 quarts.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.750
And you could visualize it.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.990
2 of these combined make 1
quart, so 4 of them is going

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.010
to be 2 quarts.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.570
So you have 2 quarts here,
plus another 4 quarts.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.519
So this entire quantity of 2
quarts plus this 4 quarts are

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.070
going to be 6 quarts.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.080
So the entire quantity
is 6 quarts.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.850
And we have to convert
that to gallons.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.660
So let me write it right here.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.970
We have 6 quarts and we want
to convert to gallons.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.320
So we want gallons and the
numerator, and we want quarts

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.210
in the denominator, so that it
cancels out with this quarts

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.730
when we multiply them.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.380
And how many quarts are
there in a gallon?

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.840
Or 1 gallon is 4 quarts.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.400
Or 1/4 of a gallon per quart.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.100
Now we can multiply.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.430
The quarts cancel out.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.190
You have 6 times 1/4, which
is 6/4 gallons.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.460
And now we can simplify this.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.250
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 2.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.540
This is the same thing
as 3/2 gallons.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.950
So 3/2 would be an acceptable
answer right here.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.280
This would be 3/2 gallons.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.620
If you want to write it as a
mixed number, 3 divided by 2

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.190
is 1 with the remainder 1.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.360
So it's 1 and 1/2 gallons.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.610
Either one would be an
acceptable answer.
