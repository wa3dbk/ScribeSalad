00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.610
Good morning.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.630
Well today is what I hope is an

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.740
exciting day at Khan Academy.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.860
We're going to start a new set
of, I guess we could call

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.000
them, lectures.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.780
But what we're going to do is
I'm actually going to work

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.670
through just a bunch of SAT
problems. So what this is

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.850
going to be is like SAT prep for
free, or Princeton Review

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.380
or Kaplan for free, and I hope
neither of them sue me for

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.170
using their names.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.320
But anyway, what I want you to
do is, if you haven't already,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.330
I want you to buy this
book right here.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
The Official SAT Study Guide.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.526
Let me make sure it all fits
into the-- you'll see it in

00:00:35.526 --> 00:00:36.980
the bookstore.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.210
I hope I'm not doing any kind
of copyright infringement.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.850
I'm not a lawyer.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.050
I don't know all the rules.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.610
But I'm pretty sure as long as
I give them credit and that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.460
you know that all the problems
we're going to be doing are

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.490
from their book and I'm just
going to work through them,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.770
hopefully that shouldn't be
something that's wrong.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.800
Every day-- well not every
day, but as often as

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.730
possible-- I'm going to work
through all of the problems in

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.130
each of the math sections.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.530
So the best thing for you to do
is for the same section, do

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.560
them ahead of time for yourself,
try to do as many as

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.090
you can, score your test, and
then whichever problems you

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.550
don't know, you can just watch
on Khan Academy and hopefully

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.810
understand them or re-understand
them.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.170
So with that said, let's
get started.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.930
So I'm using this
book right here.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.830
Official SAT Study Guide, and
I am starting on page 395.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.850
This is section three,
I believe, of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.550
the first math section.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.240
This is page 395.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.330
So sometimes I'll
write the whole

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.160
problem, sometimes I won't.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm going to assume that
you have the textbook.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.920
So with that said let's begin.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:55.150
So the first problem, problem
number one, it says, if 2x

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:07.610
plus 3 is equal to 9, then
what is 4x minus 3.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.130
Well this is just a very
basic algebra problem.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.210
If you don't remember how to
do this you should probably

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.640
review the level one and level
two linear equations lectures

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.110
that I have in the
algebra playlist.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.180
But the way we do this, we could
solve for x here, so we

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.540
can just subtract 3
from both sides.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.920
2x plus 3 minus 3, so you get
a 0 here is equal to 6.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.900
And x is equal to 3.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.610
So if you do 4x minus 3, that's
4 times 3 minus 3.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.790
Right, that's 12 minus 3.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.660
And that also equals 9.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.050
And there are some, you could
have kind of done this a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.840
little bit faster.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.840
But this is the one way that you
would make sure that you

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.190
got the right answer.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.840
And on this test it's B, 9.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.090
Number two.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.660
There are 8 sections of seats
in an auditorium.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.670
So I will write-- let me do it
in another color just keep

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.200
things interesting--
8 sections.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.170
There are 8 sections of seats
in an auditorium.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.200
Each section contains
150 seats, but no

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:35.100
more than 250 seats.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.970
So if we say S is seats.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.410
Let me say S is seats.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.280
Seats are greater than or equal
to 150 and less than or

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.760
equal to 200.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.822
This is seats per section.

00:03:49.822 --> 00:03:52.900
I hope I'm not confusing you.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.290
Which of the following could be
the number of seats in this

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.370
auditorium.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.910
So before I even look at the
choices, I mean you could put

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.020
in the choices, you just have to
figure out, well what's the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.060
minimum number of seats
in this auditorium?

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.340
Well the minimum number
is if every section

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.420
only has 150 seats.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.760
So the minimum number is 8 times
150, 8 sections each of

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.209
them having 150 seats.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.490
Because this is the case in
which every section has the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.480
smallest number of seats.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:32.940
So 150 times 8-- 0, 40.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.280
1 times 8 is 8 plus 4 is 12.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.930
So this is the minimum number
of seats in the auditorium.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.260
And then the maximum number
would be if we assume every

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.490
section had the maximum
number of seats.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.190
So that would be 200 times 8.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.700
That's easy.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.400
2 times 8 is 1,600.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.130
So we know that seats is going
to be greater than or equal to

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.970
this and less than
or equal to this.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.910
And what choice falls
under that range?

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.870
Choice A doesn't, it's 800.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.050
Choice B doesn't, choice
C doesn't.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.140
Choice D, 1,300, does fit in
that range, and we know that

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.570
choice E doesn't fit
in that range.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.520
So we're done.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.730
It's D, 1,300 seats
is a possibility.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.610
And we turn the page and
we a graphical problem.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.020
Let's see what we could
do with this.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.920
Note: Figure not drawn to scale
in the figure above.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.060
Let me draw this.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.900
I think I'll have to explain
how it's done.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.640
I will use sky blue.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.300
So the figures-- let
me draw that line.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.310
No, let me do it better
than that.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.850
Draw a thicker line than
that so you can see it.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.110
So they have a line like that.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.860
And they have another
line that goes up

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.110
and down like that.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.470
And then they had a bunch
of points, so let

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.720
me draw those points.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.900
I will draw them in
a different color.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:47.160
So we have point A, point B,
point C, point D, point E.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.920
And they call this horizontal
line, they're

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.080
calling this line L.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.740
And then no, they have another
point up here.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.570
Point X.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.740
In the figure above XC is
perpendicular to L.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.740
So this XC is perpendicular
to line L.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.100
So we know that this is
a 90 degree angle.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.900
And I think they draw it.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.610
Yes, they draw that.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.950
Which of the following
line segments has

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.690
the greatest length?

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.870
Oh, and in the figure they also
tell you the measurements

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.260
of the different lengths.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.890
So they say from A to B is 3.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.980
From B to C is 2.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.020
C to D is 3.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.970
D to E is 1.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.930
And from C to X is 8.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.760
Which of the following line
segments that are not shown

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.620
has the greatest length?

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.710
So the first choice--
I'll write the

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.220
choices down actually.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.060
Choice A is line segment XA.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.780
Choice B is line segment XB.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.090
Well this is following
a pattern.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.210
Choice C is line segment XC.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:01.110
Choice D is line segment XD,
and then choice E is line

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.360
segment XE.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.490
So which of the following
segments has

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.870
the greatest length?

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:18.370
So just eye-balling it, you'll
know that XB is definitely

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.050
going to be shorter.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:29.090
XB is definitely going to
be shorter than XA.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:29.950
Why is that?

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.600
Because if you used--
well one, you could

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.390
just eye-ball it.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.360
I know it's not drawn
to scale.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.809
But you definitely know that
this length, this base, is

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.409
longer than this base
right here.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.200
So we know it's not
going to be XB.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.170
We know XB is shorter
than definitely XA.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.750
So we can cross that
one out, right?

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.330
Now what we don't know-- and we
could do the same thing on

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.620
the other side of this
perpendicular line.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:09:01.100
We know that XD is shorter
than XE, right?

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.920
Same reason, because we know
this base is longer.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.880
If you use a Pythagorean
theorem, you would know that

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.000
this hypotenuse is going to
be longer than this one.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.190
And you can review Pythagorean
theorem and get familiar with

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.190
the triangles if that doesn't
make a lot of sense.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.790
But that tells us that it's
definitely not going to be XD.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.260
And we also know it's
not going to be XC.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.970
This is the shortest
of all of them.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.740
And you could eye-ball that.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:30.160
So it's either going
to be XE or XA.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.880
And the way we figure out
which one has the longer

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.620
hypotenuse is we say, well they
all have the same height,

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.720
so which one has the
longer base?

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.730
So this one has a base, this
triangle right here-- if we

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.910
say this triangle-- has a base
of 4, and this triangle here

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.880
has a base of 5.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.990
So this hypotenuse will be the
longest. XA is the answer.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.510
I will see you in
the next video.
