00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:04.559
Now that we know a little bit about multiplying positive and negative numbers,

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:06.649
Let's think about how how we can divide them.

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:08.562
Now what you'll see is that it's actually

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:10.632
a very similar methodology.

00:00:10.632 --> 00:00:12.164
That if both are positive,

00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:15.455
you'll get a positive answer. If one is negative,

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:18.890
or the other, but not both, you'll get a negative answer.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.542
And if both are negative, they'll cancel out and you'll get a positive answer.

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:26.359
But let's apply and I encourage you to pause this video and try these out yourself

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.473
and then see if you get the same answer that I'm going to get.

00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:32.840
So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2).

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.957
So if I just said eight (8) divided by two (2), that would be

00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:40.326
a positive four (4), but since exactly one of these two numbers

00:00:40.326 --> 00:00:45.425
are negative, this one right over here, the answer is going to be negative.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:49.556
So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2) is negative four (-4).

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:53.425
Now negative sixteen (-16) divided by positive four (4)--

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:54.423
now be very careful here.

00:00:54.423 --> 00:00:59.727
If I just said positive sixteen (16) divided by positive four (4), that would just be four (4).

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:02.675
But because one of these two numbers is negative,

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:05.121
and exactly one of these two numbers is negative,

00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:09.104
then I'm going to get a negative answer.

00:01:09.104 --> 00:01:12.174
Now I have negative thirty (-30) divided by negative five (-5).

00:01:12.174 --> 00:01:17.285
If I just said thirty (30) divided by five (5), I'd get a positive six (6).

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:20.573
And because I have a negative divided by a negative,

00:01:20.573 --> 00:01:25.631
the negatives cancel out, so my answer will still be positive six (6)!

00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:27.332
And I could even write a positive (+) out there, I don't have to,

00:01:27.332 --> 00:01:30.448
but this is a positive six (6).

00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:34.065
A negative divided by a negative, just like a negative times a negative,

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:37.063
you're gonna get a positive answer.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.035
Eighteen (18) divided by two (2)!

00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:40.612
And this is a little bit of a trick question.

00:01:40.612 --> 00:01:43.934
This is what you knew how to do before we even talked about negative numbers:

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:47.067
This is a positive divided by a positive.

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:49.035
Which is going to be a positive.

00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:52.918
So that is going to be equal to positive nine (9).

00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:55.769
Now we start doing some interesting things,

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:57.967
here's kind of a compound problem.

00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:01.464
We have some multiplication and some division going on.

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:03.698
And so first right over here, the way this is written,

00:02:03.698 --> 00:02:06.030
we're gonna wanna multiply the numerator out,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.794
and if you're not familiar with this little dot symbol,

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.164
it's just another way of writing multiplication.

00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:12.381
I could've written this little "x" thing over here

00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:15.628
but what you're gonna see in Algebra is that the dot become much more common.

00:02:15.628 --> 00:02:17.358
Because the X becomes used for other--

00:02:17.358 --> 00:02:23.383
People don't want to confuse it with the letter X

00:02:23.383 --> 00:02:25.584
which gets used a lot in Algebra.

00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:27.927
That's why they used the dot very often.

00:02:27.927 --> 00:02:31.093
So this just says negative seven (-7) times three (3)

00:02:31.093 --> 00:02:33.447
in the numerator, and we're gonna take that product

00:02:33.447 --> 00:02:35.597
and divide it by negative one (-1).

00:02:35.597 --> 00:02:37.640
So the numerator, negative seven (-7) times three (3),

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.437
positive seven (7) times three (3) would be twenty-one (21),

00:02:41.437 --> 00:02:45.303
but since exactly one of these two are negative,

00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:47.078
this is going to be negative twenty-one (-21),

00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:49.732
that's gonna be negative twenty-one (-21) over negative one (-1).

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:51.894
And so negative twenty-one (-21) divided by negative one (-1),

00:02:51.894 --> 00:02:54.944
negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive.

00:02:54.944 --> 00:02:57.920
So this is going to be a positive twenty-one (21).

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.510
Let me write all these things down.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.266
So if I were to take a positive divided by a negative,

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:07.425
that's going to be a negative.

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:11.407
If I had a negative divided by a positive,

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:15.121
that's also going to be a negative.

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:18.020
If I have a negative divided by a negative,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.454
that's going to give me a positive,

00:03:20.454 --> 00:03:24.954
and if obviously a positive divided by a positive,

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.770
that's also going to give me a positive.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.359
Now let's do this last one over here.

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.589
This is actually all multiplication,

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:31.989
but it's interesting, because we're multiplying

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.539
three (3) things, which we haven't done yet.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.116
And we could just go from left to right over here,

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:39.405
and we could first think about negative two (-2) times

00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:41.089
negative seven (-7).

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.627
Negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7).

00:03:42.627 --> 00:03:44.043
They are both negatives, and

00:03:44.043 --> 00:03:45.094
negatives cancel out, so this would give us,

00:03:45.094 --> 00:03:46.844
this part right over here,

00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:49.539
will give us positive fourteen (14).

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.408
And so we're going to multiply positive fourteen (14)

00:03:51.408 --> 00:03:55.207
times this negative one (-1), times -1.

00:03:55.207 --> 00:03:57.908
Now we have a positive times a negative.

00:03:57.908 --> 00:03:59.590
Exactly one of them is negative,

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.470
so this is going to be negative answer,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.020
it's gonna give me negative fourteen (-14).

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.087
Now let me give you a couple of more,

00:04:06.087 --> 00:04:08.655
I guess we could call these trick problems.

00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:12.070
What would happen if I had zero (0) divided by

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.252
negative five (-5).

00:04:14.252 --> 00:04:16.503
Well this is zero negative fifths

00:04:16.503 --> 00:04:19.219
So zero divided by anything that's non-zero

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.355
is just going to equal to zero.

00:04:22.355 --> 00:04:25.035
But what if it were the other way around?

00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:27.371
What happens if we said negative five divided by zero?

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.837
Well, we don't know what happens when you divide things by zero.

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:31.522
We haven't defined that.

00:04:31.522 --> 00:04:35.254
There's arguments for multiple ways to conceptualize this,

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:38.301
so we traditionally do say that this is undefined.

00:04:38.301 --> 00:04:43.213
We haven't defined what happens when something is divided by zero.

00:04:43.213 --> 00:04:46.347
And similarly, even when we had zero divided by zero,

00:04:46.347 --> 00:04:50.431
this is still, this is still, undefined.
