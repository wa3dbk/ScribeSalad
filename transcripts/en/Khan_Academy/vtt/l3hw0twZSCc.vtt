00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.660
We've now learned that a current
or a stream of moving

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.330
charges can be affected
by a magnetic field.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.280
And we've also learned that it
can induce a magnetic field.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.430
So that begs the question,
what is the effect of one

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.980
current carrying wire on another
current carrying wire?

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.760
Let's do that.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.500
Let's draw my first current
carrying wire in green.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.600
That's the first current
carrying wire.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.030
And let's say that the current
is-- it's in magenta-- and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.370
we'll call this current 1.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.270
And then I have another
current carrying

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.605
wire not too far away.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:57.870
And I will call that
current I2.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.160
Now what else do we need
to figure out?

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.230
Oh, well, let me
just tell you.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.240
Let's say that they are
a radius of r apart.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.060
And I say radius because we
learned in the last video that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.270
the magnetic field created by
a current carrying wire is

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.430
kind of a, you know, they're
kind of these circular

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.780
cylinders around the wire.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.410
So let's say the distance from
this wire to that wire is r.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.220
That distance is r.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.760
And so my question to you is--
well, first, just before we

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.670
break into the math-- what's
going to happen?

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.480
Well, we don't know the
magnitudes of the currents or

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.580
anything just yet.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.520
But what's going to happen?

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.690
What will be the net effect
on, let's say, this wire?

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.836
Let's say for some reason this
wire is fixed or we could say

00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:42.410
they're floating in space.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.780
Let's just focus on
wire 2 for now.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.070
This is wire 2, this
is wire 1.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.460
What's going to happen
to wire 2?

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.530
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.630
Wire 1-- the current
in it is going to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.190
generate a magnetic field.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.060
Now what's the shape of
that magnetic field

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.390
going to look like?

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.450
Well, we could take our right
hand, do that right hand wrap

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.060
around rule.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.870
It's a little different than
the cross product rule,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.520
although it's kind
of a byproduct.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.800
So that's my right hand and
I'm wrapping it around.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.380
So if I point my thumb in the
direction of the current-- so

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.480
that's the direction of the
current, just like I did--

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.430
then the magnetic field
goes in the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.360
direction of my fingers.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.900
So they're going to go
around this wire.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.323
And so if I were to just draw
the magnetic field where it

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:36.010
intersects with this screen, on
the right hand side it will

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.120
go into the screen.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.700
So we'll just see the
rear ends of the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.560
magnetic field line.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.190
And I'll draw it in the same
color as the current, so you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.580
know it's being created by I1.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.700
So I1-- its effect keeps going
out to infinity, although it

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.770
gets much weaker
as we learned.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.480
It's inversely proportional
with r.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.720
But this is the field of I1.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.580
I can draw these-- I
don't want to crowd

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.200
my page up too much.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.110
And then on this side
of I1, what happens?

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.710
Well, on this side,
you can see the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.980
fingers come back around.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.860
So it pops out when
it intersects

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.660
with your video monitor.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.720
So on this side, the vectors--
this is the top of an arrow,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.960
coming out at you.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.050
Fair enough.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.410
So I1, by going in this
direction, is generating a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.870
magnetic field that, at least
where I2 is concerned, that

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.590
magnetic field is going
into the page.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.070
So what was our formula?

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.530
And this all came from the
first formula we learned

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.960
about, the effect of a magnetic
field soon. on a

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.510
moving charge.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.470
But what was the formula of the
net magnetic force on a

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.500
current carrying wire?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:56.050
It was the force-- I'll do it in
blue-- it's a vector, has a

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.420
magnitude and direction--
is equal to the current.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.820
Well, in this case, we want
to know the force on this

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.940
current, on current 2, right?

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.160
Caused by this magnetic field,
by magnetic field 1.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.220
So it will be equal to I2, the
magnitude of this current,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.250
times L-- where L is-- because
you can't just say, oh well,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.370
what is the effect
on this wire?

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.160
You have to know how much wire
is under consideration.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.520
So let's say we have
a length of wire.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.240
And then of course, if you know
the length of wire and we

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.110
knew its mass and we knew the
force on it, we could figure

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.570
out its acceleration
in some directions.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.120
So let's say that
this distance is

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.800
L, and it's a vector.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.540
L goes in the same direction
as the current.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.790
That's just the convention
we're using.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.420
It makes things simple.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.010
So that's L.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.680
So the force on this wire, or at
least the length L of this

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.720
wire, is going to be equal
to current 2 times L.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.840
We could call that even L2, just
so that you know that it

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.980
deals with wire 2.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.400
That's a vector quantity.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.420
I could make it a full arrow.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.940
Doesn't matter.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.670
It's just a notation.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.870
I've seen professors do it
either way, I've seen it

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.780
written either way, as well.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.180
Cross the magnetic field
that it's in.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.150
What's the magnetic field
that it's in?

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.080
The magnetic field-- I'll do
it in magenta, because it's

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.770
the magnetic field created
by current 1.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:26.670
So it's magnetic field 1, which
is this magnetic field.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.960
So before going into the math,
let's just figure out what

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.380
direction is this net force
going to be in?

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.000
So here we say, well, the
current is a scalar, so that's

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.470
not going to affect
the direction.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.850
What's the direction of L2?

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.290
This is L2.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.640
I didn't label it L2
on the diagram.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.190
What's the direction of L2?

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.180
Well, it's up.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.650
And then the direction of B1,
the magnetic field created by

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.400
current 1, is going into
the page here.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.520
So here we just do the standard
cross product.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.380
Let me see if I can
pull this off.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.400
This is actually an
easy one to draw.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.660
So I put my index finger
in the direction of L2.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.560
And then I put my middle
finger in the

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.760
direction of the field.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.500
So my middle finger's going
to point straight

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.560
down into this page.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.880
My other fingers just do what
they would naturally do.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.290
And then my thumb
would go in the

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.220
direction of the net force.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.190
This is just the
cross product.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.700
You'll see teachers teach the
cross product other ways,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.720
where they tell you to put your
thumb in the direction of

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.780
the field, and this and
that, your palm--

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.590
those are all valid.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.030
They're just different
variations of the same thing.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.580
I find this one easier
to remember.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.910
Because when I take the cross
product, index finger is the

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.900
first term of the
cross product.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.040
Middle finger is the second
term of the cross product.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.980
Thumb is the direction
of the cross product.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.830
So anyway, this is the
direction of L2.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.300
The magnetic field, we already
know, goes into the page.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.350
So my middle finger is
going into the page.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.510
And my thumb is in the direction
of the force on the

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.620
magnetic field.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.560
So that's the direction
of the force.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.180
So there you have it.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.420
If this current is moving in
this direction and its field

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.580
is-- we know from this wrap
around rule that pops out here

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.950
and it goes in here-- the effect
that it has on this

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.260
other wire is that where the
current is going in the same

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.430
direction, is that it
will be attracted.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.130
So the net force you is going
in that direction.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.870
We could say the force
from 1 on 2.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.900
That's just my convention.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.300
Maybe other people would have
written it the force

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.780
given to 2 by 1.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.170
That's the force given
by 1 to 2.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.750
That's how I'm writing it.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.540
Now what's going to be the force
on current 1 from I2?

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.040
Well, it's going to be the
current-- well, it's going to

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.350
be the force there.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.460
Well it's going to be
the same thing.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.190
Let me draw I2's
magnetic field.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.600
You do the wrap around rule,
it's going to look the same.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.200
So I2, sure, on this side its
field is going to be going

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.240
into the page.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.280
But what's I2's field going
to be doing here?

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.600
It's going to be popping out.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.800
I just did the wrap around--
take this wrap around, wrap it

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.280
around that wire.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.880
So that's the field of I2.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:19.250
So then we can write down that
the force-- and let's take, I

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.660
don't know, this is
some distance.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.300
Let's call that L1.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:33.860
So the force from current 2 on
wire 1 of length L1, from here

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:44.940
to here, is equal to current 1
times L1-- which is a vector--

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.950
cross the magnetic field
created by current 2.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.460
And so we can do the same
cross product here.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:01.510
Put our index finger in
the direction of L1.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.930
That's what you do with
the first element

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.140
of the cross product.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.820
And then you put your middle
finger in the direction of B2.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.800
And then your thumb is going to
tell you what the net force

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.260
is going to be.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.810
So let me draw that.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.360
So let me draw my hand.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.390
And just so you know, before I
do any of these, I actually

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.800
look at my hand, just
to make sure I'm

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.450
drawing the right thing.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:26.020
So my index finger in the
direction of I1, my middle

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.710
finger-- sorry, my index finger
in the direction of L1,

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.750
which is the same as I1, and
then my middle finger is going

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.160
to do what the magnetic
field is doing.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.560
So my middle finger is actually
going to point

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.300
straight up.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.220
And then my other fingers are
just going to do what they do.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.790
And so now you're looking
at the palm of my hand.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:47.350
And my thumb-- let me make sure
I'm doing this correctly.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.600
Oh, no.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.370
I was drawing my left hand.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.850
See, that's an error.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.400
You don't want to draw your left
hand when you're doing

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.280
the right hand rule with
cross products.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.630
So let me draw it down here.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.470
My index finger going in
the direction of L1.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.180
My middle finger's popping
straight up, because the

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.040
magnetic field created by
I2 is popping straight

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.080
out of the page here.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.460
So my middle finger goes
straight up and my other

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.830
fingers do what they
need to do.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.860
Looking at the palm.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.460
And then my thumb will
go in that direction.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:30.290
So the cross product of L with
B2 popping out of this page,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.050
the net force is going to
be in this direction.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.110
So there's a little bit
of symmetry here.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.920
This wire's going to be
attracted towards that wire,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.420
and this wire's going to be
attracted to that wire.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.240
They're both going to--
eventually if they were

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.220
floating in space, they would
slowly get closer and closer

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.000
to each other and their radiuses
would get closer and

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.370
closer and they would accelerate
to each other, at

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.310
ever increasing rates
actually.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.540
Anyway, I'm out of time.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.480
In the next video I'll do this
same principle, but we'll do

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.380
it with some numbers.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.630
