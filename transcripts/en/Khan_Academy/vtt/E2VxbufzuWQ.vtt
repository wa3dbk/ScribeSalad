00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.540
Well, now's as good a time
as any to go over some

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.670
interesting and very
useful properties

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.670
of the Laplace transform.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.620
And the first is to show that
it is a linear operator.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.230
And what does that mean?

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.840
Well, let's say I wanted to take
the Laplace transform of

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.270
the sum of the-- we call it the

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.590
weighted sum of two functions.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.222
So say some constant, c1, times
my first function, f of

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:30.600
t, plus some constant,
c2, times my second

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.850
function, g of t.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.590
Well, by the definition of the
Laplace transform, this would

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.280
be equal to the improper
integral from 0 to infinity of

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.810
e to the minus st, times
whatever our function that

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.220
we're taking the Laplace
transform of, so times c1, f

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.480
of t, plus c2, g of t-- I think
you know where this is

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.410
going-- all of that dt.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.820
And then that is equal to the
integral from 0 to infinity.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.780
Let's just distribute
the e the minus st.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.350
That is equal to what?

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:29.955
That is equal to c1e to the
minus st, f of t, plus c2e to

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:38.560
the minus st, g of t, and
all of that times dt.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.220
And just by the definition
of how the properties of

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.520
integrals work, we know that we
can split this up into two

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.650
integrals, right?

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.170
If the integral of the sum of
two functions is equal to the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.580
sum of their integrals.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.860
And these are just constant.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.190
So this is going to be equal to
c1 times the integral from

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.860
0 to infinity of e to the minus
st, times f of t, d of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.960
t, plus c2 times the integral
from 0 to infinity of e to the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.840
minus st, g of t, dt.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.880
And this was just a very
long-winded way of saying,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.410
what is this?

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.410
This is the Laplace transform
of f of t.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.060
This is the Laplace transform
of g of t.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.550
So this is equal to c1 times the
Laplace transform of f of

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:40.430
t, plus c2 times-- this is the
Laplace transform-- the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.110
Laplace transform of g of t.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.730
And so, we have just shown that
the Laplace transform is

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.210
a linear operator, right?

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.030
The Laplace transform of
this is equal to this.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.310
So essentially, you can kind of
break up the sum and take

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.830
out the constants, and just take
the Laplace transform.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.720
That's something useful to
know, and you might have

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.260
guessed that was the
case anyway.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.150
But now you know for sure.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.640
Now we'll do something which
I consider even more

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.420
interesting.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.730
And this is actually going to
be a big clue as to why

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.360
Laplace transforms are extremely
useful for solving

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.020
differential equations.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.120
So let's say I want to find
the Laplace transform of f

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.380
prime of t.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.050
So I have some f of t, I take
its derivative, and then I

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.100
want the Laplace transform
of that.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.440
Let's see if we can find a
relationship between the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.840
Laplace transform of the
derivative of a function, and

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.950
the Laplace transform
of the function.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.180
So we're going to use some
integration by parts here.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.000
Let me just say what this
is, first of all.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.360
This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity of e to the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.390
minus st, times f
prime of t, dt.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.940
And to solve this, we're going
to use integration by parts.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.492
Let me write it in the
corner, just so you

00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:08.180
remember what it is.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.200
So I think I memorized it,
because I recorded that last

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.305
video not too long ago.

00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:14.200
I'm just going to write
this shorthand.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.149
The integral of u-- well, let's
say uv prime, because

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:25.390
that will match what we have up
here better-- is equal to

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.790
both functions without the
derivitives, uv minus the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.940
integral of the opposite.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.720
So the opposite is u prime v.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.550
So here, the substitution
is pretty clear, right?

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.460
Because we want to end up
with f of x, right?

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.880
So let's make v prime is f
prime, and let's make u e to

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.170
the minus st. So
let's do that.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:58.140
u is going to be e to the minus
st, and v is going to

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.910
equal what?

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.150
v is going to equal
f prime of t.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:14.070
And then u prime would be minus
se to the minus st. And

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:21.700
then, v prime-- oh, sorry,
this is v prime, right?

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.620
v prime is f prime of t, so
v is just going to be

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.720
equal to f of t.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.090
I hope I didn't say that
wrong the first time.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.270
But you see what I'm saying.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.650
This is u, that's u, and
this is v prime.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.320
And if this is v prime, then
if you were to take the

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.070
antiderivative of both sides,
then v is equal to f of t.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.490
So let's apply integration
by parts.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.030
So this Laplace transform, which
is this, is equal to uv,

00:05:51.030 --> 00:06:01.470
which is equal to e to the minus
st, times v, f of t,

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:08.150
minus the integral-- and, of
course, we're going to have to

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.570
evaluate this from
0 to infinity.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.220
I'll keep the improper
integral with

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.960
us the whole time.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.380
I won't switch back and forth
between the definite and

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.310
indefinite integral.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.590
So minus this part.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.650
So the integral from 0 to
infinity of u prime.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:36.640
u prime is minus se to the
minus st times v--

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.590
v is f of t-- dt.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.790
Now, let's see.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.275
We have a minus and a
minus, let's make

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:47.390
both of these pluses.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.580
This s is just a constant,
so we can bring it out.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:07:02.150
So that is equal to e to the
minus st, f of t, evaluated

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.550
from 0 to infinity, or as we
approach infinity, plus s

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.890
times the integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus st,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.110
f of t, dt.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.070
And here, we see,
what is this?

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.230
This is the Laplace transform
of f of t, right?

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.010
Let's evaluate this part.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.310
So when we evaluated in
infinity, as we approach

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.350
infinity, e to the minus
infinity approaches 0.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.960
f of infinity-- now this is
an interesting question.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.180
f of infinity-- I don't know.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.570
That could be large, that
could be small, that

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.400
approaches some value, right?

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.000
This approach 0, so
we're not sure.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.970
If this increases faster than
this approaches 0, then this

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.240
will diverge.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.920
I won't go into the mathematics
of whether this

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.180
converges or diverges, but let's
just say, in very rough

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:05.030
terms, that this will converge
to 0 if f of t grows slower

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.000
than e to the minus
st shrinks.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.940
And maybe later on we'll do some
more rigorous definitions

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.300
of under what conditions
will this

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.810
expression actually converge.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:23.290
But let's assume that f of t
grows slower than e to the st,

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:31.310
or it diverges slower than this
converges, is another way

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:31.910
to view it.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.070
Or this grows slower
than this shrinks.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.730
So if this grows slower than
this shrinks, then this whole

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.320
expression will approach 0.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.730
And then you want to subtract
this whole expression

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.180
evaluated at 0.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:52.805
So e to the 0 is 1 times f of
0-- so that's just f of 0--

00:08:52.805 --> 00:08:57.030
plus s times-- we said, this is
the Laplace transform of f

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.810
of t, that's our definition--
so the Laplace

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:05.580
transform of f of t.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.120
And now we have an interesting
property.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.030
What was the left-hand side of
everything we were doing?

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.740
The Laplace transform
of f prime of t.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.860
So let me just write
all over again.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.850
And I'll switch colors.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:25.710
The Laplace transform of f prime
of t is equal to s times

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:36.740
the Laplace transform of
f of t minus f of 0.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.480
And now, let's just extend
this further.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.090
What is the Laplace transform--
and this is a

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.800
really useful thing to know--
what is the Laplace transform

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.030
of f prime prime of t?

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.270
Well, we can do a little pattern
matching here, right?

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.960
That's going to be s times the
Laplace transform of its

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.000
antiderivative, times the
Laplace transform of f prime

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.750
of t, right?

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.020
This goes to this, that's
an antiderivative.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.800
This goes to this, that's
one antiderivative.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.520
Minus f prime of 0, right?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.780
But then what's the Laplace
transform of this?

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.720
This is going to be equal to s
times the Laplace transform of

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.660
f prime of t, but what's that?

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.560
That's this, right?

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:35.550
That's s times the Laplace
transform of f of t, minus f

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.270
of 0, right?

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.360
I just substituted
this with this.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.750
Minus f prime of 0.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.380
And we get the Laplace transform
of the second

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.700
derivative is equal to s squared
times the Laplace

00:10:51.700 --> 00:11:01.590
transform of our function, f
of t, minus s times f of 0,

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.430
minus f prime of 0.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.840
And I think you're starting
to see a pattern here.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.530
This is the Laplace transform
of f prime prime of t.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.240
And I think you're starting
to see why the Laplace

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.390
transform is useful.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.910
It turns derivatives into
multiplications by f.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.510
And actually, as you'll see
later, it turns integration to

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.330
divisions by s.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.070
And you can take arbitrary
derivatives and just keep

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.290
multiplying by s.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.000
And you see this pattern.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.610
And I'm running out of time.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.310
But I'll leave it up to you to
figure out what the Laplace

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.790
transform of the third
derivative of f is.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.990
See you in the next video.
