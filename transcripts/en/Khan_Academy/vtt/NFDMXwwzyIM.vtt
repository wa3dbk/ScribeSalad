00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.810
I think now might be a good
time to address another

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.390
question that is probably
circulating in your head-- and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.920
that is, what happened
to the gold?

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.000
Remember when we started this
reserve bank, all of these

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.180
national banks or whatever we
want to call them, they had

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.660
gold as a reserve.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.670
And then at some point, they
said, well, why are we each

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.410
holding gold?

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.630
Why don't we just all
concentrate our gold in one

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.030
reserve bank?

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.130
And then that reserve bank can
issue-- and it was the only

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.580
person that could issue-- it
could issue bank notes that

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.260
could be tradeable into gold.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.370
And then we said, over time,
people just got used to the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:43.420
notion of using the bank notes
themselves as reserves.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.760
And that's what the reserve
ratios were all based on,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.010
based on the bank notes
themselves.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.060
And we talked about that if the
Fed or the reserve bank

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.900
wanted to increase the money
supply, it could essentially

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.460
just print new notes and it
would have offsetting notes,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.970
outstanding liabilities, and
then it could use those to

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.900
perform open market transactions
and it

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.670
essentially allows it to grow
the monetary base with the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.580
economy or with the needs of
different projects out there

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.480
so that those projects happen.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.840
And in that whole discussion,
you might have noticed that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.790
this yellow stuff was
just sitting here.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.110
It had nothing to do
with the economy.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.550
It was just sitting there and if
you really wanted to force

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.370
me to say what it was doing,
well, it was giving a little

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.815
bit of confidence behind what
this thing was, right?

00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:32.320
It gives you a little
bit of confidence.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.770
Because at first, at least,
when we said that it was

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.960
backed by the gold-- there was
maybe a similar amount of gold

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.630
as there was there.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.310
Maybe a little bit later, we
said, this could be exchanged

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.140
for gold at some rate--
maybe $35 per ounce.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.160
I think that's what it
was when we were

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.010
last on the gold standard.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.590
But if you think about
it, it's a couple of

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.180
weird things here.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.450
First of all, almost from the
get-go when we did this, the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.560
whole purpose of having this
flexible money supply is so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.640
you can grow and contract money
with the needs of the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.420
economy and we would, for the
most part, have notes

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.110
outstanding because this was a
fractional reserve system.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.940
We would have notes outstanding
more than the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.000
actual amount of gold.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.570
And this has been the
case even when we

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.680
were on the gold standard.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.780
You had more dollars than you
actually had gold, but you had

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.650
to keep a little bit of gold
there just in case people

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.990
wanted to call your bluff.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.720
In case X percentage of people
wanted their gold back.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.360
So they would come back to
the central bank and

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.600
say, give us our gold.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.320
But the gold fundamentally--
it had no other function.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.000
It wasn't in the economy.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.250
It wasn't helping transactions
happen.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.160
It wasn't doing anything.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.310
It was just sitting in Fort Knox
or wherever it happens to

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.110
be sitting and to some degree,
it's more of a pain than any

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.520
kind of real value because you
have to keep up this notion

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.770
that these things, these
dollar bills, could be

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.000
translated into gold, it kind
of forced a reserve ratio

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.250
requirement on the central
bank itself.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.130
And that reserve ratio
requirement-- if you think

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.990
about it, it's kind
of arbitrary.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.970
It's dependent on how
much gold is found

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.430
in the world, right?

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.360
In order to increase the money
supply with GDP because people

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.000
are inventing computers and
railroads and cars and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.980
highways are being built and
we're all becoming more

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.420
efficient-- in order to keep the
money supply up with that

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.655
extra economic activity, if we
stay on the gold standard and

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.090
if we want to keep these ratios
between the money and

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.630
gold, we'd have to grow our
gold with the economy.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.440
And that's kind of arbitrary.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.200
Maybe we'd find a big bunch of
gold or maybe we'd find no

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.680
gold-- and that really should
have no bearing on our

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.540
technological progress and
how hard we're working.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.520
And it makes a lot of sense.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.260
You could imagine in a world
where all of a sudden, an

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.790
asteroid made of gold lands in
the middle of the U.S., does

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.360
that all of a sudden-- because
gold is less valuable, should

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.810
that make the dollar
less cheap?

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.520
Or in another world where for
whatever reason we can't find

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.630
any more gold, should that all
of a sudden decrease our

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.430
ability to circulate
money around?

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.620
And when it becomes-- and I
said three videos ago that

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.380
these dollar bills aren't just
the liabilities or the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.400
obligations of this
central bank.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.460
They're actually obligations
of the U.S. government.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.870
So let me ask you a question.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.000
Would you rather have something
backed by gold or

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.270
backed by the U.S. government?

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.839
And I know many of you, your gut
reaction is to say, gold.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.760
Gold is real value.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.279
The U.S. government-- what
are they good for?

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.670
They're a bunch of crooks.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.410
They lie, cheat, and steal.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.520
They misallocate wealth
all the time.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.870
But think about it.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.170
Gold really isn't wealth.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.300
It can be used to represent
wealth only because it's

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.070
pretty, only because
at some period--

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.320
and it doesn't corrode.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.820
At some period in the past,
someone says, I'm willing to

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.460
plow your field if you give me
that cool rock that you found.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.380
That's the only value
gold has.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.430
It can't do work.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.840
It can't be eaten.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.350
It doesn't make us
more motivated.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.580
It doesn't make us happier.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.050
It's not real wealth.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.870
Now what about the
U.S. government?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.740
Well, it has the right,
the authority, to tax.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.010
I know taxes are bad words and
I don't like them myself, but

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.850
it essentially-- can extract
these rents from the U.S.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.260
economy, right?

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.680
Tax the U.S. economy.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.620
And U.S. economy-- that's
real wealth.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.970
That's labor, ideas,
land, resources.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.340
Everything that makes us tick.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.490
Our labor, our goods and
services, our ability to

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.970
educate ourselves, and innovate,
and come up with

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.010
technology, and become
more productive.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.160
That's real wealth.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.610
So if you really think about
it-- I know I'm getting a

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.700
little abstract here, but I
really want to hit this point

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.300
home because a lot of people,
I think, are still under the

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.130
notion that somehow something is
somehow tradeable for gold,

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.870
that it is of a sounder
currency, while if it's an

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.950
obligation of a government with
a very dynamic economy,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.760
but not gold, it's somehow
backed by less wealth, but I'd

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.060
argue that this is
actually a more

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.960
profound amount of wealth.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.600
I mean, we've had currencies in
ancient history that were

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.000
backed by gold, but
in a lot of cases,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.210
you still had inflation.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.595
When the Spanish currency in the
15th century was backed by

00:06:18.595 --> 00:06:21.630
gold, but all of a sudden they
discover that Central America

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.520
had a lot of gold and you had
a ton of inflation and that

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.260
gold really didn't give any real
wealth to the Spaniards

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.680
of the time.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.070
It just made everything more
expensive for them.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.810
It did allow them to buy a
little bit more from other

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.540
countries, but it really didn't
create any innovation.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.280
It didn't really make their pie
that bigger, except they

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.970
did steal some pie pieces from
other parts of the world-- but

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.260
we'll leave that
aside for now.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.360
But this is real wealth-- a
currency backed by a whole

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.960
nation's ability to generate
wealth, in some ways, is a lot

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.070
more valuable.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.400
But gold was a stepping stone
and it was necessary because

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.080
in order to get this whole thing
started and in order for

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.020
people to really have trust in
this currency, just the way

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.810
people are trained to think,
you had to originally sell

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.750
them on gold, right?

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.790
So if you think about it, gold
didn't play any role.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.280
So in 1971, when Richard Nixon
decides to go off of the gold

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.370
standard, if-- and this is a
big if-- if you trust the

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.540
government's ability to manage
the money supply effectively,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.660
that they're not going to print
so much money that we

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.750
have hyperinflation or they're
not going to print so little

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.670
money that we end up with
a deflationary spiral.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.080
If you trust the government's
ability to do that, it really

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.930
doesn't matter that we went
off of the gold standard.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.680
And it really just kind of gets
rid of a little nuisance.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.205
And if you actually look at the
Federal Reserve's balance

00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:39.720
sheet today, there still is
some gold sitting on their

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.640
balance sheet because it is
really not obvious what they

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.440
needed to do with it so
they just kept it.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.460
Anyway, we'll we'll talk a lot
about this-- what is wealth

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.260
and what isn't wealth
in the future.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.630
One example I often tell people
is-- let's say your

00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:01.420
plane is going down-- you're the
pilot of a plane and it's

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.300
it's going down.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:08.640
It's burning and you see two
islands in the horizon and you

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.760
have to ditch your plane on
one of those islands.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.230
So one of those islands
it just has a big

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.480
pile of gold on it.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.280
And then another island-- you
can see with your telescope

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.220
from the plane, it has cows on
it, it has-- I don't know--

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.290
all these random fruit
trees on it with

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.680
these luscious fruits.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.500
You see-- I don't know-- it has
a big random pool of-- I

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.230
can't draw oil because oil
is black on a blackboard.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.990
It has a pool of oil.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.039
It has another big nice lake
of fresh water that's away

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.370
from the oil so it doesn't
get contaminated.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.300
And you can see from your
telescope that it has a bunch

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.690
of hard working, innovative,
smart people on it who can-- I

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.500
don't know-- do all sorts
of interesting things.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.950
They have roads and
they have horses.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.160
They have all sorts of stuff.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.010
Which island would you ditch
your plane on, assuming that

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.020
you'll never be able to get
back to civilization?

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.900
Well, the obvious answer is
you'd rather ditch your plane

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.870
on that island because that
island has more wealth.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.370
And so when we went off of the
gold standard-- I know it

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.550
seems like this big horrible
thing in the whole scheme of

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.490
the world-- and gold has become
a lot more expensive.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.120
It's no longer $35 an ounce.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.790
It's whatever-- $700 or
$800 an ounce now.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.410
So you might think, there's
been all this inflation.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.160
It would've been great if we
were on the gold standard.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.600
But think about what's
happened since 1971.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.730
Other than some of this excess
credit that was given out

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.160
maybe over the last 10 or 15
years-- other than these

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.600
bubbles, we've seen a
tremendous amount of

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.360
innovation and we haven't seen
hyperinflation and that's all

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.590
in the world of-- you can call
it a fiat currency, a currency

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.810
that's not backed by any
kind of hard asset.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.800
It's backed by people's trust
in the ability of the U.S.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.560
economy to support debt
to pay off the

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.190
value of this currency.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.590
We'll talk more about
that in the future.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.920
I don't want to get too circular
in my conversations.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.930
But I'll see you in
the next video.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.050
I just wanted to touch on that
point that we are now off the

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.560
gold standard.
