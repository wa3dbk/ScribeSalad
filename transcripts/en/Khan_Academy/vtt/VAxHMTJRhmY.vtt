00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.760
In the last video, I hopefully
showed you that if I borrowed P

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.500
dollars, and I borrow it for a
year, and you were to charge me

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.680
an interest rate of r, or you
could say 10r%, then at

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.310
the end-- and we were to
compound continuously.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.900
So we compound every zillionth
of a second, but we compound it

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.100
a trillion times, however many
of those intervals are in a

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.610
year, that at the end of a
year, I would owe you P

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.710
times e to the r dollars.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.780
Fair enough.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.380
Now, what happens if I
borrow it for two years?

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.070
Well, after one year, we
already said that I would

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.470
owe you P times e to
the r dollars, right?

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.570
And then after two
years, what happens?

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.060
Well, this becomes
the new principal.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.380
You can kind of view it as like
I borrowed this much, then I

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.900
owed this much after a year,
and so this is the new

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.750
principal, so I can
reborrow this, right?

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.980
So if I reborrow this,
this becomes the new P.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.770
So that becomes the new P, so I
could write Pe to the r, and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.780
it's going to-- and that
new principal is going to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.340
compound for another year.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340
So e to the r.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.880
So that equals Pe to the 2r.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.330
And similarly, this is
now my new principal.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.710
If I were to borrow it
for another year, it

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.820
becomes Pe to the 3r.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.740
So, in general, if I borrow P
dollars, that's my initial

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.870
principal, I borrow it at a
rate of r and I borrow it for

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.740
two years, the amount that I
owe after two years

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.110
is Pe to the rt.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.990
And once you know this, you are
ready to become your local

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.910
banker and to lend people
money continuously.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.220
And let me just do a couple of
examples because I think it

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.670
might be a little confusing in
the abstract, but with some

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.310
numbers it might all clear up.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.700
OK, so let's say
I borrow $1,000.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.440
Let's say that the
interest rate is 25%.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.060
That's the annual
interest rate.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.040
Rate is equal to 25%, which
is the same thing as 0.25.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.810
And let's say I were to
borrow it for three years.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.140
So t is equal to three years.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.580
And we're going to continuously
compound this interest.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.930
So our formula says that the
amount that I'll owe at the end

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:45.870
of this is how much I borrowed,
$1,000 times e, to my interest

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.240
rate power, 0.25, times the
number of years, times t.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.630
And so let's-- oh,
sorry, that's 3, right?

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.610
So that equals 1,000e to
the 0.75 power, and let

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.770
me calculate what
that is in Excel.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.180
And just so you know, I
don't know if you're

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.250
familiar with Excel.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.710
In Excel, the e to the power--
so I wrote that it's a 1,000

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.700
times-- e to a power
in Excel is exp.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.270
So that's e to some power;
in this case, it's 0.75.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.845
So I get my answer.

00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:27.480
I don't know.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.360
I think it fell off the
bottom of the screen.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.650
There it is right here.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.780
That's my answer.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.470
Zoom in a little bit because I
think you might have trouble

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.710
reading it because it kind of
shrinks it when I

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.540
go to YouTube.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.010
$2,117.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.210
It equals $2,117, and that's
what you would owe me at

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.930
the end of three years.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.010
This is actually the power
of compounding interest.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.250
A lot of people, you know, when
you hear 10% interest rate or

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.070
even a 25% interest rate, that
no one really makes a

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.870
big deal about it.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.120
But when you compound it, and
especially when you compound

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.420
it continuously, it can very
quickly turn into very,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.430
very large numbers.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.380
But let's do another example,
and this might be another kind

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.200
of more complicated example,
or something that you might

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.950
actually see in a textbook.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.700
Let's say that I borrow $50.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.400
I borrow $50, and let's say
it's continuously compounded

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.520
at some rate r, and let's
say it is continuously

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.470
compounded for 10 years.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:41.690
At the end of 10
years, I owe $500.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.660
What was the rate at
which it was compounded?

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.440
So once again, we can
use the same formula.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.650
We could say, well, if my
original principle is $50--

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.410
so it's going to be $50
times e to the rate.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.160
We don't know the rate, but
we know that t is equal

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.170
to 10 years, so its 10r.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.010
That equals my final payment or
how much I owe once all the

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.800
interest and the principal
has compounded.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.440
It's equal to $500.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.000
So we can divide
both sides by 50.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.010
You get e to the 10r
is equal to 10.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.980
And then how do we solve that?

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.900
Well, we could take the
log base e of both sides.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.905
Hopefully, you might want to
review the logarithm, but log

00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:32.910
base e-- e is just a number,
if you ever get confused-- is

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.580
equal to log base e of 10.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.160
And log base e on your
calculator is often

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.420
written the natural log.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.410
And they called it the natural
log because I'll show you e in

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.470
a hundred different-- not
a hundred, but in many

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.230
different applications.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.050
It shows up all over nature,
and I think that's why it's

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.750
called the natural log.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.660
Anyway, let me see if I can
figure out what Excel's

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.590
natural log function is.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.680
So I need to figure out the
natural log, log base e of 10.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.750
Equals LN 10.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.580
Oh, there we go.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.470
There it is right there: 2.3.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.250
So first of all, if I say log
base e of e to the 10r, that's

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.180
like saying e to what power
is equal to e to the 10r?

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.940
So this is the same
thing as just 10r.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.600
Why is that?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.350
Because remember, logarithm is
an exponent, so this is saying

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.230
e to the 10r is equal
to e to the 10r.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.290
Review my logarithm videos if
that's a little confusing.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.990
I know it's a little
confusing at first.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.510
And then we just figured out
that log base e, so e to the

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.780
what power is 10, is 2.--
what was the number?

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.850
2.30.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.970
And now-- oh, this
isn't 10 to the r.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.030
This is 10r, right?

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.560
And so we want to
figure out what r is.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.700
We divide both sides by 10.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.800
We get r is equal
to 0.23, or 23%.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.920
So essentially, if I
continuously compound at an

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.500
annual rate of 23%, after 10
years, I'll essentially

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.460
owe 10 times the money.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.310
So that's something
good to keep it mind.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.660
Anyway, I'll leave you there,
and I really encourage you to

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.440
go back a couple of videos,
rewatch them, play

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.030
with the numbers.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.960
Prove to yourself that
that limit exists.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.640
Take that limit that we showed
in the beginning, the limit as

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.570
n approaches infinity of 1
over 1 plus n to the n.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.070
All you have to do to prove
this is just put in larger

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.010
and larger numbers for n.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.540
And, of course, whatever
number you put in there,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.560
you have to put over here.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.250
You can't put a million
here and a trillion there.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.650
You have to put a trillion
and a trillion, or a

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.810
million and a million.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.600
And you'll see that
it converges to e.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.710
And rewatch the videos and
make sure you get kind of

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.750
an intuitive understanding
of everything we did.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.770
And then this formula, which
most people, frankly, just

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.090
memorize, this Pe to the rt,
will make a lot of sense to

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.370
you, and you will have a
permanent neuron for it

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.550
the rest of your life.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.790
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
