00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.070
In the last video I had this 2
by 3 matrix A right here, and

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.820
we figured out all of the
subspaces that are associated

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.455
with this matrix.

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:13.370
We figured out its null space,
its column space, we figured

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.260
out the null space and column
space of its transpose, which

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.930
you could also call the left
null space, and the row space,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.580
or what's essentially the space
spanned by A's rows.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.840
Let's write it all in one place,
because I realize it

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.050
got a little disjointed, and see
if we can visualize what

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.490
all of these look
like, especially

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.620
relative to each other.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.180
So let me copy and paste
my original matrix.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
Copy, and then let me scroll
down here and paste it over

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.270
here, and hit paste.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.190
Let me see if I can find
our key takeaways

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.580
from the last video.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.410
So our column space right here,
of A, was this thing

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.900
right here.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.690
Let me write this.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.000
This was our column space.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.320
It was the span of the
R2 vector 2, 4.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.870
Let me copy that.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.366
Copy that and bring it down.

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.170
Hit paste.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.000
This was our column space.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.610
Let me write that.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.100
This is the column space of A.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.160
It was equal to that
right there.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.290
And now what other things
do we know?

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.000
Well, we know that the left null
space was a span of 2, 1.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.160
Let me write that.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.880
So our left null space, or the
null space of our transpose,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.895
either way, it was equal to the
span of the R2 vector 2,

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:47.190
1, just like that.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.820
And then what was
our null space?

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.020
Our null space we figured
out in the last video.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.510
Here it is.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.140
It's the span of these
two R3 vectors.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.440
Let me copy and paste that.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.690
Hit copy.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.152
Let me go down here.

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:08.759
Let me paste it.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.620
So that was our null
space right there.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.100
And then finally, what
was our row space?

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.860
What was our row space or the
column space of our transpose?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.850
So the column space of our
transpose was the span of this

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.220
R3 vector right there, So it
was this one right here.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.160
So let me copy and paste it.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:44.710
Copy and scroll down, and we can
paste it just like that.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.980
OK, let's see if we can
visualize this now, now that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.990
we have them all in one place.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.170
So first of all, if we imagine
a transformation, x, that is

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.160
equal to A times x, our
transformation is going to be

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.630
a mapping from what? x would be
a member of R3, so R3 would

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.670
be our domain.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.340
So it would be a mapping from
R3 and then it would be a

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.390
mapping to R2 because we have
two rows here, right?

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:21.300
You multiply a 2-by-3 matrix
times a 3-by-1 vector, and

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.330
you're going to get a 2-by-1
vector, so it's going to be a

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.090
mapping to R2.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.850
So that's our codomain.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.070
So let's draw our domains
and our codomains.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.250
I'll just write them very
generally right here.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.660
So you could imagine
R3 is our domain.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.320
And then our codomain is going
to be R2 just like that.

00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:51.020
And our T is a mapping, or you
could even imagine A is a

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.750
mapping between any vector there
and any vector there

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.340
when you multiply them.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.150
Now, what is our column
space of A?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.260
Our column space of A is the
span of the vector 2 minus 4.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.470
It's an R2 vector.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.200
This is a subspace of R2.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.340
We could write this.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.430
So let me write this.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.420
So our column space of A, these
are just all of the

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.089
vectors that are spanned
by this.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.490
We figured out that these guys
are just multiples of this

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.825
first guy, or we could have
done it the other way.

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:25.820
We could have said this guy and
that guy are multiples of

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.810
that guy, either way.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.060
But the basis is just one
of these vectors.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.590
We just have to have one of
these vectors, and so it was

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.660
equal to this right here.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.915
So the column space
is a subset of R2.

00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:41.800
And what else is
a subset of R2?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.650
Well, our left null space.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.300
Our left null space is
also a subset of R2.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.570
So let's graph them, actually.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.950
So I won't be too exact,
but you can imagine.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.680
Let's see, if we draw the
vector 2, 4-- let me

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.670
draw some axes here.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.220
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.470
So if you have some vector--
let me draw my-- do this as

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.816
neatly as possible.

00:05:12.816 --> 00:05:15.200
That's my vertical axis.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.910
That is my horizontal axis.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.490
And then, what does the span of
our column space look like?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.070
So you draw the vector 2, minus
4, so you're going to go

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.740
out one, two, and then you're
going to go down one, two,

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.200
three, four.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.800
So that's what that
vector looks like.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.420
And the span of this vector
is essentially all of the

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.970
multiples of this vector, where
you could say linear

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.565
combinations of it, but you're
taking a combination of just

00:05:47.565 --> 00:05:49.530
one vector, so it's just going
to be all of the multiples of

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.700
this vector.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.750
So if I were to graph it, it
would just be a line that is

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.030
specified by all of the linear
combinations of that vector

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.030
right there.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.665
This right here is a graphical
representation of the column

00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:07.160
space of A.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.140
Now, let's look at the left null
space of A, or you could

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.130
imagine, the null space
of the transpose.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.680
They are the same thing.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.780
You saw why in the last video.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.020
What does this look like?

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.830
So the left null space
is a span of 2, 1.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.980
So if you graph 2, and then you
go up 1, it's the graph of

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.780
2, 1, and it looks like this.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.840
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.860
So that's what the vector
looks like.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.700
The vector looks like that,
but of course, we want the

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.570
span of that vector, so it's
going to be all of the

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.670
combinations.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.800
All you can do when you combine
one vector is just

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.640
multiply it by a bunch of
scalars, so it's going to be

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.735
all of the scalar multiples
of that vector.

00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:46.880
So let me draw it like that.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.110
It's going to be like that.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.980
And the first thing you might
notice, let me write this.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.970
This is our left null space
of A or the null

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.210
space of our transpose.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:04.965
This is equal to the left
null space of A.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.670
And actually, since we're
writing, we wrote this in

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.660
terms of A transpose.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.060
It's the null space of A
transpose, which is the left

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.060
null space of A.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.900
Let's write the column
space of A also

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.640
in terms of A transpose.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:24.600
This is equal to the row space
of A transpose, right?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.400
If you're looking at the columns
of A, everything it

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.110
spans, the columns of A are the
same things as the rows of

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.450
A transpose.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.510
But the first thing that you
see, when I just at least

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.710
visually drew it like this, is
that these two spaces look to

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.400
be orthogonal to each other.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.670
It looks like I drew it in R2.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.720
It looks like there's a
90-degree angle there.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.000
And if we wanted to verify it,
all we have to do is take the

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.230
dot product.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:55.400
Well, any vector that is in our
column space, you could

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.110
take an arbitrary vector that's
in our column space,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.650
it's going to be equal
to c times 2 minus 4.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.900
So let me write that down.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.370
I want this stuff up here.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.660
I'll scroll down a little bit.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.650
Let's say v1 is a member
of our column space.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.170
And that means that v1 is going
to be equal to some

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.270
scalar multiple times the
spanning vector of our column

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.470
space, so some scale or
multiple of this.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:36.880
So we could say it's equal
to c1 times 2 minus 4.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.150
That's some member of
our column space.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:44.220
Now, if we want some member of
our left null space-- let's

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:44.990
write it here.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:53.900
So let's say that v2 is some
member of our left null space,

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.430
or the null space of
the transpose, then

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.050
what does that mean?

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.820
That means v2 is going to be
equal to some scalar multiple

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.130
of the spanning vector of our
left null space of 2, 1.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.540
So any vector that's in our
column space could be

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.770
represented this way.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.410
Any vector in our left
null space can be

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.620
represented this way.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.720
Now, what happens if you take
the dot product of these two

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.695
characters?

00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:20.570
So let me do it down here.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.850
I want to save some space for
what we're going to do in R3,

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.880
but let me take the dot
product of these two

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.910
characters.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:33.460
So v1 dot v2 is equal to--
I'll arbitrarily switch

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:42.840
colors-- c1 times 2 minus
4 dot c2 times 2, 1.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.630
And then the scalars, we've
seen this before.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:51.420
You can just say that this is
the same thing as c1, c2 times

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.620
the dot product of 2
minus 4 dot 2, 1.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.600
And then what is
this equal to?

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:05.130
This is going to be equal to
c1, c2 times 2 times 2 is 4

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.090
plus minus 4 times 1: minus 4.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.280
Well, this is going to be equal
to 0, so this whole

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.805
expression is going
to be equal to 0.

00:10:12.805 --> 00:10:15.350
And this was for any two vectors
that are members of

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.090
our column space and our
left null space.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.950
They're orthogonal
to each other.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.160
So every member of our column
space is going to be

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.660
orthogonal to every member of
our left null space, or every

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.980
member of the null space of our
transpose, and that was

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.270
the case in this example.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:35.360
It actually turns out this is
always going to be the case,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.530
that your column space of
a matrix, its orthogonal

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.280
complement is the left null
space, or the null space of

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.300
its transpose.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.640
I'll prove that probably in the
next video, either in the

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.770
next video or the video after
that, but you can see it

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.680
visually for this example.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.620
Now let's draw the other two
characters that we're

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.310
dealing with here.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:03.930
So we have our null space, which
is the span of these two

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:04.950
vectors in R3.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.330
It's a little bit more difficult
to draw it, these

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.430
two vectors in R3 right there.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.510
But what is the span of
two vectors in R3?

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.135
All of the linear combinations
of two vectors in R3 is going

00:11:16.135 --> 00:11:18.000
to be a plane in R3.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.045
So I'll draw it in just very
general terms right here.

00:11:21.045 --> 00:11:25.860
If we draw it in just very
general terms, let me see.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.410
So it's a plane in R3 that
looks like that.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.300
Maybe I'll fill in the plane
a little bit, give you some

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.370
sense of what it looks like.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.640
This is the null space of A.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.960
It's spanned by these
two vectors.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.950
Now, you could imagine these
two vectors look something

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.990
like-- I'm drawing it very
general, but if you take any

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.800
linear combinations of these two
guys, you're going to get

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.040
any vector that's along this
plane that goes in infinite

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.480
directions.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.000
And, of course, the origin
will be in these.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.090
All of these are valid
subspaces.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:05.930
Now, what does the row
space of A look like?

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.820
Or you could say the column
space of A transpose?

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:15.000
Well, it's the span of this
vector in R3, but let's see

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.580
something interesting about
this vector in R3.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.090
How does it relate to
these two vectors?

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.200
Well, you may not see it
immediately, although if you

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.910
look at it closely, it might pop
out at you, that this guy

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.670
is orthogonal to both
of these guys.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:37.170
Notice, if you take the dot
product of 2 minus 1 minus 3,

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:43.360
and you dotted it with 1/2, 1,
0, what are you going to get?

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.720
You're going to get 2 times 1/2,
which is 1, plus minus 1

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.190
times 1, which is minus
1, plus minus 3

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.390
times 0, which is 0.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.230
So that's when I dotted that guy
with that guy right there.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.490
And then, when I take the dot
of this guy with that guy,

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.150
what do you get?

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:04.580
You get 3/2, 0 and 1, dotted
with-- let me scroll down a

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.210
little bit.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:11.650
I don't want to write too
small-- dotted with 1, dotted

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.440
with 2 minus 1 minus 3.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.010
In the row space of A,
I wrote the spanning

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.970
vector there this time.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.280
I probably shouldn't have
switched the order.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.230
But here, I'm dotting it with
this guy, and then here, I'm

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.110
dotting it with this
guy right there.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:33.860
So if you take it, 3/2 times 2
is equal to 3 plus 0 times

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.966
minus 1 is 0, plus 1 times minus
3 is minus 3, so it's

00:13:37.966 --> 00:13:39.490
equal to 0.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:44.350
So the fact that this guy is
orthogonal to both of these

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.530
spanning vectors, it also means
that it's orthogonal to

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.470
any linear combination
of those guys.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.410
Maybe it might be useful
for you to see that.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:58.640
So let's take some member
of our null space.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:04.020
So let's say the vector v3 is
a member of our null space.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.680
That means it's a linear
combination of that

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.340
guy and that guy.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.850
Those are the two spanning
vectors.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.970
I'd written it up here.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.930
These are our two spanning
vectors.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.860
I need the space down here,
so let me scroll

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.520
down a little bit.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.840
These are the two spanning
vectors.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.910
So that means that v3 can be
written as some linear

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.780
combination of these two guys
that I squared off in pink.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:40.810
So let me just write it as maybe
A times 3/2, 0, 1 plus b

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:48.520
times 1/2, 1, 0.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:56.900
Now, what happens if I take the
dot product of v3 and I

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:03.110
dot it with any member of
my row space right here?

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:08.650
So any member of my row space
is going to be a multiple of

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:09.490
this guy right here.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.170
That is the spanning vector
of my row space.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.750
Just let me actually
create that.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:20.750
So let me say that v4 is a
member of my row space, which

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.800
is the column space of
the transpose of A.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.500
And that means that v4 is equal
to, let's say, some

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.300
scaling vector.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.860
I always use c a lot.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.200
Let me use d.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.490
Let's say it's d times
my spanning vector.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.520
d times 2 minus 1, 3.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:43.520
So what is v3, which is just
any member of my null space

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:50.420
dotted with v4, which is any
member of my row space?

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.740
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.890
This is going to be
equal to this guy.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.620
So let me write it like this.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:13.850
A times 3/2, 0, 1 plus v times
1/2, 1, 0 dotted with this

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:18.830
guy, dot d times 2 minus 1, 3.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.500
Now, what is this going
to be equal to?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.310
Well, we know all of
the properties

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.930
of vector dot products.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.330
We can distribute it and then
take the scalars out.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.940
So this is going to be equal
to-- I'll skip a few steps

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.970
here, but it's going to be equal
to-- ad times the dot

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:41.755
product of 3/2, 0, 1, dot 2
minus 1, 3-- just distribute

00:16:41.755 --> 00:16:50.790
it out to here-- plus bd times
the dot product of 1/2, 1, 0,

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.410
dotted with 2 minus 1, 3.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.660
This is the dot product.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.400
I just distributed this
term along these

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.670
two terms right here.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.040
And we already know what these
dot products are equal to.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.410
We did it right here.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.800
This dot product right here
is that dot product.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.420
I just switched the order,
so this is equal to 0.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.700
And this dot product is that dot
product, so this is also

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.369
equal to 0.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:17.190
So you take any member of your
row space and you dot it with

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.819
any member of your null space,
and you're going to get 0, or

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:25.690
any member of your row space is
orthogonal to any member of

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.170
your null space.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.720
And I did all of that to
help our visualization.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.420
So we just saw that any member
of our row space, which is the

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.930
span of this vector, is
orthogonal to any member of or

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:37.790
null space.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.200
So my row space, which is just
going to be a line in R3

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.550
because it's just a multiple
of a vector.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.800
It's going to look like this.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.500
It's going to be a line,
and then it's going to

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.170
maybe go behind it.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.100
You can't see it there.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.710
It's going to look like that,
but it's going to be

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:51.605
orthogonal.

00:17:51.605 --> 00:17:52.690
So let me draw it.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:59.440
So this pink line right here in
R3, that is our row space

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.540
of A, which is equal to the
column space of A transpose

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.500
because the rows of A are the
same thing as the columns of A

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.820
transposed, and the row space
is just the space spanned by

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.030
your row vectors.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:16.850
And then this is the null space
of A, which is a plane.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.240
It's spanned by two
vectors in R3.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.750
Or we could also call
that the left

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:29.800
null space of A transpose.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.590
And I never used this term in
the last video, but it's

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.620
symmetric, right?

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.880
If the null space of A transpose
is the left null

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.710
space of A, then the null space
of A is the left null

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:42.810
space of A transpose, which is
an interesting takeaway.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:50.570
Notice that you have here the
row space of A is orthogonal

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.520
to the null space of A.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.640
And here, you have the row
space of A transpose is

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.750
orthogonal to the null
space of A transpose.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.750
Or you could say the left null
space of A is orthogonal to

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.350
the column space of A.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.220
Or you could say the left null
space of A transpose is

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.780
orthogonal to the column
space of A transpose.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.280
So these are just
very interesting

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.890
takeaways, in general.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.290
And just like I said here, that
look, these happen to be

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:18.830
orthogonal.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.460
These also happen to
be orthogonal.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.590
And this isn't just some
strange coincidence.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.490
In the next video or two, I'll
show you that this space, this

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.780
pink space, is the orthogonal
complement of the null space

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:36.710
right here, which means it
represents all of the vectors

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.100
that are orthogonal
to the null space.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.110
And these two guys
are orthogonal

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.130
complements to each other.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.910
They each represent all of the
vectors that are orthogonal to

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.210
the other guy in their
respective spaces.
