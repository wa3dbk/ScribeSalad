00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.530
Let's solve a few more systems
of equations using

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.520
elimination, but in these it
won't be kind of a one-step

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.070
elimination.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.350
We're going to have to massage
the equations a little bit in

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.530
order to prepare them
for elimination.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.480
So let's say that we have an
equation, 5x minus 10y is

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.130
equal to 15.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.159
And we have another equation,
3x minus 2y is equal to 3.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.350
And I said we want to do
this using elimination.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.440
Once again, we could use
substitution, we could graph

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.430
both of these lines and figure
out where they intersect.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.930
But we're going to
use elimination.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.740
But the first thing you might
say, hey, Sal, you know, with

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.450
elimination, you were
subtracting the left-hand side

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.160
of one equation from another,
or adding the two, and then

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.580
adding the two right-hand
sides.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.610
And I could do that, because it
was essentially adding the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.180
same thing to both sides
of the equation.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.010
But here, it's not
obvious that that

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.870
would be of any help.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.970
If we added these two left-hand
sides, you would get

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.750
8x minus 12y.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.580
That wouldn't eliminate
any variables.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.930
And on the right-hand
side, you would just

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.030
be left with a number.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.400
And if you subtracted,
that wouldn't

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.420
eliminate any variables.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.710
So how is elimination
going to help here?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.370
And the answer is, we can
multiply both of these

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.070
equations in such a way that
maybe we can get one of these

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.250
terms to cancel out with
one of the others.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.210
And you could really
pick which term you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.890
want to cancel out.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.690
Let's say we want to cancel out
the y terms. So I'll just

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.510
rewrite this 5x minus
10y here.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.860
5x minus 10y is equal to 15.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.260
Now, is there anything that
I can multiply this green

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.420
equation by so that this
negative 2y term becomes a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.200
term that will cancel out
with the negative 10y?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.980
So I essentially want to make
this negative 2y into a

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.690
positive 10y.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.950
Right?

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.660
Because if this is a positive
10y, it'll cancel out when I

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.400
add the left-hand sides
of this equation.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.280
So what can I multiply
this equation by?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.210
Well, if I multiply it by
negative 5, negative 5 times

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.880
negative 2 right here would
be positive 10.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.949
So let's do that.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:15.870
Let's multiply this equation
times negative 5.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.820
So you multiply the left-hand
side by negative 5, and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.280
multiply the right-hand
side by negative 5.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.310
And what do you get?

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.110
Remember, we're not
fundamentally

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.490
changing the equation.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.700
We're not changing the
information in the equation.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.750
We're doing the same thing
to both sides of it.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.950
So the left-hand side of the
equation becomes negative 5

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.310
times 3x is negative 15x.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.010
And then negative 5 times
negative 2y is plus 10y, is

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.210
equal to 3 times negative
5 is negative 15.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.820
And now, we're ready to
do our elimination.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.980
If we add this to the left-hand
side of the yellow

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.120
equation, and we add the
negative 15 to the right-hand

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.690
side of the yellow equation, we
are adding the same thing

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.460
to both sides of the equation.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.230
Because this is equal to that.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.480
So let's do that.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.430
So 5x minus 15y-- we have this
little negative sign there, we

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.020
don't want to lose that--
that's negative 10x.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.320
The y's cancel out.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.430
Negative 10y plus
10y, that's 0y.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.480
That was the whole point behind
multiplying this by

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.720
negative 5.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.230
Is going to be equal to--
15 minus 15 is 0.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.450
So negative 10x is equal to 0.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.250
Divide both sides by negative
10, and you get

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.010
x is equal to 0.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.880
And now we can substitute back
into either of these equations

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.920
to figure out what y
must be equal to.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.960
Let's substitute into
the top equation.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.280
So we get 5 times 0, minus
10y, is equal to 15.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.560
Or negative 10y is
equal to 15.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.240
Let me write that.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.290
Negative 10y is equal to 15.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.660
Divide both sides
by negative 10.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.670
And we are left with
y is equal to

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.620
15/10, is negative 3/2.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.100
So if you were to graph it,
the point of intersection

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.430
would be the point
0, negative 3/2.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.370
And you can verify that it also
satisfies this equation.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.020
The original equation over
here was 3x minus

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.290
2y is equal to 3.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:48.370
3 times 0, which is 0, minus 2
times negative 3/2 is, this is

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.810
0, this is positive 3.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.080
Right?

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.160
These cancel out, these
become positive.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.130
Plus positive 3 is equal to 3.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.040
So this does indeed satisfy
both equations.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.160
Let's do another one of these
where we have to multiply, and

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.890
to massage the equations, and
then we can eliminate one of

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.000
the variables.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.550
Let's do another one.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:21.330
Let's say we have 5x plus
7y is equal to 15.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:29.150
And we have 7-- let me do
another color-- 7x minus 3y is

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.350
equal to 5.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.810
Now once again, if you just
added or subtracted both the

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.020
left-hand sides, you're
not going to

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.170
eliminate any variables.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.350
These aren't in any way kind of
have the same coefficient

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.180
or the negative of their
coefficient.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.940
So let's pick a variable
to eliminate.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.740
Let's say we want to eliminate
the x's this time.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.180
And you could literally
pick on one of the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.930
variables or another.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.480
It doesn't matter.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.415
You can say let's eliminate the
y's first. But I'm going

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:56.060
to choose to eliminate the x's
first. And so what I need to

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.840
do is massage one or both of
these equations in a way that

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.330
these guys have the same
coefficients, or their

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.510
coefficients are the negatives
of each other, so that when I

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.400
add the left-hand sides, they're
going to eliminate

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.600
each other.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.960
Now, there's nothing obvious--
I can multiply this by a

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.630
fraction to make it equal
to negative 5.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.950
Or I can multiply this by a
fraction to make it equal to

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.930
negative 7.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.420
But even a more fun thing to do
is I can try to get both of

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.220
them to be their least
common multiple.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.980
I could get both
of these to 35.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.130
And the way I can do it is by
multiplying by each other.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.775
So I can multiply this
top equation by 7.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.560
And I'm picking 7 so that
this becomes a 35.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.835
And I can multiply this bottom
equation by negative 5.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.230
And the reason why I'm doing
that is so this becomes a

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.270
negative 35.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.980
Remember, my point is I want
to eliminate the x's.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.670
So if I make this a 35, and if
I make this a negative 35,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.630
then I'm going to be all set.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.480
I can add the left-hand
and the right-hand

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.070
sides of the equations.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.996
So this top equation, when you
multiply it by 7, it becomes--

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:13.790
let me scroll up a little bit--
we multiply it by 7, it

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:22.960
becomes 35x plus 49y is equal
to-- let's see, this is 70

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.950
plus 35 is equal to 105.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.250
Right?

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.930
15 and 70, plus 35,
is equal to 105.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.960
That's what the top
equation becomes.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.000
This bottom equation becomes
negative 5 times 7x, is

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.110
negative 35x, negative 5 times
negative 3y is plus 15y.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.520
The negatives cancel out.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.640
And then 5-- this isn't a
minus 5-- this is times

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.060
negative 5.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.640
5 times negative 5 is equal
to negative 25.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.760
Now, we can start with this top
equation and add the same

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.220
thing to both sides, where that
same thing is negative

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.130
25, which is also equal
to this expression.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.960
So let's add the left-hand
sides and

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.710
the right-hand sides.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.250
Because we're really adding the
same thing to both sides

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.200
of the equation.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.430
So the left-hand side,
the x's cancel out.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.050
35x minus 35x.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.020
That was the whole point.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.760
They cancel out, and on the
y's, you get 49y plus 15y,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.360
that is 64y.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:37.470
64y is equal to 105 minus
25 is equal to 80.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:49.060
Divide both sides by 64, and you
get y is equal to 80/64.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.820
And let's see, if you divide
the numerator and the

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.570
denominator by 8-- actually
you could probably do 16.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.780
16 would be better.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.590
But let's do 8 first,
just because we

00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.860
know our 8 times tables.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.720
So that becomes 10/8, and then
you can divide this by 2, and

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.200
you get 5/4.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.020
If you divided just straight
up by 16, you would've gone

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.600
straight to 5/4.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.340
So y is equal to 5/4.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.390
Let's figure out what x is.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.340
So we can substitute either into
one of these equations,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.300
or into one of the original
equations.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.140
Let's substitute into the
second of the original

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.250
equations, where we had 7x
minus 3y is equal to 5.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.450
That was the original version of
the second equation that we

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.790
later transformed into this.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:42.070
So we get 7x minus 3 times y,
times 5/4, is equal to 5.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:49.180
Or 7x minus 15/4
is equal to 5.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:54.600
Let's add 15/4-- Oh, sorry,
I didn't do that right.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.780
This would be 7x minus 3 times
4-- Oh, sorry, that was right.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.290
What am I doing?

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.520
3 times is 15/4.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.290
Is equal to 5.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:16.960
Let's add 15/4 to both sides.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.290
And what do we get?

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.940
The left-hand side just
becomes a 7x.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.630
These guys cancel out.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.810
And that's going to be
equal to 5, is the

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.000
same thing as 20/4.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.740
20/4 plus 15/4.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.610
Or we get that-- let me scroll
down a little bit-- 7x is

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.820
equal to 35/4.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.750
We can multiply both sides by
1/7, or we could divide both

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.240
sides by 7, same thing.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.530
Let's multiply both
sides by 1/7.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.380
The same thing as
dividing by 7.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.520
So these cancel out and you're
left with x is equal to--

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.190
Here, if you divide 35
by 7, you get 5.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.340
You divide 7 by 7, you get 1.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.100
So x is equal to 5/4 as well.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.960
So the point of intersection of
this right here is both x

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.170
and y are going to
be equal to 5/4.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:18.900
So if you looked at it as a
graph, it'd be 5/4 comma 5/4.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.170
And let's verify that this
satisfies the top equation.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:29.480
And if you take 5 times
5/4, plus 7 times

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.530
5/4, what do you get?

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.330
It should be equal to 15.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:39.580
So this is equal to 25/4,
plus-- what is this?

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.560
This is plus 35/4.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.020
Which is equal to 60/4, which
is indeed equal to 15.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.220
So it does definitely satisfy
that top equation.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.750
And you could check out this
bottom equation for yourself,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.630
but it should, because we
actually used this bottom

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.750
equation to figure out that
x is equal to 5/4.
