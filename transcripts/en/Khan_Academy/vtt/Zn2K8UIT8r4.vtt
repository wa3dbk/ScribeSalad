00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.170
Let's say I've got some set
A of the vectors a1, a2,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.109
all the way to an.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.620
And I know for a fact that
it's a basis for

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.990
the subspace V.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.400
What I want to show you in this
video is that if this guy

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.210
has n elements right here, that
any set that spans V has

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.210
to have at least n elements,
[typing]

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.160
or n members, or cardinality
of n.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.020
There's all different ways
of saying you had n

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.270
vectors in this set.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.920
I'm saying that every set that
spans V must have at least n

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.340
elements, if the sum basis
set has n elements for V.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.959
Let's see if we can kind of run
with the set that has less

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.820
than n elements and see if we
reach any contradictions.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.155
So let's say that I have sum set
B here and it's equal to

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:18.330
the vectors b1, b2,
all the way to bm.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.420
And m is less than n, so I have
sum set of vectors here

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.060
that have fewer elements
than my set A.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.180
So you come to me one day and
say, look I found you this set

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.390
of vectors right here.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.140
And not only does it have
fewer elements than A,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.500
but it spans V.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.460
I look at you very suspiciously
because I always

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.440
thought that this green
statement was true.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.860
So we start a little bit of
a thought experiment.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.970
And I say OK, you claim
that your set spans

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.900
V, so let's do something.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.500
Let me define a new set.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.080
Let me call this new set B1
prime, and you'll see why I'm

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.430
doing this kind of
strange notation.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.230
What's essentially going to be
is a set B plus my vector a1.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.070
So it's a1, and then I have
all of my elements of B.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.350
So be b1, b2, all
the way to bm.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.390
Now I think you and I could both
agree that this set is

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.530
linearly dependent.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.240
How do I know that?

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.240
Linear dependence means that at
least one of the elements

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.100
of the set can be represented
as a linear

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.720
combination of the others.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.610
Well, we know that a1 is one of
the basis vectors for V for

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.800
this definition of a basis.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.510
But all the basis vectors
are members of V.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.970
If this set is a basis for V,
then this means that this set

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.360
spans V, or that every member
of V can be represented as a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.990
linear combination
of these guys.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.980
Or in other ways every
linear combination of

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.710
these guys is in V.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.600
And one of the linear
combinations of these guys is

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.280
you just set the coefficient
on a1 to be 1, and the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.240
coefficients on everyone
else to be 0.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.610
So obviously a1 is
also in the set.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.110
So if a1 is in V, and all
of these guys span V, by

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.680
definition if these guys span
V some linear combination of

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.390
these guys can be used to
construct any member of V.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.910
So you can take some linear
combination of these guys to

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.010
construct a1.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.590
So you could say a1 is equal to
d1, where the d's are the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:37.950
constants, d1 b1 plus d2 b2, all
the way to dm bm, and at

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.080
least one of these have
to be non-zero.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.010
We know that a is a
non-zero vector.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.800
If it was a 0 vector, this
couldn't be a basis because it

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.570
wouldn't be linearly
independent, because you can

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.210
always represent a 0 vector
as really just 0

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.270
times any other vector.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.830
So this won't be a 0 vector.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.390
So at least one of these
are non-zero.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.130
So let's just say, for the sake
of argument, that dj --

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.550
so the coefficient on
bj is non-zero.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.610
So dj does not equal 0.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.910
So we could actually solve
for that term.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.959
So over here someplace you have
the term dj bj, plus a

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.010
bunch of other stuff.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.110
We can solve for this term if we
subtract it from both sides

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.070
of the equation, and then divide
both sides by minus dj,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.360
and put this minus a1 on the
other side, what do we get?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.960
I know that was a lot of
operations, but that's just

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.750
straight up algebra.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.470
I think you can say that we
could rewrite this right here.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.720
We can solve for bj.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.470
That should be equal to minus
1 over its coefficient.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.620
And, if we subtract the a1 from
both sides and then plus

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.640
all of these guys, plus d1 b1
plus all the way -- you're

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.300
going to have a little
bit of a gap here.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.080
I'll just draw it like that.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.370
It's very unconventional
notation where this guy sat.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.090
All the way to dm bm.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.160
I'm doing this all of this to
show you that, by definition,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.240
you can write a1 as a
linear combination

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.050
of these other guys.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.400
But you can just rearrange
things.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.160
You can rearrange it so that you
can write one of the other

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.180
guys as a linear combination
of the rest of the

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.910
other guys and a1.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.330
This guy's now redundant.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.780
I don't need this guy any longer
to continue to span V.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.860
Clearly this set
still spans V.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.270
I added an extra vector here.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.390
But I can remove this guy right
here from my set b1

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.980
prime and still span V.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.080
And how do I know that?

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.410
Because I can achieve him.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.220
By removing him, I don't
lose anything.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.550
Because if I needed this vector
to create some other

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.310
vector, I can construct him with
a linear combination of

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.180
the rest of the b's,
plus my a1.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.680
So let's get rid of him,
and call that set v1.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.270
And actually, just for the sake
of notation, let me just

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.600
change his name.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.840
This is little unconventional.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.350
You won't see it done like
this in any textbook.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.470
But I think it's a little bit
easier, instead of having to

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.420
keep talking about these little
guys that are embedded

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.250
someplace in the middle
of the stream.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:24.380
I mean these names, b1, b2, bn,
they're arbitrary names.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.690
Let me swap the labels.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.860
Let me just say that bj is equal
to b1, and that b1 is

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.660
equal to bj.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.230
I'm just swapping their names.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.590
I took that guy, I
renamed him b1.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.120
I renamed b1, bj, so that
I could swap them.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.610
So I'm essentially just going
to remove b1 one from the

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.210
vector just to make my
notation easier.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.490
You could just keep saying I'll
remove this bj from the

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.980
middle, but it becomes
very confusing then.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.150
So let me call my new set after
removing the bj that

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.880
I've renamed as b1, let me just
call that straight up B1.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:06.470
So my straight set B1 is equal
to a1, and then remember I

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.100
removed the bj and I renamed
that as b1, and then I

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.380
renamed b1 as bj.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.840
So now my set looks like
this -- let me go

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.900
to the other color.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.130
b2 -- and for all we know
bj might have been

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.830
b1, we don't know.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.930
There are probably multiple of
these that are non-zero, so we

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.480
could pick any of those
to be our bj.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.150
But anyway, we took our
bj renamed it b1,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.590
and removed the b1.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.130
So now out set looks like this:
b3 all the way to bm.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.100
This set still spans V.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.230
And we know that because the
guy we removed can be

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.270
constructed with any linear
combination of these guys.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.130
So we haven't lost our ability
to construct all of the

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.480
vectors in V.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.730
Now let me create
another vector.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.160
We'll do a new color.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.430
Let's say I have the
vector B2 prime.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.110
And what I'm going to do here
is now I'm going to take

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.700
another element from
our basis of V.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.560
I'll take the second element;
I'll take a2.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.820
I'll take a2 and throw
it on this guy.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:23.970
So now we have the set B2 prime
is equal to -- I'm going

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.220
to add a2 to this guy.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:31.090
So you have a1, a2, and then you
have all the rest of these

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:36.360
guys, b2, b3 all the way bm.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.169
Of course this still spans V,
I just added something here.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.460
But this is definitely
linearly dependent.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.240
Remember I didn't say in the
beginning whether this was

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.710
linear dependent or not.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.700
It may or may not be.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.650
But when you add this other
vector that's in V, you

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.490
definitely know that you're
linear dependent, because

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.730
these guys can construct
that guy.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:56.380
Similarly we know that this
vector B1 spans V.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:01.550
So when we add this new element
here, we know that it

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.950
can be written as a linear
combination of the other one.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.940
So we know that this right here
is linearly dependent.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.770
And we could say that a2 is
equal to some constant times

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:28.260
c1 times a1 plus c2 b2 plus c3
b3, all the way to cm bm.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.240
Now what I'm going to claim is
that at least one of these

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.610
coefficients is non-zero.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.160
So at least one of the ci's
does not equal to 0.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.800
And I'll make the further claim
that there's at least

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.170
one that's outside
of this one.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.670
That at least one of the
coefficients on these B terms

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.230
has to be non-zero.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.350
And the way you can think about
is, what if all of these

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.750
guys were 0?

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.070
If all of these guys were 0,
then that means that a2 is a

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.490
linear combination of a1.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.640
All of these guys would cancel
out, and you'd have a2 is

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.440
equal to some non-zero
constant times a1.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.440
We know that's not the case
because these two guys come

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.630
from the same linearly
independent set.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.150
They both come from that
spanning basis.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.180
The fact that they are a basis
-- the word spanning basis, I

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.600
shouldn't say it like that,
because it's redundant.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.710
A basis is a spanning set that
is linearly independent.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.140
If they're linearly independent
we know that a2

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.240
cannot be represented as some
linear combination of the rest

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.310
of these guys.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:37.710
So we know that one of the
coefficients on the B terms

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.780
has to be non-zero.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:46.170
And let's just say that you're
going to have a cj bj, this is

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.930
a different one than
we had before.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.760
And we know that this guy, at
least one of them has to be

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.760
non-zero, because if all of
these guys were non-zero, then

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.910
you wouldn't be able to say
that this vector and that

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.780
vector are linearly independent,
because they

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.900
would be scalar multiples
of each other.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.050
So we're going to do
the same exercise.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:12.600
This guy right here, cj bj,
obviously this coefficient is

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.920
non-zero so we can
solve for our bj.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.500
Once again we can say that bj is
equal minus 1 over cj times

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:28.070
minus a2 plus c1 a1, all
the way to cm bm.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.860
So we have some bj here that can
be represented as a linear

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.420
combination of the rest of the
people, including our new a2.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.250
And so, just like we did before,
let's remove him.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.640
Let's take him out of the set.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.290
And before I take him
out of the set, I'm

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.230
going to rename him.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.750
Just solely for the purpose of
notational simplicity, I'm

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:51.770
just going to rename our bj, b2,
and our b2 is equal to bj.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.600
So I'm just rearranging
the names.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.380
And I'm going to
remove our b2.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.700
Or I'm going to remove
what I now call b2.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.260
It was whatever was out here
that could be represented as a

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.340
linear combination of
everything else,

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.590
including our new a2.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:14.000
When I remove one of those
terms right here, and I

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.250
renamed it B2.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:25.670
And now it's equal to a1
a2, and now I have the

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.030
leftovers of my b's.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:33.290
So I have b3, b4, all
the way to bm.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.780
Notice I still have exactly
m elements, and

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.410
this still spans V.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.870
It spans V because the element
that I took out of it can be

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.650
represented as a linear
combination of these guys.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.780
So if I ever want to construct
anything that need that, I can

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.750
construct that vector with some

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.610
combination of these guys.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.780
So it wasn't necessary.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.460
It still spans V.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.300
So this process I'm doing, I
can just keep repeating it.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.700
I can add an a3.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.600
I can define B3 prime.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.960
I can just add a3 to this
set right here, a2 a3.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:17.350
And then I have my b3, b4,
all the way to bm.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.050
And I'll say this is linearly
dependent because

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.830
this guy spans V.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.130
So everything but this
guy spans V.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.750
So obviously you can construct
this guy with a linear

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.460
combination of the
rest of them.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:37.610
So you could say a3 is equal to
sum a1 plus sum a2 plus c3

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.670
b3, all the way to cm bm.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.310
And we know that at least one
of the coefficients on the B

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.190
terms has to be non-zero.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.040
Because if all of those were
0, then you would be saying

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.060
that a3 could be a linear
combination of the A terms.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.640
And we know that a3 can't be
a representative linear

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.570
combination of the A terms,
because all these a terms come

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.900
from a linearly independent
set.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.430
So you do the same operation.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:12.430
Let's say that cj is non-zero.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.550
Then you could solve
for that bj.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.650
And then I do that little
renaming thing I do, where I

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.220
rename the bj b3, and rename b3
bj, and then I remove b3.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:31.840
And I get the set B3 is
equal to a1, a2, a3.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.750
And I have b4 all
the way to bm.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.200
And this still spans V.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.640
And I keep doing it.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.500
So what's going to happen
eventually?

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.210
What's going to happen if I keep
doing this process over

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.600
and over and over again?

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.460
Eventually I'll essentially
replace all of the bm's.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.730
Or I'll replace all of the n
terms, so eventually I'll have

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.580
a set that looks like this.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.470
I'll have a set that looks Bm,
where I will have replaced

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.150
each of these guys with an a.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:12.480
So I have a1, a2, a3,
all the way to am.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.330
You can always do this by
definition if you started with

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.850
that initial set B that
is a spanning set.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.345
And once you do this process
you'll get the same result

00:15:20.345 --> 00:15:24.090
that this also spans V.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.440
Now let me let me write this.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.890
This is the result we got by
starting off with a spanning

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:34.490
set B that has m elements,
where we said that m

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.190
is less than n.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.530
So we always have enough a
elements to do this, because

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.260
we have more a elements
than there were b

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.450
elements to begin with.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.370
And we get result that
this spans V.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:51.840
But we already said that the
set A which is equal to a1,

00:15:51.840 --> 00:16:00.430
a2, all the way to am, and then
am plus 1, I don't know

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.580
how many more terms there are
between m and n, but then you

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.610
go all the way to an.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.000
Remember we said that
n is greater than m.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.610
Or when we defined B, we said
that m is less than n.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.990
Same thing, that this
was a smaller set.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.380
Now we're saying that this spans
V, but at the same time

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.990
we said this was a basis.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.880
This is just our starting
fact, that this

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.410
is a basis for V.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.900
Basis means two things: it means
it spans V and it means

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.910
it's linearly independent.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.430
Now we just got this result by
assuming that we had some set

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.100
B that's smaller than this
set here that spans V.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.420
We were able to construct this
by saying that a1 through am

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.350
also spans V.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.250
The result we got is
that this spans V.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:53.440
But if this subset of A spans
V, then A becomes linearly

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:53.900
independent.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:17:00.260
Because if this subset spans V,
that means that an can be

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:05.240
represented as some linear
combination of these guys.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.560
So that implies that you're
linearly dependent, which is a

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.300
contradiction with our original
statement that set A

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.839
is a basis for V, because
that means it's linearly

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:15.869
independent.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.810
If you're able to do this, then
this means that there was

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.390
some smaller spanning set, you
get the result that A has to

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.589
be linearly dependant, even
though we said it was linearly

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:25.700
independent.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.860
So we now know, we get our
contradiction, we say that

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.580
there cannot be [typing]

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:59.640
a spanning set B that has
fewer elements than A.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:05.010
And this is a pretty neat
outcome, because now, if I

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:12.160
come up to you and say I
found some set X spans

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.960
the subspace V again.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.550
Then you know that X
has five elements.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.870
You now know that no set that
spans the subspace V can have

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.560
fewer than five elements.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:36.230
Even better, if I told you that
X is a basis for V, and I

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:42.370
told you it has five elements,
and Y is a basis for V.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.620
[typing]

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.320
You know that Y also has to have
exactly five elements.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.310
How do I know that?

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:13.450
Well, if Y is a basis, then that
means that it spans V.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.000
And we know it can't
have anything

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.310
less than five elements.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.450
We just proved that.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.380
One way we know that Y has to
have greater than or equal to

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.730
five elements.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:30.430
But on the other hand we know if
Y is a basis for V and X is

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.590
a basis, X also spans V.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.360
So we know that X has to have
fewer elements than Y.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.395
So we know that [typing]

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:49.010
Y's elements have to be greater
than X's elements,

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.170
because any spanning set has to
have more elements, or at

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:58.170
least as many elements, as a
basis set, X's elements.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:03.570
And then since X is a spanning
set, X's elements have to be

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.310
greater than or equal
to Y's elements,

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.560
because why is a basis.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.530
But if this guy's elements are
less than this guy's elements,

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.250
but it's also greater than or
equal to, we know that the

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:23.190
number of elements that X has--
X's elements, or the

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.180
cardinality or the number of
elements in it --is equal to

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.430
Y's elements.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:39.190
And so now that we know that any
basis for a vector space--

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.610
Let me just go back
to our set A.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:45.080
A is equal to a1 a2,
all the way to an.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:51.040
We can now say that any basis
for some vector, for some

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.700
subspace V, they all have the
same number of elements.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.770
And so we can define a
new term called the

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:03.510
dimension of V.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.270
Sometimes it's written just as
dimension of V, is equal to

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.530
the number of elements,
sometimes called the

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:17.670
cardinality, of any
basis of V.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.880
And I went through great pains
in this video to show that any

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.740
basis of V all has the same
number of elements, so this is

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.870
well-defined.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.120
You can't have one basis that
has five elements and

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:26.900
one that has six.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.920
By definition they would either
both have to have five,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.520
or they both would
have to have six.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.550
And so we can define
our dimensionality.
