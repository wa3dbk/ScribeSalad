00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.710
We came up with a process for
generating an orthonormal

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.515
basis in the last video, and
it wasn't a new discovery.

00:00:06.515 --> 00:00:08.650
It's called the Gram-Schmidt
process.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.760
But let's apply that now to
some real examples, and

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.590
hopefully, we'll see that it's
a lot more concrete than it

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.780
might have looked in
the last video.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:24.040
Let's say I have the plane x1
plus x2 plus x3 is equal to 0.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.200
This is a plane in R3.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.549
So let's just say that subspace
V is equal to the

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:41.370
plane defined by this guy right
here. x1 plus x2 plus x3

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.390
is equal to 0.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.760
All of the vectors in the
subspace, if you take their

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.190
entries and you add them up,
you're going to get 0.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.001
So first we need just any basis
for v, so let's see if

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.510
we can come up with that.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.750
So if we subtract x2 and x3
from both sides of this

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.060
equation, we know that x1
is going to be equal to

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.440
minus x2 minus x3.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.680
Or we could say that our
subspace V is equal to the set

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.240
of all of the vectors in R3--
x1, x2 and x3-- that satisfy

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.120
the equation, let's say,
minus-- well, let me

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.700
write it this way.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.770
Let's say that x2 is equal to
c1, and x3 is equal to c2.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.980
Then this equation would be x1
is equal to minus c1 minus c2.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.980
So if we write it that way, then
the subspace V is a set

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.860
of all of the vectors in R3
such that c1 times some

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.700
vector-- let me write it this
way-- c1 times-- let me write

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.880
it this way-- plus c2 times some
other vector, where c1

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.530
and c2 are any real numbers,
so c1 and c2 are a

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.890
member of the reals.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.600
And so what is x1? x1 is equal
to minus c1 minus c2.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.139
So x1 is equal to minus
1 c1, minus 1 c2.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.190
x2 is just equal to c1.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.550
So x2 is equal to 1 times
c1 plus 0 times c2.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.650
And then x3 is equal to c2, or
0 times c1 plus 1 times c2.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.040
So V is essentially the span of
these two vectors, all of

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.940
the linear combinations
of these two vectors.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.520
That would represent
that plane.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.490
So let me write it like this.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:39.580
So V is equal to the span of the
vectors minus 1, 1, 0, and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.480
the vector minus 1, 0, 1.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.350
And you can see that
these are linearly

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.750
independent right here.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.260
Obviously, there's no linear
combination of this guy that

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.090
can give you a 1 over here,
and there's no linear

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.290
combination of this
guy that'll give

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.950
you a 1 right there.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.010
So this is what V is.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.920
But what we want, the whole
reason why I'm making this

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.870
video, is to find an orthonormal
basis for V.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.990
This is just a basis.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.040
These guys right here are
just a basis for V.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.480
Let's find an orthonormal
basis.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.860
Let's call this vector up here,
let's call that v1, and

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.370
let's call this vector
right here v2.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.480
So if we wanted to find an
orthonormal basis for the span

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.520
of v1-- let me write
this down.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.150
Let me define some subspace V1
is equal to the span of just

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.910
my vector v1.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.740
Well, we saw in the last video,
if we just divide v1 by

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.640
its length, then the span of
that vector is going to be a

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.280
unit vector, and it's going to
be the same thing as the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.050
subspace V1.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.970
It's this line in R3.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.660
So let's do that.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.110
What is the length of v1?

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.870
The length of v1 is equal to
the square root of minus 1

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.030
squared, which is 1, plus 1
squared, which is 1, plus 0

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.650
squared, which is 0, so it's
equal to the square root of 2.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.030
So let's define some vector u1
is equal to 1 divided by the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.010
length of v1, so 1 over the
square root of 2 times v1,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.720
times minus 1, 1, 0.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.029
Then the span of v1 is
just the same thing

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.530
as the span of u1.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.620
And so this would be an
orthonormal basis.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.930
Just this vector right here
would be an orthonormal basis

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.600
for just the span of v1.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.880
But we don't want just the span
of v1, we want the span

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.910
of v1 and v2.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.230
Let me just draw it.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.210
So right now, we have a basis,
if I just do u1.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.690
I'm not going to actually draw
what this looks like.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.900
Maybe it looks something like
this, and its span is this

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.150
entire line in R3.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.860
The span of just one vector in
Rn is just going to be all the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.600
scalar multiples of it
or a line in Rn.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.310
So this right here is
the subspace V1.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.700
Now, we have a v2 here, which
is linearly independent from

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.690
this guy, which means it's
linearly independent from this

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.360
guy, because he's just a scaled
version of this guy.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.480
So v2 is going to
look like that.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.510
That is v2 right there.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.070
This, of course, was our u1.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.350
And what we want to do is we
want to find a subspace V.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.690
I'll call it V2 for now.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:31.530
V2 is equal to the span of v1
and v2, which is the same

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.720
thing as the span-- anything
that's spanned by v1 is also

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.860
spanned by u1-- the
span of u1 and v2.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.090
So we want to see everything
that could be generated by

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.480
linear combinations
of u1 and v2.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.300
And obviously, this thing right
here is our plane that

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.930
we're talking about.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.330
The span of these two guys,
that is the whole subspace

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.540
that we're talking about
in this problem.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.630
So that is equal to V.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.550
So once we find this, if we find
an orthonormal version

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.215
for this span, we're done.

00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:02.900
So how can we do that?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.140
Well, if I can find a vector
that's orthogonal to all of

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.380
the linear combinations of this,
that if I add up some

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.040
linear combination of this to
that vector, I can get v2, I

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.480
can replace v2 with
that vector.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.890
So we can call that vector
right there y2, right?

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.680
If I can determine a y2, this
y2 is clearly orthogonal to

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.490
everything over here, and I can
take some vector in v1, in

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.220
this line, and add it to y2,
and I can get to v2.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.390
So combinations of these guys
are just as good as v2.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:41.180
So this is going to be equal
to the span of u1 and y2.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.330
Now what is y2 equal to?

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.930
Well, we saw in the last
video, this is just a

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.630
projection of v2.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.640
This vector right here is the
projection of v2 onto the

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.370
subspace V1.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.870
And how do we figure out
what that-- and then

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.910
what would y2 be?

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.110
y2 would be v2 minus that.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:06.840
So y2 is equal to v2 minus the
projection of v2 onto v1.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.430
Or if, we were to actually write
it out, what is that

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.060
going to be equal to?

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.870
So it's going to be equal to--
v2 is this vector right here.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.050
So it's minus 1, 0, 2.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.370
That is v2.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.820
v2 minus the projection
of v2 onto v1.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.190
Well the projection of the
vector v2 onto the subspace V1

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:35.780
is just v2, minus 1, 0, 0,
dotted with the orthonormal

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.690
basis for v1.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.655
The orthonormal basis
for v1 is just u1.

00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:43.620
And we solved for u1 up here,
so that's going to be that

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.890
dotted with 1 over the square
root of 2 times-- let me do

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.450
that in yellow, actually,
just so you can see

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.490
that this is u1.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.690
So dotting it with u1, so
dotting it with 1 over the

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:00.780
square root of 2 times minus 1,
1, 0-- I like leaving the 1

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.670
over the square root of 2 out of
there, just to keep things

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.960
simple-- all of that divided
by-- actually,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.720
not divided by anything.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.680
Because we if we were doing a
projection of a line, it would

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.080
be divided by the dot product of
the orthonormal basis with

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.360
itself, but its length is 1, so
we don't have that, and we

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.150
saw that before.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.310
Actually let me-- let me write
this a little bit.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.700
I'll just move it down.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.630
Let me see if I can move it.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.370
It's just equal to
that guy, right?

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.850
Let me make the numbers clear.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:39.130
This is v2 minus the projection
of v2 onto the

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:39.880
subspace 1.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:46.840
So that's just v2 dotted with
my orthonormal basis for v1,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.680
my first vector in my
orthonormal basis.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.830
There's only one, so I'm only
going to have one term here,

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.960
and then all of that times
my orthonormal

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.950
basis vector for v1.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.050
So 1 over the square
root of 2 times the

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.070
vector minus 1, 1, 0.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.860
Now this looks really fancy.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.420
This right here is our
orthonormal basis for the

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.020
subspace V1, but what does
this simplify to?

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.450
So this is going to be equal
to-- remember, this right

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.120
here, this piece right
there, that's the

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.970
projection onto v1 of v2.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.230
That's what that was
right there.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:29.880
So this is going to be equal to
the vector minus 1, 0, 1,

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.140
minus-- now, I can take the 1
over the square root of 2 on

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.620
the outside.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.470
Actually, I can take both of
these onto the outside.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.385
So 1 over the square root of 2
times 1 over the square root

00:09:37.385 --> 00:09:41.670
of 2, it's just going to
be 1 over 2, right?

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:47.270
So this is going to be minus
1/2 times these guys dotted

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.580
with each other.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.430
Let me just write it this way.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.600
So what is these guys dotted
with each other?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.070
It's just going to
be a number.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.760
Minus 1 times minus 1 is 1,
plus 0 times 1, so plus 0,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.440
plus 1 times 0, so plus 0.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.440
All of that times-- well, we
already used this part of it,

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.810
so we just have this part
left over-- times minus

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.700
1, 1, and the 0.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.420
This was the dot product, and
we took the two scaling

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.110
factors out.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.830
When you multiply them you got
1/2, so this is just going to

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.440
be a 1, which simplifies
things.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:25.680
So this is going to be equal to
the vector minus 1, 0, 1,

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:32.350
minus 1/2 times this, or we
could just write-- 1/2 times

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.150
minus 1 is minus 1/2.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.190
We have 1/2 and then
we have 0.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.120
And so this is going to
be equal to minus

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.010
1, minus minus 1/2.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.220
That's plus 1/2, so that's going
to be just minus 1/2.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.050
0 minus 1/2 is minus 1/2.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.120
And then 1 minus 0 is just 1.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.790
So this right here
is our vector y2.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:04.320
And if you combined u1 right
here and y2, we are spanning

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.930
our subspace V.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.000
But we don't have an orthonormal
basis yet.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.490
These guys are orthogonal with
respect to each other, but

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.840
this guy does not have
length 1 yet.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.500
So to make it equal to length
1, let's replace him.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:22.700
Let's define another vector u2
that's equal to 1 over the

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:29.820
length of y2 times y2.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.320
So what is the length of y2?

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:38.290
The length of y2 is equal to the
square root of minus 1/2

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:45.160
squared is 1/4, plus
1 squared.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.930
So it's the square root
of 1 and 1/2, or 3/2.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:54.060
So it's equal to the square
root of 3/2, right?

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.250
Yeah, this is 1/2 plus 1 is
1 and 1/2, which is 3/2.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.080
So it's equal to the
square root of 3/2.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.806
So if I defined u2, u2 is equal
to 1 over the square

00:12:07.806 --> 00:12:11.120
root of 3/2, or that's the same
thing as the square root

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:18.060
of 2/3 times y2, which is this
guy right here, minus 1/2,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.470
minus 1/2, and 1.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.420
And I already had defined
u1 up here.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.680
u1 was right up here.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.540
Let me copy and paste.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.180
Actually, I think I can
just move it down.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.140
So I found u1 right here.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:44.930
We now have two vectors that are
orthogonal with respect to

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:45.950
each other.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.870
So if I have the set of
u1 and u2, these guys

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.410
both have length 1.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.620
They are orthogonal with respect
to each other, and

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.410
they span V.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:03.030
So this is an orthonormal basis
for the plane that we

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.340
started this video
out with: for V.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.030
And we're done.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.650
We have done the Gram-Schmidt
process.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.390
These are our new orthonormal
basis vectors.
