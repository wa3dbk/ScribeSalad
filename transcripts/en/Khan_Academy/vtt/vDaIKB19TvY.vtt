00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.280
We now hopefully know a little about variables

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.436
and as we covered in the last video, a variable can be

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:08.834
really any symbol, although we typically use letters

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:11.510
because we're used to writing and typing letters.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.193
But it can be anything from an x, to a y, a z, an a, a b,

00:00:17.193 --> 00:00:20.833
and oftentimes we start using greek letters like theta.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:22.826
But you can really use any symbol to say

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:24.090
Hey, this is going to vary

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.300
You can take on multiple values

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.767
But out of all of all of these

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.759
The one that is most typically used in algebra

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.754
Or really in all of mathematics

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:33.703
is the variable "x"

00:00:33.703 --> 00:00:36.471
Although all of these are used to some degree

00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.168
But given that x is used so heavily

00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:42.757
it does introduce a slight problem.

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:46.247
And that problem is that it looks a lot like the multiplication symbol

00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:48.501
Or the one that we use in arithmetic

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:49.924
So in arithmetic

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.209
if I want to write 2 x 3

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:53.635
I literally write "2 x 3"

00:00:53.635 --> 00:00:55.481
But now that we are starting to use variables,

00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:57.489
if I want to write "2 times x"

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.916
Well if I use this as the multiplication symbol

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:01.533
it would be 2 times x

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.491
And the times symbol and the X

00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:05.593
look awfully similar

00:01:05.593 --> 00:01:08.747
and if I'm not really careful with my penmanship

00:01:08.747 --> 00:01:10.248
it can get very confusing.

00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:11.348
Is this "Two x x"?

00:01:11.348 --> 00:01:13.301
Is this "two times times something"?

00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:15.689
What exactly is going on here?

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.023
And because this is confusing,

00:01:18.023 --> 00:01:21.729
This, right over here, is extremely confusing

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.967
And it can be misinterpreted,

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:28.636
We tend not to use this multiplication symbol

00:01:28.636 --> 00:01:31.101
When we are doing algebra

00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:33.683
Instead of that, to represent multiplication,

00:01:33.683 --> 00:01:35.971
We have several options.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.692
Instead of writing two times x this way,

00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:45.831
we could write 2 dot x.

00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:48.434
And this dot, I want to be very clear,

00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:50.683
This is not a decimal

00:01:50.683 --> 00:01:52.903
This is just written a little bit higher

00:01:52.903 --> 00:01:54.911
And we write this so we don't get confusion

00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:57.700
in between this and one of these variables right here.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.324
But this can really be interpreted as "2 times x"

00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:02.748
So for example, if someone says

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:06.995
2 dot x, when x is equal to 3,

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:09.762
well this would be the same thing

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.409
as two times three, when x is equal to three.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:13.825
Another way you could write it is

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:16.574
You could write "2" and then you could write the x in parentheses

00:02:16.574 --> 00:02:18.494
right next to it.

00:02:18.494 --> 00:02:22.221
This is also interpreted as 2 times x

00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:23.285
Once again, so in this situation

00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:24.504
If "x" were seven, this would be

00:02:24.504 --> 00:02:27.294
two times seven, or fourteen

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:29.671
And the most traditional way of doing it

00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:32.302
is to just write the x right after the 2.

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:35.669
And sometimes this will be read as "2x"

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:39.568
But this literally does mean "Two times x"

00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:41.633
And you might say, how come we didn't always do that?

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:44.247
Well it would be literally confusing if we did it over here.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.501
Instead of writing "2 times 3"

00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:48.272
And wrote "2 3"

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:49.894
Well, that looks like "23".

00:02:49.894 --> 00:02:51.253
This doesn't look like two times three

00:02:51.253 --> 00:02:52.633
And this is why we never did it.

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:54.365
But here, since we're using a letter now,

00:02:54.365 --> 00:02:57.579
It's clear that this isn't a part of that number.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.354
This isn't "twenty something"

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:02.838
This is two times this variable x.

00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:05.900
So all of these are really the same expression.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.070
Two times x, two times x, and two times x.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.163
And so with that out of the way

00:03:10.163 --> 00:03:13.554
Let's try some few worked examples, a few practice problems

00:03:13.554 --> 00:03:14.895
And this will hopefully prepare you for the

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.215
next exercise

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:18.034
Where you'll get a lot of chances to practice this.

00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:24.702
So if I where to say "what is 10 minus three y"

00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:29.636
And what does this equal when "y" is equal to two

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:31.821
Well, every time you see the "y"

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:32.833
You'd want that 2 there

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:35.636
So this is y is equal to 2.

00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:37.298
Let's set that y equal to two

00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:41.368
This is the same thing as 10 minus three times two

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:43.503
You do the multiplication first.

00:03:43.503 --> 00:03:46.369
Multiplication takes precedence in order of operations

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.829
So three times two is six,

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.215
Ten minus six is equal to four.

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:54.414
Let's do another one.

00:03:54.414 --> 00:04:08.073
Let's say we had "7x minus 4"

00:04:08.073 --> 00:04:14.970
And we want to evaluate that when

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.861
when x is equal to three.

00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:22.169
Where we see the x, we want to put the 3 there

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:29.221
So this is the same thing as "7 times 3"

00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:34.168
And I'll actually use this notation, so seven times three minus four.

00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:37.250
And once again, multiplication takes precedence

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.104
by order of operations, over addition or subtraction

00:04:40.104 --> 00:04:41.701
So we want to do the multiplying first

00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:43.970
7 times 3 is 21

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.233
21 minus 4 is equal to 17.

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:50.263
So hopefully that gives you a little bit of background,

00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:52.763
and I really encourage you to try the next exercise,

00:04:52.763 --> 00:04:54.367
It will give you a lot of practice

00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:56.357
on being to evaluate expressions like this.
