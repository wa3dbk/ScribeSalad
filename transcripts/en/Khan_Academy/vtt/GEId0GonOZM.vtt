00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.740
Think about this real
world problem.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.660
To estimate the population of a
town in upcoming years, one

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.670
of the town workers collected
populations from past years

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.000
and made this table.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.210
So they have years starting
with 1950 and going up by

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.310
increments of 10 years.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.130
And they just figure out the
population of the town in each

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.400
of those years.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.040
The town wants to estimate
the population for

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.950
2015, 2018, and 2020.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.930
To do this, will you be using
inductive reasoning or

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.510
deductive reasoning?

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.100
Now before answering that, let's
just think about what

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.850
inductive reasoning is and what
deductive reasoning is.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.530
Inductive reasoning is looking
for a pattern or

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.940
looking for a trend.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.220
So it's looking for a trend
or a pattern and then

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.510
generalizing.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.640
You could imagine, it's kind
of extrapolating the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.350
information you have,
generalizing.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.470
Deductive reasoning is taking
some set of data or some set

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.170
of facts and using that to
come up with other, or

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.790
deducing some other, facts
that you know are true.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.230
When you generalize you don't
know necessarily whether the

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.740
trend will continue, but
you assume it will.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.850
You don't know 100%
it'll be true.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.050
With deductive reasoning,
you know it'll be true.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.300
You're starting with facts.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.250
And then you're deducing other
facts from those facts.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.200
Other facts that you
know are true.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.230
Now, when the town is
estimating, and that's kind of

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.570
a clue that they're not going
to know the exact population

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.990
for 2015, 2018, and 2020.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.060
But when they estimate the
population for these years,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.670
these years are in the future.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.120
They don't know what
the population

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.370
will be in those years.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.900
The best they can do is see
the trend of growth here,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.050
maybe see what percentage it's
growing every 10 years.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.720
Or what the absolute number of
growth is every 10 years.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.730
And maybe they can continue
that trend out to

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.740
2015, 2018, and 2020.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.320
So they'll be looking for trend
in growth over this

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.480
60-year period.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.360
And then they'll generalize
it out to these years.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.470
So this will be inductive
reasoning.
