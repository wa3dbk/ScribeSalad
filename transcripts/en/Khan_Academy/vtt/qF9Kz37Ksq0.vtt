00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:01.821
- [Voiceover] So after
introducing the idea

00:00:01.821 --> 00:00:04.294
of fluid rotation in a
vector field like this,

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:06.499
let's start tightening up
our grasp on this intuition

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:09.460
to get something that we can
actually apply formulas to.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.062
So a vector field like
the one that I had there,

00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:13.523
that's two-dimensional,
is given by a function

00:00:13.523 --> 00:00:15.114
that has a two-dimensional input

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:17.297
and a two-dimensional output.

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:19.340
And it's common to write the
components of that output

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.300
as the functions p and q.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.123
So, each one of those p and q,

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:27.722
takes in two different
variables as it's input.

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.963
P and q.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:33.121
And what I want to do here, is
talk about this idea of curl

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:37.566
and you might write it down as just curl,

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.096
curl of v, the vector field.

00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:43.161
Which takes in the same inputs
that the vector field does.

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:45.240
And because this is the
two-dimensional example,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.343
I might write,

00:00:46.343 --> 00:00:48.119
just to distinguish it from
three-dimensional curl,

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:51.242
which is something we'll get
later on, two d curl of v.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:53.866
So you're kind of thinking of
this as a differential thing,

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.526
in the same way that you have, you know,

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:59.764
a derivative, dx is gonna take
in some kind of a function.

00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:01.703
And you give it a function and
it gives you a new function,

00:01:01.703 --> 00:01:02.620
the derivative.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.360
Here, you think of this 2d
curl, as like an operator,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.438
you give it a function,
a vector field function,

00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:09.365
and it gives you another function,

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:12.604
which in this case will be scalar valued.

00:01:12.604 --> 00:01:13.626
And the reason it's scalar valued,

00:01:13.626 --> 00:01:15.263
is because at every given point,

00:01:15.263 --> 00:01:16.645
you want it to give you a number.

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:18.340
So if I look back at the vector field,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.582
that I have here,

00:01:19.582 --> 00:01:21.277
we want, that at a point like this,

00:01:21.277 --> 00:01:23.146
where there's a lot of
counter-clockwise rotation

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.865
happening around it, for the curl function

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:26.803
to return a positive number.

00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:28.545
But at a point like
this, where there's some,

00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:31.599
where there's clockwise
rotation happening around it,

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:35.082
you want the curl to
return a negative number.

00:01:35.082 --> 00:01:37.659
So, let's start thinking
about what that should mean.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:38.959
And a good way to understand this

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.085
two-dimensional curl function

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:41.502
and start to get a feel for it,

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:45.159
is to imagine the
quintessential 2d curl scenario.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.262
Well let's say you have a point

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:48.444
and this here's going to be our point, xy,

00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:49.802
sitting of somewhere in space.

00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:51.846
And let's say there's no
vector attached to it,

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:55.619
as in the values, p and
q, and x and y, are zero.

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.266
And then let's say that
to the right of it,

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:00.298
you have a vector pointing straight up.

00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:02.260
Above it, in the vector field,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.257
you have a vector pointing
straight to the left,

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:07.067
to it's left, you have one
pointing straight down,

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:10.457
and below it, you have one
pointing straight to the right.

00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:11.966
So in terms of the
functions, what that means,

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:13.638
is this vector, to it's right,

00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:15.461
whatever point it's evaluated at,

00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:18.839
that's gonna be q is greater than zero.

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.638
So this function q, that
corresponds to the y component,

00:02:21.638 --> 00:02:23.646
the up and down component of each vector,

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:25.202
when you evaluate it at this point,

00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:26.723
to the right of our xy point,

00:02:26.723 --> 00:02:28.859
q's gonna be greater than zero.

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.262
Where as if you evaluate
it to the left over here,

00:02:31.262 --> 00:02:35.116
q would be less than zero, less than zero,

00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:38.879
in our kind of, perfect curl
will be positive example.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.086
And then these bottom guys,

00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:42.025
if you start thinking
about what this means for,

00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:43.604
you'd have a rightward vector below,

00:02:43.604 --> 00:02:45.508
and a leftward vector above,

00:02:45.508 --> 00:02:48.318
the one below it, whatever
point you're evaluating that at,

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:50.524
p, which gives us the kind of,

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:52.021
left right component of these vectors,

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:54.157
since it's the first
component of the output,

00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:56.108
would have to be positive.

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:58.580
And then above it, above it here,

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.821
when you evaluate p at that point,

00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:02.702
would have to be negative.

00:03:02.702 --> 00:03:04.827
Where as p, if you did it on
the left and right points,

00:03:04.827 --> 00:03:07.467
would be equal to zero because
there's no x component.

00:03:07.467 --> 00:03:09.878
And similarly q, if you did it
on the top and bottom points,

00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:12.316
since there's no up and down
component of those vectors,

00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:13.593
would also be zero.

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.636
So this is just the, the very specific,

00:03:15.636 --> 00:03:18.156
almost contrived scenario
that I'm looking at.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:21.232
And I want to say, hey if this
should have positive curl,

00:03:21.232 --> 00:03:23.752
maybe if we look at the information,

00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:25.748
the partial derivative
information to be specific,

00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:28.454
about p and q, in a scenario like this,

00:03:28.454 --> 00:03:31.716
it'll give us a way to
quantify the idea of curl.

00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:33.052
And first let's look at p.

00:03:33.052 --> 00:03:35.734
So p starts positive, and as y increases,

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:38.218
as the y value of our input increases,

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.712
it goes from being positive
to zero, to negative.

00:03:41.712 --> 00:03:44.232
So we would expect, that
the partial derivative of p,

00:03:44.232 --> 00:03:46.136
with respect to y,

00:03:46.136 --> 00:03:48.957
so as we change that y component,
moving up in the plane,

00:03:48.957 --> 00:03:52.150
and look at the x
component of the vectors,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.669
that should be negative.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.016
That should be negative in circumstances

00:03:56.016 --> 00:03:57.618
where we want positive curl.

00:03:57.618 --> 00:03:59.289
So all of this we're looking at cases,

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.913
you know the quintessential
case where curl is positive.

00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:03.632
So evidently, this is a fact,

00:04:03.632 --> 00:04:05.455
that corresponds to positive curl.

00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:07.556
Where as q, let's take a look at q.

00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:09.576
It starts negative,
when you're at the left.

00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:12.514
And then becomes zero,
then it becomes positive.

00:04:12.514 --> 00:04:16.019
So here, as x increases, q increases.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.353
So we're expecting that a
partial derivative of q,

00:04:18.353 --> 00:04:22.730
with respect to x, should be positive.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.797
Or at the very least,
the situations where,

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:27.188
the partial derivative of q
with respect to x is positive,

00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:31.113
corresponds to positive
two-dimensional curl.

00:04:31.113 --> 00:04:32.657
And in fact, it turns out,

00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:34.956
these guys tell us all you need to know.

00:04:34.956 --> 00:04:36.418
We can say as a formula,

00:04:36.418 --> 00:04:41.418
that the 2d curl, 2d curl,
of our vector field v,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.738
as a function of x and y,

00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:50.721
is equal to the partial
derivative of q with respect to x.

00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:54.378
Partial derivative of
q, with respect to x,

00:04:54.378 --> 00:04:56.804
and then I'm gonna subtract
off the partial of p,

00:04:56.804 --> 00:04:58.116
with respect to y.

00:04:58.116 --> 00:04:59.567
Because I want, when this is negative,

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:02.377
for that to correspond
with more positive 2d curl.

00:05:02.377 --> 00:05:05.697
So I'm gonna subtract off, partial of p,

00:05:05.697 --> 00:05:08.867
with respect to y.

00:05:08.867 --> 00:05:10.144
And this right here,

00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:13.046
is the formula for two-dimensional curl.

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:14.845
Which basically, you can
think of it as a measure,

00:05:14.845 --> 00:05:16.041
at any given point you're asking,

00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:18.839
how much does the surrounding
information to that point,

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.604
look like this set-up,

00:05:20.604 --> 00:05:23.680
like this perfect
counter-clockwise rotation set-up?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.097
And the more it looks like this set-up,

00:05:25.097 --> 00:05:27.802
the more this value will be positive.

00:05:27.802 --> 00:05:29.044
And if it was the opposite of this,

00:05:29.044 --> 00:05:30.716
if each of the vectors was turned around

00:05:30.716 --> 00:05:32.016
and you have clockwise rotation,

00:05:32.016 --> 00:05:34.304
each of these values
will become the negative

00:05:34.304 --> 00:05:35.744
of what it had been before.

00:05:35.744 --> 00:05:38.379
So 2d curl would end up being negative.

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.877
And in the next video,
I'll show some examples

00:05:39.877 --> 00:05:42.913
of what it looks like to use this formula.
