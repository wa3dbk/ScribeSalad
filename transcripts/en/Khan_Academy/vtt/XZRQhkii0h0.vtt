00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:02.574
You already know that we can view

00:00:02.574 --> 00:00:04.768
multiplication as repeated addition.

00:00:04.768 --> 00:00:08.894
So, if we had 2 times 3 (2 × 3), we could literally

00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:11.828
view this as 3 2's being added together.

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:16.645
So it could be 2 + 2 + 2.

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:20.270
Notice this is [COUNTING: 1, 2] 3 2's.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.736
And when you add those 2's together, you get 6.

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:26.376
What we're going to introduce you to

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:30.659
in this video is the idea of repeated multiplication –

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.601
a new operation that really can be

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.336
viewed as repeated multiplication.

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:39.544
And that's the operation of taking an 'exponent.'

00:00:39.544 --> 00:00:41.675
And it sounds very fancy.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:42.958
But we'll see with a few examples

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.659
that it's not too bad.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.635
So now, let's take the idea of

00:00:46.635 --> 00:00:50.104
2 to the 3rd power (2^3) –

00:00:50.104 --> 00:00:51.097
which is how we would say this.

00:00:51.097 --> 00:00:52.045
(So let me write this down

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:53.713
in the appropriate colors.)

00:00:53.713 --> 00:00:57.537
So 2 to the 3rd power. (2^3.)

00:00:57.537 --> 00:00:59.026
So you might be tempted to say,

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:01.491
"Hey, maybe this is 2 × 3, which would be 6."

00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:02.553
But remember, I just said

00:01:02.553 --> 00:01:04.527
this is repeated multiplication.

00:01:04.527 --> 00:01:07.196
So if I have 2 to the 3rd power, (2^3),

00:01:07.196 --> 00:01:11.065
this literally means multiplying 3 2's together.

00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:15.013
So this would be equal to,

00:01:15.013 --> 00:01:18.510
not 2 + 2 + 2, but 2 × ...

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.538
(And I’ll use a little dot to signify multiplication.)

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:24.276
... 2 × 2 × 2.

00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:27.202
Well, what's 2 × 2 × 2?

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:29.230
Well that is equal to 8.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.365
(2 × 2 × 2 = 8.)

00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:35.268
So 2 to the 3rd power is equal to 8. (2^3 = 8.)

00:01:35.268 --> 00:01:37.813
Let's try a few more examples here.

00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:45.598
What is 3 to the 2nd power (3^2)

00:01:45.598 --> 00:01:47.183
going to be equal to?

00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:48.970
And I'll let you think about that for a second.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.454
I encourage you to pause the video.

00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:52.829
So let's think it through.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.084
This literally means multiplying 2 3's.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.573
So let's multiply 3 –

00:02:00.573 --> 00:02:02.810
(Let me do that in yellow.)

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.093
Let's multiply 3 × 3.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:11.197
So this is going to be equal to 9.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.979
Let’s do a few more examples.

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:19.938
What is, say, 5 to the – let's say –

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:23.421
5 to the 4th power (5^4)?

00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:24.212
And what you'll see here is

00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:25.378
this number is going to get

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:27.635
large very, very, very fast.

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:30.090
So 5 to the 4th power (5^4) is going to be

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.399
equal to multiplying 4 5's together.

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:38.649
So 5^4 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5.

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:40.822
Notice, we have [COUNTING: 1, 2, 3] 4 5's.

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:42.110
And we are multiplying them.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.971
We are not adding them.

00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:44.416
This is not 5 × 4.

00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:45.668
This is not 20.

00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:47.962
This is 5 × 5 × 5 × 5.

00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:49.658
So what is this going to be?

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:52.413
Well 5 × 5 is 25. (5 × 5 = 25.)

00:02:52.413 --> 00:02:56.573
25 × 5 is 125. (25 × 5 = 125.)

00:02:56.573 --> 00:03:01.531
125 × 5 is 625. (125 × 5 = 625.)
