00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.370
Welcome back.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.030
Well we left off on
problem number 13.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.170
But let me start it over just so
that we don't get confused

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.320
kind of doing the problem over
the course of two videos.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.680
So number 13.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.990
It starts off with
this pattern.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.070
3, 5, minus 5.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.330
And what it says in the problem
is that each even

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.650
number term is 2 more than
the previous term.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.580
And then each odd number term
is negative 1 times the

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.430
previous term.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.950
So we started with 3.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.400
So let me say term-- let me
write it here, term-- term and

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.650
then value.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.630
And then what we did.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.970
Maybe we could call that
f of x or the function.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.940
How did we go from one
value to the next?

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.080
So if we make a table,
term one is value 3.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.850
And that's just the
starting one.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.800
Term two is 5.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.540
That's because we added
2, we added 2 to 3.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.840
We could write 3 plus
2 is equal to 5.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.450
Term three is minus 5.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:29.070
And that's because minus 1 times
this 5-- let me draw

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.500
these arrows-- is equal
to minus 5.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.920
And then we add again-- I'm
going to switch colors just to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.170
keep it interesting.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.220
So term four is going to be
minus 5 plus 2, which

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.470
equals minus 3.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:01.380
Then term five is going to be
minus 3 times minus 1, which

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.640
equals 3 again.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.180
Right?

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.750
And I think you see how we're
getting these patterns.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.860
You just keep switching
between adding 2 and

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.380
multiplying by negative 1.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.040
And then so term six is
going to be what?

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.360
It's going to be this
plus 2, which is 5.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.650
I think you're seeing
the pattern again.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.960
Let me do a bunch more and
I'll do it outside of the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.150
scope of this chart.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.500
The term seven is going
to be what?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.180
It's going to be minus 1
times that, so minus 5.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.450
And you see the pattern now.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.820
Term eight is going
to be minus 3.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.580
Term nine is going to be what?

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.540
Minus 3, minus 3.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.310
So here we added 2 so we
multiply it by negative 1.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.100
So it's going to be 3 again.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.540
And you could just experiment
with yourself.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.670
Once you understand how soon.
the sequence works, do a bunch

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.370
of terms until you
see a cycle.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.130
And that's the key thing.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.250
In any SAT problem, when
they ask you like what

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.800
is the 100th term?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.260
It's going to have a cycle
because they don't expect you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.000
to sit and write out 100
terms because you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.210
would run out of time.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.520
So if they ask you the 100th
term, the pattern probably

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.030
repeats every three or four or
five or, at most, six terms.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.490
And then you can use that
to figure out what

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.630
the 100th term is.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.780
So here we see that the pattern
repeats-- let's see,

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.340
3, 5, negative 5, negative 3.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.590
3, 5, negative 5,
negative 3, 3.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.900
So we see it repeats every
fourth term, right?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.170
This is kind of one cycle, then
3, 5, negative 3, and

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.590
this is another cycle.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.760
So it has this four pattern.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.950
So can we come up with any term
that is a multiple of 4,

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.120
what is our value?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.070
Well at 4 our value
is minus 3.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.940
What's the next multiple of 4?

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.160
8.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.560
At 8 our value's minus 3.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.780
So in general-- and if we did
12 we'd also get minus 3.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.070
If you don't believe me
you should try it out.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.730
So at any multiple of 4, we
know our value is minus 3.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:16.500
So what I do is, they want
to know the 55th term.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.750
So what term is a multiple of
4 that's closest to 55?

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.610
Let's see, is 56 a
multiple of 4?

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.800
Yeah.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.240
56-- that's 10.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.330
14 times 4 is 56, right?

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.800
So the 56th term, we know the
56th term because 56 is a

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.940
multiple of 4, just like
4 and 8 and 12.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.980
So the 56th term-- I have
trouble saying that.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.175
Maybe I have a little lisp.

00:04:45.175 --> 00:04:47.540
56th term is negative
3, right?

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.640
Because it's a multiple of 4.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.900
If the 56th term is negative
3, what is the 55th term?

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.260
Well the term before the
negative 3 term is always the

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.700
negative 5 term, right?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.830
Up here, negative 3?

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.820
It's always negative 5.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.880
So the answer is negative
5 is the 55th term, and

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.910
that is choice A.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.780
Very good.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.685
All right, let's move on
to the next question.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.690
I know that one's a little hard,
and those you always

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.630
just have to experiment a little
bit, try to see the

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.150
cycle, and then make sure you
have your terms right.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.860
You know that you're starting
on the first term as opposed

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.820
to the 0 term.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.190
And then figure out what the
easiest value is as close what

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.080
they're asking as possible and
then you can kind of move

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.310
backwards or forwards.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.180
That's how I do it.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.120
That's so you don't get too
confused with the shifts on

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.320
the terms.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.300
All right, number 14.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.190
In the xy plane, the equation
you of line l is-- let me

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.910
write that down-- number 14.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:56.730
The equation of line l is
y is equal to 2x plus 5.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.920
If the line m is the reflection
of l in the x-axis,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.980
what is the equation
of line m?

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.570
So I'm going to draw a graph
for you, just so you

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.540
understand what I'm doing.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.690
But on the real SAT you really
don't have to do this because

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.120
you wouldn't want to
run out of time.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.610
Oh man, I'm going to run out
of time if I can't draw a

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.430
straight line.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.770
I'm being a stickler for this.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.260
Oh, I still couldn't do it.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.510
I'll move forward.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.200
So this line, so y
equals 2x plus 5.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.810
So if you remember from our
slope and y-intercept modules,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.120
the y-intercept's going
to be 5, right here.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.530
And then the line's going
to have a slope of 2.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.330
Right?

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.253
So the line's going to look
something like this.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.960
That's line l.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.890
This is line l.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.740
And then we want to know, they
say line m is the reflection

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.240
of l in the x-axis.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.280
So reflection would
kind of be the

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.540
x-axis-- this is the x-axis.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.860
So it's like if we were looking
at this in a pool of

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.380
water, the reflection would be
like if you took this and

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.180
flipped it over the x-axis.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.120
So the line m is going to look
something like this.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.650
Line m is going to
look like this.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:33.570
So a couple of things.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.060
It's like the mirror image.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.920
If we flipped it, it's like we
flipped it over the axis.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.210
So if the y-intercept here is
5, the y-intercept here is

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.076
going to be minus 5.

00:07:46.076 --> 00:07:46.680
Right?

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.870
Because we just flipped it.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:53.210
And similarly, if every one
this moves up 2, right,

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.110
because that's at slope.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.670
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.280
2.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.340
For every one we move here
to the right we're

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.830
going to go down 2.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.670
So the slope is going to be
the negative of this or

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.240
negative 2.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.165
So line m, so this is line m,
the equation of line m's going

00:08:07.165 --> 00:08:09.480
to be y is equal to-- it's going
to have the negative

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.500
slope, right?

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.140
The same slope, but
it just moves in

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.100
the downward direction.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.220
So it's going to be minus 2x.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.150
And then its y-intercept is--
instead of plus 5 it's going

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.320
to be minus 5.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.130
Minus 2x minus 5.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.990
And that is choice A.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.190
Looks like the next problem
involves a lot of drawing, and

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.440
I only have a minute and a
half left in this video.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.330
So I will do the next problem
in the next video.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.950
I will see
