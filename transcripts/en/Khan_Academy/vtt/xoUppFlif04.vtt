00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
 

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.310
So where I left off in the last
video, I'd just rewritten

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.440
the spring equation.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.900
And I just wrote force is
mass times acceleration.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.980
And I was in the process of
saying, well if x is a

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.000
function of t, what's
acceleration?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.170
Well, velocity is this
derivative of x with respect

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.790
to time, right?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.060
Your change in position
over change of time.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.350
And acceleration is the
derivative of velocity, or the

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.635
second derivative of position.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:29.350
So you take the derivative
twice of x of t, right?

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.930
So let's rewrite this equation
in those terms. Let me erase

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.570
all this--I actually want to
keep all of this, just so we

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.710
remember what we're talking
about this whole time.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.800
Let me see if I can
erase it cleanly.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.050
That's pretty good.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.260
 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.270
Let me erase all of this.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.600
 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.850
All of this.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.100
I'll even erase this.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.430
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.280
That's pretty good, all right.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.350
Now back to work.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.070
So, we know that-- or hopefully
we know-- that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.390
acceleration is the second
derivative of x as

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.060
a function of t.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.910
So we can rewrite this as
mass times the second

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.290
derivative of x.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.870
So I'll write that as-- well,
I think the easiest notation

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.940
would just be x prime prime.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.640
That's just the second
derivative of x as

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.180
a function of t.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.530
I'll write the function
notation, just so you remember

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.190
this is a function of time.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.520
Is equal to minus
k times x of t.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.080
And what you see here, what
I've just written, this is

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.270
actually a differential
equation.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.650
And so what is a differential
equation?

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.030
Well, it's an equation where,
in one expression, or in one

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.560
equation, on both sides of
this, you not only have a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.100
function, but you have
derivatives of that function.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.670
And the solution to a
differential equation isn't

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.880
just a number, right?

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.250
A solution to equations that
we've done in the past are

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.420
numbers, essentially, or a set
of numbers, or maybe a line.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.660
But the solution to differential
equations is

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.250
actually going to be a function,
or a class of

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.470
functions, or a set
of functions.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.700
So it'll take a little time to
get your head around it, but

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.100
this is as good an example as
ever to be exposed to it.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.390
And we're not going to solve
this differential equation

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.130
analytically.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.550
We're going to use our intuition
behind what we did

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.710
earlier in the previous video.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.040
We're going to use that to guess
at what a solution to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.710
this differential equation is.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.070
And then, if it works out, then
we'll have a little bit

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.640
more intuition.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.140
And then we'll actually know
what the position is, at any

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.870
given time, of this mass
attached to the spring.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.700
So this is exciting.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.140
This is a differential
equation.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.580
When we drew the position-- our
intuition for the position

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.070
over time-- our intuition tells
us that it's a cosine

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.790
function, with amplitude A.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.130
So we said it's A cosine omega
t, where this is the angular

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.400
velocity of-- well, I don't want
to go into that just yet,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.080
we'll get a little bit more
intuition in a second.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.490
And now, what we can do is,
let's test this expression--

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.980
this function-- to see if it
satisfies this equation.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.230
Right?

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.260
 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:39.880
If we say that x of t is equal
to A cosine of wt, what is the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.530
derivative of this?
x prime of t.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.450
And you could review
the derivative

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.560
videos to remember this.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.100
Well, it's the derivative of the
inside, so it'll be that

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.680
omega, times the
outside scalar.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.650
A omega.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.915
And then the derivative-- I'm
just doing the chain rule--

00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:01.700
the derivative of cosine of t is
minus sine of whatever's in

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.070
the inside.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.780
I'll put the minus outside.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.040
So it's minus sine of wt.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.510
And then, if we want the second
derivative-- so that's

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.120
x prime prime of t.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.899
 

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.490
Let me do this in a different
color, just so it doesn't get

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.430
monotonous.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.540
That's the derivative
of this, right?

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.270
So what's the derivative
of-- these are just

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.260
scalar values, right?

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.570
These are just constants.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.870
So the derivative of the
inside is an omega.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.270
I multiply the omega times
the scalar constant.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:43.190
I get minus A omega squared.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.350
And then the derivative of
sine is just cosine.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.910
But the minus is still there,
because I had the minus to

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.950
begin with.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.422
Minus cosine of omega t.

00:04:54.422 --> 00:04:56.560
Now let's see if this is true.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:07.840
So if this is true, I should
be able to say that m times

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.740
the second derivative of x of
t, which is in this case is

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:21.750
this, times minus Aw
squared cosine wt.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:31.430
That should be equal to minus k
times my original function--

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.380
times x of t.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.020
And x of t is a cosine wt.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.210
 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.530
I'm running out of space.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.590
Hopefully you understand
what I'm saying.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.870
I just substituted x prime
prime, the second derivative,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.310
into this, and I just
substituted x of t, which I

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.800
guess that's that, in here.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.070
And now I got this.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.570
And let me see if
I can rewrite.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.670
Maybe I can get rid of
the spring up here.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.510
I'm trying to look for space.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.930
I don't want to get rid of this,
because I think this

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.200
gives us some intuition
of what we're doing.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.250
One of those days that I wish
I had a larger blackboard.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.680
 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.160
Erase the spring.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.490
Hopefully you can remember
that image in your mind.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.190
And actually, I can
erase that.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.945
I can erase that.

00:06:21.945 --> 00:06:24.600
I can erase all of this, just so
I have some space, without

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.150
getting rid of that nice curve I
took the time to draw in the

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.650
last video.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.750
Almost there.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.860
OK.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.110
Back to work.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.470
 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.420
Make sure my pen feels
right, OK.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.960
So all I did is I took-- we
said that by the spring

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.900
constant, if you rewrite force
as mass times acceleration,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.580
you get this.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.340
Which is essentially a
differential equation, I just

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.220
rewrote acceleration as
the second derivative.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.450
Then I took a guess, that this
is x of t, just based on our

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.500
intuition of the drawing.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.680
I took a guess.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.430
And then I took the second
derivative of it.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.490
Right?

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.160
This is the first derivative,
this is the second derivative.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.300
And then I substituted the
second derivative here, and I

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.450
substituted the function here.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.770
And this is what I got.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.500
And so let me see if I can
simplify that a little bit.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:28.550
So if I rewrite there, I get
minus mAw squared cosine of wt

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:37.720
is equal to minus
kA cosine of wt.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.900
Well it looks good so far.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.685
Let's see, we can get rid of the
minus signs on both sides.

00:07:41.685 --> 00:07:46.450
 

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.680
Get rid of the A's
on both sides.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:47.750
Right?

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.335
We can divide both sides by A.

00:07:50.335 --> 00:07:54.090
Let me do this in black, just
so it really erases it.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.780
So if we get rid of A on both
sides, we're left with that.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.210
 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.690
And then-- so let's see, we
have mw squared cosine of

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.620
omega t is equal to k
cosine of omega t.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.660
So this equation holds
true if what is true?

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:21.120
This equation holds true if mw
squared-- or omega squared, I

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.520
think that's omega.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.796
I always forget my--
is equal to k.

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:29.110
Or another way of saying
it, if omega squared is

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.909
equal to k over m.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:40.309
Or, omega is equal to the
square root of k over m.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:41.220
So there we have it.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.080
We have figured out what
x of t has to be.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.650
We said that this differential
equation is true, if this is x

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.840
of t, and omega is
equal to this.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.520
So now we've figured out the
actual function that describes

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.350
the position of that spring
as a function of time.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:04.886
x of t is going to be equal to--
we were right about the

00:09:04.886 --> 00:09:07.590
A, and that's just intuition,
right, because the amplitude

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:13.820
of this cosine function is A--
A cosine-- and instead of

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.880
writing w, we can now write the
square root of k over m.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:26.060
The square root of k over m t.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.490
That to me is amazing.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:34.140
We have now, using not too
sophisticated calculus, solved

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.980
a differential equation.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.860
And now can-- if you tell me at
5.8 seconds, where is x, I

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.920
can tell you.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.180
And I just realized that I am
now running out of time, so I

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.210
will see you in the
next video.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.900
