00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.810
In the last video we defined a
transformation that rotated

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.160
any vector in R2 and just gave
us another rotated version of

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.200
that vector in R2.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.420
In this video, I'm essentially
going to extend this, so I'm

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.750
going to do it in R3.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.895
So I'm going to define a
rotation transformation.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.220
I'll still call it theta.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.360
There's going to be a mapping
this time from R3 to R3.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.820
As you can imagine, the idea
of a rotation in an angle

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.940
becomes a little bit more
complicated when we're dealing

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.970
in three dimensions.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.205
So in this case we're going to
rotate around the x-axis, let

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:48.160
me call it-- so this is going
to rotate around the x-axis.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.290
And what we do in this video,
you can then just generalize

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.530
that to other axes.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950
And if you want to rotate around
the x-axis, and then

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.360
the y-axis, and then the z-axis
by different angles,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.160
you can just apply the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.580
transformations one after another.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.040
And we're going to cover that
in a lot more detail in a

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.989
future video.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.210
But this should kind of give you
the tools to show you that

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.820
this idea that we learned in the
previous video is actually

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.170
generalizeable to multiple
dimensions, and especially

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.340
three dimensions.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.060
So let me just be clear, what
we're going to be doing here.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910
Let me draw some axes.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.150
That's my x-axis.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.550
That is my y-axis.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.730
And this is my z-axis.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.660
Of course, this is R3.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.970
But any vector here in R3
I will be rotating it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.380
counterclockwise around
the x-axis.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.850
We'll be rotating like that.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.520
So if I had a vector-- I'm
just drawing it in the zy

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.220
plane because it's a little bit
easier to visualize-- but

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.430
if I have a vector sitting here
in the zy plane, it will

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.760
still stay in the zy plane.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.260
But it'll be rotated
counterclockwise by an angle

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.980
of theta, just like that.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.490
Now, a little harder to
visualize is a vector that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.970
doesn't just sit in
the zy plane.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.510
If we have some vector that
has some x-component that

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.720
comes out like that, then some
y-component and some

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.020
z-component, it looks
like that.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.650
Then when you rotate it, its
z and its y-components will

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.330
change, but its x-component
will stay the same.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.020
So then it might look
something like this.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.070
Let me see if I can
give it justice.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.030
So then the vector when I rotate
it around might look

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.050
something like that.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.850
Anyway, I don't know if I'm
giving it proper justice but

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.100
this was rotated around
the x-axis.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.920
I think you understand
what that means.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.340
But just based on the last
video, we want to build a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.190
transformation.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.300
Let me call this rotation
3 theta.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.260
Or let me call it 3 rotation
theta now that

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.970
we're dealing in R3.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.600
And what we want to do is we
want to find some matrix, so I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.280
can write my 3 rotation sub
theta transformation of x as

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.650
being some matrix A times
the vector x.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.060
Since this is a transformation
from R3 to R3 this is of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.010
course going to be
a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.970
Now in the last video we learned
that to figure this

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.580
out, you just have to apply the
transformation essentially

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.180
to the identity matrix.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.950
So what we do is we start off
with the identity matrix in

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.330
R3, which is just going
to be a 3 by 3.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.330
It's going to have 1, 1,
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.090
Each of these columns are the
basis vectors for R3.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.610
That's e1, e2, e3-- I'm writing
it probably too small

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.290
for you to see-- but each
of these are the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.260
basis vectors for R3.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.730
And what we need to do is just
apply the transformation to

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.220
each of these basis
vectors in R3.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.500
So our matrix A will
look like this.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.220
Our matrix A is going to
be a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.290
Where the first column
is going to be our

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.910
transformation, 3 rotation sub
theta, applied to that column

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.770
vector right there, 1, 0, 0.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.050
And then I'm going to apply it
to this middle column vector

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.790
right here.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.860
You get the idea, I don't
want to write

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.030
that whole thing again.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.000
I'm going to apply 3 rotation
sub theta to 0, 1, 0.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.135
And then I'm going to apply
it-- I'll do it here-- 3

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:26.400
rotation sub theta.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.130
I'm going to apply it
to this last column

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.020
vector, so 0, 0, 1.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.790
We've seen this multiple
times.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.930
So let's apply it.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.300
Let's rotate each of these
basis vectors for R3.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.650
Let's rotate them around
the x-axis.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.730
So the first guy, if I were
to draw an R3, what

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.690
would he look like?

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.150
He only has directionality
in the x direction right?

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.670
If we call this the x-dimension,
if the first

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.210
entry corresponds to our
x-dimension, the second entry

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.880
corresponds to our
y-dimension.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.720
And the third entry
corresponds to our

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.360
z-dimension.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.930
This vector would just be a unit
vector that just comes

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.710
out like that, right?

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.650
So if I'm going to rotate this
vector around the x-axis,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.040
what's going to happen to it?

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.320
Well, nothing.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.610
It is the x-axis.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.480
So when you rotate it, it's not
changing its direction or

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.000
its magnitude or anything.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.650
So this vector right here
is just going to be the

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.320
vector 1, 0, 0.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.420
Nothing happens when
you rotate it.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.040
Now these are a little
bit more interesting.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.940
To do these, let me just
draw my zy-axis.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.840
Let me just draw my Z.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.800
So that's my z-axis and this
is my y-axis right here.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.240
Now this basis vector just goes
in the y direction by 1.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.690
So this basis vector just
looks like that.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.520
And it has a length of 1.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.255
And then when you rotate it
around the x-axis, when I draw

00:05:58.255 --> 00:06:00.260
it like this, you could imagine
the x-axis is just

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.490
popping out of your
computer screens.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.455
So I could draw it like this is
like the tip of the arrow

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:06.320
just popping out.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.980
Instead of drawing it at an
angle like this, I'm drawing

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.660
it straight out of the
computer screen.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.180
So if you were to rotate this
vector right here, this blue

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.800
vector right here, by
an angle of theta,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.130
it'll look like this.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.760
And we've done this in
the previous video.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.350
What are its new coordinates?

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.890
First of all, will
its x-coordinate

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.160
have changed it all?

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.270
It's x-coordinate was 0 before,
because it doesn't

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.730
break out into the
x-dimension.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.920
It just stays along
the zy plane.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.240
It was 0 before.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.590
When you rotate it, it's
still on a zy plane.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.870
So its x direction, or
its x-component,

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.270
won't change at all.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.960
So the x direction is
still going to be 0.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.530
And then what's its
new y direction?

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.590
Well, here we do exactly what
we did in the last video.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.830
We figure out this is going to
be its new-- I guess I don't

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.330
want to draw a vector there
necessarily-- but this length

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.600
right here is going to be
its new y-component.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.430
And this length right here
is going to be its new

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.200
z-component.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.440
So what's its new y-component?

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.270
We did this in the last video
so I won't go into as much

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.320
detail, but what is
cosine of theta?

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.750
The length of this vector
is 1, right?

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.060
These are the standard
basis vectors.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.490
And one of the things that makes
them a nice standard

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.500
basis vector is that their
lengths are 1.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.480
So we know that the cosine of
this angle is equal to the

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.870
adjacent side over
the hypotenuse.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.140
The adjacent side is
this right here.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.310
And what is the hypotenuse?

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.000
It's equal to 1.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.350
So this adjacent side, which we
said is going to be our new

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.820
second component, our second
entry, is going to be equal to

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.500
cosine of theta, right?

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.630
That's A.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.780
You can just ignore the 1's.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.180
This going to be equal
to cosine of theta.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.020
And what's going to be
its new z-component?

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:06.760
Well, sine of theta is equal
to the opposite side, this

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.200
side over 1.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.790
So it just equals its
opposite side.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.950
And the length of that
opposite side is this

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.190
vector's, once it's rotated,
is its new z-component.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.560
So you've got a sine
theta right there.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.680
Now we just have to do
everything in the z direction.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.340
So this z basis vector right
there, what does it look like

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.760
on this graph?

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.850
Let me just actually redraw it
just to make things a little

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.400
bit cleaner.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.650
So that's my z-axis and
this is my y-axis.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.600
And my z-basis vector e3,
it starts off looking

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.850
something like that.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.960
It just goes only in
the z direction.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.530
So first of all, let's
just rotate it

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.510
by an angle of theta.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.310
So I'm going to rotate
it like that.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.900
That's an angle of theta.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.430
Its former x entry was 0.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.410
It did not break out in the
x direction at all.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.800
And of course we're still just
in the zy plane so it won't be

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.960
moving out in the x direction.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.650
So it's still going
to be a 0 up here.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.480
Now what about its
new y-component?

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.960
Its new y-coordinate, I guess we
can call it, is going to be

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.290
this length, or it's going to be
this coordinate right here.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.710
And how can we figure
that out?

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.490
Well, that length is the same
thing as that length.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.740
And if we call this the opposite
side of the angle, we

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:31.400
know that the sine of theta is
equal to this opposite side

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.830
over the length of this vector,
which is just 1.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.790
So it's just equal to
the opposite side.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.970
So the opposite side is equal
to sine of theta.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.246
But our new coordinate is to
the left of the z-axis, so

00:09:41.246 --> 00:09:42.500
this is going to be a
negative version.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.695
We did this in the last video.

00:09:43.695 --> 00:09:45.780
So it's just going to be a
negative sine of theta.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.630
This point right here,
that coordinate.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.690
So it's minus sine of theta.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.140
And then finally, what's its new
z-coordinate going to be?

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.310
That's going to be this
length right here.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.850
And we know that this length,
if we call that adjacent, we

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.040
know that the cosine of
our theta is equal to

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.610
this divided by 1.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.290
So it's equal to that adjacent
side, so just put a cosine of

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.990
theta right there.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.970
And we get our transformation
matrix.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.410
We're done.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.680
Our transformation
matrix A is this.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.070
So we can now say our new
transformation that

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.810
this video is about.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.810
I call it a 3 because it's
a rotation in R3.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.560
Maybe I should call it 3 sub X
because it's a rotation around

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.870
the x-axis, but I think
you get the idea.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.850
It is equal to this matrix right
up here-- maybe I could

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.230
rewrite it.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.420
Let me do it this way.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.090
Let me delete all of this so
I don't have to rewrite.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:54.250
So my transformation that this
videos is about, 3 rotation

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.500
theta of x, that transformation
is equal to

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.870
this matrix times whatever
vector x I have in R3.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.030
And you might say, hey, Sal,
that looks exactly like what

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.220
you did in the second.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.580
If you remember the last video
when we defined our rotation

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.260
in R2, we had a transformation
matrix that looked very

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.400
similar to this.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.610
And that makes sense because
we're essentially just

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.010
rotating things

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.500
counterclockwise in the zy plane.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.530
Now you might say, hey, Sal,
why is this even useful?

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.100
You extended it to three
dimensions or to R3, I saw

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.820
what you did in R2.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.620
Why is this useful?

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.610
It's kind of a limited case
where you're just rotating

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.460
around the x-axis.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.420
And I did it for two reasons.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.860
One to show you that you
can generalize to R3.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.860
But the other thing is, if you
think about it, a lot of the

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.260
rotations that you might want
to do in R3 can be described

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.340
by a rotation around the x-axis
first-- which we did in

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.080
this video-- then by rotation
around the y-axis and then

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.860
maybe some rotation
around the z-axis.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.340
This is just a special case
where we're dealing with

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.820
rotation around the x-axis.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.620
But you could do the exact
same process to define

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.560
transformation matrices for
rotations around the y-axis or

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.410
the z-axis, and then you can
apply them one after another.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.460
And we'll talk a lot about that
in the future when we

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.780
start applying one

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.010
transformation after the other.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.170
But anyway, hopefully you found
this slightly useful.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.660
It's a slight extension
of what we did in R2.
