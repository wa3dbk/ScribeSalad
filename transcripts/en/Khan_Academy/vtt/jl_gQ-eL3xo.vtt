00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome back.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.920
I now want to introduce you
really just to a different

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.330
notation for writing vectors,
and then we'll do that same

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.540
problem or a slight variation
on that problem

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.680
using the new notation.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.760
This is just to expose you to
things, so that you don't get

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.830
confused if your teacher uses a
different notation than what

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.770
I've been doing.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.090
So when we did the unit vectors,
we learned that we

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.550
can express a vector as a
component of its x- and

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.130
y-components.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.270
So let's say I had a vector--
let me just pick a random

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.090
vector just to show you.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.780
So say I had vector a and that
equals 2 times the unit vector

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.930
i plus 3 times the
unit vector j.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.430
That's the unit vector notation,
and I actually

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.090
looked it up on Wikipedia, and
they actually called it the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.060
engineering notation.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.170
That's probably why I used it
because I am an engineer, or I

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.830
was an engineer before
managing money.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.350
But another way to write this,
and I call this the bracket

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.770
notation, or the ordered pair
notation, is you could also

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.020
write it like this.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.050
We have this one bracket.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.180
That's the x-component, that's
the y-component.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.130
It almost looks like a
coordinate pair, but since

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.990
they have the brackets, you
know it's a vector.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.290
But you would draw it
the exact same way.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.570
So given that, let's do
that same problem

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.150
that we had just done.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.660
Hopefully, this make
sense to you.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.230
It's just a different
way of writing it.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.170
Instead of an i and a j, you
just write these brackets.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.611
Instead of a plus, you
write a comma.

00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:29.120
Let me clear this.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.230
I'm going to do a slight
variation.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.140
This was actually the second
part of that problem.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.560
My cousin gave these
problems to me.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.890
They're pretty good, so I figure
I'd stick with them.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.000
So in the old problem, let me
draw my coordinate axes again.

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:47.370
That's the y-axis.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.915
That's the x-axis.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.740
So in the old problem, I started
off with a ball that

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.970
was 4 feet off the ground.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.310
So let's say that's 4.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.760
And I hit it at 120 feet per
second at a 30-degree angle.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.710
So that's a 30-degree
angle like that.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:17.170
Its' a 30-degree angle
to the horizontal.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.580
And there's a fence 350 feet
away that's 30 feet high.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.660
It's roughly around there.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.020
That's 30.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.845
And what we need to do is figure
out whether the ball

00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:28.770
can clear the fence.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.190
We figured out the last time
when we used the unit vector

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.430
notation that it doesn't
clear the fence.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.180
But in this problem, or the
second part of this problem,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.300
they said that there's
a 5 meter per second

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.340
wind gust to the right.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.260
So there's a wind gust of 5
meters per second right when I

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.190
hit the ball.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.305
And you could go into the
complications of how much does

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:49.620
that accelerate the ball?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.410
Or what's the air resistance
of the ball?

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.410
I think for the simplicity of
the problem, they're just

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.670
saying that the x-component of
the ball's velocity right

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.370
after you hit it increases
by 5 meters per second.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.540
I think that's their point.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.690
So let's go back and do the
problem the exact same way

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.240
that we did it the last
time, but we'll

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.090
use a different notation.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.750
So we can write that equation
that I had written before,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.110
that the position at any given
time as a function of t is

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.870
equal to the initial position--
that's an i right

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.480
there-- plus the initial
velocity.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.300
These are all vectors.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:36.040
Initial velocity times t plus
the acceleration vector over

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.820
2t squared.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.330
So what's the initial
position?

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.140
And now we're going to use
some of our new notation.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.690
The initial position when I hit
the ball, its x-component

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.630
is 0, right?

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.130
It's almost like its coordinate,
and they're not

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.010
that different of a notation.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.920
And then the y-position is 4.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.510
Easy enough.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.710
What's its initial velocity?

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.470
Let me do it.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.810
So we can split it up into the
x- and the y-components.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.420
The y-component is 120 sine of
30 degrees and then the x

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.240
component is 120 cosine
of 30 degrees.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.410
That's just the x-component
after I hit it.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.860
But then they say there's
this wind gust so it's

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.220
going to be plus 5.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.020
I think that's their point when
they say that there's

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.130
this wind gust. They say that
right when you hit it, for

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.150
some reason in the x-direction,
it accelerates a

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.750
little bit by 5 meters
per second.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.140
So the velocity vector.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.140
This notation actually is
better, because it takes less

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.170
space up, and you don't have
all these i's and j's and

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.880
pluses confusing everything.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.690
So the initial velocity
vector, what's its

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.690
x-component?

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.590
It's 120 cosine of 30.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.310
Cosine of 30 is square root of
3/2 times 120 is 60 square

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.370
roots of 3, and then
you add 5 to it.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.990
So what is that?

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.650
Let me just solve
it right now.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:15.130
So 3 times the square root
of 3 times 60 plus 5.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.730
So let's just round up
and make it easier.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.315
It's 109 meters per second.

00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:21.940
108.9, so let's just say 109.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.010
So the x-component of
the velocity is 109.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.030
And the y-component was just
120 times the sine of 30.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.660
Well, sine of 30 is 1/2,
so this is 60.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.050
Oh, sorry, this should be
brackets, although some people

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.060
actually write the parentheses
there so it looks just like

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.930
coordinates, but I like to keep
it with these brackets so

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.410
that you don't think that these
are coordinates since

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.750
you know these are vectors.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.790
And a position vector is really
the same thing as a

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.600
position coordinate.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.270
But a velocity vector is
obviously not a coordinate.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.640
What's the acceleration
vector?

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.505
Well, the acceleration vector,
as we said, goes straight--

00:05:53.505 --> 00:05:54.540
that's not straight down.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.520
This is straight down at minus
32 feet per second squared.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.880
That's the acceleration
of gravity on Earth.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.785
So the acceleration vector
is equal to -- it has no

00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:12.390
x-component and its y-component
is minus 32.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.560
So now let's put these back
in that original equation.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.650
So our position vector, and
I'll switch colors to keep

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.680
things from getting
monotonous.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.320
Our position vector-- these are
little arrows or one-sided

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:33.040
arrows-- equals my initial
position, and that's 0, 4 plus

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:43.660
my initial velocity vector,
109, 60 times t, and I'm

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.640
running out of space, plus at
squared over two, so t squared

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:59.740
over 2 times my acceleration
vector, 0 minus 32.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.350
This is actually a little
cleaner way of writing it, but

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.800
this is exactly what
we did when we did

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.600
it with unit vectors.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.030
Instead of writing i's and j's,
we're just writing the

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.670
numbers in brackets here.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.510
So let's see if we can
simplify this.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.090
So let me write it in a
different color, so that you

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.440
know I'm doing.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:26.060
OK, so our position vector t
is equal to 0, 4 plus-- and

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.680
now we can distribute this t,
multiply it times both of

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:40.990
these-- plus 109t, 60t plus--
and we can distribute this t

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.030
squared over 2.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.970
Well, that times 0 is 0.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:51.210
And then that times minus
32 is minus 16t squared.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.540
Now we can add the vectors.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.330
So the position at any t.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.950
So let's add all the
x-components of the vectors.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:06.720
0, 109t, 0, so we
just get 109t.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.110
And then what's the
y-components?

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:23.320
4 plus 60t minus 16t squared.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.710
And there we go.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.730
We've defined the position
vector at a

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.880
function of any time.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.770
So let's solve the problem.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.260
Now that they have this wind
gust and our x velocity's

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.380
going a little faster, let's see
if we can clear the fence.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.610
So how long does it take to
get to 350 feet in the

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.450
x-direction?

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.159
Well, this number right
here has to equal 350.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:47.480
So we have 109t has to
be equal to 350.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.820
And so what's 350
divided by 109?

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:59.040
350 divided by 109 is equal
to 3.2 seconds.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.070
t is equal to 3.2 seconds.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.120
And so what's the height
at 3.2 seconds?

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.370
So let's square that.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:21.235
3.2 times 3.2 equals times
16 equals 164.

00:09:21.235 --> 00:09:25.000
So this equals 164.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.546
And then what's 60 times 3.2?

00:09:27.546 --> 00:09:33.680
60 times 3.2 is equal to 192.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.090
So what do we get?

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:50.990
We get 192 plus 4 minus
164 is equal to 32.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:10:00.350
So our position vector at time
3.2 seconds is equal to 350

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:08.150
feet in the x-direction and 32
feet in the y-direction, and

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.970
that will clear that
30-foot fence.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.860
Our ball's going to be two
feet above the fence.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.390
Hope I didn't confuse
you too much.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.980
See you soon.
