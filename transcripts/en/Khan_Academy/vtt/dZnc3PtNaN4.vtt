00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
 

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.000
I just did several videos on
the binomial theorem, so I

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.550
think, now that they're done, I
think now is good time to do

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.660
the proof of the derivative
of the general form.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.500
Let's take the derivative
of x to the n.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.300
Now that we know the
binomial theorem, we

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.440
have the tools to do it.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.830
How do we take the derivative?

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.070
Well, what's the classic
definition of the derivative?

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:36.220
It is the limit as delta x
approaches zero of f of

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.130
x plus delta x, right?

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.210
So f of x plus delta x in this
situation is x plus delta

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.000
x to the nth power, right?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.720
Minus f of x, well f of x
here is just x to the n.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.100
All of that over delta x.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.710
 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.610
Now that we know the binomial
theorem we can figure out

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.200
what the expansion of x plus
delta x is to the nth power.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.340
And if you don't know the
binomial theorem, go to my

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.040
pre-calculus play list
and watch the videos on

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.710
the binomial theorem.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.290
The binomial theorem tells us
that this is equal to-- I'm

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.170
going to need some space for
this one-- the limit as

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.310
delta x approaches zero.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.860
And what's the
binomial theorem?

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.960
This is going to be equal to--
I'm just going to do the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:39.630
numerator-- x to the
n plus n choose 1.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.440
Once again, review the binomial
theorem if this is looks like

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.340
latin to you and you
don't know latin.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:02:00.780
n choose 1 of x to the n minus
1 delta x plus n choose 2 x to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.650
the n minus 2, that's x n
minus 2, delta x squared.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.490
Then plus, and we have a bunch
of the digits, and in this

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.560
proof we don't have to go
through all the digits but the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.810
binomial theorem tells us what
they are and, of course, the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.790
last digit we just keep adding
is going to be 1-- it would

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.450
be n choose n which is 1.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.030
Let me just write that
down. n choose n.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:36.920
It's going to be x to the
zero times delta x to the n.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.030
So that's the
binomial expansion.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.450
Let me switch back to minus,
green that's x plus delta x

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.740
to the n, so minus
x to the n power.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.840
That's x to the n, I know
I squashed it there.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.810
All of that over delta x.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.590
Let's see if we can simplify.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.940
First of all we have an x to
the n here, and at the very end

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.880
we subtract out an x to the
n, so these two cancel out.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.080
If we look at every term here,
every term in the numerator has

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.310
a delta x, so we can divide
the numerator and the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.820
denominator by delta x.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.210
This is the same thing
as 1 over delta x times

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.960
this whole thing.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:29.670
So that is equal to the limit
as delta x approaches zero of,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.910
so we divide the top and the
bottom by delta x, or we

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.530
multiply the numerator
times 1 over delta x.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.310
We get n choose 1 x
to the n minus 1.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.580
What's delta x divided by
delta x, that's just 1.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.440
Plus n choose 2, x
to the n minus 2.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.310
This is delta x squared, but
we divide by delta x we

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.940
just get a delta x here.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.490
Delta x.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.100
And then we keep having a bunch
of terms, we're going to divide

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.180
all of them by delta x.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.190
And then the last term is
delta x to the n, but then

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.130
we're going to divide
that by delta x.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.550
So the last term becomes n
choose n, x to the zero is 1,

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.940
we can ignore that. delta x
to the n divided by delta x.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.910
Well that's delta x
to the n minus 1.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.150
 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.690
Then what are we doing now?

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.505
Remember, we're taking
the limit as delta

00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:30.760
x approaches zero.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.220
As delta x approaches zero,
pretty much every term that

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.290
has a delta x in it,
it becomes zero.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.850
When you multiply but
zero, you get zero.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.650
This first term has no
delta x in it, but

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.730
every other term does.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.950
Every other term, even after
we divided by delta x

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.680
has a delta x in it.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.930
So that's a zero.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.970
Every term is zero, all
of the other n minus 1

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.940
terms, they're all zeros.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.390
All we're left with is that
this is equal to n choose

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.520
1 of x the n minus 1.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.530
And what's n choose 1?

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:13.070
That equals n factorial over 1
factorial divided by n minus 1

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.170
factorial times x
to the n minus 1.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.390
1 factorial is 1.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.430
If I have 7 factorial divided
by 6 factorial, that's just 7.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.070
Or if I have 3 factorial
divided by 2 factorial, that's

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.650
just 3, you can work it out.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.660
10 factorial divided by
9 factorial that's 10.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.830
So n factorial divided
by n minus 1 factorial,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.600
that's just equal to n.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.540
So this is equal to n
times x to the n minus 1.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.866
That's the derivative
of x to the n. n times

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:45.900
x to the n minus 1.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.470
We just proved the derivative
for any positive integer when

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.610
x to the power n, where n
is any positive integer.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.790
And we see later it actually
works for all real

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.990
numbers and the exponent.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.980
I will see you in
a future video.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.860
Another thing I wanted to point
out is, you know I said that

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.150
we had to know the
binomial theorem.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.050
But if you think about it, we
really didn't even have to know

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.630
the binomial theorem because we
knew in any binomial

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.960
expansion-- I mean, you'd have
to know a little bit-- but if

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.350
you did a little
experimentation you would

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:25.470
realize that whenever you
expand a plus b to the nth

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.040
power, first term is going to
be a to the n, and the second

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.670
term is going to be plus n a to
the n minus 1 b.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.320
And then you are going to keep
having a bunch of terms.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.190
But these are the only terms
that are relevant to this proof

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.575
because all the other terms get
canceled out when delta

00:06:43.575 --> 00:06:44.980
x approaches zero.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.110
So if you just knew that you
could have done this, but it's

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.150
much better to do it with
the binomial theorem.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.880
Ignore what I just said
if it confused you.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.280
I'm just saying that we could
have just said the rest of

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.950
these terms all go to zero.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.700
Anyway, hopefully you
found that fulfilling.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.960
I will see you in
future videos.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.460
