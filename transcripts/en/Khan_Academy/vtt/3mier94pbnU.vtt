00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.650
Welcome back.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.850
In the last video, I showed you
or hopefully, I did show

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.230
you that if I apply a force
of F to a stationary, an

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.990
initially stationary object with
mass m, and I apply that

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.920
force for distance d, that that
force times distance, the

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.460
force times the distance that
I'm pushing the object is

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.980
equal to 1/2 mv squared, where
m is the mass of the object,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.430
and v is the velocity of the
object after pushing it for a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.690
distance of d.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.505
And we defined in that
last video, we just

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:38.810
said this is work.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.830
Force times distance by
definition, is work.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.340
And 1/2 mv squared, I said this
is called kinetic energy.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.110
And so, by definition, kinetic
energy is the amount of work--

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.870
and I mean this is the
definition right here.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.725
It's the amount of work you need
to put into an object or

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:03.820
apply to an object to
get it from rest

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.550
to its current velocity.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.100
So its velocity over here.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.740
So let's just say I looked at an
object here with mass m and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.250
it was moving with
the velocity v.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.960
I would say well, this
has a kinetic

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.660
energy of 1/2 mv squared.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.365
And if the numbers are confusing
you, let's say the

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:22.760
mass was-- I don't know.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.640
Let's say this was a 5 kilogram
object and it's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.330
moving at 7 meters per second.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.325
So I would say the kinetic
energy of this object is going

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:40.190
to be 5-- 1/2 times the mass
times 5 times 7 squared, times

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.850
velocity squared.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.890
It's times 49.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.220
So let's see.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.270
1/2 times 49, that's
a little under 25.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.170
So it'll be approximately 125
Newton meters, which is

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.500
approximately-- and Newton
meter is just

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.220
a joule-- 125 joules.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.420
So this is if we actually
put numbers in.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.770
And so when we immediately know
this, even if we didn't

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.770
know what happened, how did this
object get to this speed?

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.560
Let's say we didn't know that
someone else had applied a

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.090
force of m for a distance of
d to this object, just by

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.710
calculating its kinetic energy
as 125 joules, we immediately

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.120
know that that's the amount of
work that was necessary.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.500
And we don't know if this is
exactly how this object got to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.920
this velocity, but we know that
that is the amount of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.530
work that was necessary to
accelerate the object to this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.620
velocity of 7 meters
per second.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.330
So let's give another example.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.420
And instead of this time just
pushing something in a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.640
horizontal direction and
accelerating it, I'm going to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.940
show you an example we're going
to push something up,

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.550
but its velocity really
isn't going to change.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.280
Invert.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.140
Let's say I have a different
situation, and we're on this

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.990
planet, we're not
in deep space.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.090
And I have a mass of m and
I were to apply a force.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.470
So let's say the force that I
apply is equal to mass times

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.930
the acceleration of gravity.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.460
Mass times-- let's just call
that gravity, right?

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.140
9.8 meters per second squared.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.740
And I were to apply this force
for a distance of d upwards.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.500
Right?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.810
Or instead of d, let's say h.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.050
H for height.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.030
So in this case, the force times
the distance is equal

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.490
to-- well the force is mass
times the acceleration of

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.240
gravity, right?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.880
And remember, I'm pushing with
the acceleration of gravity

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.410
upwards, while the acceleration
of gravity is

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.100
pulling downwards.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.045
So the force is mass times
gravity, and I'm applying that

00:03:45.045 --> 00:03:47.390
for a distance of h, right?

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.050
d is h.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.810
So the force is this.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.580
This is the force.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.730
And then the distance I'm
applying is going to be h.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.900
And what's interesting is-- I
mean if you want to think of

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.910
an exact situation, imagine an
elevator that is already

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.140
moving because you would
actually have to apply a force

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.330
slightly larger than the
acceleration of gravity just

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.270
to get the object moving.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.280
But let's say that
the object is

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.860
already at constant velocity.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.500
Let's say it's an elevator.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.950
And it is just going up with
a constant velocity.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.520
And let's say the mass of the
elevator is-- I don't know--

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.230
10 kilograms. And it moves up
with a constant velocity.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.380
It moves up 100 meters.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.280
So we know that the work done
by whatever was pulling on

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.370
this elevator, it probably was
the tension in this wire that

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.750
was pulling up on the elevator,
but we know that the

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.210
work done is the force necessary
to pull up on it.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.330
Well that's just going to
be the force of gravity.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.780
So we're assuming that
the elevator's not

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.040
accelerating, right?

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.690
Because if the elevator was
accelerating upwards, then the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.690
force applied to it
would be more than

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.080
the force of gravity.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.840
And if the elevator was
accelerating downwards, or if

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.250
it was slowing down upwards,
then the force being applied

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.850
would be less than the
acceleration of gravity.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.360
But since the elevator is at a
constant velocity moving up,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.760
we know that the force pulling
upwards is completely equal to

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.330
the force pulling downwards,
right?

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.250
No net force.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.520
Because gravity and this force
are at the same level, so

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.050
there's no change in velocity.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.020
I think I said that two times.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.840
So we know that this upward
force is equal to

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.720
the force of gravity.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.045
At least in magnitude in
the opposite direction.

00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:35.310
So this is mg.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.500
So what's m? m is 10 kilograms.
Times the

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.320
acceleration of gravity.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.900
Let's say that's 9.8 meters
per second squared.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.750
I'm not writing the units here,
but we're all assuming

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.490
kilograms and meters
per second squared.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.760
And we're moving that for a
distance of 100 meters.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.490
So how much work was put into
this elevator, or into this

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.980
object-- it doesn't have to be
an elevator-- by whatever

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.210
force that was essentially
pushing up on it or

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.770
pulling up on it?

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.410
And so, let's see.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.160
This would be 98 times 100.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:13.820
So it's 9,800 Newton meters
or 9,800 joules.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.270
After we've moved up 100 meters,
notice there's no

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.760
change in velocity.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.220
So the question is, where
did all that work get

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.140
put into the object?

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.780
And the answer here is, is that
the work got transferred

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.940
to something called
potential energy.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.150
And potential energy is
defined as-- well,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.780
gravitational potential
energy.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.150
We'll work with other types of
potential energy later with

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.810
springs and things.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.580
Potential energy is defined
as mass times the force of

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.760
gravity times the height
that the object is at.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.840
And why is this called
potential energy?

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.430
Because at this point, the
energy-- work had to be put

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.920
into the object to get it
to this-- in the case of

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.670
gravitational potential energy,
work had to be put

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.090
into the object to get
it to this height.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.720
But the object now, it's not
moving or anything, so it

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.110
doesn't have any
kinetic energy.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.510
But it now has a lot of
potential to do work.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.860
And what do I mean by potential
to do work?

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.430
Well after I move an object up
100 meters into the air,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.420
what's its potential
to do work?

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.520
Well, I could just let go of it
and have no outside force

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.360
other than gravity.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.080
The gravity will
still be there.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.190
And because of gravity, the
object will come down and be

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.490
at a very, very fast velocity
when it lands.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.230
And maybe I could apply this to
some machine or something,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.150
and this thing could do work.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.400
And if that's a little
confusing, let

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.000
me give you an example.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.300
It all works together
with our--

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:47.882
So let's say I have an object
that is-- oh, I don't know-- a

00:07:47.882 --> 00:07:53.060
1 kilogram object and
we're on earth.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.230
And let's say that is 10 meters
above the ground.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:06.070
So we know that its potential
energy is equal to mass times

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.510
gravitational acceleration
times height.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.240
So mass is 1.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.300
Let's just say gravitational
acceleration is 10 meters per

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.660
second squared.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.435
Times 10 meters per
second squared.

00:08:17.435 --> 00:08:19.820
Times 10 meters, which
is the height.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:25.720
So it's approximately equal to
100 Newton meters, which is

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.020
the same thing is 100 joules.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.580
Fair enough.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.700
And what do we know
about this?

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.500
We know that it would take about
100-- or exactly-- 100

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.799
joules of work to get this
object from the ground to this

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.809
point up here.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:44.730
Now what we can do now is use
our traditional kinematics

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.480
formulas to figure out, well, if
I just let this object go,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.750
how fast will it be when
it hits the ground?

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.645
And we could do that, but
what I'll show you is

00:08:52.645 --> 00:08:53.380
even a faster way.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.070
And this is where all of
the work and energy

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.440
really becomes useful.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.840
We have something called the law
of conservation of energy.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.550
It's that energy cannot be
created or destroyed, it just

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.600
gets transferred from
one form to another.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.770
And there's some minor
caveats to that.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.090
But for our purposes, we'll
just stick with that.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.110
So in the situation where I just
take the object and I let

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.120
go up here, up here it has a
ton of potential energy.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.560
And by the time it's down here,
it has no potential

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.530
energy because the height
becomes 0, right?

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:27.310
So here, potential energy is
equal to 100 and here,

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.870
potential energy
is equal to 0.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.796
And so the natural question is--
I just told you the law

00:09:31.796 --> 00:09:34.930
of conservation of energy, but
if you look at this example,

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.330
all the potential energy
just disappeared.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.160
And it looks like I'm running
out of time, but what I'll

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.130
show you in the next video is
that that potential energy

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.780
gets converted into another
type of energy.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.980
And I think you might be able
to guess what type that is

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.030
because this object is going to
be moving really fast right

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.150
before it hits the ground.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.030
I'll see you in the
next video.
