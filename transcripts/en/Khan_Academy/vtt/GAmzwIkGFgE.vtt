00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.410
In the last several videos,
we did some fairly hairy

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.120
mathematics.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.660
And you might have even
skipped them.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.290
But we got to a pretty
neat result.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.970
We got to a formula for the
slope and y-intercept of the

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.390
best fitting regression line
when you measure the error by

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.150
the squared distance
to that line.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.180
And our formula is, and I'll
just rewrite it here just so

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.090
we have something
neat to look at.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.800
So the slope of that line is
going to be the mean of x's

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.700
times the mean of the y's minus
the mean of the xy's.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.870
And don't worry, this seems
really confusing, we're going

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.520
to do an example of this
actually in a few seconds.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.470
Divided by the mean of x squared
minus the mean of the

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.460
x squareds.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.410
And if this looks a little
different than what you see in

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.900
your statistics class or your
textbook, you might see this

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.850
swapped around.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.130
If you multiply both the
numerator and denominator by

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.610
negative 1, you could see this
written as the mean of the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.980
xy's minus the mean of x times
the mean of the y's.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.930
All of that over the mean of the
x squareds minus the mean

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.690
of the x's squared.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.209
These are obviously
the same thing.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.620
You're just multiplying the
numerator and denominator by

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.810
negative 1, which is same thing
as multiplying the whole

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.720
thing by 1.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.610
And of course, whatever you get
for m, you can then just

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.310
substitute back in this
to get your b.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.640
Your b is going to be equal
to the mean of the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.350
y's minus your m.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.170
Let me write that in yellow
so it's very clear.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.770
You solved for the m value.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.690
Minus m times the
mean of the x's.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.440
And this is all you need.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.390
So let's actually put
that into practice.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.740
So let's say I have three
points, and I'm going to make

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.680
sure that these points
aren't colinear.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.590
Because, otherwise, it wouldn't
be interesting.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.820
So let me draw three
points over here.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.140
Let's say that to one point
is the point 1 comma 2.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.500
So this 1, 2.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:18.305
And then we also have
the point 2 comma 1.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.730
And then, let's say we also
have the point, let's do

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:38.650
something a little bit
crazy, 4 comma 3.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.750
So this is 4, 3.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.970
So those are our three points.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.190
And what we want to do is find
it the best fitting regression

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.380
line, which we suspect
is going to look

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.020
something like that.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.790
We'll see what it actually looks
like using our formulas,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.180
which we have proven.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.000
So a good place to start is just
to calculate these things

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.370
ahead of time, and then
to substitute

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.420
them back in the equation.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.970
So what's the mean of our x's?

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:23.940
The mean of our x's is going
to be 1 plus 2 plus

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.900
4 divided by 3.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.140
And what's this going to be?

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.310
1 plus 2 is 3, plus 4
is 7 divided by 3.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.800
It is equal to 7/3.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.530
Now, what is the mean
of our y's?

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:58.405
The mean of our y's is equal
to 2 plus 1 plus 3.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.420
All of that over 3.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.920
So this is 2 plus 1 is 3.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.890
Plus 3 is 6.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.490
Divided by 3 is equal to 2.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.400
This is 6 divided by
3 is equal to 2.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:21.260
Now, what is the mean
of our xy's?

00:04:26.685 --> 00:04:31.750
So our first xy over
here is 1 times 2.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.210
Plus 2 times 1 plus 4 times 3.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.180
And we have three
of these xy's.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.430
So divided by 3.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.200
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.430
We have 2 plus 2, which is 4.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.700
4 plus 12, which is 16.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.420
So it's going to be 16/3.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.230
And then the last one we have
to calculate is the mean of

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.170
the x squareds.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.530
So what's the mean of
the x squareds?

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.640
The first x squared is just
going to be 1 squared.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.073
Plus this 2 squared, plus
this 4 squared.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.152
And we have three data
points again.

00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:31.550
So this is 1 plus
4, which is 5.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.570
Plus 16.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.440
Is equal to 21/3, which
is equal to 7.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.540
So that worked out to a
pretty neat number.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.650
So let's actually find
our m's and our b's.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.150
So our slope, our optimal slope
for our regression line,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.590
the mean of the x's is
going to be 7/3.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.890
Times the mean of the y's.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.360
The mean of the y's is 2.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.450
Minus the mean of the xy's.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.120
Well, that's 16/3.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.440
And then, all of that over
the mean of the x's.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.730
The mean of the x's
is 7/3 squared.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.300
Minus the mean of
the x squareds.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.430
So it's going to be minus
this 7 right over here.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.490
And we just have to do a little
bit of mathematics.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.660
I'm tempted to get out my
calculator, but i'll resist

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.260
the temptation.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.930
It's nice to keep things
as fractions.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.570
Let's see if I can
calculate this.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.910
This is 14/3 minus 16/3.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:50.930
All of that over,
this is 49/9.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.170
And then minus 7.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.700
If I wanted to express that as
something over 9, that's the

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:01.080
same thing as 63/9.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.230
So in our numerator, we
get negative 2/3.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.270
And then in our denominator,
what's 49 minus 63?

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.690
That's negative 14/9.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.320
And this is the same thing
as negative 2/3

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.300
times negative 9/ 14.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.250
Divide numerator and
denominator by 3.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.710
Well, the negatives are going
to cancel out first of all.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:29.590
You divide by 3.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.590
That becomes a 1.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.710
That becomes a 3.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.100
Divide by 2.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.150
Becomes a 1.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.560
That becomes a 7.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.360
So our slope is 3/7.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.790
Not too bad.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.380
Now, we can go back and figure
out our y-intercept.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.560
So let's figure out our
y-intercept using

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.110
this right over here.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.700
So our y-intercept, b, is going
to be equal to the mean

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.760
of the y's, the mean of the
y's is 2, minus our slope.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.380
We just figured out our
slope to be 3/7.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.410
Times the mean of the
x's, which is 7/3.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.140
These just are the reciprocal
of each other,

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.040
so they cancel out.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.350
That just becomes 1.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.060
So our y-intercept is literally
just 2 minus 1.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.710
So it equals 1.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.520
So we have the equation
for our line.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.690
Our regression line is going
to be y is equal to-- We

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.160
figured out m.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.530
m is 3/7.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:31.640
y is equal to 3/7 x plus,
our y-intercept is 1.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.130
And we are done.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.400
So let's actually try
to graph this.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.240
So our y-intercept
is going to be 1.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.610
It's going to be right
over there.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.789
And the slope of our
line is 3/7.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.240
So for every 7 we
run, we rise 3.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.720
Or another way to think of
it, for every 3.5 we

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.080
run, we rise 1.5.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.870
So we're going to go 1.5
right over here.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.270
So this line, if you were to
graph it, and obviously I'm

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.850
hand drawing it, so it's not
going to be that exact, is

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.520
going to look like that
right over there.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.680
And it actually won't go
directly through that line.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.030
So I don't want to give
you that impression.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.530
So it might look something
like this.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.200
And this line, we have shown,
that this formula minimizes

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.140
the squared distances
from each of these

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.360
points to that line.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.480
Anyway, that was, at least
in my mind, pretty neat.
