00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.260
The perimeter of a rectangular
fence measures 0.72 kilometers.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.480
The length of the fenced
area is 160 meters.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.260
What is it's width?

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.150
Now, the first thing
that jumps out at me,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.650
and it might have
jumped out at you,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.399
is that they're giving
us different units.

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:20.100
They're giving us the perimeter
in terms of kilometers,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.350
and they're giving us the
length in terms of meters.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.891
And I'm assuming that they want
the width in terms of meters,

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.990
since that's what they're
giving us the length in.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.740
So what I want to do
right from the get go

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.236
is just convert the
perimeter into meters.

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:32.860
So we have the
perimeter, and I'll just

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.770
represent that with a p, is
equal to 0.72 kilometers.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.290
Which I'll write km for short.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.300
Kilometers, 1,000 meters.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.240
That's what the
prefix kilo- means.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.590
And so we can say that
for every 1 kilometer

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.780
we have 1,000 meters.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.696
Or we have 1,000 meters
per every 1 kilometer.

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:56.070
And you might say
Sal, how do you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.255
know to multiply by 1,000,
instead of divide by 1,000?

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:01.380
And one way to think about
it, and this is probably

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.254
the best way to think
about it, is just look,

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:06.510
a kilometer is a
bunch of meters.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.450
It's actually 1,000 meters.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.620
So if I'm converting
kilometers into meters,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.390
I should have a
much larger number.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.060
Whatever my number
is in kilometers,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.660
it must be a much
larger number of meters.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.440
So that's what tells
you to multiply.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.980
And also, if you care
about dimensional analysis,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.010
the dimensions
cancel out here too.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.350
We have kilometers in
the numerator, kilometers

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.650
in the denominator.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.800
And so when you multiply it, you
have 0.72 times 1,000 meters.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.670
And to multiply
anything times 1,000,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.120
or really any power
of 10, you say, look,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.280
if I multiply it by 10,
I'll move the decimal

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.060
to the right one space.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.890
That'd be multiplying it
by 10, it would be 7.2.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.800
Multiplying it by
100 would give us 72.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.420
If we're multiplying by
1,000, that would give us 720.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.870
And I'll put a trailing
0 here, just so

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.630
that we have something
to move to the right of.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.230
So this is going to be
equal to 720 meters.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.320
So that is the perimeter.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.740
Now let's remind ourselves
what the perimeter even is.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.530
And then hopefully we
can figure out the width.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.009
So let me draw a
little box over here.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.500
And they tell us that
the length is 160 meters.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.050
So let's say that's this
dimension right over here.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.330
The length is 160 meters.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.340
So that would be this dimension
and this, it's a rectangle.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.110
So these sides are
both the same length.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.140
And our width is what
we need to solve for.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.640
So that's our width, and
this is also our width.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.190
And the perimeter is the
measure going around it.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.130
So the perimeter is going to be
this length, plus this width,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.300
plus that same length again,
plus that width over there.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.160
Or another way to think
about it-- and this

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.490
might be a simpler
way-- so there's

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.240
a couple of ways you
could think about it.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.050
You could say that
the perimeter is

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.840
equal to the length
plus the width,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.260
plus the length plus the width.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.860
And then we know
what the length is.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.260
So the perimeter would be equal
to 160 meters plus the width.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.270
Actually, let me
write the units down.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.750
160 meters plus the width,
plus 160 meters plus the width.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.990
And then we know what
know the perimeter is,

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.860
that's actually 720 meters.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.730
So 720 meters is the perimeter.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.140
So you would get 720
meters is equal to 160

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.340
meters, plus the width, plus
160 meters plus the width.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.800
Now there's a bunch of different
ways to solve for the width.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.894
One way, you could
just say, look,

00:03:38.894 --> 00:03:40.560
if I just have the
width plus the length

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.740
once, that's going to add
up to half of the perimeter.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.230
So if I just go halfway
around the rectangle,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.550
that's going to add up
to half the perimeter.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.130
So if I take my width, which
is w, plus my length, which

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.170
is 160 meters, this should be
equal to 1/2 of the perimeter.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.920
This should be equal to 1/2
times our perimeter, which

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.230
is 720 meters.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.100
Or you get width plus 160 meters
is equal to 1/2 times 720,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:21.019
or 720 divided by
2 is 360 meters.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.360
And so now you have
a situation where

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.940
we have the width plus
160 meters is 360 meters.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.520
So we could now subtract
360 from both sides.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.580
Or sorry, we could subtract
160 from both sides

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.260
to solve for it.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.801
Or you could even
do it in your head.

00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:42.770
If I say something plus 160 is
360, you could, in your head,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.490
say well, that
something must be 200.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.010
200 plus 160 is 360.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.390
So you could just say
your width is 200 meters.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.780
Or if you want to do it a
little bit more formally,

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.280
you could say look,
subtract 160 meters

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.020
from both sides
of this equation.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.236
And you are left with the
width is equal to 200 meters.

00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:08.360
So that's one way to do it.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.600
We've solved the problem.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.100
The other way is,
you could actually

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.710
go straight from this equation.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.120
So we get 720.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.190
I'm just going to assume
everything is in meters.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.980
720.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.450
160 meters plus
160 meters is 320.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.690
And that's going to
be the same thing

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.950
as the width plus the width.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.370
Or 2 times the width.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.910
Anything plus itself is
just 2 times that anything.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.010
Now if this plus 320 is equal to
720, you could do in your head.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.550
You could say well,
what plus 320 is 720?

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.535
Well, this thing
must be equal to 400.

00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:44.910
Or you could do
it more formally,

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.720
and subtract 320 from
both sides of this.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.440
And you would get--
if you subtract 320

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.990
from here-- you would
get 400 is equal to,

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.850
subtract 320 from this side,
you get 2 times the width.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.120
So if I have 2 times
something is equal to 400,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.169
that something must be 200.

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.710
Or if we want to do
it more formally,

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.830
you could divide both sides
of this equation by 2.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.240
Either way, you will get the
width is equal to 200 meters.
