00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.780
Welcome back.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.590
I'm now going to do a
series of videos on the

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.430
trigonometric identities.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.250
So let's just review what
we already know about the

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.920
trig function, so let me
just write SOHCAHTOA.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.320
That tells us, and we've
actually extended this with the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.670
unit circle definition, but if
you watch those videos, you'll

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.040
realize that the unit circle
definition directly

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.910
uses SOHCAHTOA.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.690
So we'll just stick with
SOHCAHTOA because I think it'll

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.690
help make some of what we're
about to do seem a little bit

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.380
more straightforward and will
kind of verge on the unit

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.760
circle definition anyway.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:40.150
So we know that sine of
theta is equal to opposite

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.390
over hypotenuse, right?

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.290
So cosine of theta is equal to
adjacent over hypotenuse, and

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.930
then the tangent of theta is
equal to opposite

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.310
over adjacent.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.420
So let's draw that out
on a right triangle.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.230
We could do this with the
unit circle as well, and

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.590
it would make sense.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.960
Let's see if we can find a
relationship between sine,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.760
cosine and tangent.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.915
There's my right triangle.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.690
Let's call this theta.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.910
This is the hypotenuse h.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.820
This is the opposite side,
right, opposite of theta.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.480
This is theta right here.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.090
This is the adjacent
side, right?

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.940
Well, what do we know about
the relationship between

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.860
the opposite adjacent side
and then the hypotenuse?

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.030
What does the Pythagorean
theorem tell us?

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.350
Oh, yeah, this side squared
plus this side squared is equal

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.290
to the hypotenuse squared,
so we could write that down.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.100
a squared plus o squared is
equal to the hypotenuse

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.900
squared, right?

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.980
And then this is just an
equation, so if we want to, we

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.620
could divide both sides of this
equation by h squared,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.790
and so what do we get?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:07.880
We get a squared over h squared
plus o squared over h squared

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.590
is equal to 1, right?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:22.070
And then I could rewrite that
as a over h squared plus o

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.710
over h squared is equal to 1.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.930
Now, do these look
at all familiar?

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.080
Well, we have them here, right?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.570
This is a over h, this is
o over h, so we could

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.750
just substitute.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.280
So this is just cosine
of theta squared.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.520
And this is how you
write cosine squared.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.280
You could put a parentheses
around the whole thing and then

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.760
square it, but this is just
the notation people use.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.510
Plus opposite over adjacent
squared, so that's sine theta

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.280
squared is equal to 1.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.530
So that's our first
trig identity.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.440
So if you know the sine of
theta, it's very easy to figure

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.680
out the cosine of theta, right?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.550
You could just solve
this equation.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.430
If I know that the--
I don't know.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:14.050
Let's say I know that the
sine of theta is 1/2, right?

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.351
Then what is the
cosine of theta?

00:03:16.351 --> 00:03:18.630
The cosine of theta is what?

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.950
Well, I know the sine of
theta is 1/2, right?

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:28.160
So I would say cosine squared
of theta plus sine of theta

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.770
is 1/2, so 1/2 squared
is equal to 1, right?

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.480
So cosine squared theta
plus 1/4 is equal to 1.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.870
So we have cosine squared theta
is equal to 3/4, or cosine of

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.830
theta would be the square
root of this, right?

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.010
We just take the square
root of both sides.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.510
It would be the
square root of 3/2.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.770
And you probably remember that
from our whole presentation

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.900
on the 30-60-90 triangle.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.400
So I just wanted to show you
a use of this trig identity

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.520
that's usually written
sine squared plus cosine

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.860
squared is equal to 1.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.740
So let's extend that
one a little bit.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.750
Let's just play with the ratios
and see what else we can--

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.950
other identities
we can discover.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.180
Whoops!

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.370
Clear image, invert colors.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:28.310
So we know that sine squared
theta plus cosine squared

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.390
theta is equal to 1.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.220
The one thing we could do is we
could divide both sides of this

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.880
equation by cosine squared of
theta, and let's just see what

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.260
happens when we do that.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.020
So if we say cosine
squared theta, right?

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.530
You have to distribute
across both terms.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:57.710
Cosine squared of theta, and
then cosine squared of theta.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.360
Well, what's sine squared theta
over cosine squared theta?

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.720
That's the same thing as sine
of theta over cosine of theta

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:16.550
squared plus this is 1 over
cosine theta squared, right?

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.240
I mean, 1 squared is 1,
so I just rewrote it.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.980
So sine over cosine theta, I
think we learned that already.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.410
That's just the
tangent of theta.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.280
And in case you actually
haven't learned that already,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.190
think about it this way.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.030
Sine is opposite over
the hypotenuse, right?

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.350
So that's opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.410
And then cosine is
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.290
So adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.350
So then that equals opposite
over hypotenuse times

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.030
hypotenuse over
adjacent, right?

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.720
Just dividing by a fraction is
the same thing as multiplying

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.160
by its reciprocal.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.000
That's all I did.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.780
And that equals opposite
over adjacent, right?

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.930
So that just says sine of
theta over cosine of theta is

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.720
equal to tangent of theta.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.270
So sine squared theta over
cosine squared theta is tan

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.310
squared theta, then plus 1 is
1 over cosine theta squared.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.300
And now I'm going to introduce
a new trig ratio, it's really

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.800
just 1 over cosine theta.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.945
So 1 over cosine theta-- and
I'm going to summarize this at

00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:28.050
the end, just so it's not too
confusing-- is actually

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.340
the secant of theta.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.780
And this is just
another ratio, right?

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.170
The secant of theta, instead of
being the adjacent over the

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.580
hypotenuse, would be the
hypotenuse over the

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.180
adjacent, right?

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.370
It's just 1 over cosine theta.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.710
Nothing fancy here.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.000
So secant of theta.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.580
So that equals secant
squared of theta.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.280
I know it can be a little
overwhelming initially, just

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.750
because I'm, you know, throwing
out all these new terms, secant

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.670
is 1 over cosine theta, but
once you just play around with

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.790
these enough and get familiar
with the terms, it'll make

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.130
sense, and it'll be a little
more natural to you.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.760
So this could be-- you
could view this as

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.970
another trig identity.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.160
And actually, I don't
even remember if I've

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.690
taught it already.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.460
I mean, you could view this as
a trig identity, although

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.110
that's almost definitional.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.730
And then, of course, you can--
in case I haven't done it

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:18.340
already, you now know that sine
of theta over cosine of theta

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.570
is equal to tangent of theta.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.210
And that's right here
with, I guess you could

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.770
say, the proof of it.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.750
So let me keep introducing you
to more things, and if this is

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.540
really daunting, maybe you
just can rewatch it, and

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.890
hopefully, it'll make sense.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.810
Let me see, clear image.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.150
So what have we learned so far?

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:45.540
We learned that sine squared
theta plus cosine squared

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.540
theta is equal to 1.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:53.880
We learned that sine of theta
over cosine of theta is

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.700
equal to tangent of theta.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:04.750
We learned that the tangent
squared of theta plus 1 is

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.650
equal to the secant of theta.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.030
And here, let me actually
write this definition down.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.675
The secant of theta-- oops,
is equal to the secant

00:08:13.675 --> 00:08:15.790
squared of theta, sorry.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.800
And the secant of theta is
just 1 over cosine of theta.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.670
This is something you really
should just memorize, that

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.950
secant is 1 over cosine.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.430
And if you're wondering what 1
over sine is, 1 over sine of

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:33.350
theta, it's the cosecant-- the
abbreviation is csc-- of theta.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.690
And if you're wondering what
1 over the tangent is,

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.730
it's the cotangent.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.660
And you just might want
to memorize these.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.600
And this often confuses me,
that 1 over the cosine is the

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.340
secant, but 1 over the sine is
the cosecant, so it's kind of

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.250
almost the opposite, right?

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.230
1 over the sine has a co in
it, while 1 over the cosine

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.060
doesn't have the co in it.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.150
So that might help
you remember things.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.760
So I think that's all
I have time for now.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.120
In the next presentation, I'm
going to introduce you to a

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.575
couple more trig identities.

00:09:07.575 --> 00:09:09.380
See you soon.
