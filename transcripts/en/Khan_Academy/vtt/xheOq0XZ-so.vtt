00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.920
Let's see if we can
learn thing or two

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.810
about carboxylic acids.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.700
They have the general form of
the carbonyl group, just like

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.540
we've seen in aldehydes and
ketones, and they will be part

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.590
of a longer carbon chain.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.930
But instead of having a hydrogen
here, as the case

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.280
with an aldehyde, or having
another carbon chain here,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.170
with the case of a ketone,
we have an OH group.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.330
And you're probably saying,
hey, why is

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.390
this called an acid?

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.930
It must be called an acid
because it is an acid, and

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.130
you'd be right.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.360
And the reason why it is an
acid, and why it is more

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.160
acidic that just something
with an OH group, it's

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:53.420
actually a good bit more acidic
than alcohols, is

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.170
because once this thing loses
its hydrogen-- remember,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.550
depending on what type of acid
you want to think about, acid

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.060
in the Lewis sense could be an
electron taker, and this

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.990
oxygen can take the electron
of this hydrogen.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.370
Or if you think about the
Arrhenius definition of an

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.530
acid, it is a proton donor,
and this OH group

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.120
can donate a proton.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.760
It takes away the electron of
this hydrogen, gives the way

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.640
the proton, either way.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.690
But the reason why this is more
acidic than alcohol is

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.510
once it gives away this
proton, it is actually

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.830
resonance stabilized.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.840
So let me show you
what that means.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.480
To do that, let me actually show
you the bond between this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.730
oxygen and this hydrogen.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.540
The oxygen has this pink
electron, and the hydrogen has

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.200
that magenta electron
right there.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.260
If you put this in a solution of
water, so you have some H2O

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:57.480
over here, this oxygen right
here really wants to take back

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.370
this magenta electron.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.900
And as it takes back that
magenta electron, it would

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.660
essentially donate the hydrogen

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.395
proton to a water molecule.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:13.650
So the water molecule would give
one of its electrons to

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.980
the hydrogen proton and
then become positive.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.890
So once this happens, the next
step would look like this.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.940
What was our carboxylic acid
will now turn into the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.190
carboxylate ion, so it will now
look like this, so it has

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.740
our carbonyl group.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.910
Now, this oxygen just took
an extra electron.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.455
So if I want to draw it,
I have that one.

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:40.060
Actually, let me draw.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.270
So this is the oxygen.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.980
To start off with, the oxygen
had two lone pairs, so I want

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.490
to draw those two lone pairs
first. So to start off with,

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.000
it had those two lone pairs,
and now it had this pink

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.590
electron from the get go, and
now it took this magenta

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.310
electron, so now it has one
extra valence electron.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.720
We can even draw them here.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.440
We can count them: one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.730
Six is just a neutral oxygen,
but now it gained another one.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.570
It has seven.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.580
It now has a negative charge,
and then the water has now

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.330
become a hydronium ion.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.040
So you have the water here.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.630
We've increased the proton
or the hydronium

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.970
concentration in the water.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.750
This one water molecule is now
a hydronium molecule, so this

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.900
is now bonded with
this hydrogen

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.130
proton just like this.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.010
This oxygen gave away an
electron to this proton, so

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.810
now it has a positive charge.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:49.160
And this right here, this
carboxylate ion right over

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.810
here, the reason why this thing
was a stronger acid than

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.920
something that just had an OH
group is because the conjugate

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.230
base, the carboxylate ion, is
actually resonance stabilized.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.610
It is more stable than the
conjugate base of an alcohol,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.080
and let me show you that.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.150
This thing can share its
negative charge.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.330
Let me draw it.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.240
It can take this magenta
electron, give it to this

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.480
carbon, then this carbon will
have an extra electron, so

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.390
then it can give back an
electron to this top oxygen.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.400
So it is resonance stabilized
with this

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.260
structure right over here.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.565
Let me draw the same so it
could look like this.

00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:36.410
That's too big.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.110
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.510
It could look like this.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.290
And now, this took back this
blue electron, so now one of

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.880
the bonds is gone, and it
started off with two lone

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.560
pairs, so I want to draw that
there, and now it has

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.360
another lone pair.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.970
It has this electron, this
electron, and now it has that

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.390
blue electron over there.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.140
And now this oxygen, this top
oxygen, has a negative charge,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.810
and now the carbon
has a double bond

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.610
with this side oxygen.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.600
So now the carbon-- let me go
back to the yellow-- that's

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.190
the first bond with
that oxygen.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.510
It had one, two lone pairs to
begin with, and now it has

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.620
this magenta bond.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.900
So this pink electron
is at this end.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.280
And now this purple electron is
at the other end, or this

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.080
magenta electron, and
now it has a double

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.930
bond with this oxygen.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.160
And we know that when you have
resonance stabilization, it's

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.360
not like you're going
back and forth.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.050
The reality is that you have a
half double bond between both

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.250
oxygens, that the electrons are
just flowing across the

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.920
whole place, and that stabilizes
the molecule.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.220
And so to show that this is a
resonance structure, let me

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.570
put some brackets around it.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.160
And, in general, if this R group
right here is actually

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.750
even better at withdrawing
electrons, so if you put

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.570
something that was really
electronegative here,

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.530
something that likes to hog
electrons, it would make the

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.130
carboxylate ion even
more stable.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.500
It would make the carboxylic
acid even a better acid.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.630
So if you put something
electronegative here, then you

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.050
could imagine that some of this
negative charge that we

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.640
drew in these two resonance
structures, can be sucked to

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.070
that R group, and then that
would make it even more

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.850
stable, and would make
the carboxylic

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.000
acid even more acidic.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.530
Now, like in everything we've
looked at, there are some

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.930
common carboxylic acids that are
not systematically named,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.090
that it's probably a
good idea to know.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.230
And I'll start with one, just to
see the pattern that we've

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.470
seen in other things.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.590
We've seen that this thing over
here, if we have this, we

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.260
call this acetaldehyde.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.250
This was the very simple
aldehyde we studied.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.170
we saw that if we have something
like this, which is

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.720
a ketone, we called
this acetone.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.930
So you could imagine what we're
probably going to name--

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.760
let me do this in a different
color-- this

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.050
molecule right over here.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.930
This is a carboxylic acid,
clearly, and it has just that

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.950
one methyl group, just like the
acetaldehyde, just like

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.545
the acetone, and so this
is acetic acid.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.210
So the acetaldehyde, acetone,
and acetic acid for me are

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.980
fairly easy to memorize just
because they all have the

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.420
acet- part.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.870
They all have that as their
prefix, and this part of the

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.280
molecule is identical
in every case.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.290
And the difference is the
hydrogen, the methyl group

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.080
over here, or the OH group,
making this one a carboxylic

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.370
acid, an acetone,
and all that.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.360
Now, a couple of other ones that
it wouldn't hurt for you

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.850
to know is this one
right over here.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.950
This is, you could argue, even
simpler than acetic acid, and

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.205
this formic acid.

00:08:05.325 --> 00:08:08.800
And then another one, and
actually, I recently did a

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.290
general chemistry video with
this, where we did a titration

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.970
example, but this is essentially
two carboxyl

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.130
groups attached to each other.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:23.440
It looks like this, two carboxyl
groups attached to

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.280
each other and you
can see them.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.250
This is one carboxyl group right
over here, and then you

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.200
have another carboxyl group
right over here.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.470
And so this actually can
be deprotonated twice.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.510
This hydrogen can be lost, and
that hydrogen can be lost, and

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.760
this is oxalic acid.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:44.490
I'll leave you there.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.370
And in the next video, we'll
learn how to systematically

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.230
name carboxylic acids.
