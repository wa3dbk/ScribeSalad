00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.050
Evan from Norway has asked me
to do another u substitution

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.350
problem, and I like these
because it gets my momentum

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.920
going for doing other things
that maybe take a little

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.810
bit more preparation.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.050
And the problem he sent me--
and I hope I pronounced his

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:21.250
name right-- was the indefinite
integral of sin of x over

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.850
the cosine of x squared dx.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.270
This it also be written as-- he
wrote it in email, so I don't

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.600
know how he exactly saw it, but
it can also be written as sin

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.130
of x over cosine squared of x.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.710
Sometimes it's
written like that.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.270
Either way, I like looking
at this a bit better.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.350
It's a little bit
less ambiguous.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.740
But in general you know to do u
substitution, or integration by

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.930
substitution when you see
something and you see its

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.580
derivative sitting there.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.820
Right.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.190
You're like wow, this cosine of
x was just an x, or if it was

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.920
just a u, this would be a
really easy integral to do.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.010
We know how to do
this integral.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.450
Let me do it on the side.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.680
This integral would be easy.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.850
1 over x squared dx.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.690
We know how to do that.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.210
That would just be the
antiderivative of x squared.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.580
This is the same thing as the
antiderivative of x to the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.500
minus 2 dx, and we know how to
take the antiderivative

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.500
of something like that.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.810
You increase the exponent by
1 and then you multiply by

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.730
what your new exponent is.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.510
So it would be minus
x-- I'm sorry.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
You increase your exponent by
1, and then you divide by

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.040
whatever your new exponent is.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160
So you would,
[? let me do the, ?]

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.450
increasing the exponent x to
the minus 2, you'd increase

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.420
the exponent, you'd
get x to the minus 1.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.100
And then when you divide this
by minus 1 you get this minus

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.860
out front, and then of course
you'd have the plus c.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.070
If you don't believe it
take the derivative.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.190
Negative 1 times minus 1.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.340
That's a positive.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.360
And then you'd decrease
the exponent by 1, you

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.980
get x to the minus 2.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.700
So if we could get it in
a form that looks like

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.530
this, we'd be all set.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.250
And you kind of do
see a pattern.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.330
Where this x is you have a
cosine there, and then we have

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.650
cosines derivative there.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.950
So that's the big clue that we
should be using u substitution.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.815
So let's do that.

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:09.920
And what we're going to do is
we're going to substitute

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.670
u for cosine of x.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.170
So if we say u is equal to
cosine of x, and let's take

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.750
the derivative of u
with respect to x.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.740
So du/dx is equal to what?

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.790
What's the derivative of
cosine of x? it's not

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.690
quite sin of x, right?

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.302
It's minus sin of x.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.370
And then we can multiply both
sides by dx, and you get du is

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.720
equal to minus sin of x dx.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.090
I just multiplied
both sides by dx.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.120
And then up here we
have sin of x dx.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.380
We don't have minus
sin of x dx.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.710
There we have sin of x dx.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.980
We could have rewritten this
top integral, we could have

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.500
rewritten it like this.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.930
Sin of x dx.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.680
All of that over
cosine of x squared.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.780
So if we want to substitute for
this, here we have a minus.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.750
Let's multiply both sides of
this by a negative 1, and you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.080
get minus du is equal
to sin of x dx.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.370
And let's see.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.650
So let's rewrite this
original problem.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.690
Now I know I'm running
out of space.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.000
Let me rewrite it.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.780
So we know that u is equal to
cosine of x, so let's do that.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.720
So now this integral becomes--
and the denominator, instead of

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.170
cosine of x squared,
u is cosine of x.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.930
That's u, right?

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.900
We made that definition.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.240
So that's over u squared.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.260
Cosine of x becomes u.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.240
And then sin of x dx right up
there, what is that equal to?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.490
Well we just solved
for it here.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.930
That's equal to minus du.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.120
Sin of x dx is
equal to minus du.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.810
So that we can replace
with this, minus du.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.330
And then of course this has
the exact same form as

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.200
this thing right here.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.420
You could rewrite this,
this is equal to let's say

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.940
minus 1 over u squared du.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.280
I'm just writing it a
bunch of different ways.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.455
Whatever is easier for
you to conceptualize.

00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:27.550
The same thing as minus
u to the minus 2 du.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.180
And then here we do the same
thing we did up here, although

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.870
now we have a minus out front,
that actually makes it

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.300
a little bit cleaner.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.530
To take the antiderivative, we
raise u-- it was to the minus 2

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.230
power, let's raise it to 1
power higher than that-- so

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.960
minus 2 plus 1 is minus 1.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.760
So it's u to the minus 1 power,
and then you want to divide by

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.810
minus 1, and I'll do
it explicitly here.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.760
Minus one.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.640
And then you had this negative
that was sitting out there

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.200
before, so that negative is
still going to be there.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.110
And of course you're
going to have a plus c.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.790
You can view this as a negative
1 or, this negative divided

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.870
by a negative, they're
going to cancel out.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.540
And so you're just left with u
to the minus 1 plus c, or 1

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.970
over u plus c is the
antiderivative-- oh sorry,

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.950
we're not done yet.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.400
That's just the
antiderivative of this.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.330
And now we have our
substitution to deal with.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.850
What was our substitution
that we started with?

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.780
u is equal to cosine of x.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.700
So if u is equal to cosine of
x, this thing is equal to 1

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:41.830
over cosine of x plus c is
equal to the antiderivative of

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:50.200
our original problem, which was
sin of x over cosine

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.450
of x squared dx.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.502
There you go.

00:05:54.502 --> 00:05:55.310
See you in the next video.
