00:00:00.292 --> 00:00:02.261
- [Voiceover] In the last
couple videos I talked about

00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:04.354
the local linearization of a function.

00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:07.096
And in terms of graphs, there's
a nice interpretation here

00:00:07.096 --> 00:00:09.023
where if you imagine a graph of a function

00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:11.246
and you want to approximate
it near a specific point,

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:13.706
you picture that point
somewhere on the graph,

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:14.986
and it doesn't have to be there,

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:18.263
you know I can choose to be
anywhere else along the graph,

00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:20.175
but if you have some sort
of point and you want

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:22.063
to approximate the function near there

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:24.169
you can have another function whose graph

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.913
is just a flat plane,

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:27.839
and specifically a plane
which is tangent to

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.865
your original graph at that point.

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:31.496
And that's kind of visually how you

00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:33.311
think about the local linearization.

00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:35.152
And what I'm going to
start doing here in this

00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:36.898
next video and in the ones following,

00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:39.470
is talking about quadratic approximations.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.303
So quadratic approximations,

00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:49.010
and these, these basically
take these to the next level.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.508
And first I'll show what
they look like graphically

00:00:51.508 --> 00:00:53.444
and then I'll show you what
it actually means in formulas.

00:00:53.444 --> 00:00:55.990
But graphically instead of
having a plane that's flat,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.762
you have a few more
parameters to deal with,

00:00:57.762 --> 00:01:00.321
and you can give yourself
some kind of surface that

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:02.726
hugs the graph a little bit more closely.

00:01:02.726 --> 00:01:04.568
It's still going to be
simpler in terms of formulas,

00:01:04.568 --> 00:01:07.240
it can still be notably simpler
than the original function,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.282
but this actually hugs it closely.

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:11.178
And as we move around the point

00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:12.598
that it's approximating here,

00:01:12.598 --> 00:01:14.890
the way that it hugs it
can look pretty different.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.605
And if you want to
think graphically what a

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:19.489
quadratic approximation is,

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:22.414
you can basically say if
you slice this surface,

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:25.185
this kind of ghostly white
surface in any direction

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.027
it'll look like a parabola of some kind.

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:29.702
And notice that given that
we're dealing in multiple

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:32.431
dimensions that can make
things look pretty complicated,

00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:35.271
like this right here, you know
if you slice it kind of in

00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:39.420
this direction, whoa, if you
look at it from this angle

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.881
it kind of looks like
a concave up parabola,

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:43.330
but if you were looking at it from another

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.453
direction it kind of looks concave down,

00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:46.903
and all-in-all you get
a surface that actually

00:01:46.903 --> 00:01:49.364
has quite a bit of
information carried within it.

00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:52.752
And you can see that by
hugging the graph very closely

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:55.185
this approximation is going to be,

00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:56.788
well, it's going to be even closer,

00:01:56.788 --> 00:01:59.038
because near the point
where you're approximating

00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:00.262
you can go out, you know,

00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:01.767
you can take a couple steps away

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.071
and the approximation is still going to

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:04.702
be very close to what the graph is,

00:02:04.702 --> 00:02:06.249
and it's only when you
step really far away from

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.431
the original point that the approximation

00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:11.059
starts to deviate away
from the graph itself.

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:12.662
So this is going to be
something that although

00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:14.237
it takes more information to describe than

00:02:14.237 --> 00:02:15.842
a local linearization it gives

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:17.824
us a much closer approximation.

00:02:17.824 --> 00:02:19.764
So a linear function which, you know,

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.042
one that just draws a plane like this,

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.660
in terms of actual
function what this means,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.327
so kind of a linear,

00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:31.423
this is going to be some
kind of function of x and y,

00:02:31.423 --> 00:02:33.697
and what it looks like
is some kind of constant,

00:02:33.697 --> 00:02:37.888
which I'll say a plus another
constant times the variable x,

00:02:37.888 --> 00:02:40.504
plus another constant
times the variable y,

00:02:40.504 --> 00:02:43.148
this is sort of the basic
form of linear functions.

00:02:43.148 --> 00:02:44.947
And technically this isn't
linear if one is going

00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:46.677
to be really pedantic
and they would say that

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:50.024
that's actually affine,
because I'm strictly speaking

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:52.106
linear functions shouldn't
have this constant term,

00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:54.004
it should be purely x's and y's,

00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:55.650
but in the context of approximations

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.969
people would usually
call this a linear term.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.528
So quadratic term, what
this is going to look like,

00:03:01.528 --> 00:03:04.482
quadratic,

00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:07.055
we are allowed to have all
the same terms as that linear

00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:09.123
one, so you can have constant,

00:03:09.123 --> 00:03:12.540
you can have these two
linear terms bx and cy,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.509
and then you're allowed
to have anything that

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.843
has two variables multiplied into it.

00:03:16.843 --> 00:03:20.823
So maybe I'll have d times x squared,

00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:23.763
and then you can also
have something times xy,

00:03:23.763 --> 00:03:25.394
this is considered a quadratic term.

00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:26.463
Which is a little bit weird at first,

00:03:26.463 --> 00:03:28.263
because usually we think
of quadratics as associated

00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:29.992
with that exponent two,

00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:31.553
but really it's just saying any time

00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:33.691
you have two variables multiplied in,

00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:35.759
and then we can add some other constants,

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.038
say f times y squared.

00:03:38.038 --> 00:03:40.666
Where, you know, now we're
multiplying two y's into it.

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:42.635
So all of these guys,
these are what you would

00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:44.422
call your quadratic terms.

00:03:44.422 --> 00:03:47.178
Things that either x squared,
y squared, or x times y,

00:03:47.178 --> 00:03:48.936
anything that has two variables in it.

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:50.441
So you can see this gives
us a lot more control

00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:53.183
because previously, as
we tweaked the constants

00:03:53.183 --> 00:03:56.428
a, b, and c, you're able to give yourself,

00:03:56.428 --> 00:03:58.475
you know, that gives you
control over all sorts

00:03:58.475 --> 00:04:00.472
of planes in space, and
if you choose the most

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:02.314
optimal one you'll get
one that's tangent to

00:04:02.314 --> 00:04:04.283
your curve at this specific point,

00:04:04.283 --> 00:04:06.294
and kind of, it'll depend
on where that point is,

00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:08.208
you'll get different planes,
but they're all tangent.

00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:10.781
So what we're going to do in
the next couple of videos,

00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:13.241
is talk about how you tweak all of these

00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:16.125
six different constants so
that you can get functions

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.909
that really closely hug the curve, right?

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:20.619
And as you, and they're
all going to depend on the

00:04:20.619 --> 00:04:22.708
original point because as
you move that point around,

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:25.394
what it takes to hug the curve
is going to be different.

00:04:25.394 --> 00:04:27.547
It's going to have to do
with partial differential

00:04:27.547 --> 00:04:29.880
information about your original function,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.455
the function whose graph this is,

00:04:31.455 --> 00:04:33.114
and it's going to look pretty similar to

00:04:33.114 --> 00:04:34.619
the local linearization case,

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:36.504
just you know, added complexity so we have

00:04:36.504 --> 00:04:38.543
to add a few more steps in there.

00:04:38.543 --> 00:04:40.911
And I'll see you next
video talking about that.
