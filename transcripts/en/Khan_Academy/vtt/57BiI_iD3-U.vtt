00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.220
Let's see if we can remove the
parameter t from a slightly

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.180
more interesting example.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.130
So let's say that x is equal
to 3 times the cosine of t.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.570
And y is equal to 2
times the sine of t.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.470
We can try to remove the
parameter the same way we did

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.970
in the previous video, where we
can solve for t in terms of

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.120
either x or y and then
substitute back in.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.300
And I'll do that.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.575
But I want to do that first,
just to show you that it kind

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.740
of leads to a hairy or
an unintuitive answer.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.220
So if we solve for--
let's solve for t here.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.940
We could do it either one,
they're equally complex.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.940
So if we solve for t here,
we would say divide

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.060
both sides by 2.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.970
You'd get y over 2 is
equal to sine of t.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.150
And then you would take the
arcsine of both sides, or the

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.730
inverse sine of both sides, and
you would get-- I like writing

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.710
arcsine, because inverse sine,
people often confuse it with an

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.600
exponent, taking it to
the negative 1 power.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.510
Arcsine of y over
2 is equal to t.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.050
Actually, let me do that
little aside there.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.630
I should probably do it at the
trigonometry playlist, but it's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.710
a good thing to hit home.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.570
Because I think
people get confused.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.840
So arcsine of anything,
let's say, y.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.910
The other way of writing
that is sine minus 1 of y.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.320
These two things are
equivalent, when

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.420
they're normally used.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.200
But I don't like using this
notation most of the time,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.890
because it can be ambiguous.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:47.150
This could mean sine of y to
the negative 1 power, which

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.990
equals 1 over sine of y.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.540
And arcsine and this are
definitely not the same thing.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.750
So you want to be very careful
there to make sure that you

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.750
don't get confused when someone
writes an inverse

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.560
sine like this.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.365
But they're not actually
taking sine of y to

00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:03.700
the negative 1 power.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.970
On the other hand, if someone
were to write sine squared of

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.270
y, this is unambiguously the
same thing as sine

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.230
of y squared.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.050
In fact, I wish this was the
more conventional notation

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.770
because it wouldn't make people
think, oh, 2 and minus 1

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.860
there, and of course, that's
just sine of y squared.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.380
So it can be very ambiguous.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.950
And of course, if this was a
negative, this would be a minus

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.480
2, and then this really would
be 1 over sine of y squared.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.930
That's why, just a long-winded
way of explaining why I

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.120
wrote arcsine, instead of
inverse sine right there.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.830
Needless to say, let's
get back to the problem.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.090
So we've solved for
t in terms of y.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.410
Now we can substitute
back here.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.780
And we've got an expression
for x in terms of y.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.135
So we get x is equal to 3
times the cosine of t.

00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:59.510
But we just solved for t. t
is this thing right here.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.030
So it's the cosine of
arcsine of y over 2.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.380
And we have eliminated the
parameter, but this is a very

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.680
non-intuitive equation.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.710
We could have done
the other way.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.190
We could have solved for y in
terms of x and we would have

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.200
gotten the sine of
the arccosine.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.840
It would have been equally
hairy or non-intuitive.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.400
But either way, we did remove
the parameters so I guess

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.720
we could mildly pat
ourselves on the back.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.110
But that's not the
purpose of this video.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.280
The purpose of this video is to
see if there's any way we can

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.150
remove the parameter that leads
to a more intuitive equation

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.790
involving x and y.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.250
And what we're going to do is,
I guess you can call it a bit

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.140
of a trick, but it's something
that shows up a lot.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.850
Especially when you deal
with polar coordinates.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.250
And you might want to watch
my polar coordinate videos,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.545
because this essentially
touches on that.

00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:52.800
But if I said-- let me rewrite
them. x is equal to 3 cosine of

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.940
t and y is equal
to 2 sine of t.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.780
So what we can do is
just think, well, how

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.620
can we write this?

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.110
And you know, cosine
of t and [? kind ?]

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.270
of t, how can we relate them?

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.460
And the first thing that comes
to my mind is just the unit

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.300
circle, or to some degree, the
most basic of all of the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.890
trigonometric identities.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.320
And that is that the cosine
squared of t plus the sine

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.980
squared of t is equal to 1.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.210
This comes from
the unit circle.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.000
I explained it in the unit
circle video, and that's

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.840
because the equation for the
unit circle is x squared plus

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.330
y squared is equal to 1.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.300
The cosine of the angle is the
x coordinate, the sine of the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.180
angle is the y coordinate,
and so on and so forth.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.100
But this is our trig identity.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.690
You don't have to think about
it too much right now.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.550
Just, I guess, know that it's
true and watch some of the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.330
other videos if you want
it proven that it's true.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.600
But if we can somehow replace
this cosine squared with some

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.880
expression in x, and replace
the sine or the sine squared

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.400
with some expression of
y, we'd be done, right?

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.490
And then we would
have it equaling 1.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.680
And that shouldn't be too hard.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.160
We can rewrite this.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.040
We can set cosine of t equal to
something in x, and we can set

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.780
sine of t equal in
something in y.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.400
So let's do that.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.100
We divide both sides
of the equation by 3.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.165
You get x over 3 is
equal to cosine of t.

00:05:12.165 --> 00:05:16.400
And if you divide both sides of
this equation by 2, you get y

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.590
over 2 is equal to sine of t.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.120
And then we can use this
trigonometric identity.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.190
Instead of the cosine of t,
we can substitute x over 3.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.780
Instead of the sine of t, we
can substitute y over 2.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.810
And you get x over 3 squared--
that's that, right there,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.490
that's just cosine of t
squared-- plus y over 2

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.730
squared-- that's just sine of t
squared-- is equal to 1.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.190
And now this is starting to
look a lot better than this.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.330
This, I have no
idea what this is.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.850
But hopefully if you've watched
the conic section videos, you

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.110
can already recognize that this
is starting to look

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.660
like an ellipse.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.870
We can simplify
it a little bit.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.010
We could say this is equal to x
squared over 9 plus y squared

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.070
over 4 is equal to 1.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.380
And if we were to graph this
ellipse-- we will actually

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.220
graph it-- we get--
let me draw my axis.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.910
I'm using this blue color
a little bit too much,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.920
it's getting monotonous.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.530
OK, let me use the purple.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.210
So that's our x-axis.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.860
That's our y-axis.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.610
The major axis is in the
x direction because the

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.010
denominator here is
larger than that one.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.150
And it's the semi-major
radius-- this is going

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.240
to be the square root
of this, it's 3.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.360
1, 2, 3 in that direction.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.720
1, 2, 3.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.470
I know I'm centered in
0, because neither of

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.140
these are shifted.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.540
You should watch the conic
section videos if this

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.160
sounds unfamiliar to you.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.540
And the semi-minor radius
is the square root

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.210
of 4, so that's 2.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.665
So they get 1, 2.

00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:05.410
And 1, 2.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.570
Let me see if I can
draw this ellipse.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:17.020
So it looks something
like that.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.870
There you go.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.860
So just like that, by
eliminating the parameter t, we

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.170
got this equation in a form
that we immediately were able

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.360
to recognize as ellipse.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.970
When I just look at that,
unless you deal with parametric

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.680
equations, or maybe polar
coordinates a lot, it's not

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.170
obvious that this is the
parametric equation

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.110
for an ellipse.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.050
But this, once you learn
about conic sections,

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.100
is pretty clear.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.410
It's an ellipse.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.490
And it's easy to
draw that ellipse.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.400
But in removing the t and from
going from these equations up

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.090
here, and from going from that
to that, like in the last

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.050
video, we lost information.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.330
We lost, one, what is the
direction that we move

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.850
in as t increases?

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.180
And we also don't know what
point on this ellipse we

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.230
are at any given time, t.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.750
So to do that, let's
make our little table.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.525
So let's take some values of t.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:26.510
So we'll make a little
table. t, x, and y.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.960
It's good to pick values of t.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.620
Remember-- let me rewrite the
equations again, so we didn't

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.250
lose it-- x was equal to 3
cosine of t, and y is

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.010
equal to 2 sine of t.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.250
It's good to take values of t
where it's easy to figure out

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.900
what the cosine and sine are,
and without using a calculator.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.130
We're assuming the t is in
radiance, just for simplicity.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.560
So let's pick t is equal to 0.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.550
t is equal to pi over 2.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.240
That's 90 degrees in degrees.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.650
And t is equal to pi.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.750
And so what is x when
t is equal to 0?

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:03.980
Well, cosine of 0 is
1 times 3, that's 3.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.810
What's x, when t is
just pi over 2?

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.490
Cosine of pi over 2 is 0.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.780
0 times 3 is 0.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.100
And what's x equal when
t is equal to pi?

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.300
Cosine of pi is minus 1.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.380
Minus 1 times 3 is minus 3.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.750
Fair enough.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.770
Now let's do the y's.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.740
When t is 0 what is y?

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.060
Sine is 0, 0.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.480
So 2 times 0 is 0.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.890
When t is pi over 2,
sine of pi over 2 is 1.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.380
1 times 2 is 2.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.570
And when t is pi, sine of
pi-- that's sine of 180

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.770
degrees-- that's 0.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.420
2 times 0 is 0.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.720
So let's plot these points.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.410
When time is 0, we're
at the point 3, 0.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.040
So 3, 0-- 3, 0 is right there.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.090
This is t equals 0.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.230
When t increases by pi over 2,
or if this was seconds, pi over

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.380
2 seconds is like 1.7
something seconds.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:10.030
So at t equals pi over 2,
we're at the point 0, 2.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.700
We're right over here.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.380
So this is at t is
equal to pi over 2.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.820
And then when t increases a
little bit more-- when we're

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.820
at t is equal to pi-- we're
at the point minus 3, 0.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.760
We're here.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.160
So this is t is equal to
pi or, you know, we could

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.090
write 3.14159 seconds.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.080
3.14 seconds.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.830
And actually, you know, I want
to make the point, t does not

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.620
have to be time, and we don't
have to be dealing

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.090
with seconds.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.360
But I like to think
about it that way.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.700
I like to think about, maybe
this is describing some object

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.230
in orbit around, I don't
know, something else.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.380
So now we know the direction.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.650
As t increased from 0 to pi
over 2 to pi, we went this way.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.000
We went counterclockwise.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.280
So the direction of t's
parametric equations

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.090
is in that direction.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.150
And you might be saying,
Sal, you know, why'd we

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.450
have to do 3 points?

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.110
We could have just done
2, and made a line.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.850
If we just had that point and
that point, you might have

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.680
immediately said, oh, we
went from there to there.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.500
But that really wouldn't
have been enough.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.150
Because maybe we got from
here to there by going

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.470
the other way around.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.220
So giving that third point lets
us know that the direction is

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.610
definitely counterclockwise.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:31.200
And so what happens if we just
take t from 0 to infinity?

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.470
What happens if we bound t?
t is greater than 0 and

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.200
less than infinity.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.130
Well, we're just going
to keep going around

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.820
this ellipse forever.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.760
Multiple times.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.600
Keep writing over and
over, infinite times.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.480
If we went from minus infinity
to infinity, then we would

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.480
have always been doing it, I
guess is the way to put it.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.590
Or if we just wanted to trace
this out once, we could go from

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.440
t is less than or equal to-- or
t is greater than

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.370
or equal to 0.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:03.900
All the way to t is less
than or equal to 2 pi.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.090
And in this situation,
t really is the angle

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.010
that we're tracing out.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.220
If we were to think of this
in polar coordinates, this

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.010
is t at any given time.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.570
And I just thought I would
throw that out there.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.700
It isn't always, but in
this case it really is.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.510
When you go from 0 to 2 pi
radius, you've made 1 circle.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.280
But this is about parametric
equations and not trigonometry.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.090
So I don't want to focus
too much on that.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.850
But anyway, that was neat.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.340
When we started with this,
if I just showed you those

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.330
parametric equations, you'd
have no idea what

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.040
that looks like.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.470
But by recognizing the trig
identity, we were able to

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.930
simplify it to an ellipse,
draw the ellipse.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.880
And then by plotting a couple
of points, we were able to

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.000
figure out the direction at
which, if this was describing

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.380
a particle in motion, the
direction in which that

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.140
particle was actually moving.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.530
Anyway, hope you enjoyed that.
