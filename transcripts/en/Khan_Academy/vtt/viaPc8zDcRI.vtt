00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.300
I just got sent this
problem, and it's a

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.350
pretty meaty problem.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.910
A lot harder than what
you'd normally find

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.580
in most textbooks.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.470
So I thought it would help
us all to work it out.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.190
And it's one of those problems
that when you first read it,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.630
your eyes kind of glaze over,
but when you understand what

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.340
they're talking about, it's
reasonably interesting.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.580
So they say, the curve in the
figure above is the parabola

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.190
y is equal to x squared.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.150
So this curve right there is
y is equal to x squared.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.260
Let us define a normal line as
a line whose first quadrant

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.650
intersection with the parabola
is perpendicular

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.940
to the parabola.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.920
So this is the first
quadrant, right here.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.230
And they're saying that a
normal line is something, when

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.570
the first quadrant intersection
with the parabola is

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.720
normal to the parabola.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.870
So if I were to draw a tangent
line right there, this line is

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.450
normal to that tangent line.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.070
That's all that's saying.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.470
So this is a normal
line, right there.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.250
Normal line.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.090
Fair enough.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.410
5 normal lines are
shown in the figure.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.750
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.200
Good enough.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.010
And these all look
perpendicular, or normal to

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.540
the parabola in the first
quadrant intersection,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.100
so that makes sense.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.420
For a while, the x-coordinate
of the second quadrant

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.140
intersection of the normal line
of the parabola gets smaller,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.970
as the x-coordinate of the
first quadrant intersection

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.570
gets smaller.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.760
So let's see what happens as
the x-quadrant of the first

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.570
intersection gets smaller.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.620
So this is where I left
off in that dense text.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.050
So if I start at this point
right here, my x-coordinate

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.840
right there would look
something like this.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.170
Let me go down.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.380
my x-coordinate is
right around there.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.080
And then as I move to a smaller
x-coordinate to, say, this one

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.170
right here, what happened
to the normal line?

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.380
Or even more important, what
happened to the intersection

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.590
of the normal line in
the second quadrant?

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.740
This is the second
quadrant, right here.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.520
So when I had a larger
x-value here, my normal

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.110
line intersected here,
in the second quadrant.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.470
Then when I brought my x-value
in, when I lowered my x-value,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.420
my x-value here, because this
is the next point, right here,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.960
my x-value at the intersection
here, went-- actually,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.910
their wording is bad.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.570
They're saying that
the second quadrant

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.510
intersection gets smaller.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.500
But actually, it's not
really getting smaller.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.870
It's getting less negative.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.430
I guess smaller could be just
absolute value or magnitude,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.380
but it's just getting
less negative.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.060
It's moving there, but
it's actually becoming

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.040
a larger number, right?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.510
It's becoming less negative,
but a larger number.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.110
But if we think in absolute
value, I guess it's

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.920
getting smaller, right?

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.550
As we went from that point to
that point, as we moved the x

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.660
in for the intersection of the
first quadrant, the second

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.430
quadrant intersection also
moved in a bit, from

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.640
that line to that line.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.890
Fair enough.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.300
But eventually, a normal line
second quadrant intersection

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.270
gets as small as it can get.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.520
So if we keep lowering our
x-value in the first quadrant,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.210
so we keep on pulling in the
first quadrant, as we

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.480
get to this point.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.060
And then this point intersects
the second quadrant,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.390
right there.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.580
And then, if you go even
smaller x-values in the first

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.150
quadrant then your normal line
starts intersecting in the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.240
second quadrant, further and
further negative numbers.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.680
So you can kind of view this
as the highest value, or the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.020
smallest absolute value, at
which the normal line can

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.720
intersect in the
second quadrant

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.870
Let me make that clear.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.700
Up here, you were intersecting
when you had a large x in the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.800
first quadrant, you had a large
negative x in the second

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.120
quadrant intersection.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.890
And then as you lowered your
x-value, here, you had a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.940
smaller negative value.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.410
Up until you got to this point,
right here, you got this, which

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.980
you can view as the smallest
negative value could get, and

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.930
then when you pulled in your x
even more, these normal lines

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.280
started to push out again,
out in the second quadrant.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.580
That's, I think, what
they're talking about.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.220
The extreme normal line
is shown as a thick

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.230
line in the figure.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.480
Right.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.710
This is the extreme normal
line, right there.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.500
So this is the extreme
one, that deep, bold one.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.040
Extreme normal line.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.600
After this point, when you pull
in your x-values even more, the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.680
intersection in your second
quadrant starts to

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.900
push out some.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.770
And you can think of the
extreme case, if you draw the

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.360
normal line down here, your
intersection with the second

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.260
quadrant is going to be way out
here someplace, although it

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.430
seems like it's kind of
asymptoting a little bit.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.990
But I don't know.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.060
Let's read the rest
of the problem.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.385
Once the normal line passes
the extreme normal line, the

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:30.130
x-coordinates of their second
quadrant intersections what the

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.300
parabola start to increase.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.520
And they're really, when they
say they start to increase,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.100
they're actually just
becoming more negative.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.550
That wording is bad.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.560
I should change this to
more, more negative.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.420
Or they're becoming
larger negative numbers.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.450
Because once you get below
this, then all of a sudden

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.460
the x-intersections start
to push out more in

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.390
the second quadrant.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.930
Fair enough.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.640
The figures show 2
pairs of normal lines.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.470
Fair enough.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.740
The 2 normal lines of a pair
have the same second quadrant

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.730
intersection with the parabola,
but 1 is above the extreme

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.590
normal line, in the first
quadrant, the other

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.510
is below it.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.180
Right, fair enough.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.280
For example, this guy right
here, this is when we

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.360
had a large x-value.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.760
He intersects with the
second quadrant there.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.940
Then if you lower and lower the
x-value, if you lower it

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.930
enough, you pass the extreme
normal line, and then you get

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.890
to this point, and then this
point, he intersects, or

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.010
actually, you go to this point.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.160
So if you pull in your x-value
enough, you once again

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.650
intersect at that same point
in the second quadrant.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.510
So hopefully I'm making some
sense to you, as I try to make

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.410
some sense of this problem.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.980
OK.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.210
Now what do they want to know?

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.470
And I think I only have time
for the first part of this.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.030
Maybe I'll do the second
part in the another video.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.850
Find the equation of the
extreme normal line.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.790
Well, that seems very daunting
at first, but I think our

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.790
toolkit of derivatives, and
what we know about equations

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.710
of a line, should be
able to get us there.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.470
So what's the slope of
the tangent line at any

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.490
point on this curve?

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.540
Well, we just take the
derivative of y equals

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.910
x squared, and y prime
is just equal to 2x.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:14.040
This is the slope of the
tangent at any point x.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.290
So if I want to know the slope
of the tangent at x0, at some

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.250
particular x, I would just
say, well, let me just say,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.010
slope, it would be 2 x0.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.490
Or let me just say, f of
x0 is equal to 2 x0.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.760
This is the slope at
any particular x0 of

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.310
the tangent line.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.550
Now, the normal line slope
is perpendicular to this.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.720
So the perpendicular line, and
I won't review it here, but the

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.730
perpendicular line has a
negative inverse slope.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:54.460
So the slope of normal line at
x0 will be the negative inverse

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.590
of this, because this is the
slope of the tangent line x0.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.090
So it'll be equal to
minus 1 over 2 x0.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.510
Fair enough.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:10.100
Now, what is the equation of
the normal line at x0 let's say

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.570
that this is my x0 in question.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.500
What is the equation of
the normal line there?

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.960
Well, we can just use
the point-slope form

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.330
of our equation.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.570
So this point right here
will be on the normal line.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.230
And that's the
point x0 squared.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.030
Because this the graph of
y equals x0, x squared.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.720
So this normal line will
also have this point.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.970
So we could say that the
equation of the normal line,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:48.300
let me write it down, would
be equal to, this is just a

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.480
point-slope definition
of a line.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.480
You say, y minus the y-point,
which is just x0 squared,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.810
that's that right there, is
equal to the slope of the

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:08.865
normal line minus 1 over
2 x0 times x minus the

00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:10.050
x-point that we're at.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.680
Minus x, minus x0.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.780
This is the equation
of the normal line.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.260
So let's see.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.620
And what we care about is when
x0 is greater than 0, right?

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.740
We care about the normal line
when we're in the first

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.410
quadrant, we're in all of
these values right there.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.710
So that's my equation
of the normal line.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.150
And let's solve it
explicitly in terms of x.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.800
So y is a function of x.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.780
Well, if I add x0 squared
to both sides, I get y is

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.760
equal to, actually, let
me multiply this guy out.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:52.340
I get minus 1/2 x0 times x, and
then I have plus, plus, because

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.880
I have a minus times
a minus, plus 1/2.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.110
The x0 and the over the
x0, they cancel out.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.340
And then I have to add
this x0 to both sides.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.560
So all I did so far, this is
just this part right there.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.040
That's this right there.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.260
And then I have to add this to
both sides of the equation, so

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.130
then I have plus x0 squared.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.300
So this is the equation of the
normal line, in mx plus b form.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.860
This is its slope, this is
the m, and then this is its

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.740
y-intercept right here.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.280
That's kind of the b.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.200
Now, what do we care about?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.600
We care about where
this thing intersects.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.990
We care about where it
intersects the parabola.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.130
And the parabola, that's pretty
straightforward, that's just

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.590
y is equal to x squared.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.960
So to figure out where they
intersect, we just have

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.660
to set the 2 y's to be
equal to each other.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.110
So they intersect, the x-values
where they intersect, x

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.660
squared, this y would have
to be equal to that y.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.940
Or we could just substitute
this in for that y.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:02.870
So you get x squared is equal
to minus 1 over 2 x0 times x,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:10.180
plus 1/2 plus x0 squared.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.020
Fair enough.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:15.350
And let's put this in a
quadratic equation, or try to

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.670
solve this, so we can apply
the quadratic equation.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.410
So let's put all of this
stuff on the lefthand side.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:29.420
So you get x squared plus
1 over 2 x0 times x minus

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:35.680
all of this, 1/2 plus x0
squared is equal to 0.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.100
All I did is, I took all of
this stuff and I put it on the

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.770
lefthand side of the equation.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.340
Now, this is just a standard
quadratic equation, so we can

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:47.680
figure out now where the
x-values that satisfy this

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.420
quadratic equation will tell
us where our normal line

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.890
and our parabola intersect.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.850
So let's just apply the
quadratic equation here.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.690
So the potential x-values,
where they intersect, x is

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.950
equal to minus b, I'm
just applying the

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.400
quadratic equation.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:10.950
So minus b is minus 1 over
2 x0, plus or minus the

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.060
square root of b squared.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.200
So that's that squared.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:22.520
So it's one over four
x0 squared minus 4ac.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.570
So minus 4 times 1 times
this minus thing.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.320
So I'm going to have a minus
times a minus is a plus, so

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.370
it's just 4 times this,
because there was one there.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.720
So plus 4 times
this, right here.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:42.940
4 times this is just
2 plus 4 x0 squared.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.840
All I did is, this
is 4ac right here.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.190
Well, minus 4ac.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.295
The minus and the minus
canceled out, so

00:11:50.295 --> 00:11:50.980
you got a plus.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.820
There's a 1.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:12:00.010
So 4 times c is just
2 plus 4x squared.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.410
I just multiply this by two,
and of course all of this

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.290
should be over 2 times
a. a is just 2 there.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.000
So let's see if I
can simplify this.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.890
Remember what we're doing.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:14.740
We're just figuring out where
the normal line and the

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.810
parabola intersect.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.540
Now, what do we get here.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.350
This looks like a little
hairy beast here.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.980
Let me see if I can simplify
this a little bit.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:31.310
So let us factor out--
let me rewrite this.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:40.290
I can just divide everything by
1/2, so this is minus 1 over 4

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:47.110
x0, I just divided this by 2,
plus or minus 1/2, that's just

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.720
this 1/2 right there, times the
square root, let me see what

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.560
I can simplify out of here.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:13:03.300
So if I factor out a 4 over
x0 squared, then what does

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.630
my expression become?

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:12.000
This term right here will
become an x to the fourth, x0

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.140
to the fourth, plus, now,
what does this term become?

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:25.240
This term becomes
a 1/2 x0 squared.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.110
And just to verify this,
multiply 4 times 1/2, you

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.110
get 2, and then the x0
squares cancel out.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.410
So write this term times that,
will equal 2, and then you have

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.280
plus-- now we factored a four
out of this and the x0

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.762
squared, so plus 1/16.

00:13:40.762 --> 00:13:45.060
Let me scroll over
a little bit.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.840
And you can verify
that this works out.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.280
If you were to multiply this
out, you should get this

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.340
business right here.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.680
I see the home stretch here,
because this should actually

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.890
factor out quite neatly.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.090
So what does this equal?

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.120
So the intersection of
our normal line and our

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.650
parabola is equal to this.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:12.510
Minus 1 over 4 x0 plus or
minus 1/2 times the square

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.290
root of this business.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.350
And the square root, this
thing right here is

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.160
4 over x0 squared.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.880
Now what's this?

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.680
This is actually, lucky
for us, a perfect square.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.850
And I won't go into details,
because then the video will get

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.090
too long, but I think you can
recognize that this is

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:33.580
x0 squared, plus 1/4.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.410
If you don't believe me,
square this thing right here.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.480
You'll get this
expression right there.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.370
And luckily enough, this is
a perfect square, so we

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.650
can actually take the
square root of it.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.110
And so we get, the point
at which they intersect,

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.730
our normal line and our
parabola, and this is

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.970
quite a hairy problem.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:54.960
The points where they intersect
is minus 1 over 4 x0, plus

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.990
or minus 1/2 times the
square root of this.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.270
The square root of this is the
square root of this, which is

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:05.810
just 2 over x0 times the square
root of this, which is

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.590
x0 squared plus 1/4.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:17.860
And if I were to rewrite all of
this, I'd get minus 1 over 4 x0

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.090
plus, let's see, this 1/2 and
this 2 cancel out, right?

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.810
So these cancel out.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.650
So plus or minus, now I
just have a one over

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:27.960
x0 times x0 squared.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:35.360
So I have 1 over x0-- oh sorry,
let me, we have to be very

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.475
careful there-- x0 squared
divided by x0 is just x0, let

00:15:39.475 --> 00:15:42.400
me do that in a yellow color so
you know what I'm dealing with.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.940
This term multiplied by this
term is just x0, and then

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.560
you have a plus 1/4 x0.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.630
And this is all a
parentheses here.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.280
So these are the two points at
which the normal curve and

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.610
our parabola intersect.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.810
Let me just be very clear.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:04.230
Those 2 points are, for if
this is my x0 that we're

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.380
dealing with, right there.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.405
It's this point and this point.

00:16:07.405 --> 00:16:10.070
And we have a plus or minus
here, so this is going to be

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.920
the plus version, and this is
going to be the minus version.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.680
In fact, the plus version
should simplify into x0.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.670
Let's see if that's the case.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:22.360
Let's see if the plus version
actually simplifies to x0.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.830
So these are our two points.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.600
If I take the plus version,
that should be our first

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.770
quadrant intersection.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:35.980
So x is equal to minus 1/4
x0 plus x0 plus 1/4 x0.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.320
And, good enough, it does
actually cancel out.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.530
That cancels out.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.140
So x0 is one of the points
of intersection, which

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.260
makes complete sense.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.940
Because that's how we even
defined the problem.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.540
But, so this is the first
quadrant intersection.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.770
So that's the first
quadrant intersection.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.430
The second quadrant
intersection will be

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.690
where we take the minus
sign right there.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.890
So x, I'll just call it in the
second quadrant intersection,

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:06.240
it'd be equal to minus 1/4 x0
minus this stuff over here,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.020
minus the stuff there.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:19.310
So minus x0 minus
1 over 4 mine x0.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.850
Now what do we have?

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:21.270
So let's see.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.150
We have a minus 1 over 4
x0, minus 1 over 4 x0.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:33.020
So this is equal to minus x0,
minus x0, minus 1 over 2 x0.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.760
So if I take minus 1/4 minus
1/4, I get minus 1/2.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.780
And so my second quadrant
intersection, all this work

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.900
I did got me this result.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.990
My second quadrant
intersection, I hope I

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.090
don't run out of space.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.730
My second quadrant
intersection, of the normal

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:59.730
line and the parabola, is
minus x0 minus 1 over 2 x0.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.970
Now this by itself is a pretty
neat result we just got, but

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.880
we're unfortunately not
done with the problem.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.550
Because the problem wants us to
find that point, the maximum

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.620
point of intersection.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.420
They call this the
extreme normal line.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.930
The extreme normal line is
when our second quadrant

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.560
intersection essentially
achieves a maximum point.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.750
I know they call it the
smallest point, but it's the

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.870
smallest negative value, so
it's really a maximum point.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.440
So how do we figure out
that maximum point?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.940
Well, we have our second
quadrant intersection as

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.460
a function of our
first quadrant x.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.950
I could rewrite this as, my
second quadrant intersection as

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:45.210
a function of x0 is equal to
minus x minus 1 over 2 x0.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.270
So this is going to reach a
minimum or a maximum point when

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.790
its derivative is equal to 0.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.910
This is a very unconventional
notation, and that's

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.530
probably the hardest
thing about this problem.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:58.390
But let's take this derivative
with respect to x0.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.470
So my second quadrant
intersection, the derivative of

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:05.910
that with respect to x0, is
equal to, this is pretty

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:06.580
straightforward.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:12.860
It's equal to minus 1, and then
I have a minus 1/2 times, this

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.800
is the same thing as
x to the minus 1.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:20.630
So it's minus 1 times x0
to the minus 2, right?

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.320
I could have rewritten
this as minus 1/2 times

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.850
x0 to the minus 1.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.560
So you just put its
exponent out front and

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.090
decrement it by 1.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.870
And so this is the derivative
with respect to my first

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.770
quadrant intersection.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.760
So let me simplify this.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.820
So x, my second quadrant
intersection, the derivative of

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.670
it with respect to my first
quadrant intersection, is equal

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:52.110
to minus 1, the minus 1/2 and
the minus 1 become a positive

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:58.190
when you multiply them, and so
plus 1/2 over x0 squared.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.280
Now, this'll reach a maximum
or minimum when it equals 0.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.600
So let's set that equal to
0, and then solve this

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.410
problem right there.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.000
Well, we add one to both sides.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.180
We get 1 over 2 x0 squared is
equal to 1, or you could just

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.510
say that that means that 2 x0
squared must be equal to

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.750
1, if we just invert both
sides of this equation.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:32.740
Or we could say that x0 squared
is equal to 1/2, or if we take

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.780
the square roots of both sides
of that equation, we get x0 is

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.030
equal to 1 over the
square root of 2.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.470
So we're really, really,
really close now.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:46.000
We've just figured out the
x0 value that gives us

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.530
our extreme normal line.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.910
This value right here.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.080
Let me do it in a
nice deeper color.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.640
This value right here, that
gives us the extreme normal

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.410
line, that over there is
x0 is equal to 1 over

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:58.930
the square root of 2.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.390
Now, they want us to figure
out the equation of the

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.910
extreme normal line.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.710
Well, the equation of the
extreme normal line we already

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.670
figured out right here.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:07.910
It's this.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.900
The equation of the normal line
is that thing, right there.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.400
So if we want the equation of
the normal line at this extreme

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.120
point, right here, the one that
creates the extreme normal

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.140
line, I just substitute 1 over
the square root of 2 in for x0.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.400
So what do I get?

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.800
I get, and this is the home
stretch, and this is quite

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.440
a beast of a problem.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.670
y minus x0 squared.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.290
x0 squared is 1/2, right?

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.430
1 over the square root
of 2 squared is 1/2.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:42.510
Is equal to minus 1 over 2 x0.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.660
So let's be careful here.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:48.560
So minus 1/2 times 1 over x0.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.670
One over x0 is the square
root of 2, right?

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:57.530
All of that times x minus x0.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:02.080
So that's 1 over the square
root of 2. x0 is one

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.870
over square root of 2.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.850
So let's simplify
this a little bit.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.570
So the equation of our normal
line, assuming I haven't made

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:13.400
any careless mistakes, is
equal to, so y minus 1/2

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.060
is equal to, let's see.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:21.410
If we multiply this minus
square root of 2 over 2x, and

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.310
then if I multiply these
square root of 2 over

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.690
this, it becomes one.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:29.120
And then I have a minus
and a minus, so that

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.290
I have a plus 1/2.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:32.230
I think that's right.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:37.590
Yeah, plus 1/2, this
times this times that

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.170
is equal to plus 1/2.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.190
And then, we're at
the home stretch.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.650
So we just add 1/2 to both
sides of this equation, and we

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:51.150
get our extreme normal line
equation, which is y is

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.670
equal to minus square
root of 2 over 2x.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:23:00.100
If you add 1/2 to both sides of
this equation, you get plus 1.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.300
And there you go.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.830
That's the equation of that
line there, assuming I haven't

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.020
made any careless mistakes.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.320
But even if I have, I think you
get the idea of hopefully how

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.710
to do this problem, which
is quite a beastly one.
