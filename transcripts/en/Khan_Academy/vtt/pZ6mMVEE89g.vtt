00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
In the last video we were able
to show that any lambda that

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:09.910
satisfies this equation for some
non-zero vectors, V, then

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.510
the determinant of lambda times
the identity matrix

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.560
minus A, must be equal to 0.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:24.620
Or if we could rewrite this as
saying lambda is an eigenvalue

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.780
of A if and only if-- I'll
write it as if-- the

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.250
determinant of lambda times the
identity matrix minus A is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.860
equal to 0.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.230
Now, let's see if we can
actually use this in any kind

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.690
of concrete way to figure
out eigenvalues.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.880
So let's do a simple 2
by 2, let's do an R2.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:58.000
Let's say that A is equal to
the matrix 1, 2, and 4, 3.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.790
And I want to find the
eigenvalues of A.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:11.610
So if lambda is an eigenvalue
of A, then this right here

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.330
tells us that the determinant
of lambda times the identity

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.140
matrix, so it's going to be
the identity matrix in R2.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:29.230
So lambda times 1, 0, 0, 1,
minus A, 1, 2, 4, 3, is going

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.320
to be equal to 0.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.510
Well what does this equal to?

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.170
This right here is
the determinant.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.740
Lambda times this is just lambda
times all of these

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.790
terms. So it's lambda times 1
is lambda, lambda times 0 is

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.260
0, lambda times 0 is 0, lambda
times 1 is lambda.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.910
And from that we'll
subtract A.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.130
So you get 1, 2, 4, 3, and
this has got to equal 0.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.820
And then this matrix, or this
difference of matrices, this

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.580
is just to keep the
determinant.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.360
This is the determinant of.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.670
This first term's going
to be lambda minus 1.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.540
The second term is 0 minus
2, so it's just minus 2.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.570
The third term is 0 minus
4, so it's just minus 4.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.310
And then the fourth term
is lambda minus

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.310
3, just like that.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.620
So kind of a shortcut to
see what happened.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.560
The terms along the diagonal,
well everything became a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.550
negative, right?

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.700
We negated everything.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.350
And then the terms around
the diagonal, we've got

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.260
a lambda out front.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.930
That was essentially the
byproduct of this expression

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.900
right there.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.990
So what's the determinant
of this 2 by 2 matrix?

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.950
Well the determinant of this is
just this times that, minus

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.940
this times that.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:58.260
So it's lambda minus 1, times
lambda minus 3, minus these

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.170
two guys multiplied
by each other.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.480
So minus 2 times minus 4
is plus eight, minus 8.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.470
This is the determinant of this
matrix right here or this

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.920
matrix right here, which
simplified to that matrix.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.510
And this has got to
be equal to 0.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.180
And the whole reason why that's
got to be equal to 0 is

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.810
because we saw earlier,
this matrix has a

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.615
non-trivial null space.

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:27.860
And because it has a non-trivial
null space, it

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.790
can't be invertible and
its determinant has

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.530
to be equal to 0.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.160
So now we have an interesting
polynomial

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.880
equation right here.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.030
We can multiply it out.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.030
We get what?

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.960
Let's multiply it out.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:46.280
We get lambda squared, right,
minus 3 lambda, minus lambda,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.880
plus 3, minus 8,
is equal to 0.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:00.330
Or lambda squared, minus
4 lambda, minus

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.710
5, is equal to 0.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.600
And just in case you want to
know some terminology, this

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.520
expression right here is known
as the characteristic

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.770
polynomial.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.860
Just a little terminology,
polynomial.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.430
But if we want to find the
eigenvalues for A, we just

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.775
have to solve this right here.

00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:28.310
This is just a basic
quadratic problem.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.600
And this is actually
factorable.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.180
Let's see, two numbers and you
take the product is minus 5,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.250
when you add them
you get minus 4.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.760
It's minus 5 and plus 1, so you
get lambda minus 5, times

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.580
lambda plus 1, is equal
to 0, right?

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.190
Minus 5 times 1 is minus 5, and
then minus 5 lambda plus 1

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.260
lambda is equal to
minus 4 lambda.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.970
So the two solutions of our
characteristic equation being

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.740
set to 0, our characteristic
polynomial, are lambda is

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.090
equal to 5 or lambda is
equal to minus 1.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.240
So just like that, using the
information that we proved to

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.970
ourselves in the last video,
we're able to figure out that

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:15.610
the two eigenvalues of A are
lambda equals 5 and lambda

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.320
equals negative 1.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.500
Now that only just solves part
of the problem, right?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.570
We know we're looking
for eigenvalues and

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.800
eigenvectors, right?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.660
We know that this equation can
be satisfied with the lambdas

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.700
equaling 5 or minus 1.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.630
So we know the eigenvalues, but
we've yet to determine the

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.610
actual eigenvectors.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.660
So that's what we're going
to do in the next video.
