00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.170
We are asked, what is the value
of the 100th term in

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.000
this sequence?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.640
And the first term is 15, then
9, then 3, then negative 3.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.820
So let's write it like
this, in a table.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.890
So if we have the term, just
so we have things straight,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.070
and then we have the value.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.810
and then we have the
value of the term.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.260
I'll do a nice little
table here.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.770
So our first term
we saw is 15.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.730
Our second term is 9.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.330
Our third term is 3.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.940
I'm just really copying this
down, but I'm making sure we

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.720
associate it with
the right term.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.510
And then our fourth term
is negative 3.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.550
And they want us to figure out
what the 100th term of this

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.700
sequence is going to be.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.670
So let's see what's happening
here, if we can discern some

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.900
type of pattern.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.300
So when we went from the
first term to the

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.770
second term, what happened?

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.270
15 to 9.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.670
Looks like we went down by 6.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.920
It's always good to think
about just how much the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.910
numbers changed by.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.860
That's always the simplest
type of pattern.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.070
So we went down by 6,
we subtracted 6.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.470
Then to go from 9 to 3, well,
we subtracted 6 again.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.380
And then to go from 3 to
negative 3, well, we

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.900
subtracted 6 again.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.610
So it looks like, every
term, you subtract 6.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.900
So the second term is going to
be 6 less than the first term.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.330
The third term is going to be
12 from the first term, or

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.690
negative 6 subtracted twice.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.010
So in the third term, you
subtract negative 6 twice.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.270
In the fourth term,
you subtract

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.710
negative 6 three times.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.770
So whatever term you're looking
at, you subtract

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.610
negative 6 one less than
that many times.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.210
Let me write this down just so--
Notice when your first

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.070
term, you have 15, and
you don't subtract

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.220
negative 6 at all.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.430
Or you could say you subtract
negative 6 0 times.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.850
So you can say this is 15 minus
negative 6 times-- or

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.290
let me write it better
this way --minus 0

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.860
times negative 6.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.890
That's what that first
term is right there.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.530
What's the second term?

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.680
This is 15.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.140
We just subtracted negative
6 once, or you could say,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.980
minus 1 times 6.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.890
Or you could say plus
1 times negative 6.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.700
Either way, we're subtracting
the 6 once.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.330
Now what's happening here?

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.970
This is 15 minus 2 times
negative 6-- or, sorry

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.695
--minus 2 times 6.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.300
We're subtracting a 6 twice.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.960
What's the fourth term?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.740
This is 15 minus-- We're
subtracting the 6 three times

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.870
from the 15, so minus
3 times 6.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.370
So, if you see the pattern here,
when we have our fourth

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.940
term, we have the term
minus 1 right there.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.530
The fourth term, we have a 3.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.080
The third term, we have a 2.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.800
The second term, we have a 1.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.250
So if we had the nth term, if we
just had the nth term here,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.390
what's this going to be?

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.890
It's going to be 15 minus--
You see it's going to be n

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.320
minus 1 right here.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.630
Right?

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.960
When n is 4, n minus 1 is 3.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.000
When n is 3, n minus 1 is 2.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.080
When n is 2, n minus 1 is 1.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.960
When n is 1, n minus 1 is 0.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.420
So we're going to have this term
right here is n minus 1.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.330
So minus n minus 1 times 6.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.970
So if you want to figure out
the 100th term of this

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.780
sequence, I didn't even have
to write it in this general

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.450
term, you can just look
at this pattern.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.590
It's going to be-- and I'll do
it in pink --the 100th term in

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.640
our sequence-- I'll continue
our table down

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.600
--is going to be what?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:06.310
It's going to be 15 minus 100
minus 1, which is 99, times 6.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.620
right?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.900
I just follow the pattern.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.340
1, you had a 0 here.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.440
2, you had a 1 here.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.730
3, you had a 2 here.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.830
100, you're going to
have a 99 here.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.950
So let's just calculate
what this is.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.060
What's 99 times 6?

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.680
So 99 times 6-- Actually you
can do this in your head.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.160
You could say that's going to
be 6 less than 100 times 6,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.360
which is 600, and
6 less is 594.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.120
But if you didn't want to do
it that way, you just do it

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.310
the old-fashioned way.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.090
6 times 9 is 54.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.240
Carry the 5.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.490
9 times 6, or 6 times 9 is 54.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.600
54 plus 5 is 594.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.670
So this right here is 594.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.610
And then to figure out what 15--
So we want to figure out

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.080
what 15 minus 594 is.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.160
And this can sometimes be
confusing, but the way I

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.040
always process this in my head
is, I say that this is the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.970
exact same thing as the negative
of 594 minus 15.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.870
And if you don't believe
me, distribute out

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.920
this negative sign.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.580
Negative 1 times 594
is negative 594.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.970
Negative 1 times negative
15 is positive 15.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.880
So these two statements
are equivalent.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.160
This is much easier for my
brain to understand.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.270
So what's 594 minus 15?

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.120
We can do this in our heads.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:40.530
594 minus 14 would be 580,
and then 580 minus 1

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.820
more would be 579.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.270
So that right there is 579, and
then we have this negative

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.900
sign sitting out there.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.510
So the 100th term in our
sequence will be negative 579.
