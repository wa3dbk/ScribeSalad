00:00:00.702 --> 00:00:08.503
Let's say that f(x) is equal to the absolute value of x minus three over x minus three

00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:18.469
and what I'm curious about is the limit of f(x) as x approaches three

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:26.767
and just from an inspection you can see that the function is not defined when x is equal to three - you get zero over zero: it's not defined

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:32.978
So to answer this question let's try to re-write the same exact function definition slightly differently

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:37.768
So let's say f(x) is going to be equal to - and I'm going to think of two cases:

00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:40.035
I'm going to think of the case when x is greater than three

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:42.700
and when x is less than three

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.142
So when x is - I'll do this in two different colors actually

00:00:47.142 --> 00:00:51.367
When x - I'll do it in green - that's not green

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:53.767
When x is greater than three...

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:57.434
When x is greater than three, what does this function simplify to?

00:00:57.434 --> 00:00:59.835
Well, whatever I get up here, I'm just taking the..

00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:02.375
I'm going to get a positive value up here and then I'm...

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.421
Well, if I take the absolute value it's going to be the exact same thing, so let me...

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:13.412
For x is greater than three, this is going to be the exact same thing as x minus three over x minus three

00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:21.300
because if x is greater than three, the numerator's going to be positive, you take the absolute value of that, you're not going to change its value

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.500
so you get this right over here or, if we were to re-write it...

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.633
...if we were to re-write it, this is equal to, for x is greater than three, you're going to have f(x) is equal to one

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.696
for x is greater than three

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:38.012
Similarly, let's think about what happens when x is less than three

00:01:38.012 --> 00:01:44.224
When x is less than three, well, x minus three is going to be a negative number

00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:47.471
When you take the absolute value of that, you're essentially negating it

00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:53.939
so it's going to be the negative of x minus three over x minus three

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.644
or if you were to simplify these two things, for any value as long as x doesn't equal three

00:01:58.644 --> 00:02:03.235
this part right over her simplifies to one, so you are left with a negative one

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:06.738
negative one for x is less than three

00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:09.761
I encourage you, if you don't believe what I just said, try it out with some numbers

00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:10.834
Try out some numbers:

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:15.302
3.1, 3.001, 3.5, 4, 7

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.900
Any number greater than three, you're going to get one

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.963
You're going to get the same thing divided by the same thing

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:21.969
and try values for x less than three:

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.963
you're going to get negative one no matter what you try

00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:28.635
So let's visualise this function now

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:32.070
So, now you draw some axes...

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.849
That's my x- axis

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.769
and then this is my...

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.500
This is my f(x) axis - y is equal to f(x)

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.633
and what we care about is x is equal to three

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:47.635
so x is equal to one, two, three, four, five

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:48.872
and we could keep going...

00:02:48.872 --> 00:02:53.233
and let's say this is positive one, two, so that's y is equal to one

00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:56.233
this is y is equal to negative one and negative two

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:57.548
and we can keep going...

00:02:57.548 --> 00:02:59.969
So this way that we have re-written the function

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.040
is the exact same function as this

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.567
we've just written [it] in a different way

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.003
and so what we're saying is...

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:05.634
is we're...

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:07.161
Our function is undefined at three

00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:10.796
but if our x is greater than three, our function is equal to one

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:14.501
so if our x is greater than three, our function is equal to one

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.752
so it looks like...

00:03:15.752 --> 00:03:19.838
It looks like that, and it's undefined at three

00:03:19.838 --> 00:03:23.312
and if x is less than three our function is equal to negative one

00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:26.678
so it looks like - I'll be doing that same color

00:03:26.678 --> 00:03:28.212
It looks like this...

00:03:28.212 --> 00:03:30.169
It looks like...

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.567
Looks like this...

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:34.836
Once again, it's undefined at three

00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:36.498
So it looks like that

00:03:36.498 --> 00:03:38.303
So now let's try to answer our question:

00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:41.833
What is the limit as x approaches three?

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:44.230
Well, let's think about the limit as x approaches three

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.567
from the negative direction, from values less than three

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:49.924
So let's think about first the limit...

00:03:49.924 --> 00:03:52.831
...the limit, as x approaches three...

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:57.767
...as x approaches three, the limit of f(x)...

00:03:57.767 --> 00:04:00.512
...as x approaches three from the negative direction

00:04:00.512 --> 00:04:04.400
and all this notation here - I wrote this negative as a superscript right after the three - says

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.567
Let's think about the limit as we're approaching...

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:07.636
...let me make this clear...

00:04:07.636 --> 00:04:11.069
Let's think about the limit as we're approaching from the left

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.033
So in this case, if we get closer...

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:14.235
If we get...

00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:16.450
If we start with values lower than three

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.620
as we get closer and closer and closer...

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.034
So, say we start at zero, f(x) is equal to negative one

00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:23.634
We go to one, f(x) is equal to negative one

00:04:23.634 --> 00:04:25.767
We go to two, f(x) is equal to negative one

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:30.769
If you go to 2.999999, f(x) is equal to negative one

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:33.380
So it looks like it is approaching negative one if you approach..

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.367
...if you approach from the left-hand side

00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:39.285
Now let's think about the limit...

00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:41.625
...the limit of f(x)...

00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:48.690
...the limit of f(x) as x approaches three from the positive direction, from values greater than three

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.149
So here we see, when x is equal to five, f(x) is equal to one

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:55.968
When x is equal to four, f(x) is equal to one

00:04:55.968 --> 00:05:01.368
When x is equal to 3.0000001, f(x) is equal to one

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:03.305
So it seems to be approaching...

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:06.033
It seems to be approaching positive one

00:05:06.033 --> 00:05:08.101
So now we have something strange

00:05:08.101 --> 00:05:11.367
We seem to be approaching a different value when we approach from the left

00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:14.094
than when we approach from the right

00:05:14.094 --> 00:05:19.347
and if we are approaching two different values then the limit does not exist

00:05:19.347 --> 00:05:27.951
So this limit right over here does not exist

00:05:27.951 --> 00:05:30.209
or another way of saying it:

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:31.403
The limit...

00:05:31.403 --> 00:05:34.165
...the limit of...

00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:37.563
(Let me write this in a new color - I have a little idea here)

00:05:37.563 --> 00:05:47.968
...the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches some value c is equal to L if and only if...

00:05:47.968 --> 00:05:57.763
...if and only if the limit of f(x) as x approaches c from the negative direction is equal to the limit

00:05:57.763 --> 00:06:06.033
of f(x) as x approaches c from the positive direction which is equal to L

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.354
This did not happen here -

00:06:07.354 --> 00:06:10.093
the limit when we approached the left was negative one,

00:06:10.093 --> 00:06:12.351
the limit when we approached from the right was positive one,

00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.401
So we did not get the same limits when we approached from either side

00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:19.401
So the limit does not exist in this case
