00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.220
We're asked to subtract and
simplify the answer, and we

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.170
have 8/18 minus 5/18.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.500
So subtracting fractions
is very

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.920
similar to adding fractions.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.620
If we have the same denominator,
the denominator

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.460
in the difference is going
to be the same as the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.379
denominators in the two
numbers that we're

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.700
subtracting, so it's
going to be 18.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.900
And our numerator is going to be
the difference between the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.470
numerators.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.750
So in this case, it is 8 minus
5, and this will be equal to 3

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.900
over 18, which is the answer,
but it's not completely

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.250
simplified, because both 3 and
18 are divisible by 3.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.450
So let's divide them
both by 3.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.540
So you divide 3 by 3, you divide
18 by 3, and you get 3

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.390
divided by 3 is 1.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.000
18 divided by 3 is 6,
so you get 1/6.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.280
And just to see this visually,
let me draw 18 parts.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.030
Let me draw 18 parts here.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.395
So it might be a little bit
of a messy drawing.

00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:00.070
I'll try the best I can.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.810
So let me draw six in
this direction.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.900
So that is three right there.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.730
We have another three,
so that's six parts.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.990
And then let me split this
into three columns.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.690
So there we go.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.390
We have 18 parts.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.050
Now 8/18 is equal to one,
two, three, four,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.330
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.990
That's 8/18.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.370
And now we want to subtract five
of the eighteenths, so we

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.210
subtract one, two, three,
four, five.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.525
Now, what do we have
left over?

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:43.150
Well, we have three of the
eighteenths left over, so you

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.960
have that right there.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.340
You have three of the
eighteenths left over.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.340
Now, if you turn three of the
eighteenths into one piece,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.500
how many of those bigger
pieces do you have?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.450
This is one of those
big pieces.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.640
Now, where are the other ones?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.820
Well, this is another big
piece right here.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.720
This is another big piece
right here, another one,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.970
another one, and another one.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.110
If you had 18 pieces and you
merged three of the pieces

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.960
into one, then you actually end
up with only six pieces.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.590
You end up with six pieces.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.720
Hopefully, you see that each row
is one of the pieces now,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.300
and the blue is exactly one
of the six, so 3/18

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.550
is the same as 1/6.
