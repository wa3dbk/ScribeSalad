00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.530
In the last video, we saw what
a system of equations is.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.970
And in this video, I'm going
to show you one algebraic

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.390
technique for solving systems of
equations, where you don't

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.630
have to graph the two lines and
try to figure out exactly

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.560
where they intersect.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.610
This will give you an exact
algebraic answer.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.290
And in future videos,
we'll see more

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.290
methods of doing this.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.760
So let's say you had
two equations.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.910
One is x plus 2y is equal to 9,
and the other equation is

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.140
3x plus 5y is equal to 20.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.810
Now, if we did what we did in
the last video, we could graph

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.350
each of these.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.010
These are lines.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.630
You could put them in either
slope-intercept form or

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.560
point-slope form.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.290
They're in standard
form right now.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.530
And then you could graph each
of these lines, figure out

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.040
where they intersect, and that
would be a solution to that.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.710
But it's sometimes hard to
find, to just by looking,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.280
figure out exactly where
they intersect.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.890
So let's figure out a way to
algebraically do this.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.150
And what I'm going to do is
the substitution method.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.400
I'm going to use one of the
equations to solve for one of

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.440
the variables, and then I'm
going to substitute back in

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.880
for that variable over here.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.570
So let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.500
So let me solve for x using
this top equation.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.440
So the top equation says x
plus 2y is equal to 9.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.410
I want to solve for x, so let's
subtract 2y from both

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.520
sides of this equation.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.500
So I'm left with x is
equal to 9 minus 2y.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.780
This is what this first equation
is telling me.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960
I just rearranged
it a little bit.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.710
The first equation
is saying that.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.350
So in order to satisfy both of
these equations, x has to

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.890
satisfy this constraint
right here.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.080
So I can substitute this
back in for x.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.430
We're saying, this top equation
says, x has to be

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.320
equal to this.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.690
Well, if x has to be equal
to that, let's

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.820
substitute this in for x.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.990
So this second equation
will become 3 times x.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.300
And instead of an x, I'll write
this thing, 9 minus 2y.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.090
3 times 9 minus 2y, plus
5y is equal to 20.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.540
That's why it's called the
substitution method.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.250
I just substituted for x.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.730
And the reason why that's
useful is now I have one

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.830
equation with one unknown,
and I can solve for y.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.060
So let's do that

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.810
3 times 9 is 27.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.150
3 times negative 2 is negative
6y, plus 5y is equal to 20.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.180
Add the negative 6y plus the 5y,
add those two terms. You

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.750
have 27-- let's see, this will
be-- minus y is equal to 20.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.870
Let's subtract 27
from both sides.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.260
And you get-- let me
write it out here.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.110
So let's subtract 27
from both sides.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.250
The left-hand side, the 27's
cancel each other out.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.420
And you're left with negative y
is equal to 20 minus 27, is

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.770
negative 7.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.170
And then we can multiply both
sides of this equation by

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.450
negative 1, and we get
y is equal to 7.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.320
So we found the y value of the
point of intersection of these

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.320
two lines. y is equal to 7.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.550
Let me write over here, so I
don't have to keep scrolling

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.660
down and back up.
y is equal to 7.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.290
Well, if we know y, we can
now solve for x. x is

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.780
equal to 9 minus 2y.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.120
So let's do that.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.010
x is equal to 9 minus 2
times y, 2 times 7.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:49.210
Or x is equal to 9 minus 14, or
x is equal to negative 5.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.640
So we've just, using
substitution, we've been able

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.600
to find a pair of x
and y points that

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.020
satisfy these equations.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.990
The point x is equal to negative
5, y is equal to 7,

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.520
satisfy both of these.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.830
And you can try it out.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.270
Negative 5 plus 2 times 7,
that's negative 5 plus 14,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.990
that is indeed 9.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.910
You do this equation.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.170
3 times negative 5 is negative
15, plus 5 times y,

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.670
plus 5 times 7.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.310
So negative 15 plus
35 is indeed 20.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.350
So this satisfies
both equations.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.640
If you were to graph both of
these equations, they would

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.090
intersect at the point
negative 5 comma 7.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.000
Now let's use our newly
found skill to do

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.830
an actual word problem.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.530
Let's say that they tell
us that the sum of

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:55.130
two numbers is 70.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.710
And they differ-- or maybe we
could say their difference--

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.820
they differ by 11.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.070
What are the numbers?

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.980
So let's do this word problem.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.460
So let's define some
variables.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:29.210
Let's let x be the larger
number, and let y be the

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.420
smaller number.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.180
I'm just arbitrarily creating
these variables.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.640
One of them is larger
than the other.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.940
They differ by 11.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.020
Now, this first statement, the
sum of the two numbers is 70.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:51.340
That tells us that x plus
y must be equal to 70.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.350
That second statement, that
they differ by 11.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.450
That means the larger number
minus the smaller

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.290
number must be 11.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.320
That tells us that x minus
y must be equal to 11.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.960
So there we have it.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.510
We have two equations
and two unknowns.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.530
We have a system of
two equations.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.040
We can now solve it using
the substitution method.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.190
So let's solve for x on this
equation right here.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.160
So if you add y to both
sides of this

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.610
equation, what do you get?

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.700
On the left-hand side, you just
get an x, because these

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.890
cancel out.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.000
And then on the right-hand side,
you get x is equal to 11

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.630
plus y, or y plus 11.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.240
So we get x is equal
to 11 plus y

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.830
using the second equation.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.070
And then we can substitute it
back into this top equation.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.770
So instead of writing x plus
y is equal to 70, we can

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.850
substitute this in for x.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.210
We've already used the second
equation, the magenta one, now

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.360
we have to use the
top constraint.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.600
So if we substitute this in, we
get y plus 11-- remember,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.990
this is what x was, we're
substituting that in for x--

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.700
plus y is equal to 70.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.710
This is x.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.870
And that constraint was given to
us by this second equation,

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.650
or by this second statement.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.020
I just substituted this x with
y plus 11, and I was able to

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.480
do that because that's the
constraint the second

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.420
equation gave us.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.280
So now let's just solve for y.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.230
We get y plus 11, plus
y is equal to 70.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.470
That's 2y plus 11
is equal to 70.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:45.430
And then if we subtract 11 from
both sides, we get 2y is

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.570
equal to-- what is that?

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.220
59?

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.160
You subtract 10 from
70, you get 60, so

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.530
it's going to be 59.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:56.120
So y is equal to 59 over 2.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.240
Or another way to write it,
you could write that as 59

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:10.110
over 2 is the same thing as--
let's see-- 25-- 29.5.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:15.380
y is equal to 29.5.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.650
Now, what is x going
to be equal to?

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.090
Well, we already figured out
x is equal to y plus 11.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:26.120
So x is going to be equal to
29.5-- that's what y is, we

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.835
just figured that out-- plus 11,
which is equal to-- so you

00:08:30.835 --> 00:08:32.549
add 10, you get 39.5.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.809
You add another 1,
you get 40.5.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:37.990
And we're done.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.690
If you wanted to find the
intersection of these two

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:48.140
lines, it would intersect at
the point 40.5 comma 29.5.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.435
And you could have used this
equation to solve for x and

00:08:51.435 --> 00:08:52.200
then substituted in this one.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.756
You could have used this
equation to solve for y and

00:08:53.756 --> 00:08:55.250
then substituted in this one.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.245
You could use this equation
to solve for y and then

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.760
substitute into that equation.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.770
The important thing is, is
you use both constraints.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.850
Now let's just verify that
this actually works out.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.330
What's the sum of these
two numbers?

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.600
40.5 plus 29.5, that
indeed is 70.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.250
And the difference between
the two is indeed 11.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.550
They're exactly 11 apart.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.320
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
