00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.250
In the last video, we stumbled
upon a way to figure out the

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.940
inverse for an invertible
matrix.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.090
So, let's actually use
that method in

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.310
this video right here.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.390
I'm going to use the same matrix
that we started off

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.820
with in the last video.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.860
It seems like a fairly
good matrix.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.360
We know that it's reduced row
echelon form is the identity

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.890
matrix, so we know
it's invertable.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.800
So, let's find its inverse.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.040
The technique is pretty
straightforward.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.700
You literally just apply the
same transformations you would

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.220
apply to this guy to get you
to the identity matrix, and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.170
you would apply those same
transformations to the

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.370
identity matrix.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.440
That's because the collection
of those transformations, if

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.240
you represent them as matrixes,
are really just the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.820
inverse of this guy.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.480
Let's just do it.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.280
So I'll create an augmented
matrix here.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.420
Maybe I'll do it right here.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.800
Let me make it a little
bit neater.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.940
First, I'll write a.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.490
It's 1, minus 1, 1.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.310
And then minus 1, 2, 1.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.340
Minus 1, 3, 4.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.180
And then I'll augment it with
the identity matrix, with 1,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.040
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.600
Now, if I want to get a into
reduced row echelon form,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.480
maybe I'll replace
the second row.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.280
I'll keep the first row
the same for now.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.100
Let me just draw it like this.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.000
The entire first row:
1, minus 1, minus 1.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.680
It's going to be augmented
with 1, 0, 0.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.630
Keep the whole first
row the same.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.960
Let's replace the second
row with the second row

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.230
plus the first row.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.220
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.830
2 plus minus 1 is 1.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.950
3 plus minus 1 is 2.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.570
0 plus 1 is 0.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.660
1 plus-- oh, sorry.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.780
That was a tricky one.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.520
0 plus 1 is 1.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.050
1 plus 0 is 1.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.170
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.290
All I did is I added
these two rows up.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.450
Now, this third row.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.190
Let me replace-- I want
to get a zero here.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.220
Let me replace the third
row with the third row

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.730
minus the first row.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.080
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.930
1 minus minus 1 is 2.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.850
4 minus minus 1 is 5.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.260
0 minus 1 is minus 1.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.270
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.110
And then 1 minus 0 is 1.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.880
Just like that.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.300
Now, what do we want to do?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.750
Well, we've gotten this far.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.170
We want to zero out that
guy and that guy.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.760
Let's keep our second
row the same.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.600
Let me write it down here.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.410
It's 0, 1, 2, and then you
augmented it with 1, 1, 0.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.680
Just like that.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.900
And let's replace my first row
with the first row plus the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.590
second row.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.880
1 plus 0 is 1.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.890
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.980
That's why I did that,
to get a zero there.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.050
Minus 1 plus 2 is 1.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.970
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.150
0 plus 1 is 1.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.160
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.730
And now, I also want to zero
out this guy right here.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.770
Let's replace the third row
with the third row minus 2

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.000
times the second row.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.360
0 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.010
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.340
5 minus 2 times 2 is 5
minus 4, that's 1.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.820
Minus 1 minus 2 times 1--
that's minus 1 minus

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.570
2-- is minus 3.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.660
0 minus 2 times 1,
that's minus 2.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.030
And then, 1 minus 2 times
0 is just 1 again.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.250
All right, home stretch.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.070
Now, I just want to zero out
these guys right here.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.685
All right, so just let me keep
my third row the same.

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:10.736
Let me switch colors, keep
things colorful.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.589
It's 0, 0, 1.

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:21.490
We're going to augment it with
minus 3, minus 2, and 1.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.370
Now, let's replace our first row
with the first row minus

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.980
the third row.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.210
1 minus 0 is 1.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.600
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.730
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.220
2 minus minus 3, that's 5.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.310
1 minus minus 2 is 3.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.530
0 minus 1 is minus 1.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.100
Now, let's replace the second
row with the second row minus

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.610
2 times the third row.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.310
0 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.930
1 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.060
2 minus 2 times 1 is-- I'm
sorry, I just-- oh, whoops.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.200
Let me-- we have to be very
careful not to make any

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.090
careless mistakes.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.370
0 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.490
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.960
It's not 0.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.690
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.730
1 minus 2 times minus
3-- that is 1 plus 2

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.780
times 3-- that is 7.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.010
1 minus 2 times minus 2, that's
1 plus 4, which is 5.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.780
And then, 0 minus 2 times
1, so that's minus 2.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.710
And just like that, we've
gotten the A part of our

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.980
augmented matrix into reduced
row echelon form.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.020
This is the reduced row
echelon form of A.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.830
And when you apply those exact
same transformations-- because

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.020
if you think about it, that
series of matrix products that

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.420
got you from this to the
identity matrix-- that, by

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.230
definition, is the
identity matrix.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.210
So you apply those same
transformations to the

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.730
identity matrix, you're going
to get the inverse of A.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.030
This right here is A inverse.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.650
And we have solved for the
inverse, and it actually

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.010
wasn't too painful.
