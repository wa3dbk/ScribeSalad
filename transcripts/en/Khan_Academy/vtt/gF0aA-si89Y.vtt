00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.700
SAL KHAN: I'm here with
the Dr. Laura Bachrach

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.850
at Stanford Medical School.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.276
And what are we
going to talk about?

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:05.850
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
We're going to talk

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.830
about normal and abnormal
growth in children.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.276
SAL KHAN: Fascinating.

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:11.470
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So this
is an important concern.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.900
Parents really worry if their
child is growing normally.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.940
And physicians worry
about this too,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.570
because the change in height is
an important barometer of how

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.980
the child is doing overall,
in terms of health.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.725
So to begin to assess the
child's growth pattern,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.100
we have to think about what
are the determinants of where

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.900
the child should be
on the growth curve.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.650
The number one most important
determinant, of course,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.049
is genetics.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:36.590
Short parents are
more likely to have

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.270
short children and vice versa.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.572
SAL KHAN: And that's true
even when a child is young,

00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:44.280
because sometimes I've
seen the opposite.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.312
So people who are petite
have large children

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:47.020
and all the rest.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.940
But it is true that,
if someone is large,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.940
they're more likely to
have large children, even

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.815
infants and toddlers.

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:55.850
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: You've hit
upon a really important issue

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.710
that's shown here in this slide.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.580
The size of a baby at
birth isn't necessarily

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.990
going to reflect the genetics.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.370
There are babies that are
born small, because mother

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.780
didn't have prenatal care.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.670
Mother was a smoker,
other factors

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.340
that compromise the
growth of the child.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.760
And those babies
can be born small

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.680
for their gestational age.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.790
During the first two
to three years of life,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.000
they have a chance to
catch up on the curve

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.270
and reach what's called
their genetic potential.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.987
SAL KHAN: So let's
just make sure.

00:01:24.987 --> 00:01:25.820
I want to make sure.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.940
I've seen these
curves before, when

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.440
I went to visit a
pediatrician, even

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.190
I remember this when I used to
visit the pediatrician, which

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.690
I did maybe a little too long.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.650
So this axis right
over here is age.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.900
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: In months.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.420
SAL KHAN: In months-- so
this is right here birth.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.800
This is birth.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.812
So if a baby is born
at-- I don't know.

00:01:44.812 --> 00:01:46.270
This is the weight
right over here.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.080
So if a baby is born at five
pounds-- is this in pounds?

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.970
This is kilograms.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.957
OK, so five pounds
is right over.

00:01:54.957 --> 00:01:55.540
Is that right?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.770
Yeah, five pounds would
be right over here.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.615
So this would be a baby
born at five pounds.

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:01.080
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.130
And I'm talking more here,
during this growth lecture,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.009
about the height or
length of the baby,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.330
throughout babyhood
and childhood.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.500
But let's say, the baby
were born light in weight

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.850
and short in length.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.320
SAL KHAN: So maybe
18 inches right here

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.330
would be a short length.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.130
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Right, and let's say,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.110
that baby was small
because his mother

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.035
had issues during the pregnancy.

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:28.910
SAL KHAN: Is it always
the case that the baby

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.390
will be small because of issues?

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.470
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: No.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.160
The bottom line is
that genetics plays

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.062
less of a part in the
size of the baby at birth

00:02:38.062 --> 00:02:39.520
than it will later
on in childhood.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.490
SAL KHAN: All right,
it makes sense.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.590
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So to
come back to your point,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.560
you'll meet parents
whose baby seem

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.770
to be larger or
smaller than they are.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.102
But by age three the
child should be--

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:51.310
SAL KHAN: Hold on one second.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.930
Let me just close this.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.430
OK.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.804
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
By age three,

00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:58.590
the child should be in
his or her genetic groove,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.200
if you will.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.070
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.528
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
So there can be

00:03:01.528 --> 00:03:04.180
movement on the growth curve
in the first two to three years

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.710
of life.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.160
There can be catch-up growth,
where the child, who was small,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.120
let's say, moves
from below the curve

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.144
up to the 50th percentile,
by age 24 months.

00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:14.560
SAL KHAN: So this
would be a child

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.768
who does something like this.

00:03:15.768 --> 00:03:18.700
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Exactly, exactly.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.730
And you can have the converse,
where you have a very big baby.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.110
Let's say, mother had
uncontrolled diabetes,

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.590
and the baby was
born very large.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.820
That baby can have catch-down
growth, to the 50th percentile.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.690
By the age of three, certainly
movement across percentiles

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.650
is considered to be abnormal
and warrants an investigation.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.460
SAL KHAN: So you really can
predict someone's even adult

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.065
height, based on
where they at three?

00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:48.800
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: A general
rule of thumb is, that by age 2

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.450
and 1/2 to 3, the child is
in their genetic groove.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.770
SAL KHAN: Really?

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.470
Oh, wow.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.460
I didn't realize that
quickly you can kind of--

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.370
so if a child, at
age three or four,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.170
is in the 25th
percentile in height,

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.362
it's unlikely that they're
going to be in the NBA?

00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:04.220
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: In
general, that's true.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.420
There are a few exceptions.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.750
There are late
bloomers, what we call

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.990
a constitutional
delay of growth.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.580
But a general rule
would be, what

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.710
percentile you are by
the age of two or three

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.501
is pretty much where
you're going to track,

00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:18.040
if all things are
going normally.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.970
SAL KHAN: Wow, I never
realized that it was that soon.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.470
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And genetics
is an important determinant

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.520
as I said.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.880
We can actually do a
calculation of where

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.020
we think a child should end
up, the so-called mid-parental

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.000
height, which we are
going to talk about later.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.930
So genetics is the
critical factor.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.950
But whether or not you
reach your genetic potential

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.750
means that the cards have to
be lined up appropriately.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.860
So the cards that are
important for achieving

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.570
your genetic potentials, first
of all, number one-- normal

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.430
amounts of hormones that
are important for growing.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.115
And those are thyroid and growth
hormone, to a large extent.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.910
A second factor, of course,
is adequate nutrition.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.860
And we think
worldwide of children

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.820
who are undernourished,
who don't look anywhere

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.540
near their age, in
terms of height,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.960
because they're
so undernourished.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.115
It really cramps their style.

00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:14.300
SAL KHAN: And you see
the reverse of that.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.354
I mean, I don't know
what I am officially.

00:05:16.354 --> 00:05:17.020
I was born here.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.610
My parents weren't.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.175
So I'm what, first generation
or second generation.

00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:20.860
But you see that in
that, is that you

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.790
see a lot of people
in my generation

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.670
are much taller
than their parents,

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.140
because their
parents were probably

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.350
malnourished in some way.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.010
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Certainly, there

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.370
can be a secular trend,
where the children get taller

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.150
than the parents,
if the children have

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.830
a different environment.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.370
The other thing we notice
about nutrition in our country

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.640
is the over-nutrition
of our children.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.080
And what happens with obesity is
that children may grow faster,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.160
in terms of both weight
and height for their age.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.220
They don't end up
taller in the long run.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.714
But they move ahead more quickly
through the maturation process.

00:05:54.714 --> 00:05:55.380
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.963
I didn't know.

00:05:55.963 --> 00:05:56.950
OK, it can accelerate.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.687
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly.

00:05:59.687 --> 00:06:01.020
SAL KHAN: I never realized that.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.812
That's fascinating.

00:06:01.812 --> 00:06:03.353
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
And then we think

00:06:03.353 --> 00:06:04.540
about psychosocial factors.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.500
There literally is
a situation where

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.690
infants can be deprived of
parental love and support,

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.350
and you see something
dwarfing there.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.290
In a teenager, we see problems
with eating disorders,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.287
that's a cross between nutrition
and a psychological problem.

00:06:19.287 --> 00:06:21.120
So psychosocial factors
play a role as well.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.550
SAL KHAN: So they've
shown, or it's

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.380
been seen that it's
noticeable changes

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.770
in physical development,
based on, I guess,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.042
attention and love.

00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:30.750
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Yes, there's actually

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.840
a syndrome called
psychosocial dwarfism, where

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.700
you can actually see
a slow down in growing

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.280
without adequate
interpersonal support.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.035
SAL KHAN: Wow,
that's fascinating.

00:06:40.035 --> 00:06:43.710
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So
the issue is, when do you

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.470
need to worry about a
child's growth pattern?

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.260
In order to interpret
that, you have

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.580
to understand about the
variability in growth.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.730
In the first two to
three years of life,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.240
children grow much more quickly
than they will later on.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.710
By the age of three,
until they hit puberty,

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.006
children should grow
two inches a year.

00:07:05.006 --> 00:07:07.434
SAL KHAN: Two inches a year,
this is from the ages of--

00:07:07.434 --> 00:07:09.100
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
After they're out of

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.614
toddlerhood until
they hit puberty.

00:07:10.614 --> 00:07:12.405
SAL KHAN: So this is
like three to puberty.

00:07:12.405 --> 00:07:14.840
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Exactly, exactly.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.910
But when kids will hit puberty
is going to be variable.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.940
And so that's an issue.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.360
If children are growing
at a normal rate,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.130
it's not necessary to
memorize the inches per year.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.040
Children will track
along the growth curve.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.010
And if we can turn to the
next slide or next graph,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.950
this is a graph for what
we use for older children,

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.700
after the age of 2
up until they're 18.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.680
This is the curve that we use.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.040
Now, beyond the age
of two, I said to you,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.020
it's not normal for children to
necessarily cross percentiles.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.900
So if, for example,
you have a child

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.570
who is tracking along the
fifth percentile every year,

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.927
growing their two inches a year.

00:07:58.927 --> 00:08:00.510
SAL KHAN: This is
the fifth down here?

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.510
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right,
the lower line there.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.780
They're moving along,
steadily, steadily, steadily.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:10.770
That child has a more reassuring
growth curve than one,

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.080
for example, who
as a five-year-old

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.786
had been at the
top of the curve.

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.160
SAL KHAN: Right,
a five-year-old.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.665
So five-year-old is right there.

00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:19.415
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
And then the next year

00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:21.505
is on the 75th
moving down a line.

00:08:21.505 --> 00:08:22.470
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.053
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
And the year after

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:25.620
is on the 50th percentile.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.560
Now, at that point
in time, the child

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.450
has theoretically
a normal height

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.310
because it's within the curve.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.005
But there's something very
abnormal about that rate

00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:34.504
of growing.

00:08:34.504 --> 00:08:38.031
And that's the child that's
more worrisome than the shorter

00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:38.530
child.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.961
SAL KHAN: Fascinating.

00:08:39.961 --> 00:08:41.419
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
So bottom line,

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.070
when a child would
come in to present

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.670
to me because of a
concern about growing,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.287
I'd first of all try to
decide if they're are short

00:08:48.287 --> 00:08:49.620
and if they're growing normally.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.260
And those are two
different questions.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.350
The first question
is, are they short?

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.930
And are they short
can be defined

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.630
by looking at these curves.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.140
These are curves
representing the spectrum

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.040
of normal height for a
healthy American youth.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.612
And they go from the 5th
to the 95th percentile.

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:10.950
So you can compare a child
to the population as a whole.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.170
But I also like
to calculate what

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.510
we call the mid-parental height.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.560
OK, this is where
we take into account

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.500
the heights of the
parents, because that's

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.120
the most important determinant.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.580
So how we calculate
that is as follows.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.820
We take the height of mom
and dad and average them.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.370
SAL KHAN: OK, let's do that.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.152
So I'm 5' 9", if I'm
wearing decent shoes.

00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:35.110
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.510
SAL KHAN: So set
that to 69 inches.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.730
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.710
And how tall is the
mother of your children?

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.800
SAL KHAN: She's 5' 6".

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.370
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: She's 5' 6".

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.100
SAL KHAN: Which is why I don't
let her wear too large heels.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.060
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.790
And are we trying to calculate
your son or your daughter?

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.010
SAL KHAN: Let's do my son,
since he's a little older.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.472
So let's see, it's
plus 66 inches.

00:09:53.472 --> 00:09:54.430
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.370
So we'll take the
midpoint of that.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.540
SAL KHAN: OK, so that's
really an inch and 1/2.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.127
So it's what, 67 and 1/2
inches between me and my wife.

00:10:01.127 --> 00:10:02.210
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.920
And we're going to
add 2 and 1/2 inches.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.720
SAL KHAN: OK.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.435
So that gets us what,
to exactly 70 inches.

00:10:08.435 --> 00:10:09.940
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.381
And that's the height
prediction for your son.

00:10:12.381 --> 00:10:13.380
SAL KHAN: Oh, very good.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.310
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Plus or minus--

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.630
SAL KHAN: Oh, plus or minus.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.350
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: 4 inches.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.300
SAL KHAN: Plus or
minus 4 inches,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.420
oh, that's a big difference.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.170
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
It's a big difference.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.780
But that's the nature
of human variability.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.500
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.458
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:26.535
Now, if this were
your daughter, we

00:10:26.535 --> 00:10:30.560
would take the 67 and 1/2 inches
and subtract 2 and 1/2 inches.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.795
Let's do that.

00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:34.394
SAL KHAN: OK, so that
gets us 65, so 5' 5"

00:10:34.394 --> 00:10:36.560
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly,
plus or minus 4 inches.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.224
SAL KHAN: Plus or
minus 4 inches.

00:10:38.224 --> 00:10:40.140
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So
that's something we do.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.670
We then calculate-- in
fact, let's plot that,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.570
right on the curve.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.865
This is the boys' curve, so
let's plot the 70 inches.

00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:53.840
SAL KHAN: 70 inches is
right over here, OK.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.690
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And
then the range of 74.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.707
SAL KHAN: 74 to 66.

00:10:59.707 --> 00:11:02.040
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right,
exactly-- pretty broad range.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.580
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.538
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:07.900
But if we had a child who was
growing well below the curve

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.560
and we thought the
midpoint should

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.960
be about the 50th
percentile, that child

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.450
would be short for the family.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:17.600
So we always like to take the
family heights into account.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.200
So number one question,
is the child's short?

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.440
It will depend on what
the height prediction is.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.130
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.169
So if my son was tracking
down here at the 5%.

00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:27.043
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: That
would be concerning.

00:11:27.043 --> 00:11:28.970
SAL KHAN: Even if he's growing
the two inches every year

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.540
and he's tracking that, it
still would be concerning.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.050
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Well, it
would raise some questions

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.100
in our minds.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.900
But that's the more
important factor is not just

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.860
where they on the
curve at the moment.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.640
But are they growing
at the normal rate?

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.280
And the child who is not
growing at the normal rate

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.960
raises more red
flags than the child

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.220
who's trotting up the curve.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.136
SAL KHAN: Fascinating.

00:11:48.136 --> 00:11:50.305
That's interesting, wow.

00:11:50.305 --> 00:11:52.480
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
So that's the issue.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.700
And that's what we
approach every day.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.440
We want to look into
the various causes,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.280
potentially, for
growth slowdown.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.130
We want to address treatment
to the specific etiology.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.675
SAL KHAN: And etiology means--

00:12:05.675 --> 00:12:07.330
DR. LAURA BACHRACH:
Well, for example,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.800
if the child has a deficiency
of thyroid hormone,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.870
we want to give
thyroid hormone back.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.280
SAL KHAN: So etiology
is like the cause.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.529
DR. LAURA BACHRACH: The cause.

00:12:13.529 --> 00:12:16.230
If the child isn't growing
because he has a nutritional

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.670
problem, like Celiac
Disease, we want

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.170
to put him on a special
diet to address that issue.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.240
Some parents think,
well, what we

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.050
want to do-- my child is
healthy and normal and growing

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.780
normally, but I want to give
him some growth hormone.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.550
That becomes a topic in itself.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.910
SAL KHAN: Right, very good.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.951
Well, thank you for this.

00:12:33.951 --> 00:12:35.680
This was super informative.
