00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:02.396
Rewrite the radical expression

00:00:02.396 --> 00:00:05.921
using rational exponents and simplify.

00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:09.915
So here we have the fourth root of 5 a to the fourth

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:11.587
b to the twelfth power.

00:00:11.587 --> 00:00:16.091
The key thing to realize here is the fourth root of something

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:19.853
is same thing as something to the one fourth power.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.475
Or in particular, or in general, the nth root something

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:27.562
is the same thing as that something to the 1 over n power.

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:29.745
So we can just apply that over here:

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:30.665
the fourth root of all of this

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:35.133
is equal to 5 a to the 4th, b to the 12th power,

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.166
all of that to the one fourth power.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.215
And then we also know if we take the product of things,

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:43.491
and then raise them to some exponent,

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:46.928
that's the same thing as raising each of the terms in the product

00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:47.998
to the exponent first,

00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:50.550
or each of the things that we're taking the product of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.825
to that exponent, and then multiplying.

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:55.057
So let's do that.

00:00:55.057 --> 00:00:57.302
So 5, so this is the same thing as

00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:59.039
5 to the 1/4 power

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.430
times a to the fourth to the 1/4 power

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.222
times b to the 12th to the 1/4 power.

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:10.147
Now 5 to the 1/4,

00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:11.329
I don't know what that is,

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.605
so I'll just keep that as the cube root,

00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:15.805
well, we could leave it as 5 to the 1/4,

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:17.876
and that's not not simplified.

00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:23.027
or we can just rewrite it again as the fourth root of 5.

00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:25.446
a to the fourth to the 1/4 power:

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:28.740
if your raise something to a power and then another power,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.151
and raise that to another power,

00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:35.267
that's equivalent of raising a to the four times 1/4 power.

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:36.329
So let me just write that down.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.200
This is, so times a to four times 1/4 power.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.234
And then finally, this right over here,

00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:46.928
using the same exact exponent property,

00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:50.504
this is b to the 12th times 1/4 power.

00:01:50.504 --> 00:01:53.151
So all of this simplifies to,

00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:55.241
and I'll change the order here,

00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:59.112
so you have the fourth root of 5,

00:01:59.112 --> 00:02:02.903
and then you have a to the fourth times 1/4 power

00:02:02.903 --> 00:02:05.368
so that's just, this simplifies to a to the first power

00:02:05.368 --> 00:02:07.059
which is really just the same thing as a.

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:08.902
So that's just a.

00:02:08.902 --> 00:02:13.882
And then we have b to the 12 times 1/4 power.

00:02:13.882 --> 00:02:16.454
Well, 12 times 1/4 is just three.

00:02:16.454 --> 00:02:19.036
So that's b to the third power.

00:02:19.036 --> 99:59:59.999
So it's a, b to the third power times the fourth root of 5.
