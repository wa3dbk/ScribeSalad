00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.680
Welcome back.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.210
I'm now going to do a bit of a
review of everything we've

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.080
learned so far about maybe even
trigonometry and

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.350
trig identities.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.450
And then we'll see if we can
come up with-- maybe use what

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.050
we already know to come up with
a couple more trig identities.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.940
So we know that from
SOH-CAH-TOA we know that sine

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:26.070
of theta is equal to the
opposite over the hypotenuse.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.270
Let me draw a triangle here.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.560
If I were to draw a
triangle here-- whoops.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.380
Oh, there you go.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.780
OK, so this is theta.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.180
This is the opposite.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.410
This is the adjacent.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.400
This is hypotenuse.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.460
Then sine of theta is equal
to opposite over hypotenuse.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.040
Cosine of theta-- this is basic
review, hopefully at this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.170
point-- is the adjacent
over the hypotenuse.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.470
The tangent of theta is equal
to the opposite over the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.770
adjacent, which is also equal
to the sine of theta over

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.590
the cosine of theta.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.380
And we showed this in a
couple of videos ago.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.160
And then, these are kind of
almost definitional, but the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:17.840
cosecant of theta is equal
to the hypotenuse over the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.260
opposite, which is the same
thing as 1 over sine of theta.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.900
You can just memorize this.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.120
I mean, I kind of find is
silly that there is such

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.100
a thing as cosecant.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.330
I guess it's just for
convenience because you know

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.410
everyone knows it's just
1 over sine of theta.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.830
And same thing for secant.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.140
Secant of theta-- it's
really for convenience.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.990
Instead of having to say, in
the case of secant-- oh, that's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.910
1 you know-- if you end up with
the equation 1 over cosine of

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.200
theta you can just say,
oh, that's just the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.550
secant of theta.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.573
I think it actually has some
obvious properties and if you

00:01:48.573 --> 00:01:50.450
were to draw unit circle
and all of that too.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.760
But anyway, so that's equal
to the hypotenuse over the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.400
adjacent, which is equal to
1 over cosine of theta.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.160
And then, of course, cotangent
of theta is equal to the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.430
adjacent over the opposite,
which is equal to

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.260
1 over tan theta.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.010
And of course, that's
also equal to cosine of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.430
theta over sine theta.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.310
It's just the opposite of
the tangent of theta.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.470
Or that's the same
thing as what?

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.230
That's the same thing as
the secant-- no, no, no.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.632
It's the same thing as the
cosecant-- no, no no.

00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:38.600
Let me make sure I
get this right.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.700
It's the same thing as the-- I
just want to get the inverses.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.050
Well, let's prove
what it is actually.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.110
I always confuse myself.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:59.060
So this is the same thing as 1
over the secant of theta over

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.730
1 over the cosecant of theta.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.370
Secant of theta,
cosecant theta.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.700
And then that equals the
cosecant of theta over

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.190
the secant of theta.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.110
I wouldn't waste your
time memorizing.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.930
So we know that a cotangent
of theta is equal to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.240
1 over tangent theta.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.300
Is equal to the cosine
over the sine.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.040
And it also equals the
cosecant over the secant.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.690
And I wouldn't worry about
really memorizing this.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.840
You could derive
it if you had to.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.460
As you could tell, I
really didn't have

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.850
this memorized either.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:38.380
And we also learned in previous
videos that the sine squared

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.440
theta plus the cosine squared
of theta is equal to 1.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.530
And that just comes from
the pythagorean theorem.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.170
And if you play around with
this a little bit you'd also

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.950
get that the tangent squared
theta plus 1 is equal to

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.380
the secant squared theta.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.110
You actually go from here to
here if you just divide both

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.010
sides of this equation
by cosine squared.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.860
So we know that.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.020
And then if you've watched the
last two proof videos I made,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:20.180
we also know that the sine of--
let's say a plus b-- is equal

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:31.670
to the sine of a times
the cosine of b.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.890
Plus-- let me erase some
of this because I don't

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.590
think that that is an
important trig identity.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.730
You can derive it on your own.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.570
I just wanted to show you that
you could figure it out.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.780
I'm using too much space.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.320
OK, now I have space.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.330
Let me find that blue color
I was using and make

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.650
sure my pen is small.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.015
OK.

00:04:52.015 --> 00:04:56.040
So it's the sine of a times
the cosine of b plus the sine

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.430
of b times the cosine of a.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.690
And you might want to
just memorize it.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.370
This actually becomes really
useful when you actually start

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.090
doing calculus because you have
to solve derivatives and

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.720
integrals that you might
have to know the identity.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.870
And it's not that
hard to memorize.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.080
It's the sine of one of them
times the cosine of one of them

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.370
plus the other way around.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.130
That's all this is.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.200
And then we also learned that
the cosine of a plus b-- it's

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.960
the cosine of both of them
minus the sine of both them.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:36.890
So that is equal to the cosine
of a times the cosine of b.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.400
And I proved this in another
video, hopefully did it

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.180
to your satisfaction.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:48.160
Minus the sine of a
times the sine of b.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.110
These are pretty useful because
from these can we can come up

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.040
with a bunch of other
trig identities.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.280
For example, what
is the sine of 2a?

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.360
Well, that's just the same
thing as the sine of a plus a.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.010
And if we use this trig
identity up here, that is equal

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:27.850
to sine of a cosine of a plus
the sine of a, cosine of a.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.560
I just used this sine of a plus
b identity up here and well,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.982
want a and b are both a.

00:06:32.982 --> 00:06:34.110
Now what does this equal?

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.990
Well, this is two terms
that are just both sine

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.810
of a, cosine of a.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:43.300
So that just equals 2
sine of a, cosine of a.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.030
So we now have derived another
trigonometric identity that

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.650
might be in the inside cover of
your trig, or actually,

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.270
your calculus book.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.940
All of these actually,
I could draw a square

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.540
around all of them.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.110
Let's do another one.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.070
Once you have a bit of a
library of trig identities you

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.680
can really just keep playing
around and seeing what else you

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.930
can-- and I encourage
you to do so.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.890
And you'd be amazed how
many other trig identities

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.610
you could come up with.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.490
For example, let's
do cosine of 2a.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:25.410
Cosine of 2a is equal
to cosine of a plus a.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.530
And cosine of a plus
a, what did we say?

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:33.220
It's the cosine of both of the
terms times each other minus

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.160
the sine of both of the terms.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.750
So that equals cosine of
a, cosine of a, right?

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:46.020
Cosine of a times cosine of a
minus sine of a, sine of a.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.080
This identity was the cosine
of a plus b identity.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.260
Minus sine of a.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.030
So what is this?

00:07:51.030 --> 00:08:03.280
This is equal to cosine squared
a minus sine squared a.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.720
That's interesting.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.310
We could play around.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.830
This is interesting because
this is the form a

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.880
squared minus b squared.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.770
So that's also the same thing
as a plus b times a minus b.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:22.120
So that's the same thing as
cosine of a plus sine of a

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.950
times cosine of a
minus sine of a.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:27.360
I don't know.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.250
This isn't really a trig
identity, but I'm just showing

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.310
you could play with things.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.650
Cosine of 2a is equal to cosine
of a plus sine of a times

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.290
cosine of a minus sine of a.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.400
So the sum of the cosine
and sine of a then

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.000
times the difference.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.760
That's just interesting.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.870
I'm just showing you that
what's fun about trigonometry

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.740
is you can kind of keep
playing around with it.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.010
And actually, that's probably--
that is how all of the trig

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.680
identities were discovered.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.830
So let's say that we have-- we
want to figure out what cosine

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.940
of let's say, negative a is.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.945
Well, let me draw
a right triangle.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:06.645
Whoops.

00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:08.265
That's almost a right triangle.

00:09:08.265 --> 00:09:10.850
Now let's say this angle is a.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.450
So negative a, unit circle
would look something

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.240
like this, right?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.250
Negative a.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:22.750
So cosine of a, if we say that
this side is the adjacent

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.260
side, this is the hypotenuse.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.280
This would still be the
hypotenuse, right?

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.710
And this is the opposite.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.350
This is the negative opposite.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.500
So cosine of minus a
is equal to what?

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.260
This is minus a, so it's the
adjacent over the hypotenuse.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.860
So it equals the adjacent
over the hypotenuse,

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.470
which we just say is h.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.070
But that's the same thing
as cosine of a, right?

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.130
Because cosine of a is also the
adjacent over the hypotenuse.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:54.960
Oh, I'm almost out of time.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.050
Let me switch to a new video.
