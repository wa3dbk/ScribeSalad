00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's try to fill in our Laplace
transform table a

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:03.960
little bit more.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.000
And a good place to start is
just to write our definition

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.820
of the Laplace transform.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.240
The Laplace transform of some
function f of t is equal to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.340
the integral from 0 to infinity,
of e to the minus

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.540
st, times our function,
f of t dt.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.860
That's our definition.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.330
The very first one we solved
for-- we could even do it on

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.630
the side right here-- was the
Laplace transform of 1.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.550
You know, we could almost view
that as t to the 0, and that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.220
was equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.490
f of t was just 1, so it's e to
the minus st, dt, which is

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.080
equal to the antiderivative of
e to the minus st, which is

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.910
minus 1 over s, e to the minus
st. And then you have to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.870
evaluate that from
0 to infinity.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.380
When you take the limit as this
term approaches infinity,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.740
this e to the minus, this
becomes e to the minus

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.529
infinity, if we assume
s is greater than 0.

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:08.160
So if we assume s is greater
than 0, this whole

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.400
term goes to 0.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.720
So you end up with a 0 minus
this thing evaluated at 0.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.330
So when you evaluate t is equal
to 0, this term right

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.790
here becomes 1, e to the 0
becomes 1, so it's minus minus

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.585
1/s, which is the same
thing as plus 1/s.

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:29.670
the?

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.960
Laplace transform of 1,
of just the constant

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.940
function 1, is 1/s.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.660
We already solved that.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.700
Now, let's increment
it a little bit.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.270
Let's see if we can figure out
the Laplace transform of t.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.720
So we can view this
as t to the 0.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.750
Now this is t to the 1.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.130
This is going to be equal to
the integral from 0 to

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.870
infinity, of e to the
minus st times t dt.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.560
Now.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.210
I can tell you right now
that I don't have the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.870
antiderivative of
this memorized.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.030
I don't know what it is.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.680
But there's a sense that the
integration by parts could be

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.269
useful, because integration by
parts kind of decomposes into

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.680
a simpler problem.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.230
And I always forget integration
by parts, so I'll

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.240
rederive it here in
this purple color.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.960
So if we have u times v, if we
take the derivative with

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.620
respect to t of that, that's
equal to the derivative of the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.180
first times the second function
plus the first

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.190
function times the derivative
of the second function.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.950
It's just the product rule.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.070
Now, if we take the integral
of both sides of this

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.950
equation, we get uv is equal
to the antiderivative of u

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.250
prime v plus the antiderivative
of uv prime.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.680
Now, since we want to apply
this to an integral, maybe

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.080
let's make this what we want
to solve for, so we can get

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.120
the integral of uv prime is
equal to-- we can just

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.310
subtract this from that side
of the equation, so it's

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.290
equal-- I'm just swapping the
sides, so I'm just solving for

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.330
this, and to solve for this, I
just subtract this from that,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.390
so it's equal to uv minus the
integral of u prime v.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.290
So there you go.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.040
Even though I have trouble
memorizing this formula, it's

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.660
not too hard to rederive as
long as you remember the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.350
product rule right there.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.880
So if we're going to do
integration by parts, it's

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.740
good to define our v prime to
be something that's easy to

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.460
take the antiderivative of,
because we're going to have to

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.480
figure out v later on, and
it's good to take u to be

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.690
something that's easy take
the derivative of.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.000
So let's make t is equal to our
u and let's make e to the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.010
minus st as being our v prime.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.810
If that's the case,
then what is v?

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.440
Well, v's just the
antiderivative of that.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.970
In fact, we've done it before.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.830
It's minus 1/s, e to the
minus st. That's v.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.800
And then if we want to figure
out u prime, because we're

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.980
going to have to figure out that
later anyway, u prime's

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.000
just the derivative of t.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.980
That's just equal to 1.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.020
So let's apply this.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:21.480
Let's see, so the Laplace
transform of t is equal to uv.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.890
u is t, v is this right here.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:35.880
It's times minus 1/s, e to the
minus st. e to the minus st,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.820
that's the uv term
right there.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.110
And this is a definite
integral, right?

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.980
So we're going to evaluate
this term right

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.210
here from 0 to infinity.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:56.190
And then it's minus the integral
from 0 to infinity of

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.530
u prime, which is
just 1 times v.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.060
v, we just figured out here, is
minus-- let me write it in

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.720
v's color-- times minus 1/s--
this is my v right here--

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.610
minus 1/s, e to the
minus st, dt.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.860
All of that is dt.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.540
So let's see if we can
simplify this.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:31.640
So this is equal to minus t/s,
e to the minus st, evaluated

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.740
from 0 to infinity.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.030
And let's see, we could take--
well, this is just 1.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.080
1 times anything is 1.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.430
We can just not write that.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.170
And then bring the
minus 1/s out.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.180
So if we bring the minus 1/s
out, this becomes plus 1/s

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.330
times the integral from
0 to infinity of e to

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.360
the minus st, dt.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.640
And this should look
familiar to you.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.950
This is exactly what we
solved for right here.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.150
It was the Laplace
transform of 1.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.850
So let's keep that in mind.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.010
So this right here is the
Laplace transform of 1.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.500
And I want to write it that way,
because we're going to

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.700
see a pattern of this
in the next video.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.580
I'm going to write that as
a Laplace transform of 1.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.180
But what is this equal to?

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.300
So we're going to evaluate this
as it adds to infinity

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.790
and then subtract from
that evaluated at 0.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.520
You can kind of view it as a
substitution, so this is equal

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.240
to-- well, let me write
it this way.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:36.550
It's the limit as A approaches
infinity, of minus A/s, e to

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.580
the minus sA.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.100
So that's this evaluated
at infinity.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.900
And then from that, we're
going to subtract this

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.960
evaluated at 0.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.360
So minus all of this, but we
already have a minus sign

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.420
here, so we could
write a plus.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.930
Plus 0/s times e to the
minus s times 0.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.670
And then, of course, we have
this term right here.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.030
So let me write that term.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.330
I'll do it in yellow or
let me do it in blue.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.040
Plus 1/s-- that's this right
there-- times the Laplace

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.650
transform of 1.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.890
And what do we get?

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.590
So what's the limit of this
as A approaches infinity?

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.270
You might say, wow, you know, as
A approaches infinity right

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.320
here, this becomes a
really big number.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.510
There's a minus sign in there,
so it would be a really big

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.550
negative number.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.575
But this is an exponent.

00:07:29.575 --> 00:07:31.340
A is an exponent right here.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.520
So e to the minus infinity is
going to go to zero much

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.160
faster than this is going
to go to infinity.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.570
This term right here is a much
stronger function, I guess is

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.230
the way you could see it.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.830
And you could try it out on your
calculator, if you don't

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.660
believe me.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.470
This term is going to overpower
this term and so

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.490
this whole thing is going
to go to zero.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.910
Likewise, e to the minus-- e
to the 0, this is 1, but

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.170
you're multiplying it times a
zero, so this is also going to

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.800
go to zero, which is convenient
because all of this

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.620
stuff just disappears.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.530
And we're left with the Laplace
transform of t is

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:14.240
equal to 1/s times the Laplace
transform of 1.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.160
And we know what the Laplace
transform of 1 is.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.135
The Laplace transform of 1-- we
just did it at beginning of

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.840
the video-- was equal to 1/s,
if we assume that s is

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.450
greater than zero.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.300
In fact, we have to assume that
s was greater than zero

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.680
here in order to assume that
this goes to zero.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.370
Only if s is greater than zero,
when you get a minus

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.559
infinity here does this
approach zero.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.360
So fair enough.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:43.710
So the Laplace transform of t
is equal to 1/s times 1/s,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.760
which is equal to 1/s squared,
where s is greater than zero.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.330
So we have one more entry
in our table, and

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.890
then we can use this.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.460
What we're going to do in the
next video is build up to the

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:02.940
Laplace transform of t to
any arbitrary exponent.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.230
And we'll do this in
the next video.
