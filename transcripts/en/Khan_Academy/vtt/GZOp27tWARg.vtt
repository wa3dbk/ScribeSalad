00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.590
We are in Section 8 on the
seventh test. We're almost

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.960
done with this book,
so let's start.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.210
Problem number one.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:19.520
If 6,700 is equal to 100 times
6k plus 7, then k equals what?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.060
So let's divide both sides
of this by 100.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.060
So you get 100 and you get these
two zeroes, so you get

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.310
67 is equal to 6k plus 7.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.520
I just divided both
sides by 100.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.980
Subtract 7 from both sides.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.490
You get 60 is equal to 6k.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.310
Divide both sides by 6, you
get 10 is equal to k.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.740
That's choice C.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.040
Problem 2.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.850
If 3 more than n is a negative
number-- so n plus 3 is a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.270
negative number-- that's
what that says, right?

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.210
And 5 more than n is a positive
number, so n plus 5

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.320
is greater than 0, which of
the following could be the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.770
value of n?

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.810
So n plus 3 is negative, n plus
5 is greater, so n plus 3

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.710
has to be less than
negative 3, right?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.500
This means that n is less
than negative 3.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.180
How did I get that?

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.970
I subtracted 3 from both sides
of this equation, right?

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.520
If I subtract 5 from both sides
of this equation, I

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.570
would get that n is greater
than negative 5.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.460
So you have to be greater than
negative 5 and less than

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.780
negative 3.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.240
What's the only number that I
can think of that's that?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.140
Well, there's a lot of numbers,
but a simple one is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.230
minus 4, right?

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.140
Minus 4 is less than
negative 3, right?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.540
If I draw a number line, this is
minus 3, minus 4, minus 5.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.280
So minus 4 is less than negative
3 and it's greater

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.100
than minus 5.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.120
So that's the answer.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.310
Choice B.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.100
And you can try it
out with minus 4.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.110
Minus 4 plus 3 is minus 1.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.520
So that works.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.830
Minus 4 plus 5 is plus 1.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.270
So that works.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.520
Problem three.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.090
OK in the figure above-- OK let
me see if I can draw this.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.640
I'll draw it big because
it looks complicated.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:26.800
A line like that, a line like
that, and one like that.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:41.180
They tell us this is x, this is
y, and then they tell us in

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.020
the figure above, if x is equal
to 70, so this is equal

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.710
to 70, and y is equal to 40,
so this is equal to 40, and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.030
the dotted lines bisect the
angles with measure x and y

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.180
degrees, what is
the value of z?

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.370
OK, so the dotted lines, instead
of drawing dotted

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.950
lines, I'm going to draw green
lines, so this green line will

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.450
bisect this angle, so it
goes right in between.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.600
So if it bisects the angle, what
is the measure of this

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.350
angle right here?

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.630
Well, it's going to be half of
this angle that it bisected.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.240
So this whole thing
is 70, so this is

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.860
going to be 35 degrees.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.990
Similarly, this other green line
is going to bisect this

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.960
y-- oh, I thought I was
using the line tool.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.490
This other green line is going
to bisect y right here, right?

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.380
So it bisects it.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.100
So if it bisects it, what's
this angle going to be?

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.280
Well, it's going to be half of
angle y, and they tell us

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.240
angle y is 40.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.810
I wrote that.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:39.800
I just wrote over it.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.910
So this has to be 20
degrees, right?

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.600
Because it's half
of the full y.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.770
And they say, what is
the values of z?

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.840
Well, z is just this
whole thing.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.890
So it's this angle plus this
angle, so it's 55 degrees.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.140
And that's choice E.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.090
Problem four.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.960
A piece of fruit is to
be chosen at random

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.700
from a basket a fruit.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.560
The probability that the piece
of fruit chosen will be an

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.610
apple is 2/5.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:19.589
So the probability of an
apple is equal to 2/5.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.620
Which of the following could not
be the number of pieces of

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.760
fruit in the basket?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.350
Could not be.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:35.280
So the secret here is you take
2/5 and whatever 2/5 is times

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.610
the number of fruit, right?

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.410
2/5 times the number of
fruit has to equal

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.660
the number of apples.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.430
And implicitly, there's not
going to be a fractional

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.980
number of apples
in the basket.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.840
You can't pick up a
piece of an apple.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.450
So this is going to have to be
an integer, the number of

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.140
apples, right?

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.020
So if 2/5 times some number is
going to be an integer, then

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.020
this number has to be
divisible by 5.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.140
It makes sense, you know?

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.810
If there are 10 fruit,
then this is going

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.640
to be equal to 4.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.040
If there are 20 fruit, then
this is going to be what?

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.740
What's 2/5 of 20?

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.350
It's going to be 8.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.605
But if there were 6 fruit, or
if we thought the number of

00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:28.860
fruit was 6, 2/5 times
6 is 12/5.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.650
That means that there are
2 and 2/5 apples.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.650
That's not right.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.740
So what we have to find is the
number of fruit, and it has to

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.822
be some number divisible by 5.

00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:40.140
And if you look at the choices,
they give you 20,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.200
that's divisible by 5.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.720
35 is divisible by 5.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.840
Choice C, 52.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.020
That's not divisible by 5.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.100
And then the other two choices,
70 and 80 are

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.010
divisible by 5.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.650
So only C is not
divisible by 5.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.920
So that's our choice.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.180
That could not be the number
of fruit in the basket.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.260
And you could figure it out.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.770
If there were 52 fruit, and 2/5
were apples, you'd get a

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.020
fractional number of apples.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.740
And that's not cool.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.990
Next problem.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.590
Problem five.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.960
A square and an equilateral
triangle have equal

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.130
perimeters.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.740
If the square has sides of
length 3, what is the length

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.190
of one side of the triangle?

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:29.340
So a square and a triangle
have equal perimeters.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.240
And the square has--
what does it say?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.050
It has sides of length 3.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.740
So 3, 3, 3, 3.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.300
So what's this perimeter?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.020
It's 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.010
That's 12.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.500
Perimeter is 12.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.420
Well, this triangle is also
going to have a perimeter of

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.050
12, but it's going to have it
amongst 3 equal sides, right?

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.140
Because there's only 3
sides of a triangle.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.315
So it's going to have 12 divided
by 3, so it's going to

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:58.640
have to be 4, 4, and 4,
so one side of the

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.750
triangle has length 4.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.100
That's choice C.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.134
Problem six.

00:07:07.134 --> 00:07:10.930
We'll do it here.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:18.540
If x is equal to negative 1 and
k is greater than 0, which

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.110
of the following has
the greatest value?

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:29.080
OK, so choice A is 2
times k times x.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.550
So k is positive, x is minus
1, so this is going to

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.230
be less than 0.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.890
So this is going to be a
negative number, right?

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.860
And so we know that's probably
not going to be the answer.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.740
So if we look at all of the
choices, the only positive

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.650
answers, the only positive
choices, are going to be the

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.280
ones where I raise x to an
even exponent, right?

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.840
Because if I raised x to an odd
exponent, like let's see,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.195
choice C, choice C
is 6k x cubed.

00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:02.600
And that's equal to 6k times
minus 1 cubed, right?

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.980
Because x is minus 1.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.530
So that's going to
be minus 6k.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.220
And we know k is a
positive number.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.440
I mean, really, you could just
ignore the k's, really.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.580
k is just a positive number.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.700
It's just kind of a
scaling factor.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.050
And they all have k in them.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.660
So you just have to worry about
the coefficient in the x

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.850
terms. So one thing we can--
if x has an odd exponent on

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.440
it, it's going to be a negative
number, so that's not

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.990
going to be the greatest
value.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.560
So there are only two that
have x with a-- so

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.260
you have 4k x squared.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.690
That's choice B.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:40.900
And then you have choice D,
which is 8k x to the fourth.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.230
Well, in both of these cases,
x squared is equal to 1.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.950
Negative 1 squared is 1.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.170
Negative 1 to the fourth is
also equal to 1, right?

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.020
And if k is positive,
what's bigger?

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.710
8k or 4k?

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.930
Well, 8k is going
to be bigger.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.420
As I said, they all have k in
them so you could kind of

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.310
ignore k because it's
a positive number.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.000
So the answer is choice D.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.860
I'll see you in the
next video.
