00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.950
Evaluate 1x when x is equal to
negative 1, x is equal to 0,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.950
and x is equal to 1.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.590
So let's do the scenario
x is equal to negative 1.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.030
Then 1x becomes 1 times x,
which is now negative 1.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.759
So it's 1 times negative 1.

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.800
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.270
1 times anything is going
to be that anything.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.509
So 1 times negative 1 is going
to be equal to negative 1.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.300
Another way you could
have thought about it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.274
is you could've just looked
at the absolute value

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:36.940
of both numbers.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.800
You'd say 1 times 1 is 1.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.010
They have different signs.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.218
So it's going to be negative.

00:00:41.218 --> 00:00:43.890
It would have gotten you
the same answer either way.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.350
Now we have the scenario
where x is equal to 0.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.610
So 1 times x is going to be
the same thing as 1 times 0.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.020
We've substituted a 0 for x.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.520
Once again, 1 times anything is
going to become that anything.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.270
So this is going to become 0.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.140
Another way to think about
it is 0 times anything

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.010
is going to become 0.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.134
So either one of those
ways of thinking about it

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.550
would have gotten
you this answer.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.220
1 times-- actually,
we could even

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.752
write 1 times x is equal to x.

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:17.460
So really, when you
evaluate any of these

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.450
at x is equal to negative 1, or
x is equal to 0, or x equals 1,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.450
it's really just going
to equal that number

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.730
because 1 times anything
is equal to that anything

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.560
right over there.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.610
Just to make it clear, 0
times anything is equal to--

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.770
and this x here is a variable
not a multiplication sign-- 0

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.720
times anything is equal to 0.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.790
Just for good measure--
we kind of already

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.530
went over the answer-- but
let's try x is equal to 1.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.330
So this will give us 1 times
1, which you've probably

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.770
learned a while ago.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830
But 1 times anything is
equal to that number.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.390
So it's equal to 1.
