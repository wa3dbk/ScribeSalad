00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.280
We're on problem 48.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.800
It says if x squared is added
to x, the sum is 42.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.220
So let's just write that out.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.390
If x squared is added to x,
the sum is equal to 42.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.079
Which of the following could
be the value of x?

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.660
So essentially they just want
us to solve this equation.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.930
So the easiest way to do it is
to write it as a quadratic

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.500
equaling 0 and then
factoring it.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.130
So we could write this as x
squared plus x minus 42 is

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.560
equal to 0.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.020
And let's think.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.040
What two numbers when I add
them equal 1, and when I

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.710
multiply them equal minus 42?

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.110
And the fact that when I
multiply them equals minus 42

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.530
tells me that one of them has to
be positive and one of them

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.290
has to be negative.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.280
That's the only way that when
you multiply two numbers

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.700
you're going to have
a negative number.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.500
So one of them has to be
positive, one of them has to

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.370
be negative.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.640
And so when we're adding a
positive and a negative,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.430
you're really finding the
difference between the two.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.080
So the difference between the
two numbers has to be 1 and

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.000
their product has to be 42.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.610
And I noticed when I see
42 I immediately

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.770
think, oh, 6 and 7.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.930
6 times 7 is 42.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.850
And since when you add them
you get a positive 1, 7's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.780
probably the positive one and
minus 6 or 6 is probably the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.730
negative one.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.210
So let's try it out.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.190
x plus 7 times x minus
6 equal to 0.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.460
And right, 7 times minus
6 is minus 42.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.460
It's really 7x plus minus 6x
is equal to positive x.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.740
Or you could think 7 plus
minus 6 is equal to the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.466
coefficient on the
x, which is 1.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.890
But anyway, that works.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.050
And you could multiply this
out and try it out.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.860
And everything I'm saying,
it's not some voodoo.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.200
The reason why I say that they
have to add up to the 1 is

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620
because when you multiply
this out, that's what

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.870
builds up this term.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.370
This 7 times x plus the minus
6 times the other x.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.880
That's what builds this term
when you multiply it out.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.010
This term comes from
the x times the x.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.620
The minus 42 comes from the
7 times the minus 6.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.640
Anyway, now we're
at this point.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.210
We say OK, well how do we get--
we have two things when

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.840
you multiply them equal to 0.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.120
Well that means that one of them
or both of them have to

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.110
be equal to 0.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.520
So that means that x plus 7 is
equal to 0, which would mean

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.890
subtract 7 from both sides.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.290
Which means x is equal
to minus 7.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.580
Or x minus 6 is equal to 0.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.090
Add 6 to both sides. x is
equal to 6. x would

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.110
be 6 or minus 7.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.830
And they have one of
the choices there,

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.710
which was choice A.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.340
Next problem.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.820
49.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.740
What quantity should be added to
both sides of this equation

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.320
to complete the square?

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.930
So when you complete the square
you want the thing to

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.740
just look like a-- you want
whatever's on the left-hand

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.190
side to look like a
perfect square.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.350
And what do I mean by
perfect square?

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.580
So if I had x plus a squared,
that's equal to x plus a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.030
times x plus a.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.370
And that's equal to x
times x, x squared.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.890
x times that a, so
that's plus ax.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.680
And now this a times this x.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.250
So that's another ax.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.730
Plus this a times that a.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.410
So plus a squared.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.100
And that's equal to x squared.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.720
Plus-- we have two of these
now-- plus 2ax plus a squared.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.520
So essentially we want this, we
want the left-hand side to

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.930
have this form.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.330
So we say, this is
a perfect square.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.742
We can say that's the same thing
as x plus a squared.

00:03:26.742 --> 00:03:29.820
So let's think about
how we can do it.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:37.040
If we have x squared minus 8x
is equal to 5 and I put a

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.640
space here for a reason because
we want to add or

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.490
subtract something here so it
looks like a perfect square.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.530
So think about it.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.600
When we have this format, in
order for this thing to be a

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.820
perfect square, whatever this
coefficient is right here,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.430
this term right here has to
be half of this, squared.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.310
a squared is half
of 2a squared.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.990
So if we took half of minus
8, that's minus 4.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.890
In this case, if we said
2a is equal to 8, a

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.720
would be minus 4.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.910
And so minus 4 squared
is what?

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.830
It's plus 16.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.990
And this is an equation.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.005
So one you do to one side of an
equation you have to do to

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:18.955
the other side of
the equation.

00:04:18.955 --> 00:04:21.570
So you have to say that
that is also equal to.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.820
So you have to add
16 to both sides.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.600
Otherwise you're changing
the equation.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.610
Now this, hopefully you
recognize this as already a

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.300
perfect square.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.270
I mean you could look at this
pattern up here or you could

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.090
say, OK, if I add minus 4 to
itself twice I get minus 8.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.680
If I multiply it by
itself I get 16.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.790
So this is x minus 4 squared.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.490
That's equal to 25.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.370
And actually, just if you're
curious-- and we did this in

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.170
the Khan Academy, we did a
couple of videos on this--

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.400
this is how you prove the
quadratic equation.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.050
You essentially complete the
square with arbitrary numbers

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.320
a, b, and c, and you get
the quadratic equation.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.540
You know, we show it in 10
minutes, so it's not this

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.270
impossibly hard thing
to understand.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.860
They just want to know, what
do you add to both sides of

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.220
this equation?

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.500
What quantity should be added to
both sides of this equation

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.370
to complete the square?

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.100
So the answer to this
one was 16.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.670
But they just as equally could
have said, solve it by

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.860
completing the square.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.730
And you'd say oh, x minus 4
squared is equal to 25.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.160
So x minus 4 is equal
to plus or minus 5.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.310
And then you could say,
x is equal to plus or

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.690
minus 5 plus 4.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.930
And then you could say,
OK, which is 4 plus

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.190
positive 5 is 9.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.780
4 plus minus 5 is--
or, minus 1.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.160
Anyway, they didn't ask us
that, so we don't have to

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.350
spend too much time
thinking about it.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.310
Let's see, we're
on problem 50.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.070
Let me see, problem 50.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:01.970
I'll copy and paste 50 and 51.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.190
All right, what are the
solutions for the quadratic

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:12.190
equation x squared plus
6x is equal to 16?

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.350
And the temptation here is
really to kind of try to solve

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.870
it the way you do a
linear equation.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.110
I don't know, factor out an
x and-- I don't know, do

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.580
whatever else.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.010
But the important thing to
recognize is this is a

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.220
quadratic equation.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.910
And the easiest way to solve it
is to put all the terms on

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.660
one side and then get a
0 on the other side.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.640
And then either factor
it or use the

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.090
actual quadratic equation.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.300
Or complete the square, whatever
you need to do.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.970
So let's subtract 16
from both sides.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.230
And you get x squared plus 6x
minus 16 is equal to 0.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.270
I just subtracted 16 from
both sides to get here.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.600
And before just jumping into the
quadratic equation, let's

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.270
see if we can factor
it by inspection.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:54.165
So what two numbers, when I
add them, equal 6-- and we

00:06:54.165 --> 00:06:58.602
want positive 6-- and when I
multiply them equal minus 16?

00:06:58.602 --> 00:07:01.360
And once again, since it's a
minus 16, if you multiply two

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.310
numbers you get a
negative number.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.530
They have to be different
signs.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.560
One has to be positive and
one has to be negative.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.780
And their difference will be 6
because one's positive and

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.435
one's negative.

00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:12.990
So let me think about it.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.470
So if I had minus-- well,
8 and 2 is equal to 16.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.390
And they're 6 apart.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.800
So if I did plus 8 and
minus 2-- right.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.370
Plus 8 and minus 2
is positive 6.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.360
So it's x plus 8 times
x minus 2.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.620
And that really just takes
a lot of practice.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.870
You say, OK, what two numbers?

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.880
16.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.340
OK.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.010
8 and 2.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.290
Well they're going to have
to be different signs.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.480
But I have a positive one here,
so whichever number's

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.430
larger is probably going
to be the positive one.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.120
So positive 8 and minus 2.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.790
Yeah, when you add them up,
they equal minus 6.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.660
Yeah, it works.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.120
So you set that equal to 0.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.910
And you say OK, this has to be
equal to 0, or that has to be

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.320
equal to 0.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.220
So x is either equal
to minus 8.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.830
If you say x plus 8 is equal to
0 then subtract 8 from both

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.590
sides, you get x is
equal to minus 8.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.075
I shouldn't have skipped
that step, but

00:08:01.075 --> 00:08:02.030
I'll do the step here.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.530
Or you could say x minus
2 is equal to 0.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.220
Add 2 to both sides, you
get x is equal to 2.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.070
What x makes this
term equal to 0?

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.330
And you could look at
it from inspection.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:19.190
So x could either be minus 8
or 2, and that is choice C.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.290
Problem 51.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.970
Leanne correctly solved the
equation x squared plus 4x

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.020
equals 6 by completing
the square.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.530
Which equation is part
of her solution?

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.385
OK, so the same thing.

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:34.010
x squared plus 4x.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.260
And when you complete the square
you're going to add

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.809
something here.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:36.954
So I'm going to leave
a little blank.

00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:38.850
Is equal to 6.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.880
So what could I add here that
makes this expression look

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.950
like a perfect square?

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.320
Well, got to the pattern
that we did a

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.850
couple of problems ago.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.840
Whatever's here should be the
square of half of this.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.510
So 4-- well, half
of that is 2.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.570
2 squared is 4.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.400
So I should add 4
to that side.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.630
If I add 4 to that side,
I have to add 4 to

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.490
this side as well.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.080
And now this 2 plus
2 is equal to 4.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.800
2 times 2 is equal to 4.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.340
So this is x plus 2 squared.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.660
And I really want you to
get the intuition.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.750
Don't memorize the steps for
completing the square.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.380
I want you to really
understand why.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.120
This is the square
of half of that.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.230
And we showed it in
the beginning.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.650
Square a lot of binomials and
see for yourself that that's

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.270
always going to be the case.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.200
Anyway, so this is
x plus 2 squared.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.360
That's going to be equal to--
6 plus 4 is equal to 10.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.170
And that is choice B.

00:09:30.842 --> 00:09:34.760
I think we have time
for one more.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:40.980
One more problem, problem 52.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.330
Copied it and now I
have pasted it.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.410
Carter is solving this equation
by factoring.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.610
Which expression could be one
of his correct factors?

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:58.470
Once again, I like to personally
separate out the

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.030
number that goes into
all of them.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.320
And all of these are
divisible by 5.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.260
And that just simplifies
it in my head.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.760
So if I divide all of these by
5-- actually, I could just

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.600
divide both sides of
this equation by 5.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.410
0 divided by 5 is 0.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.910
And then that left side divided
by 5 becomes 2x

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:27.960
squared minus 5x plus
3 is equal to 0.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.400
So if this is 2x squared here,
so it's going to be two

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.880
numbers when you multiply them
equal 3 and when you-- so

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.210
let's think about this
a little bit.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.830
Actually, let me write it down
here because I think I'll need

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:38.930
more space.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:44.240
2x squared minus 5x plus
3 is equal to 0.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.040
And I just divided both
sides of the equation

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.755
by 5 to get to this.

00:10:47.755 --> 00:10:50.430
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.870
So we have a 2x squared here
and they already kind of

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.860
hinted to us that we're going
to have an integer solution,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.230
so we can factor this.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:00.460
So the intuition is that this is
going to be 2x times-- you

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.250
know, plus something.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.460
Plus a.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.650
Times-- well what times?

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:06.810
Times probably x, right?

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.340
2x times x is 2x squared.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.050
Now that wouldn't be completely
obvious if they

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.970
didn't already tell us that
we could factor this.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:13.550
You might have to use a

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.840
quadratic equation or something.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.660
Actually, the quadratic equation
wouldn't be something

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.800
crazy to use here because
you can just

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.890
kind of plug and chug.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.210
But let's see if we can
get the intuition.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:25.470
So it's going to be 2x plus
something times x plus

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.830
something else.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.310
If we were to multiply this out,
you get 2x times x is 2x

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.380
squared as it should.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.250
2x times b is plus 2bx.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.180
a times x is plus ax.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.320
a times b is plus ab.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.570
And so let's see what we get.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:55.400
So plus 2b plus ax plus ab.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.420
2x squared.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.180
OK, now can do pattern
matching.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.440
This was our original thing.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.890
So 2 times b plus a has to be
equal to-- this term is the

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.150
same thing as this
term right here.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.080
And that term has to be
the same thing as

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.440
that term right there.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.230
So first of all, I have
a positive 3 here.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.290
So I'm multiplying two numbers
to get a positive 3.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.940
So they either have to be both
positive or both negative.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.460
And then the other interesting
thing is we have-- when I take

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.070
2 times one of them plus
the other one, I

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.920
get a negative number.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.520
So the only way when you're
dealing with negative numbers,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.750
and when you just multiply it
times a positive and add them

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.050
to each other you get another
negative number, is if they're

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.340
both negative.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.860
This told us they both
have to be negative

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.050
because this is positive.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.460
And then since when you add
them without any negative

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.510
signs you get a negative number,
it tells you that that

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.920
has to be negative as well.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.190
So let's see.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:54.390
Let's just try 3-- negative
3 and negative 1.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.300
If negative 3 and negative 1.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:56.800
So you're right.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.330
Yeah.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:05.450
If b is equal to minus 1 and a
is equal to minus 3, then 2

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.050
times minus 1 is minus 2.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.080
Minus 3.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.460
Right, so b is equal to minus
1 and a is equal to minus 3.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.740
This is a bit of an
art form here.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.950
I mean there isn't like a plug
and chug, very mechanical way

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:17.680
of doing this.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.610
The quadratic equation is one,
but this is the best way that,

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.220
at least, I know how to
do these without.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.980
So, we know what a and b is.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.460
So it's 2x-- a is minus 3.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:34.910
2x minus 3 times x plus
b. b is minus 1.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.290
So that's the factorization.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.590
So 2x minus 3 times x
minus 1, which one?

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.180
They have this one right here.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.090
2x minus 3.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.070
And I'm all out of time.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.790
See you in the next video.
