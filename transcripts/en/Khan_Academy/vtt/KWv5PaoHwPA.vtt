00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.590
Everything we've named so
far has been an alkane.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.630
We've seen all single bonds.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.610
Let's see if we can expand our
repertoire a little bit and do

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.990
some alkenes.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.830
So let's look at this first
carbon chain right here.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.110
And actually, here I drew out
all of the hydrogens just to

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.110
remind you that everything we
were doing before with just

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.810
the lines, it really
was representing

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.210
something like this.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.800
When you start having the
double bonds, and we'll

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.020
explain it in more detail later
on, it actually starts

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.400
to matter a little bit more to
draw the constituents, because

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.550
there's actually different ways
that you can arrange it.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.750
Because these double bonds, you
can imagine, they're more

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.610
rigid, you can't rotate
around them as much.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.050
But don't think about that
too much right now.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.830
Let's just try to name
these things.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.540
So like we always do, let's try
to find the longest chain

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.070
of carbons.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.230
And there's only one chain
of carbons here.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.520
There's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons in

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.170
that chain.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.460
So we're going to be
dealing with hept,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.930
that is seven carbons.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.700
But it's not going
to be a heptane.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.340
Heptane would mean that we
have all single bonds.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.250
Here we have a double bond, so
this is going to be an alkene.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.200
So this tells us right here
that we're dealing with an

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.290
alkene, not an alkane.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.300
If you have a double bond,
it's an alkene.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.910
Triple bond, alkyne.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.000
We'll talk about that
in future videos.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.230
This is hept, and we'll put an
ene here, but we haven't

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.040
specified where the double
bond is and we haven't

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.790
numbered our carbons.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.730
When you see an alkene like
this, you start numbering

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.300
closest to the double bond, just
like as if it was a alkyl

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.340
group, as if it was a side
chain of carbons.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.860
So this side is closest to the
double bond, so let's start

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.390
numbering there.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.180
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.710
The double bond is between two
and three, and to specify its

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.830
location, you start at the
lowest of these numbers.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.620
So this double bond is at two.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.870
This is actually hept-2-ene.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.330
So this tells us that we have a
seven carbon chain that has

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.060
a double bond starting-- the
ene tells us a double bond.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.080
Let me write that down.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.940
So this double bond right
there, that's what

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.190
the ene tells us.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.910
Double bond between two carbons,
it's an alkene.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.120
The double bond starts-- if you
start at this point-- the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.000
double bond starts at number two
carbon, and then it will

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.620
go to the number three carbon.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.960
Now you might be asking, well,
what if I had more than one

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.830
double bond here?

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.630
So let me draw a quick
example of that.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.760
Let's say I have something like,
one, two, three, four,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.060
five, six, seven.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.010
So this is the same
molecule again.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.120
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.810
The way we drew it up
here, it would look

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.130
something like this.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.170
What if I had another double
bond sitting right here?

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.170
How would we specify this?

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.220
Well, once again we have
seven carbons.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.860
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.580
So we're still going to
have a hept here.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.850
It's still going to
be an alkene, so

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.310
we put our ene here.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.740
But we start numbering it, once
again, closest to the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.970
closest double bond.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.070
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.620
But now we have a double bond
starting at two to three, so

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.940
it would be hept-2.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.405
And we also have another double
bond starting from four

00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:32.760
and going to five,
so hept-2,4-ene.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.290
That's what this molecule
right there is.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.560
Sometimes, this is the-- I
guess-- proper naming, but

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.610
just so you're familiar with
it if you ever see it.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.620
Sometimes someone would write
hept-2-ene, they'll write that

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.390
as 2-heptene, probably because
it's easier to say 2-heptene.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.710
And from this, you would be able
to draw this thing over

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.620
here, so it's giving you the
same amount of information.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.390
Similarly over here, they
might say 2,4-heptene.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.520
But this is the specific,
this is the correct

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.640
way to write it.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.890
It let's you know the two and
the four apply to the ene,

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.860
which you know applies
to double bonds.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.000
Let's do a couple more.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.910
So over here, I have a double
bond, and I also have some

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.720
side chains.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.140
Let's see if we can figure
out how to deal with

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.519
all of these things.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.300
So first of all, what is our
longest chain of carbons?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.400
So we have one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.180
Now we could go in either
direction, it doesn't matter.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.650
Seven carbons or
seven carbons.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.580
Let's start numbering closest
to the double bond.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.490
The double bond actually will
take precedence over any other

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.210
groups that are attached
to it.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.990
So let's take precedence--
well, over any other

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.940
groups in this case.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.510
There will be other groups that
will take precedence in

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.800
the future.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.580
But the double bond takes
precedence over this side

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.300
chain, this methyl group.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.230
But it doesn't matter in this
case, we'd want to start

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.140
numbering at this end.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.800
It's one, two carbon, three
carbon, four carbon, five

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.100
carbon, six carbon,
seven carbon.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.855
So we're dealing with
a hept again.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.480
We have a double bond starting
from the second carbon to the

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.760
third carbon.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.750
So this thing right here, this
double bond from the second

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.760
carbon to the third carbon.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.880
So it's hept-2,3-ene-- sorry,
not 2,3, 2-ene.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.490
You don't write both
endpoints.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.420
If there was a three, then there
would have been another

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.530
double bond there.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.780
It's hept-2-ene.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.680
And then we have this methyl
group here, which is also

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.900
sitting on the second carbon.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.040
So this methyl group right there
on the second carbon.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.290
So we would say
2-methyl-hept-2-ene.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.020
It's a hept-2-ene, that's all of
this part over here, double

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.380
bonds starting on
the two if we're

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.570
numbering from the right.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.870
And then the methyl group
is also attached

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.260
to that second carbon.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.960
Let's do one more of these.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.830
So we have a cycle here, and
once again the root is going

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.890
to be the largest chain or
the largest ring here.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.110
Our main ring is the largest
one, and we have one, two,

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.150
three, four, five,
six, carbon.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.890
So we are dealing with hex as
our root for kind of the core

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.350
of our structure.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.240
It's in a cycle, so it's
going to be cyclohex.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.230
So let me write that.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.980
So it's going to be cyclohex.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.280
But it has a double
bond in it.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.710
So it's cyclohex ene,
cyclohexene.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.040
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.750
So we have this double bond
here, and that's why we know

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.410
it is an ene.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.160
Now you're probably saying, Hey
Sal, how come we didn't

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.850
have to number where
the ene is?

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.990
So if you only have one double
bond in a ring, it's assumed

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.380
that one end point of the double
bond is your 1-carbon.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.200
When you write just cyclohexene,
you know-- so

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.100
cyclohexene would look
just like this.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:11.480
Just like that.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.140
You don't have to specify
where it is.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.390
It's just, one of these are
going to be the double bond.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.920
Now when you have other
constituents on it, by

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.510
definition or I guess the proper
naming mechanism, is

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.940
one of the endpoints of the
double bond will be the

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.070
1-carbon, and if any of those
endpoints have something else

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.730
on it, that will definitely
be the 1-carbon.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.270
So these both are kind of the
candidates for the 1-carbon,

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.640
but this point right here also
has this methyl group.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.020
We will start numbering there,
one, and then you want to

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.580
number in the direction of the
other side of the double bond.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.470
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.750
So we have three methyl
groups, one on one.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.490
So these are the-- let me circle
the methyl groups.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.950
That's a methyl group
right there.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.490
That's a methyl group
right there.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.470
That's just one carbon.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.760
So we have three methyl groups,
so this is going to

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.650
be-- it's at the one, the
four, and the six.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.900
So it is 1, 4, 6.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:19.030
We have three methyl groups, so
it's trimethyl cyclohexene.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.460
1, 4, 6-trimethylcyclohexene.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.720
That's what that is, hopefully
you found that useful.
