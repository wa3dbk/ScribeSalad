00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.570
Welcome back.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.680
I'm on problem number 10.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.980
Phillip used 4 pieces of masking
tape, each 6 inches

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:25.020
long, to put up each
of his posters.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.150
So this is per poster.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.060
Good enough.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.610
Phillip had a 300-foot roll of
masking tape when he started.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.130
So he starts at 300 feet.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.760
I can already tell you that
some unit conversion will

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.180
happen, because they're talking
about 6 inches here

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.940
and they're talking about
300 feet here.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.850
If no tape was wasted, which
of the following represents

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.330
the number of feet--and they
underline it-- of masking tape

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.080
that was left on the roll after
he put up the n posters?

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.330
And they actually tell us that
12 inches are equal to a foot

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.140
in case you aren't
from this planet.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.715
So how do we do this?

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.460
So he's going to put
up n posters.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.630
So he's going to start
off-- well, how much

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.830
tape will he use?

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.390
So for each of those n posters,
how much will he use?

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.980
He uses 4 pieces
times 6 inches.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.300
But we want to go into feet.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.230
We want to know how many
feet are left.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.170
So let's just convert
immediately to feet.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.070
6 inches is equal to
how many feet?

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.980
Well, it's half a foot.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.160
6/12 inches.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.000
So it equals 1/2 foot.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.790
So he does 4 pieces for each
poster, and each of those

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.640
pieces is 1/2 foot.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.800
And now we're immediately
in feet length.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.290
So this is how much he uses.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.790
So he will use-- so 4
times 1/2 is just 2.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.640
So he uses 2n feet.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.210
So if he starts with 300, the
amount that he has left is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.485
what he started with
minus what he used.

00:02:08.485 --> 00:02:10.900
He used 2n.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.360
So he starts with 300 feet minus
2n feet, so that's the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.350
expression.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.600
That's choice B.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.680
Next problem.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.990
Problem 11.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.870
I'll switch to magenta.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.450
In the x, y coordinate plane,
line m is the reflection of

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.320
line l about the x-axis.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.650
If the slope of m-- so m slope--
is equal to minus 4/5,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.300
what is the slope of l?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.000
So you should hopefully be able
to do this on the real

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.980
exam without having
to draw it.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.330
Or you could actually just draw
a really quick and dirty

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.740
one, and that actually
probably would

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.990
do the job for you.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.450
So minus 4/5.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.460
That means for every
5-- and it's a

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.510
reflection about the x-axis.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.805
So let's draw a line m.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.510
Now let's just assume that
the origin's here.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.350
They don't tell us that,
but they don't

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.150
tell us it's not that.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.860
So that's zero, one, two,
three, four, five.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.900
And this is one, two,
three, four.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.850
Let me do it here.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.330
One, two, three, four.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.490
I just want to draw it
so you understand.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.410
So 4, minus 4, this is 5.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.120
So we know line m.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.530
For every line m, for every
5 it goes to the right,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.450
it goes down 4.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.590
So this could be a legitimate
line m right here.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.670
It could be like this.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.840
Line m could look like that.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.367
So a reflection about the
x-axis, if I were to reflect

00:03:57.367 --> 00:04:00.520
it about the x-axis.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.160
This is the x-axis right here,
so I just want to take its

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.190
mirror image, or flip
it over the x-axis.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.440
It would look like this.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.960
Oh, I thought I was using
the line tool.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.210
It would look like this.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.950
I'm still not using
the line tool.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.430
Now, I'm using the line tool.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.440
It would look like
that, right?

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.270
So what's the slope here?

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:35.230
Well, for every 5 I go to
the right, I move up 4.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.940
So change in y.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.790
Let me make sure this is
line m, this is line l.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.350
Change in y over change in
x for line l is equal to

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.600
positive 4/5.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.000
It shouldn't take you
that long to do it.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.720
One thing that you could just
do as well, you could just

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.530
draw a quick and dirty one.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.160
It's like, well, if I have
something with a negative

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.640
slope-- let's say I have
a negative, really

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.590
shallow slope like that.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.040
If I flip it, it's going to have
the same slope, but it's

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.620
going to be a positive slope,
but it's still going to be

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.260
shallow, so it's going to
be the same magnitude.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.290
You'll flip the sign.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.100
So the answer is B, 4/5.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.920
But I did this just to give
you the intuition.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.940
The next problem.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.550
Or to let you know why you got
it wrong, if you got it wrong.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.960
Anyway.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.090
Problem number 12.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:37.900
If n is equal to 3p, for what
value of p is n equal to p?

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.380
This is kind of crazy.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.240
And at first, I was like,
what are they saying?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.890
And then I read one
of the choices.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.810
Because no matter what,
n is equal to 3p.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.100
There's no circumstance--
well, oh, sorry.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.820
I was incorrect.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.350
There is a circumstance in
which n is equal to 3p.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.070
Well, what's the circumstance?

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.290
Well, you might initially say,
well, as long as p is not 0, n

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.580
is going to be exactly
3 times p.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.890
But then in our statement, I
just told you the answer.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.750
They both can be 0.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.680
If p is 0, then 3
times 0 is 0.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.540
So there's no real
algebra there.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.310
It's just kind of to realize
that 0 is a choice.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.970
And if you looked at the
choices, you'd immediately see

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.160
choice A is 0.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.870
Try it out.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.180
You say, oh, well, if p is
0, then n is also 0.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.930
So then n would equal p.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.140
So next problem.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.310
Problem 13.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.920
That was one of those problems
that in some ways are so easy

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.700
that you waste time
on it, making sure

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.300
you didn't miss something.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.265
Let's draw what they drew.

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:09.350
So we have a line like that.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.385
I have a line like that.

00:07:11.385 --> 00:07:15.030
Then I have a line like that.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.250
And this is line l.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.580
This is y degrees.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.430
This is line m.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:29.520
This is x degrees, and this
is line n right here.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.440
In the figure above, if z--
oh, they tell us this is z

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.670
right here.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:42.155
In the figure above, if z is
equal to 30, what is the value

00:07:42.155 --> 00:07:44.670
of x plus y?

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.720
x plus y is what?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.800
Well, what can we figure out?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.050
What do we know about this
angle right here?

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.130
It's supplementary
to y, right?

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.760
So this is kind of the angle
game, but we're going to have

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.260
a little bit more variables
than normal.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.810
It's supplementary to y, so this
is going to be 180 minus

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.880
y because y plus this
angle are going to

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.610
have to equal 180.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.980
And for the exact same reason,
this angle right here

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.870
is 180 minus x.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.530
And what do we know?

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.115
We know this angle plus this
angle plus z is equal to 180.

00:08:17.115 --> 00:08:18.730
So let's write that down.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:29.230
This angle, 180 minus y, plus
this angle, plus 180 minus x,

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.419
plus z is equal to 180
because they're

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.390
all in the same triangle.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.380
So let's try our best
to simplify this.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:44.540
Well, we could immediately get
rid of one of the 180's on

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.610
that side, and that becomes 0.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.100
z is 30, right?

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.490
So let's simplify it.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:58.990
We get minus y minus x, and
then you have 180 plus 30,

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.660
plus 210, is equal to 0.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.160
Now let's add x and
y to both sides.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.100
I'm kind of skipping a step.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.440
You could add x to both sides
and then add y to both sides.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.410
But if you add x and y to both
sides, you get 210 is

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.190
equal to x plus y.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.680
And that's the answer.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.710
They want to know what
x plus y is.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.440
And that is choice D.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.060
And so the trick here is really
saying, well, they

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.370
only give us z.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.440
The only thing I know is that
z is in a triangle with this

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.220
angle and this angle.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.800
And let me express those two
angles in terms of x and y,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.800
because they are supplementary
to x and y.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.610
See you in the next video.
