00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.810
Welcome back.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.250
Well, we're now on problem
number 11.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.040
And this says the circle above
has center o, and diameter ab.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.220
And it's a dotted line in the
book, but I made it a solid

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.190
green line.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.500
The two semi-circles have
diameters oa, so this is one

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.600
semi-circle and this is
its diameter, oa.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.370
And then ob, this is the
other semi-circle.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.500
It's ob.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.870
If the circumference of
the circle is 36 pi.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.020
So, circumference of the circle,
of the big circle--

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.250
and actually I'll do it in
yellow, which is the color of

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.840
kind of the perimeter or the
circumference of that circle.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.950
So they're saying the
circumference is 36 pi.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.090
What is the length of the curved
path from ab to o?

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.680
So they want to figure out the
length of, essentially, this

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.260
brown path.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.210
And so before we break into
the math, just how can we

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.540
think about this?

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.580
Well we have a big circle and
we know its circumference.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.850
So if we know its circumference
we could figure

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.730
out its radius or its
diameter, right?

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.860
Because you know the formula,
circumference is

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.820
equal to 2 pi r.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.070
So if we know the circumference
of this big

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.540
circle, we can actually
figure out its radius

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.560
by using this formula.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.960
And the radius of the big
circle, which would be-- let's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.670
say, oa or ob-- they're both
radiuses of the big circle--

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.540
than those are the diameter of
each of these half circles or

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.810
each of these semi-circles.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.820
So if we know this diameter we
could take half of it and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.880
re-use this formula, or say the
circumference is pi times

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.370
the diameter.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.780
We could do either one.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.700
And we could figure out-- let's
say we know this radius,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.730
so we could figure out this.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.020
Then we could figure out
the circumference

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.410
of this larger circle.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.370
And I'll actually make the claim
that the circumference

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.360
of this larger circle is the
same as the circumference of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.232
this half circle plus
this half circle.

00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:00.770
And I think you know why.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.340
If you just shifted this up then
you would get the other

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.460
half of this circle.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.940
The other way you could have
done it is, you figure out the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.900
circumference of this circle,
divide by 2 to get this.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.840
Take the circumference of this
circle, divide by 2 to get

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.740
this and then add them.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.800
But you'll get the same thing
as just the circumference of

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.890
this circle.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.540
So let's do the problem.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.240
So circumference is
equal to 2 pi r.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.420
We know the circumference of
the larger circle is 36 pi.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.930
So let's see, 36 pi is
equal to 2 pi r.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.490
Divide both sides by 2 pi, and
I'll switch the sides too.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.565
So you get r is equal to 36 pi
over 2 pi-- I just divided

00:02:42.565 --> 00:02:44.020
both sides by 2 pi.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.520
pi's cancel out.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.200
36 divided by 2 is
equal to 18.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.220
And so what's 18?

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.340
18 is this length right here.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.090
Is this length.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.360
We just figured out,
that's the radius

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.880
of the larger circle.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.340
And now we could use this, which
is the diameter of the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.020
smaller circle to figure out
its circumference using the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.890
same formula.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.400
And now I'm going to use brown
for this circumference.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.870
So circumference is
equal to 2 pi r.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.410
And that's the same thing as--
because 2 times the radius is

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.330
the diameter.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.040
So that equals pi times
the diameter.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.760
We know what the diameter
is, the diameter is 18.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.260
So we could say circumference
is equal to

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.880
pi times the diameter.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.690
The diameter is 18.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.120
Or if we rearrange that
that's 18 pi.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.030
And we're done.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.450
Because what we just figured
out is the circumference of

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.360
this larger circle.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.760
We could divide it by 2 and
figure out-- we could say that

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.530
this is 9 pi right here.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.560
Just this piece.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.710
This piece is 9 pi.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.250
And if we do the same math here
on this piece, you would

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.090
also get 9 pi.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.710
But that also adds
up to 18 pi.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.570
Hopefully you understand
what I'm saying.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.250
Let's move on to the
next problem.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.760
So in the table above-- this is
our classic f of x table.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.000
When x is 0, f of x is a.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.020
When x is 1, f of x is 24.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.700
When x is 2, f of x is b.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.840
It says the table above shows
some values of the functions

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.100
of f. f is a linear function.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.130
So what does a linear
function mean?

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.710
Linear means it's a line.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.200
And that also means that
the slope is constant.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.960
If you haven't gottem-- well,
if you haven't got past

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.120
algebra I, you probably haven't
seen functions with

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.220
non-constant slopes.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.780
But like, for example,
quadratics don't

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.030
have constant slopes.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.845
The linear means that the
slope is constant.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.870
That's the one conclusion you
can make from that statement.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.760
And then they want to know, what
is the value of a plus b?

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.530
a plus b is what?

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.800
So the only thing we know is
this table and we know that

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.910
it's linear.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.560
And linear means that the
slope is constant.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.040
So the slope is constant.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.040
So let's see what we can
figure out the slope.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.860
So that means the slope from x
is equal to 0 to x is equal to

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.210
1 is the same as the slope from
x is equal to 1, to x is

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.480
equal to 2.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.140
So what's the slope if we
use these two terms?

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.500
Slope is change in-- well change
in f of x over change

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.780
in x, right?

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.110
So change in-- I mean it's
change in y over

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.250
change in x, right?

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.750
We could call this y instead.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.730
So change in y-- let's see, 24
minus a-- and you might want

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.680
to review the slope video
if you forgot this.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.360
24 minus a over the change
in x is 1 minus 0.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.100
Well that's just 1.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.800
So that equals 24
minus a, right?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.310
And what's the slope
from these points?

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.080
Because we know it's constant.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.810
We know the slope between these
two points is going to

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.930
be the same as the slope between
these two points.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.900
Well, we do the same thing.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:17.880
We take the end points' change
in y, so it's b minus 24 over

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.770
change in x, 2 minus 1.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.240
So that equals-- well that's
just 1, so that

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.660
equals b minus 24.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.490
So this is the slope between
these second two points, and

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.600
this the slope between
the first two points.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.130
And since we know it's linear,
since we know this is a linear

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.180
equation, we can say well they
must be equal to each other.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.630
So let's see if that gets us
to where we want to go.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:53.760
So we know that 24 minus a
is equal to b minus 24.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.110
Let's add 24 to both sides.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.760
You get 48 minus a
is equal to b.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.600
I just added 24 to both sides.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.110
And if we add a to both sides,
I see the end point-- 48 is

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.980
equal to a plus b.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.570
And that is choice C.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.110
Let us move on.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.430
And remember, all we did is we
used this information, and we

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.160
used the fact that slope
is constant.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.670
So the only thing that you would
have had to know ahead

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.060
of time is the equation of the
slope, and that's change in y

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.260
over change in x, and that
linear means constant slope.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.990
So they write a little
sequence up here,

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.500
this is number 13.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.500
It's 3, 5, negative 5.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.540
They say the first term in the
sequence of the numbers shown

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.720
is 3-- that's obvious.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.280
They show that.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.880
Each even number term is 2 more
than the previous term,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.960
so we go from 3 to 5, that was
2 more, because this is the

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.630
second term, so it's an
even number term.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.660
So this is 2 more.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.350
And each odd number of term
after the first is minus 1

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.330
times the previous.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.160
So minus 1 times this
term is minus 5.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.610
So that's what they're saying.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.580
For example, the second term
is 3 plus 2, and the third

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.640
term is minus 1 times 5.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.240
What is the 55th term
of the sequence?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.400
So on the SAT, whenever they ask
you some crazy term, like

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.250
the 100th term or the 55th term,
that a huge signal that

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.820
this sequence is probably going
to repeat itself and you

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.010
just have to figure
out the pattern.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.450
And then once you know that
pattern I'll show you how to

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.710
figure out the 500th term
if you have to.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.789
So with any sequence the best
thing to do is just write out

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:43.210
a bunch of terms. So we start
at 3, we add 2, we get 5.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.660
We multiply that
by negative 1.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.145
This is plus 2.

00:08:47.145 --> 00:08:51.450
So we multiply by negative
1, times negative 1,

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.130
we get minus 5.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.970
Then we want to add 2.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:01.350
So 2 times negative 5 is--
we're adding 2, right.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.080
2 plus negative 5 is minus 3.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.320
I think I'm already seeing
a pattern here.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.500
And then we have to multiply
that times minus

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.430
1 times minus 1.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.970
That's not x minus 1, this
is times minus 1.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.640
So minus 1 times 3.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.630
So minus 1 times 3-- I should
do minus 1 time instead.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.460
Minus 1 times 3,
well that's 3.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.310
And then we add 2 to it,
plus 2, we get 5.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.120
And it's interesting, then it's
going to start repeating.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.610
Minus 1 is minus 5.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.660
So let's see what the repetition
looks like.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.390
The first term is 3, the second
term is 5, the third

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:46.000
term is minus 5, the fourth
term is minus 3.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.770
The fifth term is 3 again.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.010
The sixth term is
5, 7 and so on.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:53.930
I'm almost out of time.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.130
I'll continue this in
the next video.
