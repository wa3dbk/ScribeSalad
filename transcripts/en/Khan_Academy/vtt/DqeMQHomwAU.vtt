00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.370
Solve for x and
check your solution.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.920
We have x divided
by 3 is equal to 14.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.320
So to solve for x, to figure
out what the variable x must

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.135
be equal to, we really
just have to isolate it

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:15.760
on the left-hand side
of this equation.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.884
It's already sitting there.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:19.490
We have x divided
by 3 is equal to 14.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.960
We could also write this
as 1/3 x is equal to 14.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.730
Obviously, x times 1/3
is going to be x/3.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.840
These are equivalent.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.800
So how can we just end up with
an x on the left-hand side

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.107
of either of these equations?

00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:34.440
These are really the same thing.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.370
Or another way, how
can we just have a 1

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.990
in front of the x, a 1x,
which is really just saying

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.650
x over here?

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.860
Well, I'm dividing
it by 3 right now.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.420
So if I were to multiply both
sides of this equation by 3,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.680
that would isolate the x.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.100
And the reason that would
work is if I multiply this

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.140
by 3 over here, I'm multiplying
by 3 and dividing by 3.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.310
That's equivalent.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.720
That's equivalent to
multiplying or dividing by 1.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.995
These guys cancel out.

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:00.870
Remember, if you do it
to the left-hand side,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.004
you also have to do it
to the right-hand side.

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:04.879
And actually, I'll do
both of these equations

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.545
at the same time,
because they're really

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:08.470
the exact same equation.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.970
So what are we going to get
over here on the left-hand side?

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.350
3 times anything divided by 3
is going to be that anything.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.580
We're just going to
have an x left over

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.050
on the left-hand side.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.100
And on the right-hand
side, what's 14 times 3?

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.770
3 times 10 is 30,
3 times 4 is 12.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.510
So it's going to be 42.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.550
So we get x is equal to 42.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.120
And the same thing
would happen here.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.250
3 times 1/3 is just 1.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.820
So you get 1x is equal to
14 times 3, which is 42.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.250
Now let's just check our answer.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.060
Let's substitute 42 into
our original equation.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:52.190
So we have 42 in place for
x over 3 is equal to 14.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.370
So what's 42 divided by 3?

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.210
And we could do a little
bit of-- I guess we call it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.200
medium-long division.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.690
It's not really long division.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.210
3 into 4.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.580
3 goes into 4 one time.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.370
1 times 3 is 3.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.250
You subtract.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100
4 minus 3 is 1.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.370
Bring down the 2.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.110
3 goes into 12 four times.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.710
3 goes into 42 14 times.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.230
So this right over
here simplifies to 14.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.640
And it all checks
out, so we're done.
