00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.270
Let's do a few more problems
that bring together the

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.950
concepts that we learned
in the last two videos.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.140
So let's say we have the
inequality 4x plus 3 is less

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.850
than negative 1.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.440
So let's find all of the
x's that satisfy this.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.880
So the first thing I'd like to
do is get rid of this 3.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.430
So let's subtract 3 from both
sides of this equation.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.980
So the left-hand side is just
going to end up being 4x.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.320
These 3's cancel out.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.060
That just ends up with a zero.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.200
No reason to change the
inequality just yet.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.630
We're just adding and
subtracting from both sides,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.375
in this case, subtracting.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.780
That doesn't change the
inequality as long as we're

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.460
subtracting the same value.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.300
We have negative 1 minus 3.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.680
That is negative 4.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.610
Negative 1 minus 3
is negative 4.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.380
And then we'll want to-- let's
see, we can divide both sides

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.375
of this equation by 4.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.760
Once again, when you multiply
or divide both sides of an

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.190
inequality by a positive number,
it doesn't change the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.990
inequality.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.255
So the left-hand
side is just x.

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:15.070
x is less than negative 4
divided by 4 is negative 1.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.960
x is less than negative 1.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.210
Or we could write this
in interval notation.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.080
All of the x's from negative
infinity to negative 1, but

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.900
not including negative
1, so we put a

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.900
parenthesis right there.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.980
Let's do a slightly
harder one.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.500
Let's say we have 5x is greater
than 8x plus 27.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.620
So let's get all our x's on the
left-hand side, and the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.360
best way to do that is subtract
8x from both sides.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.360
So you subtract 8x
from both sides.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.640
The left-hand side becomes
5x minus 8x.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.040
That's negative 3x.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.520
We still have a greater
than sign.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.560
We're just adding or subtracting
the same

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.040
quantities on both sides.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.960
These 8x's cancel out and you're
just left with a 27.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.180
So you have negative 3x
is greater than 27.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.320
Now, to just turn this into an
x, we want to divide both

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.900
sides by negative 3.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.450
But remember, when you multiply
or divide both sides

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.140
of an inequality by a negative
number, you swap the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.550
inequality.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:29.140
So if we divide both sides of
this by negative 3, we have to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.760
swap this inequality.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.800
It will go from being
a greater than sign

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.410
to a less than sign.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.090
And just as a bit of a way that
I remember greater than

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.410
is that the left-hand side
just looks bigger.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.550
This is greater than.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.800
If you just imagine this height,
that height is greater

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.170
than that height right there,
which is just a point.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.970
I don't know if that confuses
you or not.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.830
This is less than.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.090
This little point
is less than the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.160
distance of that big opening.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.490
That's how I remember it.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.550
But anyway, 3x over
negative 3.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.280
So now that we divided both
sides by a negative number, by

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.410
negative 3, we swapped the
inequality from greater than

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.870
to less than.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.490
And the left-hand side, the
negative 3's cancel out.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.430
You get x is less than
27 over negative 3,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.820
which is negative 9.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.600
Or in interval notation, it
would be everything from

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.720
negative infinity to negative
9, not including negative 9.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.350
If you wanted to do it
as a number line, it

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.530
would look like this.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.080
This would be negative 9, maybe
this would be negative

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.350
8, maybe this would
be negative 10.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.770
You would start at negative 9,
not included, because we don't

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.190
have an equal sign here, and
you go everything less than

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.860
that, all the way down, as we
see, to negative infinity.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.540
Let's do a nice,
hairy problem.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:05.930
So let's say we have 8x minus
5 times 4x plus 1 is greater

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.290
than or equal to negative 1
plus 2 times 4x minus 3.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.330
Now, this might seem very
daunting, but if we just

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.240
simplify it step by step, you'll
see it's no harder than

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.269
any of the other problems
we've tackled.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.519
So let's just simplify this.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.990
You get 8x minus-- let's
distribute this negative 5.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.590
So let me say 8x, and then
distribute the negative 5.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.560
Negative 5 times 4x
is negative 20x.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.760
Negative 5-- when I say negative
5, I'm talking about

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.650
this whole thing.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.510
Negative 5 times 1 is negative
5, and then that's going to be

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.660
greater than or equal
to negative 1 plus

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.210
2 times 4x is 8x.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.940
2 times negative 3
is negative 6.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.490
And now we can merge these two
terms. 8x minus 20x is

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:04.120
negative 12x minus 5 is greater
than or equal to-- we

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.040
can merge these constant terms.
Negative 1 minus 6,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.070
that's negative 7, and then we
have this plus 8x left over.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.620
Now, I like to get all my x
terms on the left-hand side,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.255
so let's subtract 8x from both
sides of this equation.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.700
I'm subtracting 8x.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.900
This left-hand side, negative
12 minus 8,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.900
that's negative 20.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.270
Negative 20x minus 5.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.710
Once again, no reason
to change the

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.380
inequality just yet.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.910
All we're doing is simplifying
the sides, or adding and

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.740
subtracting from them.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.220
The right-hand side becomes--
this thing cancels out, 8x

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.600
minus 8x, that's 0.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.690
So you're just left
with a negative 7.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.690
And now I want to get rid
of this negative 5.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.910
So let's add 5 to both sides
of this equation.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.540
The left-hand side, you're just
left with a negative 20x.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.600
These 5's cancel out.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.300
No reason to change the
inequality just yet.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.330
Negative 7 plus 5, that's
negative 2.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.710
Now, we're at an interesting
point.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.810
We have negative 20x is greater
than or equal to

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.460
negative 2.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.000
If this was an equation, or
really any type of an

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.740
inequality, we want to divide
both sides by negative 20.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.520
But we have to remember, when
you multiply or divide both

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.370
sides of an inequality by a
negative number, you have to

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.810
swap the inequality.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.250
So let's remember that.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.761
So if we divide this side by
negative 20 and we divide this

00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:50.900
side by negative 20, all I did
is took both of these sides

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.350
divided by negative 20, we have
to swap the inequality.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.560
The greater than or equal to has
to become a less than or

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.990
equal sign.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.380
And, of course, these cancel
out, and you get x is less

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.550
than or equal to-- the
negatives cancel

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.590
out-- 2/20 is 1/10.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.490
If we were writing it in
interval notation, the upper

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.440
bound would be 1/10.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.670
Notice, we're including it,
because we have an equal sign,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.220
less than or equal, so we're
including 1/10, and we're

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.210
going to go all the way down
to negative infinity,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.260
everything less than
or equal to 1/10.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.600
This is just another way
of writing that.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.670
And just for fun, let's
draw the number line.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.380
Let's draw the number
line right here.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.520
This is maybe 0, that is 1.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.610
1/10 might be over here.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.090
Everything less than
or equal to 1/10.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:51.620
So we're going to include the
1/10 and everything less than

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.010
that is included in
the solution set.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.900
And you could try out any
value less than 1/10 and

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.400
verify that it will satisfy
this inequality.
