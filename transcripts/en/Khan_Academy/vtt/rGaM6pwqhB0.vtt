00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.700
Let's do a couple of problems
where the roots of the

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.980
characteristic equation
are complex.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.380
And just as a little bit of a
review, and we'll put this up

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.460
here in the corner so that
it's useful for us.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.600
We learned that if the roots of
our characteristic equation

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.290
are r is equal to lambda plus
or minus mu i, that the

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:26.360
general solution for our
differential equation is y is

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:34.740
equal to e to the lambda x times
c1 with some constant

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:45.120
cosine of mu x, plus c2
times sine of mu x.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.310
And with that said, let's
do some problems.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.860
So let's see, this first one
that our differential

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040
equation-- I'll do this one
in blue-- our differential

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.320
equation is the second
derivative, y prime prime plus

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:05.700
4y prime plus 5y
is equal to 0.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.200
And they actually give us
some initial conditions.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.610
They say y of 0 is equal
to 1, and y prime of

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.980
0 is equal to 0.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.660
So now we'll actually be able
to figure out a particular

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.000
solution, or the particular
solution, for this

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.260
differential equation.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.580
So let's write down the
characteristic equation.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:41.700
So it's r squared plus 4r
plus 5 is equal to 0.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.890
Let's break out our
quadratic formula.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.600
The roots of this are going
to be negative b.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.290
So minus 4 plus or minus the
square root of b squared.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.210
So that's 16.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:05.240
Minus 4 times a-- well that's
1-- times 1, times c times 5.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.940
All of that over 2 times a.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.880
a is 1 so all of that over 2.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.240
And see this simplifies.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.830
This equals minus 4 plus or
minus 16-- this is 20, right?

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.310
4 times 1 times 5 is 20.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.990
So 16 minus 20 is minus 4.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.590
Minus 4 over 2.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:38.670
And that equals minus 4 plus
or minus 2i, right?

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.580
Square root of minus 4 is 2i.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.820
All that over 2.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.900
And so our roots to the
characteristic equation are

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.100
minus 2-- just dividing both by
2-- minus 2 plus or minus,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.610
we could say i or 1i, right?

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.910
So if we wanted to do some
pattern match, if we just

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.050
wanted to do it really fast,
what's our lambda?

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.120
Our lambda is just minus 1.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.840
Let me write that down.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.800
That's our lambda.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.110
What's our mu?

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.800
Well mu is the coefficient
on the i, so mu is 1.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.260
mu is equal to 1.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.360
And now we're ready to write
down our general solution.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.270
So the general solution to this
differential equation is

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.570
y is equal to e to the lambda
x-- well lambda is minus 2--

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:36.780
minus 2x times c1 cosine of mu
x-- but mu is just 1-- so c1

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.370
cosine of x, plus c2 sine
of mu x, when mu is

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.970
1, so sine of x.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.070
Fair enough.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.890
Now let's use our initial
conditions to find the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.990
particular solution, or
a particular solution.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.780
So, when x is 0, y
is equal to 1.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.440
So y is equal to
1 when x is 0.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.630
So 1 is equal to-- let's
substitute x is 0 here.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.140
So e to the minus 2 times
0, that's just 1.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.460
So this whole thing becomes 1,
so we could just ignore it.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.490
It's just 1 times this thing.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.740
So I'll write that down.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.970
e to the 0 is 1 times c1 times
cosine of 0, plus c2

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.300
times sine of 0.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.530
Now what's sine of 0?

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.290
Sine of 0 is 0.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.400
So this whole term
is going to be 0.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.480
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.080
So there, we already
solved for c1.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.570
We get this, this is 1.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.440
So 1 times c1 times
1 is equal to 1.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.340
So we get our first
coefficient.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.880
c1 is equal to 1.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.020
Now let's take the derivative
of our general solution.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.180
And we could even substitute
c1 in here, just so that we

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.740
have to stop writing
c1 all the time.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.630
And we can solve for c2.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.260
So right now we know that our
general solution is y-- we

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.960
could call this our
pseudo-general solution,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.070
because we already solved for
c1-- y is equal to e to the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.630
minus 2x times c1, but we know
that c1 is 1, so I'll write

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:20.130
times cosine of x, plus
c2 times sine of x.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.180
Now let's take the derivative
of this, so that we can use

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.520
the second initial condition.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.840
So y prime is equal to-- we're
going to have to do a little

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.970
bit of product rule here.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.450
So what's the derivative of
the first expression?

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.345
It is minus 2e to
the minus 2x.

00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:39.860
And we multiply that times
the second expression.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.860
Cosine of x plus c2 sine of x.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.390
And then we add that to just the
regular first expression.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.190
So plus e to the minus 2x times
the derivative of the

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.840
second expression.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.750
So what's the derivative
of cosine of x?

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.440
It's minus sine of x.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.840
And then what's the derivative
of c2 sine of x?

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.750
Well , it's plus
c2 cosine of x.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:17.080
And let's see if we can do any
kind of simplification here.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.730
Well actually, the easiest
way, instead of trying to

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.310
simplify it algebraically and
everything, let's just use our

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.530
initial condition.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.640
Our initial condition is y
prime of 0 is equal to 0.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.940
Let me write that down.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.170
Second initial condition was
y prime of 0 is equal to 0.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.800
So y prime, when x is equal
to 0, is equal to 0.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.210
And let's substitute x is equal
to 0 into this thing.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.110
We could have simplified this
more, but let's not worry

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.500
about that right now.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.510
So if x is 0, this is going
to be 1, right?

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.370
E to the 0.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.250
e to the 0 is 1, so we're left
with just minus 2, right?

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:58.490
Minus 2 times e to the 0, times
cosine of 0, that's 1,

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.060
plus c2 times sine of 0.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.550
Sine of 0 is 0.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.010
So that's just 1 plus 0, plus
e to the minus 2 times 0.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.880
That's just 1.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.870
Times minus sine of 0.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.250
Sine of 0 is just 0.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.530
Plus c2 times cosine of 0.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.870
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.520
So plus c2.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.070
That simplified things,
didn't it?

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.730
So let's see, we get 0 is equal
to-- this is just 1--

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.130
minus 2 plus c2.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.490
Or we get c2 is equal to 2.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.090
Add 2 to both sides.
c2 is equal to 2.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.950
And then we have our particular
solution.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.230
I know it's c2 is equal to
2, c1 is equal to 1.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.160
Actually, let me erase some of
this, just so that we can go

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.245
from our general solution to
our particular solution.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.600
So we had figured out, you can
remember, c1 is 1 and c2 is 2.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.570
That's easy to memorize.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.230
So I'll just delete
all of this.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.490
I'll write it nice and big.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.070
So our particular solution,
given these initial

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:20.980
conditions, were, or are, or is
y of x is equal to-- this

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:26.220
was a general solution-- e to
the minus 2x times-- we solved

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.930
for c1, it's equal to 1.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.890
So we can just write
cosine of x.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:31.950
And then we solved for c2.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.090
We figured out that
that was 2.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.860
Plus 2 sine of x.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.909
And there you go.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:42.710
We have our particular solution
to this-- sorry where

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.200
did I write it-- to this
differential equation with

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.290
these initial conditions.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.870
And what's neat is, when we
originally kind of proved this

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.070
formula-- when we originally
showed this formula-- we had

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.110
all of these i's and
we simplified.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.210
We said c2, it was a combination
of some other

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.640
constants times some i's.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.380
And we said, oh we don't know
whether they're imaginary or

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.075
not, so let's just merge them
into some constant.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:06.890
But what's interesting is this
particular solution has no i's

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.570
anywhere in it.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.530
And so, that tells us a
couple of neat things.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:18.470
One that, if we had kept this
c2 in terms of some multiple

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.745
of i's, and our constants
actually would have had i's

00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:22.440
and they would have canceled
out, et cetera.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.860
And it also tells us that this
formula is useful beyond

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.230
formulas that just involve
imaginary numbers.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.460
For example, this differential
equation, I don't see an i

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.070
anywhere here.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.790
I don't see an i
anywhere here.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.320
And I don't see an
i anywhere here.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.190
But given this differential
equation, to get to the

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.770
solution, we had to use
imaginary numbers in between.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.990
And I think this is the first
time-- if I'm remembering all

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.800
my playlists correctly-- this is
the first time that we used

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.120
imaginary numbers for
something useful.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.760
We used it as an intermediary
tool where we got a real, a

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.070
non-imaginary solution,
to a real problem, a

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.140
non-imaginary problem.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.100
But we used imaginary numbers
as a tool to solve it.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.370
So, hopefully, you found that
slightly interesting.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.960
And I'll see you in
the next video.
