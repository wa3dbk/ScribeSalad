00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome back.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.850
I was just chugging through the
hairy math of this problem,

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.300
which I think we're
almost done.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.950
But as I was saying, we're
just simplifying this.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.880
We have 25 times sine
squared of 15 plus

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.010
cosine squared of 15.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.730
I said well, that's
an identity, right?

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.690
Remember, I
undistributed this 25.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.190
So sine squared plus cosine
squared of the same angle is 1.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.130
So I can simplify this to --
and I will now change colors

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.810
just to be arbitrary.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:35.240
So, 25 plus 100 minus 100
cosine of 15 degrees, and this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.090
is what m squared is equal to,
and I used the variable m

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.910
because it stands for nothing
relevant to this problem.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:49.440
And that equals 125 minus
100 cosine of 15 degrees.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.320
Now I have to use a calculator
if I want to get a real answer.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.060
But the possibility for error
is much lower now that I've

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.320
hopefully simplified it.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.080
So I could use my calculator,
and the cosine of 15 degrees --

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.610
I'll write that down here, you
could just use a calculator or

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:20.220
table to figure that out --
it is equal to 0.96593.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.040
So this term would be 125
minus 100 times this, right?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.430
So what's 100 times this?

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.600
Well that's just minus 96.593,
right, I just did 100 times

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.880
the cosine of 15 degrees.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.970
And now let me use the
trusty calculator to

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.220
figure out what that is.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:56.800
So if I say 125 minus
96.593, I get 28.407.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.050
So I have m squared
is equal to 28.407.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.492
And so m is equal to the
square root of that.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:08.910
It's going to be 5 point
something, right?

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.970
Square root.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.220
5.3298.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.950
So 5.33.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.690
m is equal to 5.33.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.570
And we're done.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.870
The poor guy -- he's got to
figure out the right direction

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.040
to go in and he probably has to
think about the current in all

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.820
of that, but he hasn't asked us
that question so we

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.300
won't answer it.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.190
But all he has left
to go is 5.33 miles.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.770
So he only has to go an extra
0.33 miles than he would have,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.240
had he gone in the right
direction from the get-go.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.490
Hopefully that
makes some sense.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.740
If it doesn't, well, not much
I can do, but maybe you

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.960
can re-watch this video.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.460
Have fun.
