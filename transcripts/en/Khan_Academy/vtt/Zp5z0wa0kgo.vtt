00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.501
So we want to take the indefinite integral of 4x^3 over x^4 plus 7 dx.

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:11.573
So how can we tackle this? It seems like a hairy integral.

00:00:11.573 --> 00:00:18.184
Now the key inside here is to realize you have this expression x^4 + 7

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:26.171
and you also have its derivative up here. The derivative of x^4 plus 7 is equal to 4x^3.

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:30.843
Derivative of x^4 is 4x^3; derivative of 7 is just 0.

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:36.903
So that's a big clue that u-substitution might be the tool of choice here.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:39.575
U-sub -- I'll just write u- -- I'll write the whole thing.

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:47.180
U-Substitution could be the tool of choice. So given that, what would you want to set your u equal to?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.486
And I'll let you think about that 'cause it can figure out this part

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:53.982
and the rest will just boil down to a fairly straightforward integral.

00:00:53.982 --> 00:00:58.737
Well, you want to set u be equal to the expression that you have its derivative laying around.

00:00:58.737 --> 00:01:09.745
So we could set u equal to x^4 plus 7. Now, what is du going to be equal to?

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:18.406
du, I'm doing it in magenta. du, well it's just going to be the derivative of x^4 plus 7 with respect to x,

00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:27.278
so 4x^3 plus 0 times dx. I wrote it in differential form right over here,

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:32.929
but it's a completely equivalent statement to saying that du, the derivative of u with respect to x,

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:40.848
is equal to 4x^3 power. When someone writes du over dx, like this is really a notation to say

00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:46.512
the derivative of u with respect to x. It really isn't a fraction in a very formal way,

00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:50.421
but often times, you can kind of pseudo-manipulate them like fractions.

00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:56.378
So if you want to go from here to there, you can kind of pretend that you're multiplying both sides by dx.

00:01:56.378 --> 00:01:59.377
But these are equivalent statements and we want to get it in differential form

00:01:59.377 --> 00:02:03.911
in order to do proper use of u-substitution. And the reason why this is useful --

00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:07.277
and I'll just rewrite it up here so that it becomes very obvious;

00:02:07.277 --> 00:02:15.410
our original integral we can rewrite as 4x^3 dx over x^4 plus 7.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.580
And then it's pretty clear what's du and what's u.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.110
U, which we set to be equal to x^4 plus 7. And then du is equal to this.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.580
It's equal to 4x^3 dx. We saw it right over here. So we could rewrite this integral --

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.244
I'll try to stay consistent with the colors -- as the indefinite integral,

00:02:37.244 --> 00:02:44.722
well we have in magenta right over here, that's du over -- try to stay true to the colors --

00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:52.978
over x^4 plus 7, which is just u. Or, we could rewrite this entire thing as

00:02:52.978 --> 00:03:09.961
the integral of 1 over u du. Well, what is the indefinite integral of 1 over u du?

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:16.120
Well that's just going to be equal to the natural log of the absolute value --

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.060
and we use the absolute value so it'll be defined even for negative U's --

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.881
and it actually does work out. I'll do another video where I'll show you it definitely does.

00:03:23.881 --> 00:03:32.564
The natural log of the absolute value of u and then we might have a constant there that was lost when we took the derivative.

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:38.631
So that's essentially our answer in terms of u. But now we need to un-substitute the u.

00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:42.301
So what happens when we un-substitute the u?

00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:45.132
Well, then we are left with -- this is going to be equal to --

00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:55.392
the natural log of the absolute value of -- well, u is x^4 plus 7 -- not C, plus 7 --

00:03:55.392 --> 00:03:59.392
and then we can't forget our plus C out here. And we are done!
