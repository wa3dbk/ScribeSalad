00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.750
Welcome back.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.650
We are now going to start
a new section.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.270
This is going to be section 6.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.430
It starts on page 407 of the
official SAT study guide.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.120
Let's get started with some
problems. So let's see this

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.150
first problem.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.640
Just so you know, they tend to
be tricky, but really fast

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.550
problems. And sometimes they're
just really easy and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.870
fast. But they tend to be
problems that you should be

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.770
able to get, hopefully,
in a few seconds.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.020
So if your plan of attack
immediately tells you will

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.970
take you three or four minutes,
your plan of attack

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.130
might be non-optimal.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.190
It maybe correct,
but non-optimal.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:44.270
So the first question
is, x plus 2/x is

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.440
equal to 5 plus 2/5.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.520
And I was actually just looking
at this problem right

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.490
before we started this video.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.200
And well, anyway, this is a
pretty neat problem because

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.020
this falls into the category
of, there's two plans of

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.540
attacks here.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.900
One will take you some time,
and involves quadratics.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.660
The other plan of attack is
ultra fast, so this is, if x

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.970
plus 2/x is equal to 5 plus 2/5,
then x can equal which of

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.490
the following?

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.560
And they give some choices.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.100
They give the choice, 1/5.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.300
They give the choice, 4/5.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.140
They give the choice, 1,
5/2, and 5, right?

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.190
These are the choices
they give.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.110
So if you see this on a algebra
test, your natural

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.390
reaction is, well, let
me solve for x.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.720
And so you would add 5 plus
2/5, you get some fraction

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.990
there, 27/5.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.040
You'd multiply both
sides by x.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.160
You'd get x squared plus 2
is equal to 27 over 5x.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.470
You'd have a quadratic.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.955
You would want to factor that or
use quadratic equations, et

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:47.620
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.930
That would take you some time,
and considering this is the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.000
first problem, that's
not going to

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.730
be the plan of attack.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.260
So let me ask you, do you
see a pattern here?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.990
Do these two sides
look the same?

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.180
Well, they kind of do, right?

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.020
We have an x here, an x here.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.070
We have a 2 here, right?

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.010
We have a 2 in both places.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.710
We have a plus in both places.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.420
But the only difference is,
wherever I see an x on the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.810
left hand side, I see a 5
on the right hand side.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.620
So does something
jump out at you?

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.580
Well sure, if I just replace x
with 5, it's going to equal

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.230
this, right?

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.540
Because if I just put 5-- x
equals 5-- you get 5 plus 2/5

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.460
is equal to 5 plus 2/5.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.630
So this is the answer.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.400
So it could have literally taken
you about two seconds.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.360
And I have to admit, when I
first looked at this, I

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.400
thought, the first question
is a quadratic?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.540
I said, that can't be the way.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.360
And I looked at it a little
bit longer, about three

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.450
seconds longer, and I
said, oh, this is

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.900
just pattern matching.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.650
Let's move on to the next
question-- Image, clear image.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.980
Image, invert colors--
OK, so they have a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.916
right triangle here.

00:02:57.916 --> 00:02:59.806
Let be draw the right
triangle.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.623
Not a wrong triangle,
a right triangle.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.640
Let me get the paint tool.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.420
I'll draw this edge now
with my free hand,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.810
my shaky free hand.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.060
And they say this side
is 2, this side is y.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.760
this side is x.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.370
This , of course, is
the hypoteneuse.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.570
And they say, in the right
triangle above, If x is equal

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.390
to 3, what is the value of y?

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.840
Well, this is just straight up
Pythagorean theorem, right?

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.460
This is the hypoteneuse,
y is the hypoteneuse.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.080
So y squared is going to equal
this side, 4-- 2 squared--

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.340
plus this side, 3 squared.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.270
So y squared is going
to equal 4 plus 9.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.510
y squared is going
to equal 13.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.200
y is equal to the square
root of 13.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.970
And that is choice A.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.690
This was just straight up
Pythagorean theorem, nothing

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.210
tricky there, you just kind of
kind of chug through it.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.420
I'm assuming I didn't
do something wrong.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.745
Well anyway, let's assume that
and then move forward.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.650
I will now switch colors for
the sake of variety.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.900
OK, number 3.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.530
It says all numbers that are
divisible by both 2 and 6, are

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.180
also divisible by 4.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.060
Right.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.010
OK, that's cool.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.370
Which of the following numbers
can be used to show that the

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.070
statement above is false?

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.760
So they're saying all numbers
that are divisible by both 2

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:53.470
and 6-- so this is what the
statement is saying.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.700
Then it means that you're
going to be

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.320
divisible by 4, right?

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.580
So we want to prove that this
statement is wrong.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.750
So what we have to find is, some
number that is divisible

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:09.720
by 2 and 6, that's not
divisible by 4.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.210
And we could actually just
look at the choices.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:19.150
They give us some choices,
4, 8, 12, 18, 24.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.810
Well, 4 isn't even divisible
by 2 and 6, so

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.750
that doesn't work.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.010
8 isn't even divisible by 2 and
6, so that doesn't work.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.020
12 is divisible by 2 and 6, but
it's also divisible by 4,

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.400
so it doesn't disprove
this statement.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.210
So, you can't say that.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.900
18 is divisible by
2 and 6, right?

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.470
Is it divisible by 4?

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.590
No.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.230
So this is our answer.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.700
The example 18 is an example of
a number divisble by 2 and

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.880
6, and is not divisible by 4.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.600
So this proves that this is
an incorrect statement.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.850
Number 4.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.640
In the figure above, let me draw
this figure above, and

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.890
I'll switch colors.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.340
This is my rectangle, and then
there's going to be a circle.

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:20.330
I have a shaky hand.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.040
The circle looks something
like that.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:37.490
OK, and then we have side
B, A, C, and D.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.810
It says, in the figure above,
the circle is tangent to sides

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.790
BC and AD-- tangent means
it just touches

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.960
at one point, right?

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.820
of the 8 by 12 rectangle ABCD.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.800
So they're saying this is
an 8 by 12 rectangle.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.160
And is it's approxmately drawn--
well can assume that

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.890
this is going to be the 8 side
and this is the 12 side

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.650
because it's longer.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.290
What is the area
of the circle?

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.700
Well, what's the formula
for area of a circle?

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.476
Its area is equal to pi r
squared, where r is the radius

00:07:11.476 --> 00:07:13.010
of the circle.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.830
So let's draw that radius
of the circle.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.765
So the radius of the circle is
going to be this line right

00:07:18.765 --> 00:07:20.015
here, right?

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.040
That's the radius, which
is half the diameter.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.720
Well, what's the diameter?

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.030
Well, the diameter is
this whole length.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.030
So the diameter is 8, right?

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.150
So the radius is going
to be half of 8.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.080
So we know the radius
is 4, and then we

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.030
just use the formula.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.580
We know this is going to be 4
because this is also 4, right?

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.810
This is also 4, because
its side is 8.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.580
This top side could have been
12 billion units wide and it

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.230
wouldn't have mattered, right?

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:57.640
So we know the radius is 4, so
we say, area is equal to pi

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.450
times 4 squared.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:07.680
Area is equal to 16 pi,
and that is choice A.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.540
All right, the next problem
looks like it's more involved,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.500
and I only have two minutes left
in this video, so I will

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.090
do it in the next video.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.550
I'll see you soon.
