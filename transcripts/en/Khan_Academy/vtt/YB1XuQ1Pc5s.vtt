00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.530
A photo finishing store charges
customers a rate of

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.970
$0.29 per photo to
print pictures.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.140
For new customers, the
store offers a

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.740
one-time discount of $3.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.850
Write a function representing
the amount that a new customer

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.020
would have to pay to have x
number of photos printed.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.590
So x is the number of
photos printed.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.190
So just a regular customer would
have to pay the number

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.040
of photos times $0.29 a photo.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.290
So if we just said, let y be
the amount that a customer

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.580
would have to pay, a regular
customer would have to pay x

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.640
times $0.29 per photo.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.750
So we'd write 0.29-- we could
put the dollar sign there if

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.490
you want-- or 0.29-- we're
assuming everything is

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.590
dollars-- x.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.080
That's how much a regular
customer would have to pay.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.525
But they're asking us a first
time, a new customer.

00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:58.830
And they say that the new
customer gets a one-time

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.520
discount of $3.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.040
So a new customer will
pay this minus $3.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.260
So this right here is pretty
much a simplified version of a

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.020
function that would describe
what a new customer would pay.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.400
If you wanted to get fancy,
this is a little bit

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.850
inaccurate when the customer
ordered less than 10 photos

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.540
because, let's say the customer
orders 10 photos.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.300
Then x is going to be 10 times
$0.29 is $2.90 minus 3 is

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.790
negative $0.10.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.960
The customer is not going to
pay negative $0.10, which

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.760
would be like the store paying
them $0.10 for them to print

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.390
10 photos, the customer's not
going to pay anything.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.110
So what we could do if we wanted
to make this a little

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:57.740
bit fancier, we could say that a
new customer would pay-- and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:10.110
then we can say that's y, so y
is equal to 0.29x minus 3 if x

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.420
is greater than 10, if the
guy or the gal orders

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.160
more than 10 photos.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.100
It's 0 otherwise.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.880
Then they don't pay anything.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.760
If it's less than 10 photos,
they pay nothing.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.090
It's not like the store's going
to pay them, because if

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.640
you're less than 10, or 10 or
less, actually, then this is

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.750
going to become negative and
we don't want a situation

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.260
where it's negative.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.340
So they're either going to pay
nothing, but if they get more

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.600
than 10 photos, then they're
going to pay based on this

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.800
function right there.
