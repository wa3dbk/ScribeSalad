00:00:00.665 --> 00:00:02.331
- [Voiceover] So, in the last video,

00:00:02.331 --> 00:00:04.038
I introduced the vector form of

00:00:04.038 --> 00:00:05.745
the multivariable chain rule

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:07.045
and just to remind ourselves,

00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:09.361
I'm saying you have
some kind of function f,

00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:10.661
and in this case I said it comes from

00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:13.831
a 100 dimensional space,
so you might imagine--

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:16.066
Well, I can't imagine a
100 dimensional space,

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.397
but in principle, you're just thinking

00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:20.437
of some area that's 100 dimensions,

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.810
it can be two if you wanted to think

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.557
more concretely in two dimensions.

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:25.751
And it's a scalar valued function

00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:28.027
so it just outputs to a number line,

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:29.733
some kind of number line that I'll think

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.566
of as f as its output.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.608
And what we're gonna do is we compose it

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:36.990
with a vector valued function

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.087
so some function that
takes in a single number t

00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:43.279
and then outputs into that
super high dimensional space.

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:45.839
So you're thinking, you go
from the single variable t

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.952
to some very high dimensional space

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:49.944
that we think of as full of vectors,

00:00:49.944 --> 00:00:53.750
and then you take from that
over to a single variable,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.908
over to a number.

00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:57.452
And you know, the way you'd write that out

00:00:57.452 --> 00:01:00.581
is you'd say f composed
with the output of v,

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:02.748
so f composed with v of t,

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:07.570
and what we're interested in
doing is taking its derivative.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.715
So the derivative of that composition is--

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:13.788
and I told you and we
kind of walked through

00:01:13.788 --> 00:01:16.591
where this come from, the gradient of f,

00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:20.758
evaluated at v of t, evaluated
at your original output,

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:24.872
that product, with the derivative of v,

00:01:24.872 --> 00:01:27.963
the vectorized derivative,
and what that means, you know,

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:31.202
for v, you're just taking the
derivative of every component.

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:33.722
So when you take this and
you take the derivative

00:01:33.722 --> 00:01:37.054
with respect to t, all that means is

00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:40.955
that each component, you're
taking the derivative of it.

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:44.246
The x1 dt, the x2 dt, on and on until d

00:01:44.246 --> 00:01:47.579
and then the one hundredth component dt.

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.007
So this was the vectorized form

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:54.649
of the multivariable chain rule.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.315
And what I wanna do here is show

00:01:56.315 --> 00:02:00.541
how this looks a lot like
a directional derivative.

00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.800
And if you haven't watched the video

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.995
on the directional derivative,
maybe go back, take a look,

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.392
kind of remind yourself, but in principle,

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.668
you say, if you're in
the input space of f,

00:02:08.668 --> 00:02:13.260
and you nudge yourself
along some kind of vector v,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.722
and maybe just because I'm using v there,

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:17.567
I'll instead say some kind of vector w.

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.273
So not a function, just a vector.

00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:21.508
And you're wondering, hey,
how much does that result

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:24.149
in a change to the output of f,

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.100
that's answered by the
directional derivative

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.985
and you'd write directional derivative

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:32.033
in the direction of w of f,

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:33.821
the directional derivative of f,

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:36.584
and I should say at some
point, some input point,

00:02:36.584 --> 00:02:38.981
p for that input point and
it's a vector in this case,

00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:41.544
like a 100 dimensional vector.

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:43.077
And the way you evaluate it,

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:45.556
is you take the gradient of f,

00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:48.278
this is why we use the nabla
notation in the first place,

00:02:48.278 --> 00:02:50.229
it's an indicative of how we compute it,

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.967
the gradient of f evaluated
at that same input point,

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:55.836
the same input vector p.

00:02:55.836 --> 00:02:58.374
So here, just to be clear,
you'd be thinking of

00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:02.370
whatever vector to your
input point, that's p.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.873
But then the nudge, the nudge away

00:03:03.873 --> 00:03:06.515
from that input point is w.

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:08.587
And you take the dot product

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:11.800
between that and the vector itself,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.917
the vector that represents
your nudge direction.

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:15.771
But that looks a lot like

00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:17.518
the multivariable chain rule up here,

00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:20.647
except instead of w, you're
taking the derivative,

00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:22.679
the vector value derivative of v,

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.466
so this whole thing you could say

00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:27.480
is the directional derivative
in the direction of

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.406
the derivative of t, and
that's kind of confusing.

00:03:31.406 --> 00:03:34.585
Directional derivative in the
direction of a derivative,

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:38.790
of f, and what point are you taking this,

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.223
at what point are you taking
this directional derivative?

00:03:41.223 --> 00:03:44.636
Well, it's wherever the output of v is.

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:47.608
So this is very compact,
it's saying quite a bit here.

00:03:47.608 --> 00:03:49.910
But a way that you could
be thinking about this,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.493
is v of t, so I'm gonna
kind of erase here.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:59.584
V of t has you zooming all about

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:03.473
and as you shift t, it kind of moves you

00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:05.708
through this space in some way.

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:07.333
And each one of these output points here

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:11.000
represents the vector,
v of t at some point,

00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:16.517
the derivative of that, what
does this derivative represent?

00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:18.874
That's the tangent vector to that motion,

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:21.202
you know, so you're zipping
about through that space,

00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:22.644
the tangent vector to your motion,

00:04:22.644 --> 00:04:25.727
that's how we interpret v prime of t,

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:32.787
the derivative of v with respect to t.

00:04:32.787 --> 00:04:34.225
I mean why should that make sense?

00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:36.135
Why should the directional derivative

00:04:36.135 --> 00:04:38.451
in the direction of v prime of t,

00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:41.865
this change to the
intermediary function v,

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:45.115
have anything to do with the
multivariable chain rule?

00:04:45.115 --> 00:04:46.985
Well, remember what
we're asking when we say

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:50.308
dt of this composition is we're saying

00:04:50.308 --> 00:04:54.177
we take a tiny nudge to t,
so that tiny change here,

00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:56.313
in the value t, and we're wondering

00:04:56.313 --> 00:04:59.401
what changed that result
in after the composition?

00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:02.490
Well, at a given point,
that tiny nudge in t

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.187
causes a change in the
direction of v prime of t.

00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:07.284
That's kind of the whole meaning

00:05:07.284 --> 00:05:08.991
of this vector value derivative.

00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:11.957
You change t by a little bit,
and that's gonna tell you

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:14.274
how you move in the output space.

00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:16.346
But then you say, "Okay,
so I've moved a little bit

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:18.621
"in this intermediary
100 dimensional space,

00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:21.263
"how does that influence the output of f

00:05:21.263 --> 00:05:22.685
"based on the behavior of just

00:05:22.685 --> 00:05:24.432
"the multivariable function f?"

00:05:24.432 --> 00:05:27.317
Well, that's what the
directional derivative is asking.

00:05:27.317 --> 00:05:30.324
It says you take a nudge in
the direction of some vector,

00:05:30.324 --> 00:05:32.641
in this case, I wrote
v prime of t over here.

00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:34.826
More generally, you
could say any vector w,

00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:36.492
you take a nudge in that direction.

00:05:36.492 --> 00:05:38.077
And more importantly, you know,

00:05:38.077 --> 00:05:40.271
the size of v prime of t matters here.

00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:42.059
If you're moving really
quickly, you would expect

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:44.009
that change to be larger, so the fact

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.473
that v prime of t would
be larger is helpful.

00:05:47.473 --> 00:05:49.405
And the directional
derivative is telling you

00:05:49.405 --> 00:05:52.575
the size of the change in f as a ratio

00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:56.557
of the proportion of
that directional vector

00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:58.385
that you went along. Right?

00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:00.661
You could--another notation
for the directional derivative

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:03.755
is to say partial f, and then partial

00:06:03.755 --> 00:06:05.732
whatever that vector is.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:08.007
Basically saying you
take size of that nudge

00:06:08.007 --> 00:06:11.636
along that vector as a
proportion of the vector itself,

00:06:11.636 --> 00:06:13.960
and then you consider
the change to the output

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.376
and you're taking the ratio.

00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:17.530
So I think this is a very
beautiful way of understanding

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.050
the multivariable chain rule.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.756
Cause it give this image of, you know,

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.260
you're thinking of v of
t, and you're thinking

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.722
of zipping along in some way,

00:06:24.722 --> 00:06:26.917
and the direction and
value of your velocity

00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:28.948
as you zip along is what determines

00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:31.590
the change in the output
of the function f.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.459
So hopefully, that helps
give a better understanding

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.247
both of the directional derivative

00:06:35.247 --> 00:06:37.319
and of the multivariable chain rule.

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.540
It's one of those nice
little interpretations.
