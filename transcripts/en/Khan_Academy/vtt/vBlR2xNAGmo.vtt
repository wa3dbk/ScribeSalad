00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.345
In the last video we got as far as figuring out that the area of this Koch snowflake

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:10.004
This thing that has an infinite perimeter, can be expressed as this infinite sum over here

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:15.206
So our job in this video is to try to simplify this, and hopefully get a finite value

00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:19.721
Let's do our best to actually simplify this thing right over here

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:24.355
So the easiest part of this thing to simplify is this right over here

00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:25.806
So let's just focus on that

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:29.426
Then if we can get a value for this part that I am bracketing off

00:00:29.426 --> 00:00:32.731
Then we can just place that value here and simplify the rest of it

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:42.112
So what I've just bracketed off can be re-written as three times four ninths

00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:45.974
plus four ninths squared

00:00:45.974 --> 00:00:51.774
plus four ninths to the third power

00:00:51.774 --> 00:00:53.791
And you can go on and on and on

00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:59.910
Plus four ninths to every other power, all the way through infinity!

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.810
Lucky for us, there is a way to figure out this infinite (geometric) series

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.395
There's a way to figure this out, and I've done several videos where we prove the general thing

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:16.164
But I'll just do it by hand this time, just so that we don't have to resort to some magical formulas

00:01:16.164 --> 00:01:21.808
So let's say that we define some sum, this one over here (let's call it S)

00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:27.281
Let's say that S is equal to what we have in parentheses over here

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:35.241
It's going to be equal to four ninths, plus four ninths squared, plus four ninths to the third

00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:38.748
all the way to infinity

00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:50.264
Now let's also say that we multiply S by four ninths

00:01:50.264 --> 00:01:56.299
What's four ninths S going to look like?

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.051
So then, I'm just essentially multiplying every term here by four ninths

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:03.404
So if I take this first term and multiply it by four ninths, what am I going to get?

00:02:03.404 --> 00:02:07.719
Well I'm going to get four ninths squared

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:15.323
If I take the second term and multiply it by four ninths, I'm going to get four ninths to the third power

00:02:15.323 --> 00:02:17.283
And we are going to go all the way to infinity

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:18.650
So this is interesting

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.281
When I multiply four ninths times this I get all of the terms here except for this first four ninths

00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:30.633
Now, this is kind of the magic of how we can actually find the sum of an infinite geometric series

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:37.173
We can subtract this term right over here (this pink line) from this green line

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:41.805
If we do that, clearly this is equal to that and this is equal to that

00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:45.951
So if we subtract this from that its equivalent to subtracting the pink from the green

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:58.715
So we get S minus four ninths S is equal to...

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:04.880
Well, every other term, this guy minus this guy is going to cancel out

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.066
And that's going to happen all the way to infinity

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:17.299
and on the right hand side you're only going to be left with this four ninths over here

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:25.787
Then this four ninths, we can (S is the same thing as nine over nine) write this as nine over nine S

00:03:25.787 --> 00:03:28.285
minus four ninths S is equal to four ninths

00:03:28.285 --> 00:03:32.714
So nine over nine minus four over nine of something gives us five over nine

00:03:32.714 --> 00:03:37.501
So this becomes five ninths S is equal to four ninths

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:41.881
Then to solve for S (and this is kind of magical but it's actually quite logical)

00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:50.182
Multiply both sides times the inverse of this, so times nine fifths on both sides

00:03:50.182 --> 00:03:54.867
These guys cancel out, and we get S is equal to four fifths

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:56.910
That's really neat!

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.796
We've just shown that this whole thing over here is equal to four fifths

00:04:04.796 --> 00:04:09.320
So this entire bracket that we did over here is equal to three times four fifths

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:19.918
This entire bracket is equal to twelve over five

00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:24.453
Now let's go to our original expression, so we don't lose track of what we are doing

00:04:24.453 --> 00:04:29.886
We have this square root of three times S squared over sixteen

00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:42.870
Then we have this four here plus the entire thing in brackets (which simplified to twelve fifths)

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:52.913
Just to add these two together we can rewrite four as twenty fifths

00:04:52.913 --> 00:04:58.105
and then twenty over five plus twelve over five is thirty-two over five

00:04:58.105 --> 00:05:05.703
Let me write that down over here

00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:07.907
This is the home stretch now, this is very exciting!

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:13.279
We are about to find the finite area of something that has an infinite perimeter!

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:21.233
So it's going to be square root of three times S squared over sixteen

00:05:21.233 --> 00:05:27.036
Times thirty-two over five

00:05:27.036 --> 00:05:35.031
We can divide the thirty-two in the numerator by the sixteen there, which gives two

00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:42.562
We are left with the area of a Koch snowflake

00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:49.928
(where the initial equalateral triangle that we started with has each of its sides as length S)

00:05:49.928 --> 00:06:10.712
is, two times the square root of three times S squared all over five

00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:18.608
For example, if that first equalateral triangle had a side-length of one

00:06:18.608 --> 00:06:28.181
Then the area of this crazy thing (that has an infinite perimeter) would just be two square roots of three over five

00:06:28.181 --> 99:59:59.999
Anyway, I think that's kind of cool
