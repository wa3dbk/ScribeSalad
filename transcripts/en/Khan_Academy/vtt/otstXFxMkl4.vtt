00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.140
In the last video, I touched
on the core weakness of

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.400
fractional reserve banking and
that's the idea of the bank

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.340
run-- where if you have a bunch
of banks and they've all

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.780
lent out 90% of their reserves--
let's say that

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.280
here's all my banks-- Bank One,
Bank Two, Bank Three--

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.010
and you could have
a ton of banks.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.700
I mean, you could imagine you
go all the way to Bank 100.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.810
The problem with a bank run is
if just even one bank all of a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.990
sudden isn't able to give its
depositors its money-- so it

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.470
is illiquid-- and we'll reserve
judgment as to whether

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.910
it is truly insolvent, but it
really just doesn't have the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.410
money to give it to depositors,
then all of the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.200
depositors of all of the other
banks get scared and run over

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.710
to the banks and ask for
their money back.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.920
And by definition, in a
fractional reserve banking

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.220
system, these guys only have
10% of their deposits as

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.910
reserves, 10% reserves.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.890
So if more than 10% of the
people ask for their money,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.140
they're all going
to be illiquid.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.410
Then you're going to have
just an all-out panic.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.000
You're going to have
an all-out panic of

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.180
the financial system.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.380
As soon as any of these guys'
loans come due-- so let me

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.410
draw one of their balance
sheets-- let's assume that

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.400
they were actually good
investors, which is a big

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.160
assumption, but let's say
that their balance

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.720
sheets look like this.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.140
Here's all of the deposits that
they owe to people-- to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.730
me and you.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.290
That's their liabilities.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.425
They have 10% of their assets
as actual currency reserves.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.470
And then the rest is loans
out to businesses

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.720
and whatever else.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.590
And that's an asset because
businesses owe them something.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.380
And what's going to happens--
as soon as there's a panic,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.840
everyone wants their
money out.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.635
The reserves are depleted
very quickly.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.419
And then these guys sit there
waiting for their money.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.560
Essentially it shuts
down the bank.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.710
As soon as these loans mature--
maybe this guy owed

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.670
his money in a year.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.270
Then they're going to say, just
give me the money back.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.120
I'm not going to renew the loan
even though you have a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.070
good business.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.790
And so everyone's going to want
their money back and the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.510
whole financial system's going
to break down and credit is

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.760
going to freeze.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.380
And this is a huge problem.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.040
Remember, this could be just
because by one bad actor who

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.010
couldn't manage their
liquidity properly.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.810
Even worse, it could be caused
just by one panicky

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.480
withdrawer.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.590
There's doesn't even have
to be a bad actor.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.160
It could just be some fear that
enters the system-- and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.750
even for a completely legitimate
bank-- and I'll use

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.150
legitimate in quotations
because we're assuming

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.350
legitimate-- because some
would debate whether

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.440
fractional reserve banking
is legitimate.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.190
But even if this is a completely
up-and-up bank, if

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.070
for whatever reason more than
10% of their deposits get

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.680
scared, then all of a sudden
they'll be illiquid and you'll

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.120
be in this all-out
panic condition.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.150
Now I talked in the last video,
some of the things that

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.260
have been engineered to
fix this problem.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.350
So these are the fixes.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.615
The first one is to have a
banker of last resort, a

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:23.865
lender of last resort.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.000
And that's our central bank--
or the Federal reserve bank.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.010
And they'll never run out of
reserves, because these

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.490
reserves can be borrowed from
them and all these are, are

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:53.230
IOUs from the Federal reserve.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.590
So what the Federal reserve
does-- and I've talked about

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.960
this in the past-- let's say
that their balance sheet

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.390
currently looks like this.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.000
Let's say that this is their
current liabilities.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.430
These are their current
assets.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.510
And their current
liabilities are

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.880
essentially going to be IOUs.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.420
These are going to be their
reserve notes, but let's say

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.830
someone else comes and says,
hey, federal reserve, lend me

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.355
some money.

00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:18.370
So what they're going to do is
that they're going to print

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.010
some-- so these are Federal
reserve notes.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.250
And then they're going to just
create an offsetting liability

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.240
and they have no
reserve limits.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.770
Let me make it a new color just
to ease the monotony.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.160
So they'll have this
corresponding notes

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.740
outstanding liability and
they're going to give those

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.030
notes to you.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.420
They're going to give those
notes to the bank that's in a

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.190
desperate situation if
it couldn't borrow

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.790
from any other bank.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.470
And so the Federal reserve
balance sheet will

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.240
now look like this.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.190
This is what it looked
like before.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.910
It has these new notes
outstanding and now this will

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.570
say-- instead of federal reserve
notes in its vaults,

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.510
it'll now have this little thing
on its books called loan

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.780
to the bank, loan to this guy
right here, which is an asset

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.760
because he owes him something.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.140
And there's no limit to
which the Federal

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.010
reserve could do this.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.910
Obviously there might be some
kind of implicit limit.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.590
If they keep doing this
arbitrarily, people might not

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.370
accept these Federal
reserve notes as

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.600
actually carrying value.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.940
So that's probably the main
limiting concern.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.280
And I'll probably talk more in
future videos on other things

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.030
that are kind of keeping the
Federal reserve from just

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.030
doing this willy-nilly, but the
general idea is that they

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.790
never run out.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.610
So this is one idea-- lender of
last resort, but not even

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.230
the Federal reserve wants to
keep doing this because what

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.870
if this guy is essentially
insolvent?

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:51.090
If these loans are actually
going bad, then there's no

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.210
reason that even the central
bank should actually be

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.700
lending to this guy.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.970
They shouldn't be lending
to this guy.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.990
So let's say the Federal reserve
looks at this guy's

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.180
books and say, you know what?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.240
These loans are really
worthless.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.060
I'm not going to lend
more money to you.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.510
What I'm going to do is take
you into receivership.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.450
And I haven't even talked
about what that is.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.090
That's the second fix.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:16.260
The second fix is to have this
notion of insurance, of

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.510
deposit insurance.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.700
So if a bank just has a
liquidity problem-- it's a

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:35.160
good bank-- it just ran out of
reserves and no other bank is

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.016
willing to lend to it-- which
you might debate whether it's

00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:40.010
even a good bank if the other
banks aren't willing to lend

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.170
to it-- then it can go to the
discount window at the Federal

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.230
reserve and borrow some
reserve notes.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.730
Now, in the situation where even
that's not good enough

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.590
and the bank is essentially out
of business, it had been

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:59.270
paying the FDIC a little bit of
money-- the Federal Deposit

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:05.560
Insurance Corporation-- a little
bit of money-- I mean,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.920
probably a lot of money by an
individual's point of view,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.720
but a little bit of money from
a bank's point of view-- and

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.440
it's a fraction of a percent--
a little bit of money every

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.400
year so that it could tell its
depositors, look, even in the

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.840
situation that our bank goes
bust, the Federal reserve is

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.310
going to pay you directly.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.530
These are FDIC bank accounts.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.190
The Federal reserve will make
you whole completely,

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.650
regardless of what happens
to the banks.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.300
Now this, to me, is a big fix.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.680
I mean, I'll tell you right now,
all of my savings right

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.180
now are in Federal deposit
insured-- FDIC

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.340
insured-- bank accounts.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.180
This might sound great to the
depositor, but what's the side

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.490
effect on the banking system?

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.890
Let me draw all of
my banks again.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:55.080
So I have Bank One, I have Bank
Two, I have Bank Three, I

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.120
have Bank Four.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.540
Now, they are all
FDIC insured.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.670
They pay some small fraction of
a percentage every year so

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.980
that they can tell their
depositors, look, if we ever

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.040
go bust, if we ever blow up
for whatever reason, your

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.570
deposits are 100% safe.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.810
And what's going to happen?

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.470
This will solve the bank
run problem, right?

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.040
Let's say for whatever reason
this guy runs out of reserves

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.660
or he goes bankrupt--
let's say that

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.720
this guy goes bankrupt.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.970
In the old situation, before the
insurance, everyone else

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.570
is going to get scared
and you're going

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.470
to have a bank run.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.990
They're going to ask for their
money and there's just not

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.260
going to be enough reserves
because they only keep a

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.600
fraction of the reserves.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.530
That's what fractional reserve
banking is, but now everyone's

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.870
going to feel comfortable,
like, you know what?

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.730
Everything is backed by the
Federal reserve, which can

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.340
print as many notes is
it wants so I'm just

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.010
going to sit pretty.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.580
So this does solve the
bank run problem.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.560
And so you might say, this
doesn't make it an unstable

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.500
equilibrium any more-- which
is kind of true, but

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.900
what does this do?

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.440
All of these guys are
now FDIC insured.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.540
I'm equally willing to give my
money to any of these guys.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.510
So I'm going to essentially
going to give my money to the

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:18.600
guy who gives me the highest
interest. And I've actually

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.820
done that with my personal
accounts.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.530
I've gone and I've seen which
bank provides the highest

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.210
interest and I've ignored how
they're investing their

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.300
money-- I mean, otherwise I'd
be pretty suspicious about a

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.190
bank offering more interest
because they're probably doing

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.870
something risky, but now I don't
care because I know it's

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.560
FDIC insured and even if that
bank blows up, I'm going to

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.960
get all my money back.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.890
So I might as well give my
deposit to the bank with the

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.270
highest interest.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.250
Now based on what you saw in
that last video, which is the

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.710
bank that's going to be giving
the highest interest?

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.920
What's going to be
the bank that's

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.240
taking on the most risk?

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.120
So once again, when you give
this relatively cheap

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:06.520
insurance to all of these banks
and all of these banks

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.390
can attract money much easier by
paying this insurance-- if

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.990
they didn't have this insurance,
they would have to

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.660
pay much more.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:19.130
Let's say this insurance
is 0.1% per year.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.080
If they didn't have this
insurance, they would have to

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.610
pay much more than 0.1% per
year to the depositor in

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.810
interest to make up for the risk
that they're taking on,

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.810
that they're not being backed
by the government.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.360
So it's a really good deal
for the depositor.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.530
Let's put it this way.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.690
When you give a deposit to
a bank, you're lending

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.970
money to the bank.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.130
So your checking deposit rate--
so let me write this

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:50.840
down-- your checking deposit
interest rate is the same

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.050
thing as the bank's borrowing
cost, right?

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.750
When I go to some bank and
they're paying me 2% a year,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:04.600
that's the bank's borrowing
cost. They're the same thing.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.220
Now if the bank didn't have FDIC
insurance, it wouldn't

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.620
have to pay 0.1% a year, but it
would have to give me more

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.500
interest. It would have to pay
me 3% or 4%, probably more,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.910
because I'd say this
is a risky bank--

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.110
or it's more risky.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.680
Any bank would be more risky
than someone who can

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.120
print out the notes.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.020
So it would have to pay more,
but now it can just pay 0.1% a

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:32.240
year or whatever the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.810
pays it, but it's going to lower
to FDIC, but the main

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.000
side effect of this is it's
going to lower what it has to

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.340
pay the depositors because the
depositors say, this is a lot

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.850
safer than what I thought.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:54.560
So it's going to lower
borrowing costs by

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.420
much more than 0.1%.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.290
So it's a really good deal
for the bank and it's an

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.000
especially good deal for the
ultra-risky banks who might

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.030
have to pay a little bit more,
but because they can now do

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.810
super duper risky things.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.480
You say, hey, but this
is insurance.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.820
The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation isn't stupid.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.310
It should just charge more
for riskier banks.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.590
But I guess the rebuttal to
that is that's easier said

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:26.860
than done because when times are
good, like in the '20s or

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:32.520
during the housing bubble,
you get hidden risk.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.360
So you don't know who's
taking on the risk.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.050
It's usually the person who's
getting the highest returns,

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.280
but if they're always good for
it, you don't see it and that

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.545
person just looks
like a genius.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.780
And then when times are
bad, that guy blows

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.200
up, but guess what?

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.690
He's not on the line for it.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.040
It's the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, who all

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.200
along was probably

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.720
undercharging for that insurance.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.090
I want to make one last
point about this.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.010
It's called insurance.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.385
It's the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.970
And I want to point out the
difference between financial

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.230
insurance-- and you could
watch my video on credit

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.380
default swaps, which is another
form of financial

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.830
insurance-- between financial
insurance and what we normally

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.660
associate with insurance.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.890
If I have car insurance-- let's
say I'm a car insurance

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.060
person and I agree-- let's say
that they are Driver One--

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.180
let's say I have a bunch of
drivers-- so Driver One,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:36.210
Driver Two, Driver Three,
Driver Four.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.230
And I know that in any given
year, they each have a 10%

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.050
chance of an accident.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.860
That's a lot higher than
reality, but we'll make the

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.750
numbers easy.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:53.620
And if there is an accident,
it will cost me $10,000.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.190
So I could go to Driver One and
say, look, there's a 10%

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.510
chance you're going to
have an accident.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.770
It would cost $10,000
if you do.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.450
So I'm going to charge
you-- the fair

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.330
price would be $1,000.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.760
I'll charge you $1,100.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.040
I'll charge $1,100 just so I
can make a little bit of a

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.760
profit, right?

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.600
What you would charge is $1,000
if you wanted to break

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.060
even, but I'll charge $1,100--
and I might do this more than

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.780
just four drivers.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.670
I might do it with
4,000 drivers.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:23.530
So on average in any given
year-- let's say I have one

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:30.140
million drivers-- in any given
year, how much am I

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:30.740
going to bring in?

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.310
I'm going to bring in a million
times $1,100, which

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:37.510
is-- I'm going to get $1.1
billion in input, or in

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.980
revenue, from people paying
their premiums. And how much

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.310
am I going to have to pay out?

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.670
Well, roughly 10% if you believe
these statistics are

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.300
going to have an accident.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.330
So that means that 100,000 are
going to have an accident.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.220
Each of those 100,000
accidents are

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.300
going to cost me $10,000.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.830
$10,000 times $100,000.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.200
I'm going to have to pay out $1
billion for the accidents.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.110
So I will net every year-- if my
actuaries did their job, I

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.840
will net $100 million
every year.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.340
And this works out pretty good
assuming these statistics are

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.130
right and people are willing to
pay the premium because if

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.690
you have enough drivers-- like
a million drivers-- the

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.190
statistics really hold.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.530
In any given year, the chance
of 20% of the drivers having

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.040
an accident is very,
very, very-- almost

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.310
infinitesimally small.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.790
It's almost zero.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.140
And one driver having an
accident doesn't make it more

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.770
or less likely that another
driver will have an accident

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.480
when you're talking
about on the order

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.860
of a million drivers.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.030
And that's true of health
insurance and everything else.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.260
It's just purely probabilistic
and if you have enough people

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.070
insured, the statistics
can actually hold up.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.040
Now with financial
insurance, you

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.010
have a different situation.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:57.220
You might say, look, in any
given year, on average, the

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:03.100
FDIC might say, look, only-- I
don't know-- one out of out of

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.410
1,000 banks fail.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.200
So there's a 0.1% chance
of failure.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.260
Of course it'll capture back
some money because it'll have

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.030
some assets on average.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.700
But the reality is that when
times go bad, the bank

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.210
failures tend to be correlated
because they're all

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:18.370
interlinked.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.680
And I've done a lot-- one
might be lending to some

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.520
business that's dependent on
some business that this guy's

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.350
lending to.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.200
The whole financial system
is all linked up.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.990
So the failures aren't-- they
all correlate with each other.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.360
They're not independent
events.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.870
So if one bank fails, it's much
more likely that other

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.740
banks are going to fail all
at the same time and we're

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.580
experiencing that right now.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.550
So you can't really follow the
insurance model because the

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.800
statistics really don't apply.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.800
You can do this insurance model
when each of the events

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.350
that you're insuring are
uncorrelated, but when all the

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.940
events that you're insuring are
likely to all happen at

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.270
the same time, what you're going
to have is-- when times

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:02.220
are good, you're going to see a
much lower kind of loss rate

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.430
and then when times are bad, all
of your guys are going to

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.200
blow up and you're essentially
on the hook

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:06.950
for all these people.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.410
We see that right now and the
FDIC is actually-- it's going

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.050
to have to go back to Congress,
I'm 100% sure, and

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.890
ask for more money and it's we
the taxpayers that are going

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.910
to be on the line for
this type of thing.
