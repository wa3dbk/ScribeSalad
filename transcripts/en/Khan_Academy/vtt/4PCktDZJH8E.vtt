00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.240
 

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.570
You now know what a
transformation is, so let's

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:10.120
introduce a special kind of
transformation called a linear

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.450
transformation.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.940
It only makes sense that we have
something called a linear

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.400
transformation because we're
studying linear algebra.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.530
We already had linear
combinations so we might as

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.370
well have a linear
transformation.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.110
And a linear transformation,
by definition, is a

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.730
transformation-- which we
know is just a function.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.260
We could say it's from the set
rn to rm -- It might be

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.080
obvious in the next video why
I'm being a little bit

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.930
particular about that, although
they are just

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.540
arbitrary letters -- where
the following two

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.800
things have to be true.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.490
So something is a linear
transformation if and only if

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.870
the following thing is true.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.140
Let's say that we have
two vectors.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.990
Say vector a and let's
say vector b, are

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.780
both members of rn.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.820
So they're both in our domain.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.660
So then this is a linear
transformation if and only if

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.070
I take the transformation of
the sum of our two vectors.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.080
If I add them up first, that's
equivalent to taking the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.900
transformation of each of the
vectors and then summing them.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.100
That's my first condition
for this to be a linear

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.840
transformation.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.280
And the second one is, if I take
the transformation of any

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.420
scaled up version of a vector
-- so let me just multiply

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.550
vector a times some scalar
or some real number c .

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.490
If this is a linear
transformation then this

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.500
should be equal to c times
the transformation of a.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.080
That seems pretty
straightforward.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.940
Let's see if we can apply these
rules to figure out if

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.100
some actual transformations
are linear or not.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.790
So let me define a
transformation.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.800
Let's say that I have the
transformation T.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:10.199
Part of my definition I'm going
to tell you, it maps

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.500
from r2 to r2.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.710
 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.060
So if you give it a
2-tuple, right?

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.270
Its domain is 2-tuple.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.230
So you give it an x1 and an x2
let's say it maps to, so this

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:36.260
will be equal to, or it's
associated with x1 plus x2.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.490
And then let's just say it's 3
times x1 is the second tuple.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.330
Or we could have written this
more in vector form.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.950
This is kind of our
tuple form.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.710
We could have written it -- and
it's good to see all the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.500
different notations that you
might encounter -- you could

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.390
write it a transformation of
some vector x, where the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.970
vector looks like
this, x1, x2.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.610
Let me put a bracket there.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.230
It equals some new vector,
x1 plus x2.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.930
And then the second component
of the new

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.160
vector would be 3x1.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.880
That's a completely legitimate
way to express our

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.450
transformation.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.490
And a third way, which I never
see, but to me it kind of

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.760
captures the essence of what
a transformation is.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.200
It's just a mapping or
it's just a function.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.640
We could say that the
transformation is a mapping

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.470
from any vector in r2 that looks
like this: x1, x2, to--

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.620
and I'll do this notation-- a
vector that looks like this.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.710
x1 plus x2 and then 3x1.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.770
All of these statements
are equivalent.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.870
But our whole point of writing
this is to figure out whether

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.420
T is linearly independent.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.590
Sorry, not linearly
independent.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.250
Whether it's a linear
transformation.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.240
I was so obsessed with linear
independence for so many

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.260
videos, it's hard to get it out
of my brain in this one.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.560
Whether it's a linear
transformation.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.530
So let's test our
two conditions.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.070
I have them up here.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.230
So let's take T of, let's say
I have two vectors a and b.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.660
They're members of r2.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.530
So let me write it.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:23.570
A is equal to a1, a2, and
b is equal to b1, b2.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.795
Sorry that's not a vector.

00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:26.630
I have to make sure that
those are scalars.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.100
These are the components
of a vector.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.060
And b2.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.670
So what is a1 plus b?

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.110
Sorry, what is vector
a plus vector b?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.970
Brain's malfunctioning.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.590
All right.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.750
Well, you just add up
their components.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.010
This is the definition
of vector addition.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.290
So it's a1 plus b1.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.270
Add up the first components.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.800
And the second components is
just the sum of each of the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.220
vector's second compnents.
a2 plus b2.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.340
Nothing new here.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.990
But what is the transformation
of this vector?

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.280
So the transformation of vector
a plus vector b, we

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.640
could write it like this.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.740
That would be the same thing as
the transformation of this

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:16.520
vector, which is just a1
plus b1 and a2 plus b2.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.670
Which we know it equals
a vector.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.820
It equals this vector.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.490
Or what we do is for the first
component here, we add up the

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.930
two components on this side.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.150
So the first component here
is going to be these

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.220
two guys added up.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.630
So it's a1 plus a2
plus b1 plus b2.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.280
And then the second component
by our transformation or

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.410
function definition is just 3
times the first component in

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.810
our domain, I guess
you could say.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.000
So it's 3 times the first one.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.130
So it's going to be 3 times
this first guy.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.270
So it's 3a1 plus 3b1.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.320
Fair enough.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.810
Now what is the transformation
individually of a and b?

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.710
So the transformation of a is
equal to the transformation of

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.340
a -- let me write it this
way -- is equal to the

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.500
transformation of a1
a2 in brackets.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.020
That's another way of
writing vector a.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.200
And what is that equal to?

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.770
That's our definition of our
transformation right up here,

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:28.040
so this is going to be equal to
the vector a1 plus a2 and

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.655
then 3 times a1.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.290
It just comes straight out
of the definition.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.450
I essentially just replaced
an x with a's.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.410
By the same argument, what
is the transformation

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.650
of our vector b?

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.520
Well, it's just going to be the
same thing with the a's

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.370
replaced by the b's.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.880
So the transformation of our
vector b is going to be -- b

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.050
is just b1 b2 -- so it's
going to be b1 plus b2.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.550
And then the second component in
the transformation will be

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.300
3 times b1.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.090
Now, what is the transformation
of vector a

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.390
plus the transformation
of vector b?

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.795
Well, it's this vector
plus that vector.

00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:11.200
And what is that equal to?

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.790
Well, this is just pure vector
addition so we just add up

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.910
their components.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:21.300
So it's a1 plus a2
plus b1 plus b2.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.010
That's just that component
plus that component.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.040
The second component is 3a1 and
we're going to add it to

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.950
that second component.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.810
So it's 3a1 plus 3b1.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.790
Now, we just showed you that if
I take the transformations

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.940
separately of each of the
vectors and then add them up,

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.530
I get the exact same thing as
if I took the vectors and

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.210
added them up first and then
took the transformation.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.130
So we've met our
first criteria.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.990
That the transformation of the
sum of the vectors is the same

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.900
thing as the sum of the
transformations.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.120
Now let's see if this works
with a random scalar.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.700
So we know what the

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.180
transformation of a looks like.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.970
What does ca look like,
first of all?

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.340
I guess that's a good
place to start.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.810
c times our vector a is going
to be equal to c times a1.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.740
And then c times a2.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.280
That's our definition of scalar

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.530
multiplication time's a vector.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.740
So what's our transformation --
let me go to a new color.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.890
What is our -- let me do a color
I haven't used in a long

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:23.980
time, white.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.530
What is our transformation
of ca going to be?

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:37.179
Well, that's the same thing as
our transformation of ca1, ca2

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.649
which is equal to a new vector,
where the first term

00:08:40.649 --> 00:08:44.720
-- let's go to our definition
-- is you sum the first and

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.470
second components.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.550
And then the second term is 3
times the first component.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.820
So our first term
you sum them.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.470
So it's going to be
ca1 plus ca2.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.770
And then our second term
is 3 times our first

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.020
term, so it's 3ca1.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.810
 

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.190
Now, what is this equal to?

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.890
This is the same thing.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.350
We can view it as factoring
out the c.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:10.640
This the same thing as c times
the vector a1 plus a2.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.460
And then the second
component is 3a1.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.120
But this thing right here,
we already saw.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.460
This is the same thing as
the transformation of a.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.530
So just like that, you see that
the transformation of c

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.510
times our vector a, for any
vector a in r2 -- anything in

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.340
r2 can be represented this way
-- is the same thing as c

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.290
times the transformation of a.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:38.010
So we've met our second
condition, that when you when

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.030
you -- well I just stated it, so
I don't have to restate it.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:46.560
So we meet both conditions,
which tells us that this is a

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.170
linear transformation.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.390
And you might be thinking,
OK, Sal, fair enough.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.480
How do I know that all
transformations aren't linear

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.240
transformations?

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.760
Show me something
that won't work.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.940
And here I'll do a very
simple example.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.190
Let me define my
transformation.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:10.270
 

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:15.040
Well, I'll do it from r2
to r2 just to kind

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.970
of compare the two.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.150
I could have done it from r to r
if wanted a simpler example.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.120
But I'm going to define
my transformation.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:28.690
Let's say, my transformation
of the vector x1, x2.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:36.710
Let's say it is equal to
x1 squared and then

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.890
0, just like that.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.770
Let me see if this is a
linear transformation.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.510
So the first question
is, what's my

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.330
transformation of a vector a?

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:53.530
So my transformation of a vector
a-- where a is just the

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.770
same a that I did before--
it would look like this.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.970
It would look like a1 squared
and then a 0.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:05.330
Now, what would be my
transformation if I

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.380
took c times a?

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:14.540
Well, this is the same thing as
c times a1 and c times a2.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.920
And by our transformation
definition -- sorry, the

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.700
transformation of c times this
thing right here, because I'm

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.380
taking the transformation
on both sides.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.100
And by our transformation
definition this will just be

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.290
equal to a new vector that
would be in our codomain,

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.390
where the first term is
just the first term

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.770
of our input squared.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.940
So it's ca1 squared.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.020
And the second term is 0.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.080
What is this equal to?

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.090
Let me switch colors.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:48.130
This is equal to c squared
a1 squared and

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.880
this is equal to 0.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:57.720
Now, if we can assume that c
does not equal 0, this would

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.280
be equal to what?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.310
Actually, it doesn't
even matter.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.150
We don't even have to make
that assumption.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.780
So this is the same thing.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:12.130
This is equal to c squared times
the vector a1 squared 0.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.460
Which is equal to what?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.750
This expression right here
is a transformation of a.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.880
So this is equal to c squared
times the transformation of a.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.130
Let me do it in the
same color.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.610
 

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.810
So what I've just showed
you is, if I take the

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.000
transformation of a vector being
multiplied by a scalar

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.590
quantity first, that that's
equal to -- for this T, for

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.690
this transformation that I've
defined right here -- c

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.650
squared times the transformation
of a.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:48.220
And clearly this statement right
here, or this choice of

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:54.510
transformation, conflicts with
this requirement for a linear

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.510
transformation.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.540
If I have a c here I should
see a c here.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.160
But in our case, I have
a c here and I

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.840
have a c squared here.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.370
So clearly this negates
that statement.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:14.550
So this is not a linear
transformation.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.660
And just to get a gut feel
if you're just looking at

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.710
something, whether it's going to
be a linear transformation

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.910
or not, if the transformation
just involves linear

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.890
combinations of the different
components of the inputs,

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.200
you're probably dealing with
a linear transformation.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.910
If you start seeing things where
the components start

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.130
getting multiplied by each
other or you start seeing

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.870
squares or exponents, you're
probably not dealing with a

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.950
linear transformation.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.800
And then there's some functions
that might be in a

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.010
bit of a grey area, but it
tends to be just linear

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.500
combinations are going to lead
to a linear transformation.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.340
But hopefully that gives you
a good sense of things.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.060
And this leads up to what I
think is one of the neatest

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.680
outcomes, in the next video.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.180
