00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.120
Let's do one more homogeneous
differential equation, or

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.190
first order homogeneous
differential equation, to

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.530
differentiate it from the
homogeneous linear

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.810
differential equations
we'll do later.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.040
But anyway, the problem
we have here.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.110
It's the derivative of y with
respect to x is equal to--

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.550
that x looks like a
y-- is equal to x

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.090
squared plus 3y squared.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.312
I'm writing it a little
bit small, so that I

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:31.970
don't run out of space.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.670
Divided by 2xy.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.270
So in all of these homogeneous
equations-- and obviously, we

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.370
don't know it's homogeneous
yet.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.440
So we have to try to write
it as a function of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.910
y divided by x.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.930
So it looks like we could do
that, if we divide the top and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.110
the bottom by x squared.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.450
So if we just multiply-- let
me do it in a different

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.370
color-- 1 over x squared,
or x to the negative 2,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.240
over 1 over x squared.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.370
We're essentially just
multiplying by 1.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.860
And then, that is
equal to what?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:11.370
1 plus 3y squared over x squared
divided by 2-- if you

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.110
divide x, divide by x squared,
you just get a 1 over x-- so 2

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.610
times y over x.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.730
Or we could just rewrite the
whole thing, and this is just

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:27.930
equal to 1 plus 3y over
x squared divided by 2

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.260
times y over x.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.840
So yes, this is a homogeneous
equation.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.260
Because we were able to write
it as a function of

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.490
y divided by x.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.570
So now, we can do the
substitution with v.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.200
And hopefully, this is starting
to become a little

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.750
bit of second nature to you.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.610
So we can make the substitution
that v is equal

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.720
to y over x, or another way of
writing that is that y is

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.660
equal to xv.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.150
And then, of course, the
derivative of y with respect

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.130
to x, or if we take the
derivative with respect to x

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.100
of both sides of this, that's
equal to the derivative of x

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.060
is 1 times v, this is just the
product rule, plus x times the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.050
derivative of v with
respect to x.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.545
And now, we can substitute the
derivative of y with respect

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:13.490
to x is just this.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.270
And then the right hand side
of the equation is this.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.360
But we can substitute
v for y over x.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.230
So let's do that.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.180
And so we get v plus x.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.020
Instead of dv [? dv ?]

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.570
x, I'll write v prime for now,
just so that I don't take up

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.150
too much space.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.420
v prime is equal to 1 plus 3v
squared, we're making the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.475
substitution v is equal
to y over x.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.140
All of that over 2v.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.290
Now, let's see what we can do.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.970
This is where we just get our
algebra hat on, and try to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.990
simplify until it's a separable
equation in v.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.860
So let's do that.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.950
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 2v.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:08.250
So we'll get 2v squared plus 2xv
v prime-- 2v times x, yep,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.570
that's 2xv v prime-- is equal
to 1 plus 3v squared.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.760
Now let's see, let's subtract
2v squared from

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.350
both sides of this.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:29.580
And we will be left with 2xv v
prime is equal to 1 plus--

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.700
let's see, we're subtracting
2v squared from both sides.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.520
So we're just left with a 1 plus
v squared here, right?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.800
3v squared minus 2v squared
is just v squared.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.080
And let's see, we want it to be
separable, so let's put all

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.420
the v's on the left hand side.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:51.900
So we get 2xv v prime
divided by 1 plus v

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.640
squared is equal to 1.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.350
And let's divide both
sides by x.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.100
So we get the x's on
the other side.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.210
So then we get 2v-- and
I'll now switch back

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.100
to the other notation.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.520
Instead of v prime,
I'll write dv dx.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.760
2v times the derivative of v
with respect to x divided by 1

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.140
plus v squared is equal to-- I'm
dividing both sides by x,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.200
notice I didn't write the x on
this side-- so that is equal

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.560
to 1 over x.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.970
And then, if we just multiply
both sides of this times dx,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.310
we've separated the two
variables and we can integrate

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.940
both sides.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.710
So let's do that.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.530
Let's go up here.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.290
I'll switch to a different
color, so you know I'm working

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.540
on a different column now.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.400
So multiply both sides by dx.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:51.050
I get 2v over 1 plus v squared
dv is equal to 1 over x dx.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.640
And now we can just integrate
both sides of this equation.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.960
This is a separable equation
in terms of v and x.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.980
And what's the integral
of this?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.860
At first, you might think, oh
boy, this is complicated.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.750
This is difficult, maybe some
type of trig function.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.110
But you'll see that it's
kind of just the

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.740
reverse chain rule.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.860
We have a function here,
1 plus v squared,

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.500
an expression here.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.890
And we have its derivative
sitting right there.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.040
So the antiderivative of this,
and you can make a

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.070
substitution if you like.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.790
You could say u is equal to 1
plus v squared, then du is

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.240
equal to 2v dv.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.360
And then, well, you would
end up saying that the

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.320
antiderivative is just
the natural log of u.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.760
Or, in this case, the
antiderivative of this is just

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.640
the natural log of
1 plus v squared.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.440
We don't even have to write
an absolute value there.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.940
Because that's always going
to be a positive value.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.820
So the natural log of
1 plus v squared.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.260
And I hope I didn't
confuse you.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.120
That's how I think about it.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.670
I say, if I have an expression,
and I have its

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.630
derivative multiplied there,
then I can just take the

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.860
antiderivative of the
whole expression.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.060
And I don't have to worry about
what's inside of it.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.980
So if this was a 1 over an x,
or 1 over u, it's just the

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.270
natural log of it.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.460
So that's how I knew that this
was the antiderivative.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.170
And if you don't believe me,
use the chain rule and take

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.770
the derivative of this,
and you'll get this.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.570
And hopefully, it will make
a little bit more sense.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.880
But anyway, that's the left
hand side, and then that

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.000
equals-- Well, this
one's easy.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.630
That's the natural log, the
absolute value of x.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.180
We could say, plus c, but just
so that we can simplify it a

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.640
little bit, an arbitrary
constant c, we can really just

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.100
write that as the natural log of
the absolute value of some

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.400
constant c.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.400
I mean, this is still some
arbitrary constant c.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.880
So we can rewrite this whole
equation as the natural log of

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.900
1 plus v squared is equal to--
when you add natural logs, you

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.240
can essentially just multiply
the two numbers that you're

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.640
taking the natural log of-- the
natural log of, we could

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.710
say, the absolute value of cx.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.760
And so the natural log of
this is equal to the

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.150
natural log of this.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:07.010
So we could say that 1 plus
v squared is equal to cx.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.850
And now we can unsubstitute
it.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.700
So we know v is equal to y
over x, so let's do that.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:22.541
So we get 1 plus y over x
squared is equal to cx.

00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:25.240
Let me scroll this down
a little bit.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.100
Let's multiply both sides of the
equation times x squared.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.730
We could rewrite this as y
squared over x squared.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.900
So we multiply both sides times
x squared, you get x

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.500
squared plus y squared is equal
to cx to the third.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.370
And we're essentially done.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.040
If we want to put all of the
variable terms on left hand

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.010
side, we could say that this is
equal to x squared plus y

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.210
squared minus cx to the
third is equal to 0.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.200
And this implicitly defined
function, or curve, or however

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.980
you want to call it, is the
solution to our original

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.480
homogeneous first order
differential equation.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.340
So there you go.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.780
I will see you in
the next video.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.340
And now, we're actually
going to do something.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.260
We're going to start embarking
on higher order

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.980
differential equations.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.190
And actually, these are more
useful, and in some ways,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.630
easier to do than the
homogeneous and the exact

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.740
equations that we've
been doing so far.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.720
See you in the next video.
