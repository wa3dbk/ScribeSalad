00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.480
Let's do some exponent examples

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.420
that involve division.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.340
Let's say I were to ask you
what 5 to the sixth power

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.370
divided by 5 to the
second power is?

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.700
Well, we can just go to the
basic definition of what an

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.420
exponent represents and say 5
to the sixth power, that's

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.470
going to be 5 times 5 times
5 times 5 times 5-- one

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.730
more 5-- times 5.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.030
5 times itself six times.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.720
And 5 squared, that's just 5
times itself two times, so

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.770
it's just going to
be 5 times 5.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.380
Well, we know how to simplify
a fraction or a rational

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.620
expression like this.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.470
We can divide the numerator and
the denominator by one 5,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.900
and then these will cancel out,
and then we can do it by

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.110
another 5, or this 5 and
this 5 will cancel out.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.960
And what are we going
to be left with?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.220
5 times 5 times 5 times 5 over
1, or you could say that this

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.540
is just 5 to the fourth power.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.320
Now, notice what happens.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.060
Essentially we started with six
in the numerator, six 5's

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.580
multiplied by themselves in
the numerator, and then we

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.720
subtracted out.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.520
We were able to cancel out
the 2 in the denominator.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.450
So this really was equal to 5
to the sixth power minus 2.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020
So we were able to subtract
the exponent in the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.620
denominator from the exponent
in the numerator.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.610
Let's remember how this relates
to multiplication.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.790
If I had 5 to the-- let me do
this in a different color.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.570
5 to the sixth times 5 to the
second power, we saw in the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.330
last video that this is equal
to 5 to the 6 plus-- I'm

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.970
trying to make it color coded
for you-- 6 plus 2 power.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.670
Now, we see a new property.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.370
And in the next video, we're
going see that these aren't

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.940
really different properties.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.210
They're really kind of same
sides of the same coin when we

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.520
learn about negative
exponents.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.250
But now in this video, we just
saw that 5 to the sixth power

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.040
divided by 5 to the second
power-- let me do it in a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.610
different color-- is going to
be equal to 5 to the-- it's

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.830
time consuming to make it color
coded for you-- 6 minus

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.580
2 power or 5 to the
fourth power.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.420
Here it's going to be
5 to the eighth.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.095
So when you multiply exponents
with the same base, you add

00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:40.830
the exponents.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.270
When you divide with the same
base, you subtract the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.870
denominator exponent from
the numerator exponent.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.250
Let's do a bunch more of these
examples right here.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.470
What is 6 to the seventh
power divided by 6

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.710
to the third power?

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.060
Well, once again, we can
just use this property.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.190
This going to be 6 to the 7
minus 3 power, which is equal

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.430
to 6 to the fourth power.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.540
And you can multiply it out this
way like we did in the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.680
first problem and verify that
it indeed will be 6 to the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.840
fourth power.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.460
Now let's try something
interesting.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.350
This will be a good segue
into the next video.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.140
Let's say we have 3 to the
fourth power divided by 3 to

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.960
the tenth power.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.240
Well, if we just go from basic
principles, this would be 3

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.100
times 3 times 3 times 3, all of
that over 3 times 3-- we're

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.040
going to have ten of these--
3 times 3 times 3 times 3

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.920
times 3 times 3.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.310
How many is that?

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.960
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.160
Well, if we do what we did in
the last video, this 3 cancels

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.910
with that 3.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.790
Those 3's cancel.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.570
Those 3's cancel.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.740
Those 3's cancel.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.590
And we're left with 1 over--
one, two, three,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.730
four, five, six 3's.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.090
So 1 over 3 to the sixth
power, right?

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.970
We have 1 over all of
these 3's down here.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.029
But that property that I just
told you, would have told you

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:24.820
that this should also be equal
to 3 to the 4 minus 10 power.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.010
Well.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.590
What's 4 minus 10?

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.630
Well, you're going to get
a negative number.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.690
This is 3 to the negative
sixth power.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.350
So using the property we just
saw, you'd get 3 to the

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.670
negative sixth power.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.400
Just multiplying them out,
you get 1 over 3

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.680
to the sixth power.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.690
And the fun part about
all of this is these

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.100
are the same quantity.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.930
So now you're learning a little
bit about what it means

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.520
to take a negative exponent.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.040
3 to the negative sixth power
is equal to 1 over 3 to the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.630
sixth power.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.990
And I'm going do many, many more
examples of this in the

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.790
next video.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.520
But if you take anything to the
negative power, so a to

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.110
the negative b power is equal
to 1 over a to the b.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.230
That's one thing that we just
established just now.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.770
And earlier in this video, we
saw that if I have a to the b

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.670
over a to the c, that this is
equal to a to the b minus c.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.010
That's the other property
we've been using.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.510
Now, using what we've just
learned and what we learned in

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:32.160
the last video, let's do some
more complicated problems.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.630
Let's say I have a to the third,
b to the fourth power

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.180
over a squared b, and all of
that to the third power.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.290
Well, we can use the property
we just learned to simplify

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.010
the inside.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.800
This is going to be equal
to-- a to the third

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.650
divided by a squared.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.110
That's a to the 3 minus
2 power, right?

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.190
So this would simplify
to just an a.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.150
And you could imagine, this
is a times a times a

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.690
divided by a times a.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.260
You'll just have an a on top.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.080
And then the b, b to the fourth
divided by b, well,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.630
that's just going to be
b to the third, right?

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.990
This is b to the first power.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.810
4 minus 1 is 3, and then all of
that in parentheses to the

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.140
third power.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.060
We don't want to forget about
this third power out here.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.220
This third power is this one.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.110
Let me color code it.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.485
That third power is that one
right there, and then this a

00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:30.990
in orange is that
a right there.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.280
I think we understand
what maps to what.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.850
And now we can use the property
that when we multiply

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.730
something and take it to the
third power, this is equal to

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:48.820
a to the third power times
b to the third

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.140
to the third power.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.700
And then this is going to be
equal to a to the third power.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.880
times b to the 3 times 3 power,
times b to the ninth.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.830
And we would have simplified
this about as

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.680
far as you can go.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.240
Let's do one more of these.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.980
I think they're good practice
and super-valuable

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.150
experience later on.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:33.220
Let's say I have 25xy to
the sixth over 20y

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:40.190
to the fifth x squared.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.315
So once again, we can rearrange
the numerators and

00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:43.400
the denominators.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:50.890
So this you could rewrite as
25 over 20 times x over x

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.940
squared, right?

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.170
We could have made this bottom
20x squared y to the fifth--

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.850
it doesn't matter the order we
do it in-- times y to the

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.140
sixth over y to the fifth.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.470
And let's use our newly learned
exponent properties in

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.150
actually just simplify
fractions.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:13.220
25 over 20, if you divide
them both by 5, this is

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.240
equal to 5 over 4.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.990
x divided by x squared-- well,
there's two ways you could

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.880
think about it.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.890
That you could view as
x to the negative 1.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.080
You have a first power here.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.240
1 minus 2 is negative 1.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.169
So this right here is equal to
x to the negative 1 power.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.169
Or it could also be
equal to 1 over x.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.620
These are equivalent.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.690
So let's say that this
is equal into 1 over

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.510
x, just like that.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.900
And it would be. x
over x times x.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.050
One of those sets of x's would
cancel out and you're just

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.560
left with 1 over x.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.160
And then finally, y to the sixth
over y to the fifth,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.540
that's y to the 6 minus 5 power,
which is just y to the

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.230
first power, or just
y, so times y.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.730
So if you want to write it all
out as just one combined

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.410
rational expression, you have 5
times 1 times y, which would

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.690
be 5y, all of that over
4 times x, right?

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.930
This is y over 1, so 4 times x
times 1, all of that over 4x,

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.240
and we have successfully
simplified it.
