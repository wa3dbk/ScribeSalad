00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.780
So just a bit of review.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.650
What happened from
2000 to 2004?

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.029
Actually I should really say,
from 2000 to 2006, because

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.700
that really was when the housing
bubble happened.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.270
Well financing got easier.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.640
Or essentially they lowered
their standards.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.230
And it got progressively easier
and easier and easier,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.400
every year we went.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:36.630
So then that allowed more
people to bid on homes.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.110
So it increased the demand
artificially in certain ways.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.670
Because we saw from that New
York Times article that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.360
people's incomes weren't
increasing, and the population

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.160
wasn't increasing anywhere
near as fast

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.470
to soak up the supply.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.110
So all it did is allow people
who were renting before, and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.900
who couldn't save the money for
the down payment, now to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.490
participate.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.480
So now you had more people
bidding for the same house, to

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.550
bid up houses.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.530
But that led to the
obvious question.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.050
Why did financing get
easier and easier?

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.980
So let's go back to the good old
days, like the early '90s.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.370
Or actually, let's go
even before that.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.990
Let's go to the classic, what
happens to get a housing loan?

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.260
Well traditionally, if I
want to get a loan I

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.535
would go to my bank.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.330
And that loan officer at the
bank, he's going to be giving

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.370
the bank's money for
your house, right?

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.210
He gives you money.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.200
And you're going to pay
him interest. Right?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.800
This is me.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.390
And so that loan officer at the
bank, he really cares that

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.460
they're not going to lose money
on the transaction.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.860
If he's going to give you $1
million, he wants to make sure

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.820
that no matter what happens, if
you lose your job, if you

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.750
get arrested, if you skip town,
that he's still going to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.260
be able to get his
$1 million back.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.630
And if you go back to our
equity and balance sheet

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.180
presentations, that's why, back
in the day, they made

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.480
sure that you put 20%, 25% down
payment on your house,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.650
that you had a good credit
rating, that you had a good

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.660
steady income.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.080
Because that banker, that
loan officer, was

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.890
going to be in trouble.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.860
And his bonus was based
on how good the loans

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.770
he gave held up.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.280
So that was the traditional
model.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.190
What happened-- started to
happen the mid-90s, especially

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.760
in California, and then
nationwide in about 2001,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.670
2002-- is you had what we call
a securitization of the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.100
mortgage market.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.170
And this, in all fairness, this
actually happened a while

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.230
before, with things like Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.830
And I'll do a completely
separate video on those.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.000
But Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac essentially

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.390
had the same standards.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.550
They had the standards of, we
call them, conforming loans.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.740
I think the numbers -- you
have to have 20% down.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.310
You have to have a certain
credit score,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.550
certain steady income.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.190
So Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
were these entities that might

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.420
buy the loan from your
local banker.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.950
But their standards were just as
high as the local banker's.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.110
And they were based -- I think
they were actually, they had

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.390
oversight by Congress.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.050
So they weren't giving
away loans for free.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.116
But I'll do a whole other
presentation on Fannie Mae and

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:12.140
Freddie Mac.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.800
What you had happen in the late
'90s, and especially in

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.550
the early part of this decade,
is you had a whole industry

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.120
outside of the
government-sponsored entities.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.550
The government-sponsored
entities are Fannie Mae and

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.510
Freddie Mac.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.280
And this is essentially --
instead of you going to your

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.810
local bank for a loan -- this
is me again -- I would go to

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.700
my local mortgage broker.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.400
Countrywide is the most
famous of them.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.440
I think they're CFC.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.840
That's their stock ticker.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.380
They're not bankrupt yet.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.630
So I would go to Countrywide.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.010
And essentially I would
get $1 million from

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.170
them, a home loan.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.470
I would get $1 million
from them.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.520
And I'd agree to pay interest
to Countrywide.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.890
But then Countrywide would do
this like, a million times.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.600
So times a million, right?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.670
They'll give home loans
to a million people,

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.120
put them all together.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.320
And then they'll
sell the loans.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.090
They'll sell the loans to like,
let's say, Bear Stearns.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.060
So that's an investment bank.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.420
Let's call it Bear Stearns.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.890
Hope none of these
people sue me.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.860
I guess they have bigger
troubles now, then wondering

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.579
about my YouTube videos.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.620
They sell it to Bear Stearns.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.070
And then Bear Stearns will
package a bunch of these

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.550
mortgages together, essentially
IOU's from people.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.770
And then they would sell
those to investors.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.980
Right?

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.540
So essentially, instead of
Countrywide being responsible

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.580
for my loan, my payments now
go to these investors.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.380
And you could watch the--
that says investors.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.190
I know my penmanship
is horrible.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.030
But you should watch the videos
on mortgage-backed

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.530
securities and collateralized
debt obligations, if you want

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.800
to get a better understanding
of exactly how

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.080
the money flows go.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.810
But the bottom line is, because
of this process,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.150
what's happening?

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.860
Countrywide is just being
a transactional.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.200
They're just doing the paperwork
for my loan.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.920
They're temporarily
holding the loan.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.780
And they're doing a little
bit of due diligence.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.640
And in return for that, that
Countrywide mortgage broker

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.020
will just get a fixed fee for
doing that transaction.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.000
Maybe they'll get like $5,000
for just doing the paperwork

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.090
for my mortgage.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.570
Right?

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.160
And then Bear Stearns will
package a bunch of these

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.710
mortgages up-- and now it's
going to be in the billions--

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.320
and then repackage them and
sell them to investors.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.700
In the process, Bear
Stearns gets a cut.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.430
And Bear Stearns is doing
this for millions of

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.420
mortgages at a time.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.580
It's in the billions of
dollars, and Bear

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.600
Stearns gets a cut.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.570
So Bear Stearns essentially
just gets a fee, like the

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.180
mortgage broker.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.630
Of course it's a huge fee.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.290
And then the investors
are going to

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.766
get my interest payments.

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:55.670
Right?

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.220
And let's say if the interest
rates, if I'm paying 7%, and

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.710
the other million people are
paying 7%, the investors are

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.380
going to get 7% on
their money.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.800
And that seems like a pretty
reasonable proposition.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.960
And of course the investors
would care that the money that

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.950
they're essentially giving --
because they're giving money

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.520
to the investment bankers
who are giving money to

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.250
Countrywide.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.100
And that's where my $1 million
is essentially coming from.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.460
The only reason why the
investors would give their

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.490
money, is if they have a lot of
confidence that these are

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.580
really really good loans.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.150
Well the investors, they
don't know who I am.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.745
They don't know what my
job is, how likely I

00:06:27.745 --> 00:06:28.540
am to pay the loan.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.820
So the investors have to rely
on someone to tell them that

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.290
these are good loans.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.410
And that's where the rating
agencies come in.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.170
And these are Standard
&amp; Poor's and Moody's.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.720
And they rate these assets,
these mortgage-backed

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.530
securities.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.100
And what they say is, well,
they'll look at this big

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.210
package of mortgages, these
million mortgages that Bear

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.300
Stearns has packaged together.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.430
And they'll look at the
historical default rate.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.320
And they'll say, wow, these
mortgages really haven't been

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.050
defaulting.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.760
And you can think about
why they haven't.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.590
Because housing prices
been going up.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.060
So these mortgages really
haven't been defaulting.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.770
There's a very high chance
you're going to be able to get

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.810
all your money back.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.870
So we're going to give these
what they call, let's say they

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.920
say AAA rating.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.730
So this investor, who knows,
it could be the

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.850
Central Bank of China.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:22.880
It could be a hedge fund.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.930
It could be a whole
set of people.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.910
It might be the investment
banks themselves.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.630
Sometimes they actually
bought these just to

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.090
make some extra money.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.270
These investors, they don't know
who actually borrowed the

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.330
money, or what kind of credit
rating they had, or anything.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.170
But they just took
a leap of faith.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.320
They said well, Standard
&amp; Poor's or

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.650
Moody's did the work.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.320
They're telling me that this
is AAA, which means the

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.430
highest level of debt.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.490
Or you know, whatever
they told them.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.140
Maybe it was A.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.860
I forget all the different
qualities of debt.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.280
But they just took their
word for it.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.525
And they got their 7% interest
on their money-- whatever it

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:57.000
was, 6% money.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.210
And that worked out
pretty well.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.020
And so these guys, they liked
the fact that they were

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.790
getting the 7%.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.220
They said, this is a
good asset class.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.150
So then they funneled
even more money.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.680
So then there were even more
investors that wanted do this.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.620
They're like, this is great,
with very little risk I'm

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.930
getting a pretty good
return on my money.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.160
That's better than putting
it in the bank.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.960
That's better than buying
Treasury Bills, right?

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.790
So then even more
money flowed in.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.220
Well, more money wanted to
invest in people's mortgages.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.130
But Countrywide would say, well,
we're already giving

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.300
mortgages to all the
people who qualify.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.860
So in order to actually find
more people who want mortgages

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.480
from us, we'll just
have to lower the

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.770
standards a little bit.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:35.400
Right?

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.080
And we can lower the standards,
because we find

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.130
even when we do lower the
standards, no one's defaulting

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.100
on their mortgages.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.350
And in the next video, I'll
maybe give a little bit more

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.610
[? color ?]

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.250
why.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.190
So Countrywide will issue even
more mortgages, and give them

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.210
to these investors with
even lower standards.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.050
Of course, the mortgage
brokers at

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.880
Countrywide, they love it.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.300
Because every time they do a
transaction, they just get

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:54.730
some money.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.800
And then they give the mortgage
to the investment

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.850
banker, which packages
them up and then

00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.810
sells them to investors.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.490
So they get it off
their hands.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:02.350
And they just got the fee.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.100
So they just collect
the big cash.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.430
The investment banks
love it, right?

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.120
They just love doing the
transactions, because they get

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.380
more and more money every time
they do the transactions.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.530
And for the moment, the
investors seem pretty happy,

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.960
because they keep giving money
into this system, so to speak.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.840
Even though they might be
reading the newspaper and

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.450
seeing that the standards
are going down.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.240
But they're consistently
getting their return.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.575
And because the defaults were
very low over this time period

00:09:27.575 --> 00:09:29.950
-- and I'll explain in the next
video why the defaults

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.520
were very low -- they felt that
they were getting a good

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.460
return, maybe 6% or 7%, on
investments that had very,

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.300
very low risk.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.680
So in the next video, I'll
explain why the defaults were

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.400
very low in that time period.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.030
See you soon.
