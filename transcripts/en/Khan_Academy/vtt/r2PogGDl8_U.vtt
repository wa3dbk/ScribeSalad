00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.270
Let's say that I have
two nonzero vectors.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.005
Let's say the first vector is
x, the second vector is y.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.270
They're both in the set Rn
and they're nonzero.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.133
It turns out that the absolute
value of their-- let me do it

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:25.320
in a different color.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.800
This color's nice.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.080
The absolute value of their
dot product of the two

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.280
vectors-- and remember, this is
just a scalar quantity-- is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.840
less than or equal to the
product of their lengths.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.140
And we've defined the dot
product and we've defined

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.230
lengths already.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.390
It's less than or equal to the
product of their lengths and

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.730
just to push it even further,
the only time that this is

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.930
equal, so the dot product of the
two vectors is only going

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.575
to be equal to the lengths of
this-- the equal and the less

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:05.470
than or equal apply only in the
situation-- let me write

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.460
that down-- where one of these
vectors is a scalar multiple

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.920
of the other.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.580
Or they're collinear.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.430
You know, one's just kind of the
longer or shorter version

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.530
of the other one.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.250
So only in the situation where
let's just say x is equal to

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.875
some scalar multiple of y.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.760
These inequalities or I guess
the equality of this

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.215
inequality, this is called the
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.580
So let's prove it because you
can't take something like this

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.680
just at face value.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.040
You shouldn't just
accept that.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.280
So let me just construct a
somewhat artificial function.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.180
Let me construct some function
of-- that's a function of some

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.410
variables, some scalar t.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.710
Let me define p of t to be equal
to the length of the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.420
vector t times the vector-- some
scalar t times the vector

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.880
y minus the vector x.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.300
It's the length of
this vector.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.320
This is going to be
a vector now.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.920
That squared.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.130
Now before I move forward
I want to make one

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.790
little point here.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.740
If I take the length of any
vector, I'll do it here.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.890
Let's say I take the length
of some vector v.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.820
I want you to accept that this
is going to be a positive

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.150
number, or it's at least greater
than or equal to 0.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.940
Because this is just going to be
each of its terms squared.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.340
v2 squared all the way
to vn squared.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.640
All of these are real numbers.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.550
When you square a real number,
you get something greater than

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.770
or equal to 0.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.290
When you sum them up, you're
going to have something

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.670
greater than or equal to 0.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.840
And you take the square root
of it, the principal square

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.370
root, the positive square root,
you're going to have

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.270
something greater than
or equal to 0.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.930
So the length of any real vector
is going to be greater

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.180
than or equal to 0.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.690
So this is the length
of a real vector.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.230
So this is going to be greater
than or equal to 0.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.400
Now, in the previous video, I
think it was two videos ago, I

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.860
also showed that the magnitude
or the length of a vector

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.950
squared can also be rewritten
as the dot product of that

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.570
vector with itself.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.830
So let's rewrite this
vector that way.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.750
The length of this vector
squared is equal to the dot

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.230
product of that vector
with itself.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:44.880
So it's ty minus x
dot ty minus x.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.120
In the last video, I showed
you that you can treat a

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.050
multiplication or you can treat
the dot product very

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.330
similar to regular
multiplication when it comes

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.420
to the associative, distributive
and commutative

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.330
properties.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.200
So when you multiplied these,
you know, you could kind of

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.340
view this as multiplying
these two binomials.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.440
You can do it the same way as
you would just multiply two

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.360
regular algebraic binomials.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.030
You're essentially just using
the distributive property.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.760
But remember, this isn't just
regular multiplication.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.480
This is the dot product
we're doing.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.149
This is vector multiplication
or one version of vector

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.220
multiplication.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.730
So if we distribute it out, this
will become ty dot ty.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.850
So let me write that out.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.850
That'll be ty dot ty.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.430
And then we'll get a minus--
let me do it this way.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.580
Then we get the minus
x times this ty.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.640
Instead of saying times,
I should be very

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.720
careful to say dot.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.400
So minus x dot ty.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.810
And then you have this ty
times this minus x.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.860
So then you have
minus ty dot x.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.900
And then finally, you have the
x's dot with each other.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.680
And you can view them as
minus 1x dot minus 1x.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.080
You could say plus minus 1x.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.500
I could just view this as plus
minus 1 or plus minus 1.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.260
So this is minus 1x
dot minus 1x.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.860
So let's see.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.940
So this is what my whole
expression simplified to or

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.710
expanded to.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.890
I can't really call this
a simplification.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.410
But we can use the fact that
this is commutative and

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.230
associative to rewrite this
expression right here.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:45.430
This is equal to y dot
y times t squared.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.680
t is just a scalar.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.750
Minus-- and actually,
this is 2.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.810
These two things
are equivalent.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.370
They're just rearrangements of
the same thing and we saw that

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.290
the dot product is
associative.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:06.260
So this is just equal to 2
times x dot y times t.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.230
And I should do that in maybe
a different color.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.080
So these two terms result in
that term right there.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.570
And then if you just rearrange
these you have a minus 1

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.400
times a minus 1.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.070
They cancel out, so those will
become plus and you're just

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.140
left with plus x dot x.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.740
And I should do that in a
different color as well.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.690
I'll do that in an
orange color.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.820
So those terms end up
with that term.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.620
Then of course, that term
results in that term.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.880
And remember, all I did
is I rewrote this

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.490
thing and said, look.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.990
This has got to be greater
than or equal to 0.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.620
So I could rewrite that here.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.070
This thing is still just
the same thing.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.450
I've just rewritten it.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.620
So this is all going to be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.990
Now let's make a little bit of
a substitution just to clean

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.590
up our expression
a little bit.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.280
And we'll later back substitute
into this.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.480
Let's define this as a.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.860
Let's define this piece
right here as b.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.380
So the whole thing
minus 2x dot y.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.780
I'll leave the t there.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.020
And let's define this or
let me just define this

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.825
right here as c.

00:07:17.825 --> 00:07:20.130
X dot x as c.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.060
So then, what does our
expression become?

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:29.910
It becomes a times t squared
minus-- I want to be careful

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:35.480
with the colors-- b
times t plus c.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.050
And of course, we know that it's
going to be greater than

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.780
or equal to 0.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.660
It's the same thing as
this up here, greater

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.270
than or equal to 0.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.125
I could write p of t here.

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:50.890
Now this is greater than or
equal to 0 for any t that I

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:51.530
put in here.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.995
For any real t that
I put in there.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.190
Let me evaluate our function
at b over 2a.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.570
And I can definitely do this
because what was a?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.700
I just have to make sure I'm not
dividing by 0 any place.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.850
So a was this vector
dotted with itself.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.290
And we said this was
a nonzero vector.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.680
So this is the square
of its length.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.610
It's a nonzero vector, so some
of these terms up here would

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.790
end up becoming positively
when you take its length.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.710
So this thing right
here is nonzero.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.310
This is a nonzero vector.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.880
Then 2 times the dot product
with itself is also going to

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.450
be nonzero.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.309
So we can do this.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.990
We don't worry about dividing
by 0, whatever else.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.049
But what will this
be equal to?

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.200
This'll be equal to-- and I'll
just stick to the green.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.110
It takes too long to keep
switching between colors.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.230
This is equal to a times this
expression squared.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.340
So it's b squared
over 4a squared.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.090
I just squared 2a to
get the 4a squared.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.270
Minus b times this.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.760
So b times-- this is just
regular multiplication.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.650
b times b over 2a.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.780
Just write regular
multiplication there.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.130
Plus c.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.870
And we know all of that is
greater than or equal to 0.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.080
Now if we simplify this a little
bit, what do we get?

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.290
Well this a cancels out with
this exponent there and you

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.480
end up with a b squared
right there.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:26.150
So we get b squared over 4a
minus b squared over 2a.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.650
That's that term over there.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.730
Plus c is greater than
or equal to 0.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.440
Let me rewrite this.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.810
If I multiply the numerator and
denominator of this by 2,

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.010
what do I get?

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.110
I get 2b squared over 4a.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.050
And the whole reason I did
that is to get a common

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.660
denominator here.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.670
So what do you get?

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.050
You get b squared over 4a minus
2b squared over 4a.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.600
So what do these two
terms simplify to?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.930
Well the numerator is b squared
minus 2b squared.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:01.200
So that just becomes minus b
squared over 4a plus c is

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.710
greater than or equal to 0.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.570
These two terms add up to
this one right here.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.490
Now if we add this to both sides
of the equation, we get

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:16.260
c is greater than or equal
to b squared over 4a.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.720
It was a negative on
the left-hand side.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.570
If I add it to both sides it's
going to be a positive on the

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.760
right-hand side.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.470
We're approaching something that
looks like an inequality,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.380
so let's back substitute our
original substitutions to see

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.060
what we have now.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.660
So where was my original
substitutions that I made?

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.790
It was right here.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.970
And actually, just to simplify
more, let me multiply both

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.220
sides by 4a.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.020
I said a, not only
is it nonzero,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.130
it's going to be positive.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.070
This is the square
of its length.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.670
And I already showed you that
the length of any real

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.170
vector's going to be positive.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.460
And the reason why I'm taking
great pains to show that a is

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.510
positive is because if I
multiply both sides of it I

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.690
don't want to change the
inequality sign.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.910
So let me multiply both sides
of this by a before I

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.380
substitute.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:07.750
So we get 4ac is greater than
or equal to b squared.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.160
There you go.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.890
And remember, I took
great pains.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.400
I just said a is definitely a
positive number because it is

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.830
essentially the square of the
length. y dot y is the square

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.450
of the length of y, and that's
a positive value.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.320
It has to be positive.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.970
We're dealing with
real vectors.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.470
Now let's back substitute
this.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:30.030
So 4 times a, 4 times y dot y.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.420
y dot y is also-- I might as
well just write it there.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:39.470
y dot y is the same thing as
the magnitude of y squared.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.490
That's y dot y.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.760
This is a.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.690
y dot y, I showed you that
in the previous video.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:46.800
Times c.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.760
c is x dot x.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.640
Well x dot x is the
same thing as the

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.200
length of vector x squared.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.420
So this was c.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.030
So 4 times a times c is going
to be greater than

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.920
or equal to b squared.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.760
Now what was b? b was
this thing here.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:14.610
So b squared would be 2
times x dot y squared.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.880
So we've gotten to this
result so far.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.620
And so what can we
do with this?

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.200
Oh sorry, and this whole
thing is squared.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.240
This whole thing right
here is b.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.220
So let's see if we can
simplify this.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.620
So we get-- let me switch
to a different color.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:34.870
4 times the length of y squared
times the length of x

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.660
squared is greater than or equal
to-- if we squared this

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:46.270
quantity right here, we
get 4 times x dot y.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:54.620
4 times x dot y times x dot y.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.510
Actually, even better, let me
just write it like this.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:01.090
Let me just write 4 times
x dot y squared.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.950
Now we can divide
both sides by 4.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.600
That won't change
our inequality.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.250
So that just cancels
out there.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.050
And now let's take the
square root of both

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.840
sides of this equation.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.040
So the square roots of both
sides of this equation-- these

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.380
are positive values, so the
square root of this side is

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.840
the square root of each
of its terms. That's

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.325
just an exponent property.

00:13:18.325 --> 00:13:21.150
So if you take the square root
of both sides you get the

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:28.010
length of y times the length of
x is greater than or equal

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.570
to the square root of this.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.650
And we're going to take the
positive square root.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.480
We're going to take the positive
square root on both

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.400
sides of this equation.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.600
That keeps us from having to
mess with anything on the

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.260
inequality or anything
like that.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.640
So the positive square root is
going to be the absolute value

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.370
of x dot y.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.060
And I want to be very careful
to say this is the absolute

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:51.060
value because it's possible that
this thing right here is

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:51.755
a negative value.

00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:55.520
But when you square it, you want
to be careful that when

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.710
you take the square root
of it that you

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:57.960
stay a positive value.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.050
Because otherwise when we take
the principal square root, we

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.070
might mess with the inquality.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.130
We're taking the positive square
root, which will be--

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.965
so if you take the absolute
value, you're ensuring that

00:14:08.965 --> 00:14:10.590
it's going to be positive.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.000
But this is our result.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.800
The absolute value of the dot
product of our vectors is less

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.510
than the product of the
two vectors lengths.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.586
So we got our Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:36.630
Now the last thing I said is
look, what happens if x is

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.640
equal to some scalar
multiple of y?

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.385
Well in that case, what's
the absolute value?

00:14:41.385 --> 00:14:45.930
The absolute value of x dot y?

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.520
Well that equals--
that equals what?

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.080
If we make the substitution that
equals the absolute value

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.850
of c times y.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:59.160
That's just x dot y, which
is equal to just from the

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.730
associative property.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.800
It's equal to the absolute value
of c times-- we want to

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.910
make sure our absolute value,
keep everything positive.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.970
y dot y.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:22.320
Well this is just equal to c
times the magnitude of y-- the

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.210
length of y squared.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:31.260
Well that just is equal to the
magnitude of c times-- or the

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.986
absolute value of our scalar
c times our length of y.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.290
Well this right here,
I can rewrite this.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.610
I mean you can prove this to
yourself if you don't believe

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.790
it, but this-- we could put the
c inside of the magnitude

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.630
and that could be a good
exercise for you to prove.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.300
But it's pretty straightforward.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.180
You just do the definition
of length.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.050
And you multiply it by c.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:01.530
This is equal to the magnitude
of cy times-- let me say the

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:06.600
length of cy times
the length of y.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.620
I've lost my vector notation
someplace over here.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.580
There you go.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.920
Now, this is x.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.370
So this is equal to the length
of x times the length of y.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.360
So I showed you kind of
the second part of the

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.650
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality that
this is only equal to each

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.510
other if one of them is a scalar
multiple of the other.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.540
If you're a little uncomfortable
with some of

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.600
these steps I took, it might
be a good exercise to

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.370
actually prove it.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.720
For example, to prove that the
absolute value of c times the

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.270
length of the vector y is
the same thing as the

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.890
length of c times y.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.790
Anyway, hopefully you found
this pretty useful.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.180
The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
we'll use a lot when we prove

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.580
other results in
linear algebra.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.250
And in a future video, I'll
give you a little more

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.960
intuition about why this makes a
lot of sense relative to the

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.500
dot product.
