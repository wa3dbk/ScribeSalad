00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.800
Hello.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.820
I'm now going to use the actual
Khan Academy website to

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.680
do some more problems.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.490
And this time we're going to
go the other way around.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.860
We're going to look at the
graph of a trigonometric

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.090
function and we're going to try
to figure out the equation.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.950
So let's start with the problem
we have in front of us.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.990
So we have a-- well we don't
know if it's a sine curve or a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.680
cosine curve, but I guess it's
fair to say that it's

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.390
one of the two.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.250
Actually, let's answer
that question first.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.020
What do you think this is?

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.490
Do you think that this is a
sine curve or a cosine curve?

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.290
What's the difference?

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.560
Or what's the easiest
difference to differentiate

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.840
between the two?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.870
Well, what was sine of 0?

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.110
Let me get a little
chalkboard in here.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.140
Let me bring it right here.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.845
Let me make sure my
pen tool is correct.

00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:51.640
All right.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.540
What is sine of 0?

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.420
And it could be 0
degrees or 0 radians.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.930
Well if you remember from a
couple of the other modules,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.570
or even if you want to use a
calculator, sine of 0 is 0.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.150
And what is cosine of 0?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.030
Well cosine of 0, if you
remember from the last modules

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.840
or you want to use a
calculator-- although you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.010
shouldn't have to use a
calculator for cosine of 0--

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.980
you might remember
that it was 1.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.820
So this graph that we have
here, it's definitely when x is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.530
0, when the x-axis is 0, the
function definitely isn't 0.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.100
In fact, in this
case it's 1 1/2.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.130
So this tells us that this
isn't a sine curve-- although

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.710
later with shifts we'll learn
that it could be a shifted sine

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.120
curve-- that this isn't a sine
curve, that this is

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.120
a cosine curve.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.080
And then you might ask, well
Sal if this is a cosine curve

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.230
why is f of 0 equal to 1
1/2, or 3/2, instead of 1?

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.010
Because I just said here
that cosine of 0 is 1.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.240
Well that's because there must
be some type of a coefficient

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.610
here, let's call it A, that is
changing the amplitude

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.170
of this cosine curve.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.160
And if you remember from
the last module, what

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.380
do you think this A is?

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.600
Well that A is just literally
the amplitude of the curve.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.710
And what's the amplitude
of this curve?

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.950
Well, the amplitude of this
curve, if we just see how much

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.710
it moves above and below the
x-axis, well it's that 3/2,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.610
or that 1 1/2, we've
been talking about.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.030
See it moves up 3/2,
and it moves down 3/2.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.530
So let me just write that.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:35.410
So we know that this is 3/2
cosine of, well, something x.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.490
Right?

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.360
We know f of x is equal to
3/2 cosine of something x.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.140
And we could use the formula
that we learned in the previous

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.510
video, that it equals
2pi over the period x.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.430
So now we just have to look at
the graph and try to figure

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.720
out what the period
of the graph is.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.420
Well how many radians does
it take for the graph to

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.110
start repeating again?

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.450
Let me click on the
hint button, and maybe

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.460
this'll help us.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.900
When I click hint--
there; drew the period.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.180
And you could have figured
it out on your own.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.990
If you just go from any point
and then follow the curve back

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.540
to the same point again, you'll
see how long it's period is.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.730
And the hint on the Khan
icon actually told us

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.430
that the period is 4pi.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.475
And you could just start from
any point to any other point.

00:03:20.475 --> 00:03:23.860
You could have gone from this
point and then gone down,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.350
gone back up, come down.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.680
And then you would have seen
that this distance is also 4pi.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.200
So we know that the
period is 4pi.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.060
And then I could click hint
again and it'll tell us stuff

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.810
that we already figured out.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.700
The amplitude, we already
figured out, was 1 1/2.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.525
But let's just use a period,
because we already knew

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:39.750
what the amplitude is.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.370
So the period here we already
figured out was 4pi.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.670
So let's just write
that in our equation.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:56.400
So f of x is equal to 3/2
cosine of 2pi divided by

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.810
the period-- the period
in this case is 4pi-- x.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:11.770
That equals 3/2
cosine of 1/2 x.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.060
Now if you ever forget this
formula, which frankly

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.990
I always do forget it.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.210
I've actually never
memorized it.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.920
I just try to think about
what the period would be.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.680
The way I think about it is the
coefficient on the x-term,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.360
that's a measure of how
many cycles does the graph

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.300
do within 2pi radians.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.150
Let me see if I can explain
that within the context

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.240
of this problem.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.720
So this problem, if we start at
0 and then 2pi is here, how

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.330
many cycles do we complete
by the time we get to 2pi?

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.950
We start here, we go back
here, and then we're at 2pi.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.980
Well we only got halfway
done through a cycle.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.420
So that's the coefficient
on the x-term.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.230
And that's how I remember it.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.980
So I could just say, well
that's 3/2 cosine of

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.430
how many cycles do I
complete in 2pi radians?

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.810
Well I only complete
half a cycle.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.660
3/2 times the cosine of 1/2 x.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.580
So that's our f of x.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.550
Let's do another problem.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.130
All right.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.490
OK.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.630
This one's interesting.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.520
So the first thing, just by
inspection we can figure out

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.590
what this amplitude is.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.860
This is pretty easy.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.130
Right?

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.180
How much does it move above
and below the x-axis?

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.860
Well it only goes 1, so we know
that the coefficient, or the

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.020
multiplier times the sine
or the cosine function--

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.240
whichever this is-- is 1.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.680
So let's write that down.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:48.300
Let's write down that the
amplitude is equal to 1.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.580
Now let's try to figure
out if this is a sine

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.800
or a cosine function.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:59.290
In the last problem we
said sine of 0 is 0

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.880
and cosine of 0 is 1.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.750
Well f of 0 of this function,
whichever it is, is 0.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.830
So we know this is a
non-shifted sine function.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.870
So there.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.080
We have another piece
of information.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.070
It's a sine function.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.680
So the last thing we have to
figure out, we can either

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.110
figure out the period or we
could use the method that I

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.500
just showed you where we say,
well how many times does it

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.800
cycle within 2pi radians?

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.610
So let's do it that way.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.910
And then we immediately
know the coefficient.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.270
Let's see.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.770
Well actually, this graph
board doesn't even get

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.960
all the way to 2pi.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.480
But let's see.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.890
It goes one cycle, two cycles.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.770
And I did two cycles in
only pi radians, right?

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.840
Because I'm only at
x equals pi here.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.830
So if I did two cycles in pi
radians, then we must be able

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.820
to do four cycles
in 2pi radians.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.100
Or we could actually
start here.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.750
Actually, this is better.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.020
Right?

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.230
Going from negative pi to pi.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.990
That's 2pi radians.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.560
So we finish one cycle,
two cycles, three

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.080
cycles, four cycles.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.670
So then we know what the
coefficient on the x-term is.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.960
So we know that it
is sine of 4x.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.340
So the answer here is f of x is
equal to 1-- because that's the

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.400
amplitude-- the amplitude
times sine of 4x.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.620
I think we have
time for one more.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.410
And I want you to-- don't just
mechanically do whatever

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:22.840
I'm telling you.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.420
I want you to think about why
counting the number of cycles

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.150
within 2pi radians, why
that makes sense to you.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.160
Then think back to
the unit circle.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.790
Or think back why that formula,
the 2pi divided by the period,

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.610
is also the coefficient.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.100
Think about why
that makes sense.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.990
If you realize why it makes
sense you'll never have to

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.310
memorize it, and then 20 years
later when you're doing it like

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.520
I'm doing it right now
you won't be confused.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.460
You'll be able to
re-derive the formulas.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.320
Let's do one more.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.080
All right.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.890
So what's the amplitude here?

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:57.430
Well, let's see.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.510
The amplitude is 1/2.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.462
So let me delete the old stuff
that I was writing before.

00:08:03.462 --> 00:08:04.905
For some reason
it's not deleting.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.220
OK.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.200
Hope I don't confuse you.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.980
So the amplitude, let's
just call it Amplitude,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.730
is equal to 1/2.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:24.040
And how many cycles does it
complete within 2pi radians?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.560
Let's see.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.180
If we start here it looks like
it completes only half a cycle.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:30.390
Right?

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:35.770
Because it takes 4pi radians
to complete the entire cycle.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.820
So it only completes
half a cycle.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.450
So we could think of
it either two ways.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.730
We could say that the period is
equal to 4pi, because that's

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.720
how long it takes to complete
one cycle, or we could say

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.710
it can only complete half a
cycle within 2pi radians.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.130
The last thing we have to
figure out: Is it a sine

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.340
or a cosine function?

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.640
Well, f of 0 is 0.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.020
Right?

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.250
So it's a non-shifted
sine function.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.500
So then we're done.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:09.160
We have f of x is equal to
1/2-- figured out it's a sine

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.950
function-- sine of what?

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.280
How many cycles did it
complete in 2pi radians?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.950
It only completed half a cycle.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.090
Let me not cover the problem.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.360
It only completes half a cycle.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.530
So it's 1/2 sine of 1/2 x.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.300
Or we could use the formula f
of x equals goes 1/2 sine of

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.190
2pi divided by the period x.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.430
Right?

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:37.840
Because 2pi divided by the
period is equal to 2pi over

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.100
4pi, which also equals 1/2.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.210
I think that'll give you
a sense of how to do

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.850
these problems now.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.740
And I encourage you to
practice them on the

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.140
Khan Academy website.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.630
Have fun.
