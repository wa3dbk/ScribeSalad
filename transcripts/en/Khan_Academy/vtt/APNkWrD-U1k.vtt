00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.180
I will now do a proof
of the law of sines.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.920
So, let's see, let me draw
an arbitrary triangle.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.380
That's one side right there.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.510
And then I've got
another side here.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.320
I'll try to make it look a
little strange so you realize

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.410
it can apply to any triangle.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.920
And let's say we know the
following information.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.530
We know this angle -- well,
actually, I'm not going to say

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.940
what we know or don't know, but
the law of sines is just a

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.980
relationship between different
angles and different sides.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.500
Let's say that this angle
right here is alpha.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.470
This side here is A.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.490
The length here is A.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.720
Let's say that this side
here is beta, and that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.270
the length here is B.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.185
Beta is just B with
a long end there.

00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:53.700
So let's see if we can find a
relationship that connects A

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.120
and B, and alpha and beta.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.300
So what can we do?

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.130
And hopefully that
relationship we find will

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.610
be the law of sines.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.390
Otherwise, I would have
to rename this video.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.980
So let me draw an
altitude here.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.612
I think that's the proper term.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:15.230
If I just draw a line from this
side coming straight down, and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.350
it's going to be perpendicular
to this bottom side, which I

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.130
haven't labeled, but I'll
probably, if I have to label

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.630
it, probably label it C,
because that's A and B.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.780
And this is going to
be a 90 degree angle.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.280
I don't know the
length of that.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.480
I don't know anything about it.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.510
All I know is I went from this
vertex and I dropped a line

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.550
that's perpendicular
to this other side.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.300
So what can we do
with this line?

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.330
Well let me just say
that it has length x.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.320
The length of this line is x.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.950
Can we find a relationship
between A, the length of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.620
this line x, and beta?

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.570
Well, sure.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.670
Let's see.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.790
Let me find an
appropriate color.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.160
OK.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.290
That's, I think, a good color.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.380
So what's the relationship?

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.730
If we look at this angle right
here, beta, x is opposite to it

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.140
and A is the hypotenuse, if we
look at this right triangle

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.430
right here, right?

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.180
So what deals with
opposite and hypotenuse?

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.100
Whenever we do trigonometry, we
should always just right soh

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.180
cah toa at the top of the page.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.010
Soh cah toa.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.190
So what deals with
opposite of hypotenuse?

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.960
Sine, right?

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.820
Soh, and you should probably
guess that, because I'm

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.770
proving the law of sines.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.490
So the sine of beta is
equal to the opposite

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.370
over the hypotenuse.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.130
It's equal to this opposite,
which is x, over the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.440
hypotenuse, which is
A, in this case.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.500
And if we wanted to solve for
x, and I'll just do that,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.160
because it'll be convenient
later, we can multiply both

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.550
sides of this equation by A
and you get A sine of

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.240
beta is equal to x.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.350
Fair enough.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.100
That got us someplace.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.470
Well, let's see if we
can find a relationship

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.680
between alpha, B, and x.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.170
Well, similarly, if we look at
this right triangle, because

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.730
this is also a right triangle,
of course, x here, relative to

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.330
alpha, is also the opposite
side, and B now is

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.945
the hypotenuse.

00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:22.560
So we can also write that sine
of alpha -- let me do it in a

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.270
different color -- is equal
to opposite over hypotenuse.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.995
The opposite is x and
the hypotenuse is B.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.900
And let's solve for x
again, just to do it.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.910
Multiply both sides by B
and you get B sine of

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.280
alpha is equal to x.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.130
So now what do we have?

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.080
We have two different ways that
we solved for this thing that I

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.890
dropped down from this
side, this x, right?

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.770
We have A sine of
beta is equal to x.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.180
And then B sine of
alpha is equal to x.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.120
Well, if they're both equal
to x, then they're both

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.390
equal to each other.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.060
So let me write that down.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.060
Let me write that down
in a soothing color.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:21.520
So we know that A sine of beta
is equal to x, which is also

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.900
equal to B sine of beta --
sorry, B sine of alpha.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.280
If we divide both sides of this
equation by A, what do we get?

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.600
We get sine of beta, right,
because the A on this side

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.360
cancels out, is equal to
B sine of alpha over A.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.790
And if we divide both sides of
this equation by B, we get

00:04:47.790 --> 00:05:04.920
sine of beta over B is equal
to sine of alpha over A.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.880
So this is the law of sines.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.280
The ratio between the sine of
beta and its opposite side --

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.550
and it's the side that it
corresponds to, this B -- is

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.670
equal to the ratio of the sine
of alpha and its opposite side.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.200
And a lot of times in the
books, let's say, if this angle

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.430
was theta, and this was C, then
they would also write that's

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.560
also equal to the sine
of theta over C.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.130
And the proof of adding
this here is identical.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.380
We've picked B arbitrarily, B
as a side, we could have done

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.830
the exact same thing with theta
and C, but instead of dropping

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.350
the altitude here, we would
have had to drop one of

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.160
the other altitudes.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.800
And I think you could
figure out that part.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.530
But the important thing
is we have this ratio.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.800
And of course, you could have
written it -- since it's a

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.920
ratio, you could flip both
sides of the ratio -- you could

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.730
write it B over the sine of B
is equal to A over

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.480
the sine of alpha.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.740
And this is useful, because if
you know one side and its

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.640
corresponding angle, the angle
opposite it that kind of opens

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.680
up into that side, and say you
know the other side, then you

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.640
could figure out the angle
that opens up into it.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.370
If you know three of these
things, you can figure

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.960
out the fourth.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.100
And that's what's useful
about the law of sines.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.490
So maybe now I will do a few
law of sines word problems.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.450
I'll see you in the next video.
