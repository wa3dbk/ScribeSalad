00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.890
All right, I have
a problem here.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.840
Jacob and Emily ride a
ferris wheel at a carnival

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.290
in Billings, Montana.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.280
The wheel has a
16-meter diameter.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.440
So let me draw the wheel.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.110
It has a 16-meter diameter.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.225
So let me draw it big.

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:16.886
Give me a lot of space.

00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:20.910
So it has a 16-meter
diameter, so what's its

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.710
radius going to be?

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.570
Its radius is going to
be half of that, right?

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:33.280
So if I were to draw its
radius, just draw it like that.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.780
It's a 16-meter diameter, so
it's radius is going to be 8

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.390
meters with its lowest point
above the ground-- oh,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.540
with its lowest point 1
meter above the ground.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.690
So its lowest point
is right here.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.580
This is its lowest point,
and that is 1 meter

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.270
above the ground.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.920
So this distance right
here is 1 meter.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.570
Fair enough.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.335
Assume that Jacob and Emily's
height h above the ground is a

00:01:05.335 --> 00:01:10.100
sinusoidal function of time
where t equals 0 represents the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.700
lowest point on the wheel.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.720
So this is at point t equals 0
right here. t equals 0 is the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.860
lowest point of the wheel.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.440
Write an equation for h.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.060
Oh, I think I forgot,
so let me reread it.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.490
Jacob and Emily ride a
ferris wheel at a carnival

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.170
in Billings, Montana.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.030
The wheel has a 16-meter
diameter-- we did

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.450
that-- and turns at 3
revolutions per minute.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.910
So it turns at 3 revolutions
per minute with its lowest

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.570
point 1 meter above the ground.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.790
Assume that Jacob and Emily's
height h above the ground is

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.250
a sinusoidal function of
time, where t equals 0.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.160
So we need to write a function
of h, their distance above the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.200
ground, as a function of time,
and they're saying that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.280
time is given in seconds.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.860
So, first of all, they're
telling us 3 revolutions

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.760
every minute, right?

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.950
So that's 3 revolutions per
60 seconds, and that's the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.500
same thing as 1 revolution
per 20 seconds, right?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.630
I just divide both sides of
the per by 3 for 20 seconds.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.710
And one revolution is
how many degrees?

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.840
One revolution is 360 degrees.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.420
So it's 360 degrees
per 20 seconds.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.280
And if you're going 360 degrees
per 20 seconds, let's divide--

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.980
you know, the per you can just
kind of use as an equal

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.270
sign of the equation.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.180
360 degrees for 20 seconds.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.270
That means you're
going to go what?

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.740
18 degrees, Just divide
both sides by 20.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.895
18 degrees per second.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.450
And we could have done it with
a numerator and a denominator.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.260
3 revs per-- you know,
you could have said 3

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.940
revs over 60 seconds.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.140
That's actually how I
should have done it.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.430
3 revs over 60 seconds is equal
to 1 rev over 20 seconds, which

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.600
is equal to 360 degrees over 20
seconds, which is equal to 18

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.790
degrees per second, right?

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.350
So we're going to travel
18 degrees per second.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.510
So the total number of degrees
we've traveled in t seconds is

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.890
going to be-- so see, if we say
the angle, that's the angle

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.180
from our starting point.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.270
So let's say we've traveled t
seconds, and we're right there.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.460
What is-- let's drop a
little altitude right here.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.270
What is this angle going to be,
where this angle is right here?

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.070
What is this angle going to be?

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.000
How many degrees
have we traveled?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.180
Well, we say we traveled 18
degrees per second, so if we

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:03.090
travel t seconds, this is going
to be 18t degrees, right?

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.920
All right, so let's see if we
can figure out how their height

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.600
as a function of this-- well,
as a function of t or as

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.170
a function of this
angle right here.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.270
So what is this
height right here?

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.220
Up here?

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.420
It's 1 meter plus the radius
because this distance

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.710
right here is 8.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.000
So we could say that this is--
this point right here is h is

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.420
equal to 9 at this
point, right?

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.650
We could almost view
that as the h axis.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.990
So that's h is equal to 9.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.020
So at this point,
how high are they?

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.430
If this is h-- so right
now, let me draw a little

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.810
drop and go flat here.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.510
So their height above the
ground is this distance h,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.280
which is the same thing
as this distance h.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.050
So what is that distance?

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.100
Well, it's going to be-- well,
if this distance is h, what is

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.590
this distance going to be?

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.540
This distance is going
to be 9 minus h.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.060
How do I know this?

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.170
This whole distance is 9.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.770
This distance is h, so-- let me
do it in a better color-- so

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.690
that this distance right
here is 9 minus h.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.410
So let's see what we can do.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.860
What do we know?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.550
We know this distance.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.300
We know this angle
is 18t degrees.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.720
And do we know this side?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.010
Sure.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.730
That's the radius.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.490
That's 8.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.610
8 meters.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.780
9 minus h meters, 8
meters, and 18 degrees.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.260
And what are these sides
relative to this angle?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:42.800
Well, if we were to draw a
triangle here relative to this

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.400
angle right here, the 9 minus h
is adjacent, and the 8 meters

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.430
is, of course, the
hypotenuse, right?

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.780
So what trig function deals
with adjacent and hypotenuse.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.500
SOHCAHTOA.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.120
CAH, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.900
So we could say the cosine at
18 degrees, the cosine of 18t

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.445
degrees, is equal to
its adjacent side.

00:06:11.445 --> 00:06:14.462
The adjacent side is 9 minus h.

00:06:14.462 --> 00:06:21.670
It's equal to 9 minus h over
the hypotenuse, over 8.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.720
And now we can solve for
h, and we'll have h

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.910
as a function of t.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.810
So we multiply both sides by 8.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:37.090
You get 8 cosine of 18t
is equal to 9 minus h.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.870
Maybe we could subtract
9 from both sides.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:48.190
So we get minus 9 plus 8 cosine
of 18t is equal to minus h, and

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.340
then multiply both sides by
negative 1, and then you get

00:06:52.340 --> 00:07:00.130
9-- positive 9, right-- minus 8
cosine of 18t is equals

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:10.500
to h, or h is equal to 9
minus 8 cosine of 18t.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.330
So there we have it.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.230
We have expressed h
as a function of t.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.050
And in the next video,
I'm actually going to

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.835
graph this function.

00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:20.420
See you soon.
