00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.110
We're told to make a
table and solve.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.090
So they tell us that we have
50 ounces of a 25% saline

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.180
solution, a mixture
of water and salt.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.230
How many ounces of a 10% saline
solution must you add

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.700
to make a new solution
that is 15% saline?

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.190
So let's make this table that
they're talking about.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.180
Let's write amount
of solution.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.130
Let me write total amount of
solution or maybe I should say

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.510
total volume of solution.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.195
And then the next column I'll
say percent saline.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.610
And then we can use this
information to figure out

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.860
total amount of saline.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.380
And let's list it for each of
the two solutions that they

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.210
talk about.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.900
We're starting with 50 ounces
of a 25% saline solution.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.220
So this is what we start with.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.050
Starting solution, we have
50 ounces of it, so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.850
I'll just write 50.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.220
We'll assume everything
is in ounces.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.000
It is 25% saline.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.190
So if we wanted to figure out
the total ounces of saline, we

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.900
say, well, we have 50 ounces.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.240
Multiply that by 25% and we
have the total amount of

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.940
saline in this solution.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.510
So 50 times 25%, that's the same
thing as 50 divided by 4,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.870
so that's 12.5 ounces
of saline in

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.470
this 50 total ounces.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.560
It's 25% saline.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.760
Now, let's talk about what we're
going to add to it, so

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.010
solution added.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.450
Now, they say how many ounces
of a 10% solution?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.600
So we don't even know how many
ounces we're going to add.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.480
That's what we have to
actually solve for.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.140
So let's call that x for the
amount of solution that we

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.980
have to add.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.120
So we don't know how much we're
going to add, but we do

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.506
know that it is a 10%
saline solution.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.750
And if we know what x is, we
know the total amount of

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.630
saline is going to
be 10% of x.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.790
If we had 50 here, it
would be 10% of 50.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.200
If we had 10 here, it
would be 10% of 10.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.370
So the amount of saline we have
in this solution, in x

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.040
ounces of this solution, is
going to be 0.1x, or 10%

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.600
percent of x.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.560
That's what 10% of the solution
being saline means.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.070
Now, when we add it, what
do we end up with?

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.450
So let me do this in
a different color.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.945
Resulting solution.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.230
Well, if we started with 50
ounces and we add x ounces,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.170
we're going to end up with
50 plus x ounces.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.600
That's our total volume of
the resulting solution.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.060
What percent saline is it?

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.080
Well, our goal is to make a 15%
saline solution, so it has

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.210
to be 15% saline.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.090
Now, what's the total amount
of saline in it?

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.340
And this is kind of the main
box or cell in this table.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.140
There's two ways to get
to the total amount of

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.590
saline in the solution.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.600
One, we could just multiply the
percent saline times the

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.450
total value, so we
could do that.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.150
So let write that.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.270
It's 0.15 times 50 plus x.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.560
All I did, I multiplied
the percent saline

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.720
times my total volume.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.170
That's one way to get the
total amount of saline.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.020
The other way to get the total
amount of saline is to add

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.190
these two numbers.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.250
The 50-ounce solution had
12.5 ounces of saline.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.910
We added 0.1x ounces of saline,
so if we add these two

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.860
numbers, it should also
be equal to the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.180
total amount of saline.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.180
So this has to be equal to the
sum of these two things.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:16.290
It has to be equal to
12.5 plus 0.1x.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.990
And just like that, because 15%
of this has to be the same

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.340
thing as the sum of this, we
have one equation and one

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.030
unknown, and we can solve
for x, which is what we

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.570
need to solve for.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.840
How much solution do
we need to add?

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.430
So let's just do that.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.630
So 0.15 times 50.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.090
Let's see, that's 7.5, if
I'm doing that right.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.430
Yeah, because 0.15 times
100 would be 15.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:49.650
So this is 7.5 plus 0.15x--
that's the left-hand side-- is

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.080
equal to 12.5 plus 0.1x.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.560
Let me scroll to the
right a little bit.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.082
Now, we can subtract 7.5 from
both sides of this equation.

00:05:02.082 --> 00:05:04.590
Let me do it in a new color.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.390
So if we subtract 7.5 from both
sides of this equation,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.660
the left-hand side,
that cancels out.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.700
We're just left with 0.15x
is equal to-- 12.5

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.580
minus 7.5 is just 5.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.630
5 plus 0.1x.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.890
Now, we could subtract
0.1x from both

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:26.980
sides of this equation.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.950
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.170
Let me subtract 0.1, or I could
say 0.10x from both

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.420
sides of this equation.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.340
These are the same number.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.790
So they cancel out.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.640
The left-hand side, we
just end up with

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.900
0.05x is equal to 5.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:56.850
And now we just divide
both sides by 0.05.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.160
And we get x is equal to
5 divided by 0.05.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.150
That's the same thing as 5
divided by 1/20, or the same

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.970
thing as 5 times 20.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.030
So we get x is equal to 100.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.060
So we're done!

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.380
If you add 100 ounces--
so we figured out that

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.900
x is equal to 100.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.750
If you add 100 ounces of 10%
saline solution, you will end

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.870
up with 150 ounces of
15% saline solution.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.920
So if you add 100,
10% of that, we

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.960
actually added 10 ounces.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.700
So you have 12.5 plus 10 ounces
is 22.5 ounces of

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.450
saline in a solution of 150
ounces, which will be 15%.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.060
And we're done.
