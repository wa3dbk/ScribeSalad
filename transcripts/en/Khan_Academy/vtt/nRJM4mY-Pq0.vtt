00:00:00.293 --> 00:00:01.837
- So in single variable calculus,

00:00:01.837 --> 00:00:04.517
if you have a function f
of x and you want to find

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:07.052
the maximum or the
minimum of this function,

00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:10.228
what you do is you find its
derivative and you set that

00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:11.671
equal to zero.

00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.410
And graphically, this has
the interpretation that,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.545
you know, if you have the graph
of f, setting its derivative

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:21.049
equal to zero means that
you're looking for places where

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:23.027
its got a flat tangent line.

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:24.502
So in the graph that I drew,

00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:26.648
it would be these two flat tangent lines.

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:29.018
And then once you find these
points, you know for example,

00:00:29.018 --> 00:00:31.672
here you have one
solution that I'll call x1

00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:35.897
and then here you have
another solution, x2,

00:00:35.897 --> 00:00:38.921
you can ask yourself the
question are these maxima,

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:41.773
or are they minima, right?

00:00:41.773 --> 00:00:45.478
Because both of these can
have flat tangent lines.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.048
So when you do find this
and you want to understand

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.692
is it a maximum or a minimum,

00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:51.447
if you're just looking at
the graph, we can tell.

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:54.470
You can tell that this point
here is a local maximum

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.377
and this point here is a local minimum.

00:00:56.377 --> 00:00:58.075
But if you weren't looking at the graph

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:01.106
there's a nice test that
will tell you the answer.

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:04.300
You basically look for the
second, second derivative

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.841
and in this case because
the concavity is down,

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.735
that second derivative is
going to be less than zero,

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:12.888
and then over here, because
the concavity is up,

00:01:12.888 --> 00:01:15.886
that second derivative
is greater than zero.

00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:18.301
And by getting this
information about the concavity

00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:21.561
you can make a conclusion that
when the concavity is down,

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:24.416
you're at a local maximum,
when the concavity is up,

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:25.778
you're at a local minimum.

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:28.604
In the case where the second,
second derivative is zero,

00:01:28.604 --> 00:01:29.538
it's undetermined.

00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:32.053
You'd have to do more
tests to figure it out.

00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:33.653
It's unknown.

00:01:33.653 --> 00:01:35.325
So in the multi-variable world,

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:37.016
the situation is very similar.

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:39.618
As I've talked about in
previous videos, what you'd do

00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:41.624
is you'd have some kind of function

00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:43.594
and let's say it's a
two variable function,

00:01:43.594 --> 00:01:45.965
and instead of looking for where
the derivative equals zero,

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:47.684
you're gonna be looking for where the

00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:51.000
gradient of your function
is equal to the zero vector,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.625
which we might make bold to
emphasize that that's a vector.

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:56.930
And that corresponds with
finding flat tangent planes.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.036
If that seems unfamiliar,

00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:00.485
go back and take a look at
the video where I introduce

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:03.604
the idea of multi-variable
maxima and minima.

00:02:03.604 --> 00:02:05.452
But the subject of this
video is gonna be on

00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:08.577
what is analogous to this
second derivative test,

00:02:08.577 --> 00:02:10.610
where in the single variable
world, you just find the second

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.237
derivative and check if it's
greater than or less than zero.

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:15.038
How can we, in the multi-variable world,

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:16.795
do something similar to
figure out if you have

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:19.894
a local minimum, a local
maximum, or that new possibility

00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:22.955
of a saddle point, that I
talked about in the last video?

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:24.321
So there is another test and it's called

00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:26.356
the second partial derivative test.

00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:27.472
I'll get to the specifics of that

00:02:27.472 --> 00:02:29.643
at the very end of this video.

00:02:29.643 --> 00:02:32.104
To set the landscape, I want
to actually talk through

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:34.144
a specific example where we're finding

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:35.739
when the gradient equals zero,

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:36.886
just to see what that looks like

00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:39.557
and just to have some concrete
formulas to deal with.

00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:42.247
So, the function that
you're looking at right now

00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:45.747
is f of xy is equal to x to the fourth,

00:02:47.654 --> 00:02:50.987
minus four x squared, plus y squared.

00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:55.530
Okay, so that's the function
that we're dealing with.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.570
In order to find where
its tangent plane is flat,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.813
we're looking for where
the gradient equals zero.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.932
And remember, this is just
really a way of unpacking

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:05.952
the requirements that
both partial derivatives,

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.756
the partial derivative
of f with respect to x,

00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:12.096
at some point, and we'll
kind of write it in as we're

00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:15.220
looking for the x and
y where this is zero,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.561
and also where the partial
derivative of f with respect to y

00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:22.894
at that same point, xy is equal to zero.

00:03:24.298 --> 00:03:26.176
So the idea is that this is
gonna give us some kind of

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:29.157
system of equations that
we can solve for x and y.

00:03:29.157 --> 00:03:30.796
So let's go ahead and actually do that.

00:03:30.796 --> 00:03:33.978
In this case, the partial
derivative with respect to x,

00:03:33.978 --> 00:03:36.577
we look up here and the only
places where x shows up,

00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:38.989
we have x to the fourth
minus four x squared,

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.575
so that x to the fourth,
turns into four times x cubed,

00:03:43.575 --> 00:03:48.452
minus four x squared, that
becomes minus eight x,

00:03:48.452 --> 00:03:50.958
and then y, y just looks like a constant.

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.208
So we're adding a constant
and nothing changes here.

00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:54.068
So the first requirement is

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:56.985
that this portion is equal to zero.

00:03:57.901 --> 00:03:59.076
Now the second part, where we're looking

00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:02.019
for the partial derivative
with respect to y,

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.920
the only place where y shows
up is this y squared term,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.651
so the partial derivative with
respect to y is just two y.

00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:11.424
And we're setting that equal to zero.

00:04:11.424 --> 00:04:14.813
I chose a simple example
where these partial derivative

00:04:14.813 --> 00:04:17.479
equations, you know this
one nicely only includes x

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.201
and this one nicely only includes y

00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:20.323
but that's not always the case.

00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:22.285
You can imagine if you
intermingle the variables

00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:25.298
a little bit more, these
will actually intermingle Xs

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.583
and Ys and it'll be a
harder thing to solve.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:29.145
But I just want something where we can

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:31.487
actually start to find the solutions.

00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:35.654
So if we actually solve this
system, this equation here,

00:04:36.774 --> 00:04:39.200
the two y equals zero,
just gives us the fact

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.395
that y has to equal zero.

00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:42.945
So that's nice enough, right?

00:04:42.945 --> 00:04:45.819
And then this second equation,
that four x cubed minus

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.558
eight x equals zero, let's
go ahead and rewrite that

00:04:48.558 --> 00:04:50.178
where I'm going to
factor out one of the Xs

00:04:50.178 --> 00:04:53.828
and factor out a four, so
this is four x multiplied

00:04:53.828 --> 00:04:57.661
by x squared, minus
two, has to equal zero.

00:05:00.517 --> 00:05:01.507
So there's two different ways

00:05:01.507 --> 00:05:03.191
that this can equal zero, right?

00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:05.058
Either x itself is equal to zero,

00:05:05.058 --> 00:05:07.719
so that would be one
solution, x is equal to zero,

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:11.054
or x squared minus two
is zero, which would mean

00:05:11.054 --> 00:05:13.572
x is plus or minus the square root of two.

00:05:13.572 --> 00:05:17.739
So we have x is plus or
minus the square root of two.

00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:21.025
So the solution to the
system of equations,

00:05:21.025 --> 00:05:23.763
we know that no matter
what, y has to equal zero,

00:05:23.763 --> 00:05:26.823
and then one of three
different things can happen.

00:05:26.823 --> 00:05:28.910
X equals zero, x equals
positive square root of two,

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.827
or x equals negative square root of two.

00:05:30.827 --> 00:05:33.195
So this gives us three separate solutions,

00:05:33.195 --> 00:05:34.927
and I'll go ahead and write them down.

00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:39.094
Our three solutions as ordered
pairs are gonna be either

00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:43.606
zero, zero; for when x
is zero and y is zero.

00:05:43.606 --> 00:05:46.439
You have square root of two, zero.

00:05:48.368 --> 00:05:52.381
And then you have negative
square root of two, zero.

00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:54.139
These are the three different points,

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.557
the three different values,

00:05:55.557 --> 00:05:58.397
for x and y that satisfy
the two requirements

00:05:58.397 --> 00:06:00.886
that both partial derivatives are zero.

00:06:00.886 --> 00:06:02.311
What that should mean on the graph then

00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:04.337
is when we look at those
three different inputs,

00:06:04.337 --> 00:06:06.363
all of those have flat tangent planes.

00:06:06.363 --> 00:06:09.381
So the first one, zero, zero,
if we kind of look above,

00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:10.828
I guess we're kind of
inside the graph here,

00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:13.163
zero, zero, is right at the origin.

00:06:13.163 --> 00:06:15.702
We can see, just looking at the graph,

00:06:15.702 --> 00:06:17.589
that that's actually a saddle point.

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.469
You know, this is neither a local maximum

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:20.553
nor a local minimum.

00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:23.276
It doesn't look like a
peak or like a valley.

00:06:23.276 --> 00:06:25.814
Then the other two, where we
kind of move along the x axis,

00:06:25.814 --> 00:06:28.215
and that guess it turns out
that this point here is directly

00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:30.635
below x equals positive
square root of two,

00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:33.617
and this other minimum is directly below

00:06:33.617 --> 00:06:35.395
x equals negative square root of two.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.979
I wouldn't have been able
to guess that just looking

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.968
at the graph but we just figured it out.

00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:42.259
We can see visually that both
of those are local minima.

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.611
But the question is, how could
we have figured that out,

00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:46.839
once we find these solutions,
if you didn't have the graph

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.557
to look at immediately, how
could you have figured out

00:06:49.557 --> 00:06:51.869
that zero, zero corresponds
to a saddle point,

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.509
and that both of these other solutions

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.014
correspond to local minima?

00:06:56.014 --> 00:06:57.889
Well following the idea
of the single variable

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:59.110
second derivative test,

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.870
what you might do is take the
second partial derivatives

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.330
of our function and see how
that might influence concavity.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.532
For example, if we take the
second partial derivative

00:07:07.532 --> 00:07:10.957
with respect to x, and I'll
try to squeeze it up here.

00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:13.284
Second partial derivative of the function,

00:07:13.284 --> 00:07:16.983
with respect to x, and
we're doing that twice,

00:07:16.983 --> 00:07:19.926
we're taking the second
derivative of this expression,

00:07:19.926 --> 00:07:22.978
with respect to x, so we
bring down that three,

00:07:22.978 --> 00:07:26.561
and that's gonna become 12
because three times four

00:07:26.561 --> 00:07:30.961
times x squared, 12 times
x squared minus eight,

00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:31.961
minus eight.

00:07:33.989 --> 00:07:35.995
So what this means, woah,
kind of moved that around.

00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:38.092
What this means in terms
of the graph is that

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:39.962
if we move purely in the x direction,

00:07:39.962 --> 00:07:41.812
which means we kind of
cut it with a plane,

00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:43.989
representing a constant y value,

00:07:43.989 --> 00:07:47.712
and we look at the slice
of the graph itself,

00:07:47.712 --> 00:07:50.441
this expression will tell us the concavity

00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:51.780
at every given point.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.320
So these bottom two
points here correspond to

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.060
plus and minus x equals
the square root of two.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.123
So if we go over here
and think about the case

00:08:00.123 --> 00:08:01.882
where x equals the square root of two,

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:03.967
and we plug that in to the expression,

00:08:03.967 --> 00:08:05.342
what are we gonna get?

00:08:05.342 --> 00:08:08.043
Well, we're gonna get 12 multiplied by,

00:08:08.043 --> 00:08:09.686
if x equals square root of two,

00:08:09.686 --> 00:08:11.204
then x squared is equal to two,

00:08:11.204 --> 00:08:13.889
so that's 12 times two, minus eight.

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:15.966
So that's 24 minus eight.

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:17.371
We're gonna get 16.

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:20.027
Which is a positive number,
which is why you have positive

00:08:20.027 --> 00:08:22.331
concavity at each of these points.

00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:24.489
So as far as the x direction
is concerned it feels like

00:08:24.489 --> 00:08:26.557
oh yes, both of these
have positive concavity,

00:08:26.557 --> 00:08:28.377
so they should look like local minima.

00:08:28.377 --> 00:08:31.368
Then if you plug in zero,
if instead we went over here

00:08:31.368 --> 00:08:35.996
and we said x equals zero,
then when you plug that in,

00:08:35.996 --> 00:08:39.163
you'd have 12 times zero, minus eight.

00:08:40.127 --> 00:08:43.485
And instead of 16, you would
be getting negative eight.

00:08:43.485 --> 00:08:45.715
So because we have a negative
amount that gives you this

00:08:45.715 --> 00:08:48.552
negative concavity on
the graph, which is why,

00:08:48.552 --> 00:08:50.952
as far as x is concerned, the origin looks

00:08:50.952 --> 00:08:53.420
like a local maximum.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.523
So let's actually write that down.

00:08:55.523 --> 00:08:57.606
If we kind of go down
here and we're analyzing

00:08:57.606 --> 00:09:00.038
each one of these, and we think
about what does it look like

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:02.533
from the perspective of each variable?

00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:04.222
As far as x is concerned,

00:09:04.222 --> 00:09:07.627
that origin should look like a max,

00:09:07.627 --> 00:09:11.160
and then each of these two
points should look like minima.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.009
This is kind of what
the variable x thinks.

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:17.741
And then the variable y,
if we do something similar,

00:09:17.741 --> 00:09:21.604
and we take the second partial
derivative with respect to y,

00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:22.569
I'll go ahead and write that over here

00:09:22.569 --> 00:09:24.172
because this'll be pretty quick,

00:09:24.172 --> 00:09:27.815
second partial derivative
with respect to y,

00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:29.681
we're taking the derivative
of this expression,

00:09:29.681 --> 00:09:32.499
with respect to y, and
that's just a constant.

00:09:32.499 --> 00:09:33.724
That's just two.

00:09:33.724 --> 00:09:35.366
And because it's positive,
it's telling you that

00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:36.536
as far as y is concerned,

00:09:36.536 --> 00:09:38.381
there's positive concavity every where.

00:09:38.381 --> 00:09:40.936
And on the graph, what that would mean,

00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:44.376
what that would mean, if you
just look at things where you

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:46.435
kind of slicing with a constant x value

00:09:46.435 --> 00:09:48.528
to see pure movement in the y direction,

00:09:48.528 --> 00:09:51.106
there's always going to
be positive concavity.

00:09:51.106 --> 00:09:52.709
And here I've only drawn the plane

00:09:52.709 --> 00:09:55.139
where x is constantly equal to zero,

00:09:55.139 --> 00:09:57.094
but if you imagine kind of
sliding that plane around

00:09:57.094 --> 00:10:00.417
left and right, you're always
getting positive concavity.

00:10:00.417 --> 00:10:02.616
So as far as y is concerned,

00:10:02.616 --> 00:10:05.013
everything looks like a local minimum.

00:10:05.013 --> 00:10:07.951
So we kind of go down here
and you'd say everything

00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:09.312
looks like a local minimum.

00:10:09.312 --> 00:10:11.812
Minimum, minimum, and minimum.

00:10:14.816 --> 00:10:17.159
So it might be tempting here
to think that you're done,

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:19.315
to think you found all the
information you need to.

00:10:19.315 --> 00:10:22.810
Because you say well in the x
and y direction, they disagree

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.507
about whether that origin should
be a maximum or a minimum,

00:10:25.507 --> 00:10:27.610
which is why it looks like a saddle point,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.736
and then they agree, they
agree on the other two points,

00:10:30.736 --> 00:10:32.832
that both of them should
look like a minimum,

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:35.134
which is why, which is why you could say,

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:37.355
you think you might
say, both of these guys

00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:38.980
look like a minimum.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.556
However, that's actually not enough.

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:42.843
There are cases, there are
examples that I could draw

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:45.236
where doing this kind of
analysis would lead you

00:10:45.236 --> 00:10:46.962
to the wrong conclusion.

00:10:46.962 --> 00:10:49.195
You would conclude that
certain points are, you know,

00:10:49.195 --> 00:10:52.005
a local minimum when in
fact they're a saddle point.

00:10:52.005 --> 00:10:54.580
And the basic reason is that
you need to take into account

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.956
information given by that other
second partial derivative.

00:10:57.956 --> 00:10:59.513
Because in the multi-variable world,

00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:00.994
you can take the partial derivative

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.634
with respect to one variable,

00:11:02.634 --> 00:11:04.667
and then with respect to another.

00:11:04.667 --> 00:11:06.684
And you have to take into
account this mixed partial

00:11:06.684 --> 00:11:09.723
derivative term in order
to make full conclusions.

00:11:09.723 --> 00:11:11.082
And I'm a little bit
afraid that this video

00:11:11.082 --> 00:11:13.703
might be running long,
so I'll cut it short here

00:11:13.703 --> 00:11:16.783
and then I will give you the
second partial derivative test

00:11:16.783 --> 00:11:19.344
in it's full glory, accounting for this

00:11:19.344 --> 00:11:21.686
mixed partial derivative
term in the next video.

00:11:21.686 --> 00:11:24.489
I'll also, you know, give
intuition for where this comes in,

00:11:24.489 --> 00:11:26.926
why this comes in, why
this simple analysis that

00:11:26.926 --> 00:11:29.544
we did in this case is close
and it does give intuition

00:11:29.544 --> 00:11:32.510
but it's not quite full
and it won't give you

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.109
the right conclusion always.

00:11:34.109 --> 00:11:36.037
All right, I will see you then.
