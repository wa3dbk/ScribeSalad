00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.470
I want to do a quick
argument, or proof,

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.270
as to why the diagonals of
a rhombus are perpendicular.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.000
So remember, a rhombus
is just a parallelogram

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.200
where all four sides are equal.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.370
In fact, if all four
sides are equal,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.550
it has to be a parallelogram.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.410
And just to make things
clear, some rhombuses

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.930
are squares, but
not all of them.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.680
Because you could have
a rhombus like this

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.580
that comes in where the
angles aren't 90 degrees.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.457
But all squares are rhombuses,
because all squares,

00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:30.790
they have 90-degree angles here.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.320
That's not what makes them a
rhombus, but all of the sides

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.080
are equal.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.660
So all squares are rhombuses,
but not all rhombuses

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.265
are squares.

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:40.390
Now with that said, let's
think about the diagonals

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.370
of a rhombus.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.850
And to think about that
a little bit clearer,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.577
I'm going to draw the rhombus
really as kind of-- I'm

00:00:46.577 --> 00:00:48.160
gonna rotate a little
bit, so it looks

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.270
a little bit like
a diamond shape.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.710
So notice I'm not
really changing

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.600
any of the properties
of the rhombus.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.770
I'm just drawing it,
I'm just changing

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.130
its orientation a little bit.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.960
I'm just changing
its orientation.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.800
So a rhombus by
definition, the four sides

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.840
are going to be equal.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.440
Now, let me draw one
of its diagonals.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.450
And the way I drew it right
here is kind of a diamond.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.200
One of its diagonals will be
right along the horizontal,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.720
right like that.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.650
Now, this triangle on
the top and the triangle

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.289
on the bottom both share
this side, so that side

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.330
is obviously going to be
the same length for both

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.376
of these triangles.

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:25.250
And then the other two
sides of the triangles

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.400
are also the same thing.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.350
They're sides of
the actual rhombus.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.520
So all three sides
of this top triangle

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.300
and this bottom
triangle are the same.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.610
So this top triangle and this
bottom triangle are congruent.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.140
They are congruent triangles.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.940
If you go back to your
ninth grade geometry,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.590
you'd use the side-side-side
theorem to prove that.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.410
Three sides are congruent,
then the triangles themselves

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.089
are congruent.

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:50.380
But that also means that all
the angles in the triangle

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.150
are congruent.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.120
So the angle that is opposite
this side, this shared side

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.680
right over here
will be congruent

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.110
to the corresponding angle in
the other triangle, the angle

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.190
opposite this side.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.620
So it would be the
same thing as that.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.870
Now, both of these triangles
are also isosceles triangles,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.170
so their base angles are
going to be the same.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.900
So that's one base angle, that's
the other base angle, right?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.810
This is an upside down
isosceles triangle,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.440
this is a right side up one.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.080
And so if these
two are the same,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.059
then these are also
going to be the same.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.850
They're going to be
the same to each other,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.467
because this is an
isosceles triangle.

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:28.800
And they're also going to be
the same as these other two

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.860
characters down here, because
these are congruent triangles.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.160
Now, if we take an altitude,
and actually, I didn't even

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.130
have to talk about
that, since actually,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.220
I don't think that'll be
relevant when we actually

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.720
want to prove what
we want to prove.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.970
If we take an altitude
from each of these

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.880
vertices down to this
side right over here.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.230
So an altitude by
definition is going

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.840
to be perpendicular down here.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.610
Now, an isosceles triangle
is perfectly symmetrical.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.002
If you drop an
altitude from the-- I

00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:04.210
guess you could call it the
top, or the unique angle,

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.550
or the unique vertex in
an isosceles triangle--

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.080
you will split it into two
symmetric right triangles.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.050
Two right triangles
that are essentially the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.880
mirror images of each other.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.080
You will also bisect
the opposite side.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.310
This altitude is, in fact,
a median of the triangle.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.260
Now we could do it
on the other side.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.990
The same exact thing
is going to happen.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.210
We are bisecting
this side over here.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.634
This is a right angle.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.050
And so essentially
the combination

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.360
of these two altitudes
is really just a diagonal

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.590
of this rhombus.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.770
And it's at a right angle to the
other diagonal of the rhombus.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.484
And it bisects that other
diagonal of the rhombus.

00:03:51.484 --> 00:03:53.650
And we could make the exact
same argument over here.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.510
You could think of an
isosceles triangle over here.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.480
This is an altitude of it.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.630
It splits it into two
symmetric right triangles.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.750
It bisects the opposite side.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.840
It's essentially a
median of that triangle.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.540
Any isosceles triangle.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.560
Any isosceles triangle, if
that side's equal to that side,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.324
if you drop an altitude,
these two triangles

00:04:16.324 --> 00:04:17.740
are going to be
symmetric, and you

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.790
will have bisected
the opposite side.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.470
So by the same argument, that
side's equal to that side,

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.700
so the two diagonals
of any rhombus

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.360
are perpendicular to each other
and they bisect each other.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.830
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
