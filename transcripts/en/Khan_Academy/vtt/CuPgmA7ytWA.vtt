00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.120
We're asked to graph y is equal
to x squared minus x,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.760
minus 6 by plotting points.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.280
Let's just make a table.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.300
Let's just pick some x values,
and figure out what y is going

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.660
to be based on this
relation up here.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.480
So let's figure out what
y is going to be.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.745
So let's just start
x at negative 3.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:25.760
So if x is negative 3, then y
is going to be negative 3

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.560
squared is 9, minus negative
3-- so that's

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.950
plus 3-- minus 6.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.810
So what is that?

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.540
9 plus 3 is 12, minus 6,
this is equal to 6.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.260
Then we get-- let's just keep
going before we plot any

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.530
points-- so then we
have negative 2.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.750
If x is equal to negative 2,
then y is negative 2 squared,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:55.060
which is 4, minus negative 2,
so that's plus 2, minus 6.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.480
So in that situation, we
have 4 plus 2, minus 6,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.410
it's equal to 0.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.750
Then if x is equal to negative
1, we have negative 1 squared,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.930
which is positive 1, minus
negative 1, which is another

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.210
positive 1.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.810
Then we have minus 6.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.980
2 minus 6 is equal
to negative 4.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.240
Let's go to 0.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.700
If x is equal to 0, these
two terms are 0.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.630
And then y is equal
to negative 6.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.620
So let's just go all the
way to positive 3.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.690
If x is equal to 1, we have
1 squared minus 1.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.130
Those cancel out.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.450
And then you have just
a negative 6 there.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.800
And then if we have x is equal
to 2, we have 2 squared, which

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.530
is 4, minus 2, minus 6.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.490
So 4 minus 2 is 2, minus 6
is equal to negative 4.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.750
And then if x is equal to 3, we
have 3 squared, which is 9,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.690
minus 3, right?

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.140
9 minus 3, minus 6.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.510
Well that's going to
be equal to 0.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.280
So let's plot these points.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.440
So let me do it in a
dark color here.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.660
So the first point is
negative 3 comma 6.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.259
So this is my x-axis right
here, this is my y-axis.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.250
So negative 3 is negative
1, 2, 3 comma 6.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.650
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.720
So it will be right
over there.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.820
That's this point over here.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.600
And the next 1 is negative
2 comma 0.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.240
So negative 2, and then we
don't move up in the y

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.560
direction at all.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.920
Then we have a negative
1 comma negative 4.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.910
Negative 1.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.960
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.800
Negative 4 is right
over there.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.720
Then we have 0, negative 6.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.180
0, x is 0.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.970
y is negative 6.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.040
So it's that point
right there.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.710
Then we have 1, negative 6.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.670
So x is 1, y is negative 6.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.770
And then we have-- and
then what do we have?

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.350
We have 2, negative 4.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.190
So x is 2, y is negative 4.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.860
And x is 3, y is 0.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.100
So you can see, here, if we just
connect these plots, we

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.080
get a bit of a curve.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.640
We get a bit of a u shape.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.360
And the u shape will
look like this.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.350
I'll do my best to draw it,
this is always the hardest

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.460
part, connecting the dots.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.460
So let me just do it in one
nice-- so you get a u shape

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.190
that looks something
like that.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.700
I can do a better job of
drawing that, I'm sure.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.970
Let me do one last
shot at this.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.570
So let me just draw as good of
a u shape as possible, just

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.770
keep going like that.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.670
So you get this u
shape over here.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.980
And this u shape, which is the
general shape of these

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.130
quadratic functions right here,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.970
this is called a parabola.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.920
So that u shape is called
a parabola.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.110
And in the future we'll see
better ways to graph it, so

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.720
you don't have to just plot
a bunch of points.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.670
But it's good to see the general
shape, and we get that

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.900
general shape just by trying
out a bunch of x values and

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.940
figuring out the corresponding
y values.
