00:00:00.796 --> 00:00:02.868
- [Voiceover] Hello
everyone, so in this video

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:05.083
I'm gonna introduce vector fields.

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:06.769
Now these are a concept
that come up all the time

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.288
in multi variable calculus,
and that's probably because

00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:11.726
they come up all the time in physics.

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:14.429
It comes up with fluid
flow, with electrodynamics,

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.176
you see them all over the place.

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:18.594
And what a vector field is,
is its pretty much a way

00:00:18.594 --> 00:00:22.231
of visualizing functions
that have the same number

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.481
of dimensions in their
input as in their output.

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:26.996
So here I'm gonna write a function

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:28.366
that's got a two dimensional input

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.154
X and Y, and then its output

00:00:30.154 --> 00:00:33.100
is going to be a two dimensional vector

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.148
and each of the components
will somehow depend on X and Y.

00:00:36.148 --> 00:00:39.571
I'll make the first one
Y cubed minus nine Y

00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:42.853
and then the second component,
the Y component of the output

00:00:42.853 --> 00:00:45.738
will be X cubed minus nine X.

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:48.237
I made them symmetric here,
looking kind of similar

00:00:48.237 --> 00:00:52.077
they don't have to be, I'm
just a sucker for symmetry.

00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:54.412
So if you imagine trying to
visualize a function like this

00:00:54.412 --> 00:00:57.412
with a graph it would be really hard

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.084
because you have two
dimensions in the input

00:01:01.084 --> 00:01:02.646
two dimensions in the output

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:03.891
so you'd have to somehow

00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:06.441
visualize this thing in four dimensions.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.022
So instead what we do, we
look only in the input space.

00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:11.460
So that means we look
only in the X,Y plane.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.207
So I'll draw these coordinate axes

00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:16.356
and just mark it up,
this here's our X axis

00:01:16.356 --> 00:01:17.880
this here's our Y axis

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.188
and for each individual input point

00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:22.938
like lets say one,two

00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:26.308
so lets say we go to one,two

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:32.062
I'm gonna consider the
vector that it outputs

00:01:32.062 --> 00:01:34.297
and attach that vector to the point.

00:01:34.297 --> 00:01:36.247
So lets walk through an
example of what I mean by that

00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:39.497
so if we actually evaluate F at one,two

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:43.971
X is equal to one Y is equal to two

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:45.904
so we plug in two cubed

00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:47.321
whoops, two cubed

00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:50.870
minus nine times two

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.151
up here in the X component

00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:56.326
and then one cubed minus nine times Y

00:01:56.326 --> 00:01:58.849
nine times one, excuse me

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.583
down in the Y component.

00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:04.346
Two cubed is eight nine times two is 18

00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:07.013
so eight minus 18 is negative 10

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:10.393
negative 10

00:02:10.393 --> 00:02:13.509
and then one cubed is one,
nine times one is nine

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.509
so one minus nine is negative eight.

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:21.128
Now first imagine that this was

00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:22.896
if we just drew this vector where we count

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:25.497
starting from the origin,
negative one, two,

00:02:25.497 --> 00:02:29.316
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10,

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.226
so its going to have
this as its X component

00:02:31.226 --> 00:02:33.055
and then negative eight,
one, two, three, four,

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:36.712
five, six, seven, we're gonna
actually go off the screen

00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:38.012
its a very very large vector

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:39.370
so its gonna be something here

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.324
and it ends up having
to go off the screen.

00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:42.380
But the nice thing about vectors

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.229
it doesn't matter where they start

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:46.688
so instead we can start it
here and we still want it

00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:49.573
to have that negative ten X component

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:51.300
and the negative eight, negative one, two,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.383
three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:57.141
negative eight

00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:00.457
as its Y component there

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:04.770
and a plan with the vector field

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.086
is to do this at not just one,two

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.732
but at a whole bunch of different points

00:03:08.732 --> 00:03:10.825
and see what vectors attach to them

00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:12.674
and if we drew them all
according to their size

00:03:12.674 --> 00:03:14.015
this would be a real mess.

00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:16.067
There'd be markings all over the place

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:19.744
and this one might have some
huge vector attached to it

00:03:19.744 --> 00:03:22.182
and this one would have some
huge vector attached to it

00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:24.377
and it would get really really messy.

00:03:24.377 --> 00:03:28.544
But instead what we do, just
gonna clear up the board here

00:03:29.883 --> 00:03:32.077
we scale them down, this is common

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:34.820
you'll scale them down and
so that you're kind of lying

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.705
about what the vectors themselves are

00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:39.493
but you get a much better feel for

00:03:39.493 --> 00:03:42.073
what each thing corresponds to.

00:03:42.073 --> 00:03:43.414
And another thing about this drawing

00:03:43.414 --> 00:03:45.222
that's not entirely faithful

00:03:45.222 --> 00:03:47.620
to the original function that we have

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.139
is that all of these
vectors are the same length.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.886
I made this one just kind of the same unit

00:03:51.886 --> 00:03:53.878
this one the same unit, and over here

00:03:53.878 --> 00:03:55.279
they all just have the same length

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.839
even though in reality
the length of the vectors'

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:01.029
output by this function
can be wildly different.

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.630
This is kind of common practice
when vector fields are drawn

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.515
or when some kind of software
is drawing them for you

00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:08.872
so there are ways of getting around this

00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:11.472
one way is to just use
colors with your vectors

00:04:11.472 --> 00:04:15.272
so I'll switch over to a
different vector field here

00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:17.994
and here color is used to
kind of give a hint of length

00:04:17.994 --> 00:04:19.721
so it still looks organized
because all of them

00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:23.541
have the same length but the difference

00:04:23.541 --> 00:04:27.239
is that red and warmer
colors are supposed to

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:29.799
indicate this is a very
long vector somehow

00:04:29.799 --> 00:04:32.176
and then blue would indicate
that its very short.

00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:34.655
Another thing you can
do is scale them to be

00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:37.235
roughly proportional
to what they should be

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.515
so notice all the blue vectors

00:04:38.515 --> 00:04:40.384
scaled way down to basically be zero

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:42.700
red vectors kind of stay the same size

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.834
even though in reality this
might be representing a function

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.353
where the true vector
here should be really long

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.933
or the true vector should
be kind of medium length

00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:51.742
its still common for people
to just shrink them down

00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:54.139
so its a reasonable thing to view.

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.638
So in the next video I'm
gonna talk about fluid flow

00:04:56.638 --> 00:04:58.365
a context in which vector
fields come up all the time

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:01.169
and its also a pretty
good way to get a feel for

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.693
a random vector field that you look at

00:05:02.693 --> 00:05:04.665
to understand what its all about.
