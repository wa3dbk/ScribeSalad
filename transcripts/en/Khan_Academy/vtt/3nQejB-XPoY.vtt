00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.450
In the first version of the
video of the proof of the

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:10.860
derivative of the natural
log of x, where the first

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.180
time I proved this is
a couple of years ago.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.960
And the very next video I
proved that the derivative

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.640
of e to the x is
equal to e to the x.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.410
I've been charged with some of
making a circular proof, and

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.160
I'm pretty convinced that
my proof wasn't circular.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.660
So what I want to do in this
video, now that I have a little

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.480
bit more space to work with, a
little bit more sophisticated

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.280
tools, I'm going to redo the
proof and I'm going to do these

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.910
in the same video to show you
at no point do I assume this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.920
before I actually show it.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.330
So let's start with the proof.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.410
So the first thing I need to do
is prove this thing up here.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.320
I want to keep track of this.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.730
I don't assume this until
I actually show it.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.370
So let's start with the
proof, the derivative of

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.310
the natural log of x.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.730
So the derivative of the
natural log of x, we can

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.580
just to go to the basic
definition of a derivative.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.940
It's equal to the limit as
delta x approaches 0 of the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.170
natural log of x plus delta x
minus the natural log of x.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.880
All of that over delta x.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.150
Now we can just use the
property of logarithms.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.100
If I have the log of a minus
the log of b, that's the same

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.900
thing as a log of a over b.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.800
So let me re-write it that way.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.490
So this is going to be equal
to the limit as delta

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.900
x approaches 0.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.900
I could take this 1 over
delta x right here.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.370
1 over delta x times the
natural log of x plus delta

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.590
x divided by this x.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.810
Just doing the logarithm
properties right there.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.830
Then I can re-write this --
first of all, when I have this

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.160
coefficient in front of a
logarithm I can make

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.480
this the exponent.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.190
And then I can simplify
this in here.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.940
So this is going to be equal to
the limit as delta x approaches

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.870
0 of the natural log -- let
me do this in a new color.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.380
Let me do it in a
completely new color.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.660
The natural log of -- the
inside here I'll just

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.020
divide everything by x.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.390
So x divided by x is 1.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.600
Then plus delta x over x.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.310
Then I had this 1 over delta x
sitting out here, and I can

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.490
make that the exponent.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.030
That's just an exponent
rule right there, or

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.440
a logarithm property.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.810
1 over delta x.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.100
Now I'm going to make
a substitution.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.910
Remember, all of this, this was
all just from my definition

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.500
of a derivative.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.130
This was all equal to
the derivative of the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.740
natural log of x.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.250
I have still yet to
in any way use this.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.550
And I won't use that until
I actually show it to you.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.600
I've become very defensive
about these claims

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.180
of circularity.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.040
They're my fault because that
shows that I wasn't clear

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.950
enough in my earlier versions
of these proofs, so I'll try

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.140
to be more clear this time.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.120
So let's see if we can
simplify this into terms

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.840
that we recognize.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.860
Let's make the substitution so
that we can get e in maybe

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.790
terms that we recognize.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:26.830
Let's make the substitute delta
x over x is equal to 1 over n.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.490
If we multiply -- this
is the same thing.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.890
This is the equivalent
to substitution.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.910
If we multiply both sides of
this by x, as saying that

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.160
delta x is equal to x over n.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.200
These are equivalent
statements.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.490
I just multiplied both
sides by x here.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.480
Now if we take the limit as n
approaches infinity of this

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.780
term right here, that's
equivalent -- that's completely

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.670
equivalent to taking the limit
as delta x approaches 0.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.890
If we're defining delta x to be
this thing, and we take the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.590
limit as its denominator
approaches 0, we're going

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.120
to make delta x go to 0.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.520
So let's make that
substitution.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.810
So all of this is going to be
equal to the limit as -- now

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.275
we've gotten rid
of our delta x.

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:19.000
We're going to say the limit as
an approaches infinity of the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.380
natural log -- I'll go back to
that mauve color -- the natural

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.900
log of 1 plus -- now, I said
that instead of delta x over x,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.580
I made the substitution that
that is equal to 1 over n.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.010
So that's 1 plus 1 over n.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.860
And then what's 1 over delta x?

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.690
Well delta x is equal to x over
n, so 1 over delta x is going

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.875
to be the inverse of this.

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:47.140
It's going to be n over x.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.700
And then we can re-write this
expression right here --

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.670
let me re-write it again.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:58.600
This is equal to the limit as
n approaches infinity of the

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.730
natural log of 1 plus 1 over n.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.610
What I can do is I can separate
out this n from the 1 over x.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.130
I could say this is to
the n, and then all of

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.200
this to the 1 over x.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.730
Once again, this is just
an exponent property.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.290
If I raise something to the n
and then to the 1 over x, I

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.110
could just multiply
the exponent to get

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.660
to the n over x.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.660
So these two statements
are equivalent.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.720
But now we can use logarithm
properties to say hey, if this

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.730
is the exponent, I can just
stick it out in front of the

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.100
coefficient right here.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.300
I could put it out right there.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.830
And just remember, this was all
of the derivative with respect

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.710
to x of the natural log of x.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.680
So what is that equal to?

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.340
We could put this 1 out
of x in the front here.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.040
In fact, that 1 out of x term,
it has nothing to do with n.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.550
It's kind of a constant
term when you think

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.290
of it in terms of n.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.000
So we can actually put it
all the way out here.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.060
We could put it either place.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.490
So we could say 1 over x times
all that stuff in mauve.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:03.400
The limit as n approaches
infinity of the natural log

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.680
of 1 plus 1 over n to the n.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.560
The natural log of
all of that stuff.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.670
Or, just to make the point
clear, we can re-write this

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.550
part -- let me make a salmon
color -- equal to 1 over x

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:27.420
times the natural log of the
limit as n approaches infinity.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.015
I'm just switching places here,
because obviously what we care

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:33.830
is what happens to this term as
it approaches infinity, of

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.550
1 plus 1 over n to the n.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.910
Well what is -- this should
look a little familiar to you

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.760
on some of the first videos
where we talked about e -- this

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.020
is one of the definitions of e.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.030
e is defined.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.880
I'm just being clear here.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.650
I'm still not using
this at all.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.020
I'm just stating that the
definition of e, e is equal

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.760
to the limit as n approaches
infinity of 1 plus

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.750
1 over n to the n.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.490
This is just the
definition of e.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.330
And natural log is defined
to be the logarithm

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.670
of base, this thing.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.890
So this thing is e.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.510
So I'm saying that the
derivative of the natural log

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.680
of x is equal to 1 over x
times the natural log.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.860
This thing right here is e.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.050
That's what the
definition of e is.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.800
I'm not using the definition
of the derivative e, or

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.360
the definition of the
derivative of e to the x.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.450
I'm just using the
definition of e.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.120
And the definition of
natural log is log base e.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.370
This says the power that you
have to raise e to to get to e,

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.870
well this is just equal to 1.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.620
There we get that the
derivative of the natural log

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.400
of x is equal to 1 over x.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.110
So, so far I think you'll be
satisfied that we've proven

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.450
this first statement up here,
and in no way did we use

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.020
this statement right here.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.540
I just used the definition
of e, but that's fine.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.420
I mean we assumed we know the
definition of e, even when we

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.070
just talk about natural log,
we assume that it's base e.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.820
In no way did I assume
this to begin with.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.760
Now, given that we've shown
this and we didn't assume

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.750
this at all, let's see
if we can show this.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:22.270
So the derivative -- let's do a
little bit of an exercise here.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.170
Actually, I could probably
do it in the margins.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:34.220
Let's take the derivative
of this function.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.246
The natural log of e to the x.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.140
So there's two ways we
can approach this.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.210
The first way we could simplify
this and we could say this is

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.520
the exact same thing
as the derivative.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.740
We could put this x out
front of x times the

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.820
natural log of e.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.910
And what's the
natural log of e?

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:01.460
The natural log of e we
already know is equal to 1.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.930
So this is just the
derivative of x.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.030
And the derivative
of x is equal to 1.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.190
So that's pretty
straightforward.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.540
The derivative, in no way did
we assume this to begin with.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.140
We just simplified this
expression to just this is the

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.260
same thing as the derivative
of x, because this

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.660
term cancels out.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.600
And the derivative
of x is just 1.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.210
Or we could do it
the other way.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.380
We could do the chain rule.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.640
We could say that this could be
viewed as the derivative of

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.960
this inner function, of this
inner expression, so the

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.180
derivative of the inner
expression, I don't

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:35.970
know what that is.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.660
I'm not assuming
anything about it.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.720
I just don't know what it is.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.410
So I'll write it in
yellow right here.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.650
So it's equal to the
derivative with respect

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.080
to x of e to the x.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.080
I don't know what this is.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.350
I have no clue what this
is, and I haven't assumed

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.430
anything about what it is.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.150
I'm just using the chain rule.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.070
If the derivative of this
inside function with respect to

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.920
x, which is this right here,
times the derivative of this

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.410
outside function with respect
to the inside function.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.080
So the derivative of natural
log of x with respect

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.730
to x is 1 over x.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.160
So the derivative of natural
log of anything with

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.310
respect to anything is
1 over that anything.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.710
So it's going to be equal to --
so the derivative of natural

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.850
log of x with respect to e to
the x is equal to 1

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.190
over e to the x.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.860
Once again, I in no way
assumed this right here.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.920
So far in anything we've done,
we haven't assumed that.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.580
But clearly, my derivatives,
either way I solve it -- one

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.210
way I solve it I got 1.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.650
The other way, I kind
of didn't solve it.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.030
I got this expression
right here.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.226
They must be equal
to each other.

00:10:39.226 --> 00:10:40.760
So let me write that down.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.330
This must be equal to that.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.260
It's just we just looked at it
two different ways and got

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.620
two different results.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.340
But I still don't know
what this thing is.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.400
I just left it kind of open.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.010
I just said whatever
the derivative of e to

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.700
the x happens to be.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.480
But we know, since these two
expressions are equal, we know

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.150
that the derivative with
respect to x of whatever e to

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.635
the x -- so whatever the
derivative with respect to x of

00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:07.140
e to the x happens to be, we
know that when we multiply that

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.340
times 1 over e to the x --
that's when we just did the

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.960
chain rule -- that we should
get the same result as when we

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.930
approached the problem
the other way.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.840
That should be equal to this
approach because they're both

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.070
different ways of looking
at the derivative of the

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.530
natural log of e to the x.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.990
So that should be equal to 1.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.090
Well, we're almost there.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.650
We could just simplify this
and solve for our mystery

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.250
derivative of e to the x.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.520
Multiply both sides of this
equation by e to the x, and you

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.890
get the derivative with respect
to x of e to the x is

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.630
equal to e to the x.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.790
And I want to clarify this.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.650
At no point in this entire
proof, at no point

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.300
did I assume this.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.090
In fact, this is the
first time that I'm even

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.880
making the statement.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.080
I didn't have to assume this
when I showed you that the

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.850
derivative of the natural
log of x is 1 over x.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.580
And I didn't have to assume
this to kind of get to it.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.320
So in no way is this
proof circular.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.520
So anyway, I didn't want to
appear defensive, but I

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.080
wanted to clarify this up.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.080
Because I don't want to in any
way blame those who think that

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.910
my original proof was circular.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.370
It's my fault because I
didn't explain it properly.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.580
So hopefully this should
provide a little bit of

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.910
clarity on the issue.
