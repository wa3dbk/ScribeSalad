00:00:00.702 --> 00:00:01.535
- [Voiceover] Hey guys.

00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:02.683
There's one more thing
I need to talk about

00:00:02.683 --> 00:00:05.179
before I can describe the vectorized form

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:08.240
for the quadratic approximation
of multivariable functions

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.848
which is a mouthful to say

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:11.301
so let's say you have
some kind of expression

00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:14.046
that looks like a times x squared

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:15.633
and I'm thinking x is a variable

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.700
times b times xy,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.129
y is another variable,

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:21.214
plus c times y squared

00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:23.298
and I'm thinking of a, b
and c as being constants

00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:25.433
and x and y as being variables.

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:28.002
Now, this kind of
expression has a fancy name.

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.687
It's called a quadratic form.

00:00:30.687 --> 00:00:31.520
Quadratic

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:33.687
form.

00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:34.520
And that always threw me off.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.919
I always kind of was like, what,

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:37.034
what does form mean?

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:38.508
I know what a quadratic expression is

00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:40.552
and quadratic typically
means something is squared

00:00:40.552 --> 00:00:41.452
or you have two variables

00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:43.071
but why do they call it a form?

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:45.584
And basically it just means
that the only things in here

00:00:45.584 --> 00:00:46.564
are quadratic.

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:48.401
It's not the case that you have an x term

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:50.770
sitting on its own or a constant out here

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.896
like two when you're adding
all of those together

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:55.676
instead it's just you have
purely quadratic terms

00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:57.390
but of course, mathematicians
don't want to call it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.023
just a purely quadratic expression

00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:00.738
instead they have to give
a fancy name to things

00:01:00.738 --> 00:01:03.475
so that it seems more
intimidating than it needs to be

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:05.191
but anyways, so we have a quadratic form

00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.132
and the question is

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:09.316
how can we express this
in a vectorized sense?

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:11.240
And for analogy, let's
think about linear terms

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.644
where let's say you have a times x

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:15.451
plus b times y

00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:16.799
and I'll throw another variable in there,

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.288
another constant times another variable z.

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:20.434
If you see something like this

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:23.456
where every variable is just
being multiplied by a constant

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:25.622
and then you add terms
like that to each other,

00:01:25.622 --> 00:01:27.995
we can express this nicely with vectors

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:30.940
where you pile all of the
constants into their own vector,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.316
a vector containing a, b and c

00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:34.992
and you imagine the dot product

00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:37.309
between that and a vector that contains

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:38.755
all of the variable components,

00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:39.588
x, y and z

00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:43.536
and the convenience here is
then you can have just a symbol

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.090
like a v let's say

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.207
which represents this
whole constant vector

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.107
and then you can write down,

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.777
take the dot product between that

00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:51.531
and then have another symbol,

00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:53.204
maybe a bold faced x

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:56.682
which represents a vector that
contains all of the variables

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:58.683
and this way, your notation
just kind of looks like

00:01:58.683 --> 00:02:00.280
a constant times a variable

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.672
just like in the single variable world

00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:03.915
when you have a constant
number times a variable number,

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.915
it's kind of like taking a constant vector

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:07.387
times a variable vector.

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:09.148
And the importance of
writing things down like this

00:02:09.148 --> 00:02:10.338
is that v could be a vector

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:11.817
that contains not just three numbers

00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:13.043
but a hundred numbers

00:02:13.043 --> 00:02:15.857
and then x would have a
hundred corresponding variables

00:02:15.857 --> 00:02:18.204
and the notation doesn't
become any more complicated.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.762
It's generalizable at
the higher dimensions.

00:02:20.762 --> 00:02:21.595
So the question is

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:23.510
can be we do something similar like that

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.952
with our quadratic form?

00:02:24.952 --> 00:02:25.785
Because you can imagine

00:02:25.785 --> 00:02:27.896
let's say we started
introducing the variable z

00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:29.662
then you would have to
have some other term,

00:02:29.662 --> 00:02:33.039
some other constant times
the xz quadratic term

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.329
and then some other constant

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.244
times the z squared quadratic term

00:02:36.244 --> 00:02:38.353
and another one for the yz quadratic term

00:02:38.353 --> 00:02:39.254
and it would get out of hand

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:40.598
and as soon as you
start introducing things

00:02:40.598 --> 00:02:42.102
like a hundred variables,

00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:43.457
it would get seriously out of hand

00:02:43.457 --> 00:02:45.561
because there's a lot of
different quadratic terms

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:47.748
so we want a nice way to express this.

00:02:47.748 --> 00:02:50.616
And I'm just going to kind
of show you how we do it

00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:53.575
and then we'll work it through
to see why it makes sense.

00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:56.052
So usually, instead of
thinking of b times xy,

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:58.667
we actually think of this
as two times some constant

00:02:58.667 --> 00:02:59.733
times xy

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:01.258
and this of course
doesn't make a difference.

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:03.180
You would just change what b represents

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.504
but you'll see why it's more
convenient to write it this way

00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:06.932
in just a moment.

00:03:06.932 --> 00:03:10.177
So the vectorized way to describe
a quadratic form like this

00:03:10.177 --> 00:03:12.204
is to take a matrix,

00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:14.531
a two by two matrix since
this is two dimensions

00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:16.899
where a and c are in the diagonal

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.428
and then b is on the other diagonal

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:21.675
and we always think of these
as being symmetric matrices

00:03:21.675 --> 00:03:23.623
so if you imagine kind of
reflecting the whole matrix

00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:25.034
about this line,

00:03:25.034 --> 00:03:25.928
you'll get the same number

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:29.384
so it's important that we
have that kind of symmetry.

00:03:29.384 --> 00:03:32.053
And now what you do is
you multiply the vector,

00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:34.498
the variable vector that's got x, y

00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:36.627
on the right side of this matrix

00:03:36.627 --> 00:03:38.633
and then you multiply it again

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:40.715
but you turn it on its side

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:42.348
so instead of being a vertical vector,

00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:44.956
you transpose it to
being a horizontal vector

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:46.263
on the other side.

00:03:46.263 --> 00:03:47.655
And this is a little bit analogous too

00:03:47.655 --> 00:03:49.655
having two variables multiplied in.

00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:52.472
You have two vectors multiplied
in but on either side.

00:03:52.472 --> 00:03:53.763
And this is a good point by the way

00:03:53.763 --> 00:03:56.391
if you are uncomfortable
with matrix multiplication

00:03:56.391 --> 00:03:57.739
to maybe pause the video,

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.862
go find the videos about
matrix multiplication

00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:01.656
and kind of refresh or learn about that

00:04:01.656 --> 00:04:02.489
because moving forward,

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.322
I'm just going to assume

00:04:03.322 --> 00:04:05.963
that it's something you're familiar with.

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:08.435
So going about computing this,

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:11.275
first, let's tackle this
right multiplication here.

00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:14.318
We have a matrix multiplied by a vector.

00:04:14.318 --> 00:04:16.503
Well, the first component that we get,

00:04:16.503 --> 00:04:18.465
we're going to multiply the top row

00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:19.992
by each corresponding term in the vector

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:21.933
so it'll be a times x.

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:22.766
a times x

00:04:24.052 --> 00:04:25.302
plus b times y.

00:04:26.218 --> 00:04:28.768
Plus b times that second term y

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.359
and then similarly for the bottom term,

00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:31.997
we'll take the bottom row

00:04:31.997 --> 00:04:33.507
and multiply the corresponding terms

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:35.144
so b times x.

00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:35.977
b times x

00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:38.685
plus c times y.

00:04:39.797 --> 00:04:40.630
c times y.

00:04:43.027 --> 00:04:43.860
So that's what it looks like

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.480
when we do that right multiplication

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.359
and of course we've got to
keep our transposed vector

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:49.457
over there on the right,

00:04:49.457 --> 00:04:51.321
on the left side.

00:04:51.321 --> 00:04:52.629
So now, we have,

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.225
this is just a two by one vector now

00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:56.385
and this is a one by two.

00:04:56.385 --> 00:04:57.978
You could think of it
as a horizontal vector

00:04:57.978 --> 00:05:00.214
or a one by two matrix

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:02.172
but now when we multiply these guys,

00:05:02.172 --> 00:05:04.743
you just kind of line up
the corresponding terms.

00:05:04.743 --> 00:05:07.392
You'll have x multiplied by
that entire top expression

00:05:07.392 --> 00:05:10.903
so x multiplied by ax plus by.

00:05:10.903 --> 00:05:11.736
ax plus by

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.602
and then we add that to the second term y

00:05:17.602 --> 00:05:19.239
multiplied by the second term of this guy

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:20.790
which is bx plus cy

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.290
so y multiplied by

00:05:23.812 --> 00:05:24.645
bx plus cy

00:05:27.734 --> 00:05:29.898
and all of these are numbers
so we can simplify it

00:05:29.898 --> 00:05:32.024
once we start distributing the first term

00:05:32.024 --> 00:05:33.782
is x times a times x

00:05:33.782 --> 00:05:35.449
so that's ax squared

00:05:36.884 --> 00:05:39.788
and then the next term
is x times b times y

00:05:39.788 --> 00:05:41.538
so that's b times xy.

00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:45.752
Over here, we have y times b times x

00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:47.526
so that's the same thing as b times xy

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:49.061
so that's kind of why we have,

00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:50.778
why it's convenient to write a two there

00:05:50.778 --> 00:05:53.880
because that naturally
comes out of our expansion.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.777
And then the last term
is y times c times y

00:05:56.777 --> 00:05:58.527
so that's cy squared.

00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:02.299
So we get back the original quadratic form

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:04.474
that we were shooting for.

00:06:04.474 --> 00:06:07.801
ax squared plus two bxy plus cy squared

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.685
That's how this entire term expands.

00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:11.113
As you kind of work it through,

00:06:11.113 --> 00:06:14.384
you end up with the same
quadratic expression.

00:06:14.384 --> 00:06:17.403
Now, the convenience
of this quadratic form

00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:19.276
being written with a matrix like this

00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:20.847
is that we can write
this more abstractally

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:23.439
and instead of writing
the whole matrix in,

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:25.508
you could just let a letter like m

00:06:25.508 --> 00:06:26.964
represent that whole matrix

00:06:26.964 --> 00:06:29.267
and then take the vector
that represents the variable,

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:30.982
maybe a bold faced x

00:06:30.982 --> 00:06:32.665
and you would multiply it on the right

00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:34.900
and then you transpose it
and multiply it on the left

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.043
so typically you denote that

00:06:36.043 --> 00:06:38.447
by putting a little t as a superscript

00:06:38.447 --> 00:06:41.578
so x transposed multiplied by

00:06:41.578 --> 00:06:43.264
the matrix from the left

00:06:43.264 --> 00:06:45.007
and this expression,

00:06:45.007 --> 00:06:49.479
this is what a quadratic form
looks like in vectorized form

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:50.499
and the convenience is the same

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:51.973
as it was in the linear case.

00:06:51.973 --> 00:06:52.952
Just like v could represent

00:06:52.952 --> 00:06:54.954
something that had a hundred
different numbers in it

00:06:54.954 --> 00:06:56.994
and x would have a hundred
different constants,

00:06:56.994 --> 00:06:58.344
you could do something similar here

00:06:58.344 --> 00:07:01.285
where you can write that same expression

00:07:01.285 --> 00:07:03.449
even if the matrix m is super huge.

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:04.512
Let's just see what this would look like

00:07:04.512 --> 00:07:07.045
in a three dimensional circumstance so,

00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:08.502
actually, I'll need more room

00:07:08.502 --> 00:07:10.072
so I'll go down even further.

00:07:10.072 --> 00:07:14.136
So we have x transpose
multiplied by the matrix

00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:16.597
multiplied by x, bold faced x

00:07:16.597 --> 00:07:18.573
and let's say instead this represented,

00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:20.906
you have x then y then z,

00:07:22.132 --> 00:07:23.719
our transposed vector

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:24.986
and then our matrix,

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.736
our matrix let's say was a, b, c,

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:32.506
d, e, f and because it
needs to be symmetric,

00:07:32.506 --> 00:07:34.666
whatever term is in this spot here

00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:36.053
needs to be the same as over here

00:07:36.053 --> 00:07:38.180
kind of when you reflect
it about that diagonal.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.915
Similarly, c, that's going
to be the same term here

00:07:40.915 --> 00:07:42.525
and e would be over here.

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:45.485
So there's only really six
free terms that you have

00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:47.529
but if fills up this entire matrix

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:48.362
and then on the right side,

00:07:48.362 --> 00:07:50.025
we would multiply that by

00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:50.858
x, y, z.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.958
Now, I won't work it out in this video

00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.869
but you can imagine actually
multiplying this matrix

00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:58.901
by this vector

00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:01.388
and then multiplying the
corresponding vector that you get

00:08:01.388 --> 00:08:03.109
by this transposed vector

00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:04.994
and you'll get some kind of quadratic form

00:08:04.994 --> 00:08:06.143
with three variables

00:08:06.143 --> 00:08:08.427
and the point is you'll
get a very complicated one

00:08:08.427 --> 00:08:10.751
but it's very simple to
express things like this.

00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:11.811
So with that tool in hand,

00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:12.644
in the next video,

00:08:12.644 --> 00:08:14.629
I will talk about how
we can use this notation

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:16.957
to express the quadratic approximations

00:08:16.957 --> 00:08:18.438
for multivariable functions.

00:08:18.438 --> 00:08:19.271
See you then.
