00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:03.704
Why does sweating cool you down?

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:06.774
That is an excellent question LeBron,

00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:11.345
and to answer it, let's zoom in on a little droplet of sweat.

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:15.583
And sweat is mostly water, so when we zoom in, and we've really zoomed in,

00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:16.083
even more than I've drawn over here.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:21.288
When we really zoom in, we'll start seeing mainly these water molecules.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.757
And the water molecules, just to be a little more accurate,

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:29.964
I've drawn the oxygen in blue, and then the hydrogens that are bonded with that oxygen I've done in white.

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:36.961
We all know that water is sometimes refered to as H2 -- that's for the two hydrogens -- H20.

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:42.009
So each of these are a molecule of H2O, or a molecule of water.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:47.348
What I've drawn down here, and this is an oversimplification of the molecules of your skin,

00:00:47.348 --> 00:00:52.620
but just for simplification, these are molecules of your skin.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.856
really, the parts of the skin cells. These aren't even the skin cells themselves,

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:58.692
these are the molecules that make up the skin cells.

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:05.927
And right over here, these are molecules of sweat, or it's really just molecules of water.

00:01:05.927 --> 00:01:10.504
So the question of why does sweat cool you down could really be restated as:

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:15.476
Why does having water on the surface of your skin actually cool you down?

00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:18.445
And to answer that, or to think about that question,

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:22.516
we have to think about what it means to have temperature, or what temperature even really means.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:28.756
Temperature, what we perceive as temperature, is really just the motion of the molecules of something.

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:32.126
So higher temperature means that they're moving around more.

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:36.630
So high temperature they're moving around more, and low temperature they're moving around less.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.332
And they can move around in different ways,

00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:42.670
they can have translational motion, which is they're actually moving around.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.540
They could be vibrating. They could be rotating in some way.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.981
And in general, on average, the more of this motional energy, often referred to as kinetic energy,

00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:58.986
that these molecules have on average, the higher the perceived temperature would be.

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:03.457
Now, how does having this water here cool down the skin?

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.726
And well, first of all, why is the skin warming up?

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:09.275
Because the muscles are doing all of this work. They're releasing heat.

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:11.811
That heat is being transferred to the skin.

00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:15.336
But then how does having this water here help?

00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:19.506
Well, the skin has a certain temperature, a certain kinetic energy, or motional energy.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:25.579
But when we say that it doesn't mean that all of these molecules have the exact same motion.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:32.739
The temperature is the average motion. Some of these are bumping around at a faster speed.

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.856
Or vibrating at a faster speed, or rotating at a faster speed

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:38.025
Some are doing it at a slower speed.

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:43.130
But as these bump around, they're going to bump into these water molecules and get them moving around.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.133
They would probably be moving around a little bit to begin with,

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:50.037
but then the warmer this is, the more energy here, they'll bump into these molecules.

00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:53.941
So let's say this guy bumps into that, then he'll bump over there ,

00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:58.011
so that energy, this bumping energy, or this kinetic energy,

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.848
well, some of it will be transferred, or you could even say some of that temperature,

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:06.372
some of that heat will be transferred to these water molecules.

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:11.358
But the important thing to remember is this is a really kind of crazy thing, they're all bumping into eachother

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.061
and rotating in all sorts of crazy ways.

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:18.098
They will have an average kinetic energy, which we perceive as temperature,

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:22.970
but this one might be going really, really, really fast in that direction,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.839
while this one might be going really, really, really slow,

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.276
this one might be going really really really fast in that direction

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:33.147
this one might be going really slow in this direction

00:03:33.147 --> 00:03:41.193
So the thing to think about is, given that you have all of this variation in the energy of each of these particles,

00:03:41.193 --> 00:03:46.059
which of these are most likely to escape, to actually evaporate?

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.663
And to think about evaporation, you just have to think about that most water molecules

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:52.232
or the water molecules that are in that droplet

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:56.640
they do have an attraction to eachother, we call those hydrogen bonds.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.274
They do have an attraction to eachother,

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:02.543
that's why a droplet kind of sticks together.

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:07.347
But if one of these molecules is moving fast enough and if it's moving in the right direction

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:10.684
it has a higher probability of being able to escape,

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:13.287
being able to actually escape that droplet.

00:04:13.287 --> 00:04:18.592
And the process of these molecules actually escaping, that's what we refer to as evaporation.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:24.965
If a molecule has enough energy it will escape this, escape the bonds of the other water molecules,

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:31.538
and just evaporate into the air.

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:34.041
But we still haven't fully answered our question.

00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:38.078
So let's say that this is one that has evaporated, it has fully escaped.

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:42.583
Why would that actually cool down this entire system?

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:49.556
Why would it cool down the droplet and essentially give it more capability to accept more energy from the skin?

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:55.229
Well, we just said the ones that have the highest energy are the ones that are most likely to escape,

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.098
the ones that have the highest kinetic energy.

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:02.402
So if you have a bunch of stuff, some are fast, some are slow, some are vibrating a lot, vibrating less

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:08.942
but the ones that have a high kinetic energy are the most likely to escape, what happens when they escape?

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:11.879
Well then the average kinetic energy will go down.

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:17.985
Or you could say the temperature would go down,

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:24.024
which is really just the average amount of motion or kinetic energy that's in this droplet.

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:28.529
If the really fast ones, the ones with a lot of energy, are leaving, then the ones are left over, on average,

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:33.000
are going to have a lower kinetic energy, or a lower temperature.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.172
And so that is what is cooling you down at a molecular level.
