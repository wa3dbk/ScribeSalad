00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.930
A lot of what you'll learn in
differential equations is

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.640
really just different
bags of tricks.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.930
And in this video I'll show
you one of those tricks.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.360
And it's useful beyond this.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.050
Because it's always good when,
if maybe one day, you become a

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.129
mathematician or a physicist,
and you

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.500
have an unsolved problem.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.890
Some of these tricks that solved
simpler problems back

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.950
in your education might be a
useful trick that solves some

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.730
unsolved problems. So
it's good to see it.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.260
And if you're taking
differential equations, it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.240
might be on an exam.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.910
So it's good to learn.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.140
So we'll learn about integrating
factors.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.810
So let's say, we have an
equation that has this form.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.120
Let's say this is my
differential equation.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.610
3xy-- I'm trying to write it
neatly as possible-- plus y

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:58.540
squared plus x squared plus xy
times y prime is equal to 0.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.950
So, especially since we've
covered this in recent videos,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.700
whenever you see an equation
of this form where you have

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.310
some function of xy, then you
have another function of x and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.350
y times y prime equals 0, you
said, oh, this looks like this

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.440
could be an exact differential
equation.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.680
And how do we test that?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.460
Well, we can take the partial
derivative of this with

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.120
respect to y, and we
could call this

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.990
function of x and y, M.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.470
So the partial of that, with
respect to y, so M partial

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.760
with respect to y, would
be 3x plus 2y.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.670
And if this function right here,
that expression right

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.530
there, that's our function
N, which is a

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.740
function of x and y.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.520
We take the partial with respect
to x, and we get that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.776
is equal to 2x plus y.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.620
And in order for this to have
been an exact differential

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.440
equation, the partial of this
with respect to y would have

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.170
to equal the partial of this
with respect to x.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.120
But we see here, just by looking
at these two, they

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.510
don't equal each other.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.600
They're not equal.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.150
So, at least superficially, the
way we looked at it just

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.940
now, this is not an exact
differential equation.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.410
But what if there were some
factor, or I guess some

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.710
function that we could multiply
both sides of this

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.980
equation by, that would
make it an exact

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.150
differential equation?

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
So let's call that mu.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.790
So what I want to do is I want
to multiply both sides of this

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.970
equation by some function mu,
and then see if I can solve

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.320
for that function mu that
would make it exact.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.260
So let's try to do that.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.450
So let's multiply both
sides by mu.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.360
And just as a simplification,
mu could be a

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.560
function of x and y.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.670
It could be a function of x.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.560
It could be a function
of just x.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.270
It could be function
of just y.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.880
I'll assume it's just
a function of x.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.810
You could assume it's just
a function of y and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.810
try to solve it.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.150
Or you could just assume it's
a function of x and y.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.710
If you assume it's a function
of x and y, it becomes a lot

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.500
harder to solve for.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.340
But that doesn't mean that
there isn't one.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.530
So let's say that mu
is a function of x.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.340
And I want to multiply it by
both of these equations.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:16.910
So I get mu of x times 3xy plus
y squared plus mu of x

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.460
times x squared plus
xy times y prime.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.750
And then, what's 0 times
any function?

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.990
Well, it's just going
to be 0, right?

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.010
0 times mu of x is just
going to be 0.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.160
But I did multiply the right
hand side times mu of x.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.720
And remember what we're doing.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.220
This mu of x is-- when we
multiply it, the goal is,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.640
after multiplying both sides
of the equation by it, we

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.210
should have an exact equation.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.180
So now, if we consider this
whole thing our new M, the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.960
partial derivative of this with
respect to y should be

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.070
equal to the partial derivative
of this with

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.570
respect to x.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.550
So what's the partial derivative
of this with

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.490
respect to y?

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.280
Well, if we're taking the
partial with respect to y

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.550
here, mu of x, which is only
a function of x, it's not a

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.570
function of y, it's just
a constant term, right?

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.060
We take a partial with respect
to y. x is just a constant, or

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.730
a function of x can be viewed
just as a constant.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.779
So the partial of this with
respect to y is going to be

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:31.170
equal to mu of x, you could just
say, times 3x plus 2y.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.940
That's the partial of this
with respect to y.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.010
And what's the partial of
this with respect to x?

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.110
Well, here, we'll use
the product rule.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.810
So we'll take the derivative of
the first expression with

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.370
respect to x. mu of x is no
longer a constant anymore,

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.050
since we're taking the partial
with respect to x.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.350
So the derivative of mu of
x with respect to x.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.470
Well, that's just mu prime
of x, mu prime, not U.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.980
mu prime of x.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.975
mu is the Greek letter.

00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:02.560
It's for the muh sound, but
it looks a lot like a U.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.450
So mu prime of x times a second
expression, x squared

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.570
plus xy, plus just the
first expression.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.150
This is just the product
rule, mu of x.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.410
Times the derivative of
the second expression

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.390
with respect to x.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:26.900
So times-- ran out of space
on that line-- 2x plus y.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.760
And now for this new equation,
where I multiplied

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.690
both sides by mu.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.810
In order for this to be exact,
these two things have to be

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.300
equal to each other.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.960
So let's just remember
the big picture.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.790
We're kind of saying, this
is going to be exact.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.340
And now, we're going to
try to solve for mu.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.070
So let's see if we
can do that.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:57.310
So let's see, on this side, we
have mu of x times 3x plus 2y.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.210
And let's subtract this
expression from both sides.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:07.050
So it's minus mu of
x times 2x plus y.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.850
You'll see a lot of these
differential equation problems

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.470
that get kind of hairy.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.100
They're really just
a lot of algebra.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.350
And that equals-- what
do we have left?

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.780
I'll write it in yellow.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.270
That equals-- I'm going
to run out of space.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.700
I'm going to do it a
little bit lower.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.670
That equals, just this
term right here.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:29.830
That equals mu prime of x
times x squared plus xy.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.020
And let's see, if we factor out
a mu of x here, we get mu

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:46.860
of x times 3x plus 2y minus 2x
minus y is equal to mu prime

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.780
of x, the derivative of mu with
respect to x, times x

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.085
squared plus xy.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.200
Now, we can simplify this.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:05.520
So we get mu of x times-- what
is this-- 3x minus 2x is x.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.840
2y minus y, so x plus y, is
equal to-- and I'm just going

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.130
to simplify this side a
little bit-- is equal

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.960
to mu prime of x.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.950
Let's factor out an x here.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.260
And the reason why I'm doing
that is because it seems like

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.630
if I factor out an x here,
I'll get an x plus y.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:29.180
So this is mu prime of x
times x times x plus y.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.710
x times x plus y is
x squared plus xy.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.160
So that's why I did it, and I
have this x plus y on both

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.540
sides equation, which I will
now divide both sides by.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.560
So if you divide both sides by
x plus y, we could maybe

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.240
assume that it's not 0.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.850
That simplifies things
pretty dramatically.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:54.710
We get mu of x is equal to
mu prime of x times x.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.730
And now, just the way my brain
works, I like to rewrite this

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.440
expression just in our operator
form, where instead

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.930
of writing it mu prime
of x, we could write

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.660
that as d mu dx.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.790
So let's do that.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:17.420
So we could write mu of x is
equal to d, the derivative of

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:22.250
mu with respect to x, times x.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.970
And this is actually a separable
differential

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.520
equation in and of itself.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.320
It's kind of a sub-differential
equation to

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.290
solve our broader one.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.840
We're just trying to figure
out the integrating factor

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.720
right here.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.039
So let's divide both
sides by x.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:41.600
So we get mu over x, this is
just a separable equation now,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.010
is equal to d mu dx.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.790
And then, let's divide both
sides by mu of x, and we get 1

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:57.220
over x is equal to 1 over mu.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.490
That's mu of x, I'll just write
1 over mu right now, for

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.810
simplicity, times d mu dx.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.080
I'm actually going to go
horizontal right here.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:12.150
Multiply both sides by dx, you
get 1 over x dx is equal to 1

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.170
over mu of x d mu.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.670
Now, you could integrate both
sides of this, and you'll get

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.890
the natural log of the absolute
value of x is equal

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.830
to the natural log of the
absolute value of mu, et

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.250
cetera, et cetera.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.660
But it should be pretty clear
from this that x is equal to

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.070
mu, or mu is equal
to x, right?

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:29.930
They're identical.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.400
If you look at both sides of
this equation there, you can

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.160
just change x for mu, and it
becomes the other side.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.560
So, this is obviously telling us
that mu of x is equal to x.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.650
Or mu is equal to x.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.590
So we have our integrating
factor.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.470
And if you want, you can take
the antiderivative of both

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.310
sides with the natural logs,
and all of that.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.870
And you'll get the
same answer.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.270
But this is just, by looking at
it, by inspection, you know

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.420
that mu is equal to x.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.500
Because both sides of
this equation are

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.180
completely the same.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.810
Anyway, we now have our
integrating factor.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.300
But I am running out of time.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.230
So in the next video, we're
now going to use this

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.010
integrating factor.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.650
Multiply it times our original
differential equation.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:10.690
Make it exact.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.110
And then solve it as
an exact equation.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.540
I'll see you in the
next video.
