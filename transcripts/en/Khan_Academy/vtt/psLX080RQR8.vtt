00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.170
I've already made one video on
it, and at least it attempts

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.000
to give you the intuition behind
how the equilibrium

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.960
constant formula is derived
or where it comes from.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.610
From maybe the probabilities
of different molecules

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.220
interacting, if they're
in some small volume.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.700
But I think I was a little
hand wavy with it, and it

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.410
might not have been clear
how probabilities and

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.510
concentrations relate.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.070
So what I thought I would do
in this video is kind of do

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.790
the same exercise, but do it
with real numbers and a real

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.760
reaction, so just a's,
b's and c's.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.000
So what I wrote here is
the Haber process.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.070
This is how we get ammonia in
the world and feed everyone.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.830
Ammonia is a very important
fertilizer, but

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.670
that's beside the point.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.480
The Haber process, which you
see right here, is in

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.740
equilibrium, which doesn't mean
that the concentrations

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.100
are the same.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.780
In fact, this is an equilibrium
concentration that

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.380
I worked out before starting
this video.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.540
Notice, the concentrations of
nitrogen and hydrogen are very

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.080
different than the concentration
of ammonia,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.080
which is much less.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.190
What equilibrium tells us is
that once we get to this

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.950
concentration of nitrogen and
hydrogen, the rate of reaction

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.720
of going in the rightward
direction is the same as the

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.180
rate of reaction of going in the
leftward direction, when

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.920
we have this much ammonia.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.510
So let's just think about what
that rate of reaction means.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.360
And then I'll tell you
how I think about it.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.770
At least how I think about it is
that if you have some small

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.560
volume-- Let's call that dV.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.300
You could kind of arbitrarily
pick how small.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.570
So dV.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.720
And the way it works in my head
is that if you pick some

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.890
small volume in this solution--
we don't know how

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.050
large of a solution we actually
have. We just have

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.230
the concentrations-- that in
this volume, you're just as

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.720
likely to have a reaction going
into that direction as

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.090
you are to have a reaction
going in

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.065
the backwards direction.

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:53.570
So let's think about what the
probability is of having a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.660
reaction in this volume.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.180
So the probability, let's say
of the forward reaction.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:07.370
Probability of N2 plus
3H2, going in

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.820
this forward direction.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.759
And whatever I do for this
direction, then you just have

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.590
to use the same logic for
the backward direction.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.980
I just want to give you the
intuition that it's equal to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.190
some constant related to
their concentration.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:27.190
So the probability of going in
that direction to 2NH3 in our

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.300
little box, I claim-- and I
think this will hopefully make

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.320
some sense-- it's equal to
first, the probability that

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.700
they react given in the box.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.650
So if you know that if you
have the constituent

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.000
particles, you have one nitrogen
molecule-- which has

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
two nitrogen atoms in it-- and
three hydrogen molecules.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.530
If you know you have those,
there's some probability that

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.010
they're going to react based
on their configurations and

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.940
their kinetic energy and how
they're approaching each other

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.740
and all of these different
types of things.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.900
So this is the probability they
react given that they're

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.040
in this little box of dV.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.900
And then, of course, you're
going to have to multiply that

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.000
times the probability in the
box, that you have the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.980
constituent particles
in the box.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.520
Now, my claim is that
this piece right

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.770
here, this is a constant.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.180
If you know at a certain
temperature, the Haber

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.600
process, these concentrations,
this would happen at 300

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.230
degrees Celsius-- I just
looked that up.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.950
No need to memorize something
like this.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.510
But equilibrium constants hold
at a certain temperature.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.160
So I'm claiming that if I give
you a temperature-- say, 300

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.390
degrees Celsius-- and if I
tell you that I have one

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.040
nitrogen and three molecules of
hydrogen in your box, that

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.500
there's some constant
probability that they react.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.770
I mean, it depends on their
configuration and all of that.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.870
So I'll just call this the
constant-- I'll just make up a

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.200
constant probability, whatever
it is, or in the box.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.520
I could write anything there.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.520
So what we should be concerned
with is what is the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.360
probability that we have those
four molecules-- three

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.190
molecules of hydrogen
and two molecules of

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.089
nitrogen-- in the box.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:21.829
So this is equal to
some constant.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.140
I'll call it the constant of
probability of react-- or let

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.420
me say react.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.150
That's a good one: react.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.710
The constant of reaction-- if
you have it in the box-- times

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.765
the probability that
they're in the box.

00:04:35.765 --> 00:04:37.320
Let me draw the box.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.390
So we want to know the
probability, where this box is

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.905
just some volume, that I have
three hydrogen molecules.

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:50.450
So one, two, three.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.030
And one nitrogen molecule.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.990
And we should pick a box that's
small enough so that

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.590
that would be indicative of how
close the molecules need

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.190
to get to actually react.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.720
So I'm just going to pick my
dV to be-- I don't know.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.680
Let's pick my dV to be-- I
looked up the diameter of an

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.240
ammonia molecule.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.600
It was about 1/10
of a nanometer.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.950
If this was a nanometer box,
you could put 10 in each

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.500
direction, so you can almost fit
1,000 if you packed them

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.570
really tightly.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.280
So let's make this half a
nanometer in each direction.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.610
So if I pick my dV-- and
remember, I don't know if this

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.180
is the right distance.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.630
I'm just trying to give you
the intuition behind the

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.180
equilibrium formula.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.700
But if I pick this as being
0.5 nanometers by 0.5

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:51.770
nanometers by 0.5 nanometers,
what is my volume?

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.980
So my little volume is going
to be 0.5 times 10 to the

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.030
minus 1/9 meters-- that's a
nanometer-- to the third

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.550
power, because we're dealing
with cubic meters.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.320
So this is equal to 0.5
to the 1/3 power.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.750
That's what?

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:17.500
0.5 times 0.5 is 0.25
times 0.5 is 0.125.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.490
I want to do the math right, so
let me just make sure I got

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.810
that right.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.890
0.5 to the 1/3 power.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:29.630
Right, 0.125 times-- negative
9 to the 1/3 power is minus

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.650
27-- 10 to the minus
27 meters cubed.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.450
So that's my volume.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.870
Now, we know the
concentration.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.920
Let's figure out what's
the probability.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.350
So this is the probability
in the box, right?

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.712
That's what we're concerned
with, the

00:06:43.712 --> 00:06:45.190
probability in the box.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.200
Well, the probability in the
box, that's the probability

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.980
that I have one hydrogen in the
box, times the probability

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.940
that I have another hydrogen
in the box, times the

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.490
probability that I have another
hydrogen in the box--

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.050
these are all in-the-box
probabilities-- times the

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.710
probability that I have
a nitrogen in the box.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.430
I'll do the nitrogen in a
different color just to ease--

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.060
oh, I should've done these in
the orange because those are

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.750
the color of the molecules
up there.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.640
And I'll do this
one in purple.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.900
What's the probability of having
hydrogen in the box?

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.100
Well, we know hydrogen's
concentration at equilibrium

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.810
is 2 Molar.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.740
So concentration of hydrogen,
we know hydrogen's

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:37.030
concentration is equal to 2
Molar, which is 2 Moles per

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:42.540
liter, which is equal to-- 2
Moles is just 2 times 6 times

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.820
10 to the twenty-third power--
Moles is just a number--

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.530
divided by liters.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:56.760
So 1 liter is-- we could write
it in meters cubed, or we

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.560
could just make the
conversion.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.730
Actually, let me just
do this for you.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:06.200
1 liter is equal to 1 times 10
to the minus 3 meters cubed.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.890
If you actually take a meter
cubed, you can actually put

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:12.480
1,000 liters in there.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:20.720
So the other way you could say
this is 1 times 10 to the

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.560
minus 3 meters cubed, and then
if we want to figure out our

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:33.440
dV times-- how many dV's do
we have per meter cubed?

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.190
Or how many meter cubes
are their per dV?

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:41.760
So we know that already, so
it's 0.125 times 10 to the

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:49.620
minus 27 meters cubed per
our volume, right?

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.220
I just got that from up here,
that I have a small fraction

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.710
of a meter cubed
per my volume.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.880
And now, I just have
to do some math.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.940
So let's see, I can cancel out
some things first, because

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.116
there's a lot of
exponents here.

00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:09.880
So let's see, if I take the
twenty-third-- so let me write

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.900
it out here.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:18.540
So my hydrogen per box-- So my
concentration of hydrogen per

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:26.100
dV, is equal to 12 times
10-- whoops!

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.943
That's not helping when
my pen malfunctions.

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.260
Let me get that right.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:39.220
12 times 10 to the twenty-third
power times 0.125

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.110
times 10 to the minus
twenty-seventh power.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:47.060
All of that divided by 10
to the minus 3, right?

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.330
That's 1 times 10
to the minus 3.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.690
So let's cancel out
some exponents.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.840
If we get rid of the minus 3
here, you divide by minus 3,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.180
then this becomes minus 24.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.610
And then the minus 24 and the
minus-- so this is equal to--

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.720
what's 12 times 1.25?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:12.150
So times 12 is equal to 1.5.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:17.170
So the 12 times the 1.25 is
equal to 1.5 times-- and then

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.020
10 to the twenty-third times 10
to the minus twenty-fourth

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.790
is equal to 10 to the
minus 1, right?

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.740
So it's just divided by 10.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:35.310
So on average, your
concentration of hydrogen in a

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.510
little cube that's half a
nanometer in each direction is

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:50.650
equal to 0.15 molecules-- not
Moles anymore-- of hydrogen

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:55.860
molecule per my little
dV, my little box.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.590
And so this is a probability,
right?

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.160
This is a probability, because
obviously I can't have 0.15

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.480
molecules in every box.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.270
This is just saying, on average,
there's a 0.15 chance

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.430
that I have a hydrogen
molecule in my box.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:15.010
So if I want to go back here to
this, this is 0.15, this is

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.360
0.15, this is 0.15.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.060
But how did we get this 0.15?

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:28.350
We multiplied the concentration
of hydrogen,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.290
which was this right here.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:37.910
That's the concentration of
the hydrogen-- I should've

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.140
written it in a more vibrant
color-- times just a bunch of

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.840
scaling factors, right?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.170
We could just say that, well,
this was just equal to the

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.120
concentration of hydrogen times,
based on how I picked

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.520
my dV, I had to do all
of this scaling.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.700
But it was times some constant
of scaling, scaling to my

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.250
appropriate factor.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:00.000
So if we want to figure out each
of these, this is just

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.910
the concentration of hydrogen
times some scaling factor.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.680
And this is going to
be the same thing.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.300
We could do the same exercise
right here.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.000
We figured out the exact value
with the hydrogen, but you

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.430
could do the same thing
with the nitrogen.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:19.310
In fact, nitrogen's
concentration is just half of

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.630
the hydrogen, so we know it.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.760
It's going to be half of that
0.15, so it's going to be

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.600
0.075, which is just equal to
the concentration of nitrogen

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.780
times some scaling factor.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.600
It's actually going to be
the same scaling factor.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.810
So let's go back to our
original problem.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.590
So our probability that the
forward reaction is going to

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.520
occur in the box is going to be
equal to some probability

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.140
that is going to react-- given
that you're on the box, that's

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.870
some constant value-- times the
probability that they're

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.920
in the box.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.030
And I'm making the claim that
that's equal to all of these

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.400
things multiplied
by each other.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.010
So that's the concentration of
hydrogen times some scaling

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.510
factor, some other scaling
factor-- I'll call it K sub

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.990
s-- times the concentration of
hydrogen times some scaling

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.440
factor, times the concentration
of hydrogen

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.230
times some scaling factor, times
the concentration of

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.390
nitrogen times some
scaling factor.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.190
And what is that equal to?

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.890
Well, if you combine all the
constants, a bunch of scaling

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.590
constants times the constant
out here, that all just

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.310
becomes a constant.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:31.640
So you get the probability of
the forward reaction in the

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.450
box is going to be equal to
just some constant-- let's

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.500
just call it constant
forward-- times the

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.780
concentration of the hydrogen
to the third power-- I

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.130
multiplied it three
times-- times the

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.820
concentration of nitrogen.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.160
Now, if you wanted to go in
the reverse direction,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.060
probability of reverse, you
could use the exact same

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.680
argument that I just used, and
I'm not going to do it just

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.760
for the sake of time, but
it'll be some constant.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.790
This is the constant that the
ammonia will react in the

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.350
reverse direction on its own,
times the scaling factor, and

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.800
all of that.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.690
But it's the same exact idea.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:18.000
So, times the reverse, which is
just going to be-- How many

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.800
Moles of ammonia do we have?

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.000
Or how many molecules?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.090
What's its stoichiometric
coefficient?

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.100
It's 2.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.860
So the reverse direction is
going to be concentration of

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.580
ammonia to the second power.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.860
And when we're in equilibrium,
these two things, the

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.050
probability of having a forward
reaction in the box,

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.030
is going to be equal to the
probability of a reverse

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.490
reaction the box.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.220
So these two things are going
to equal each other.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.320
So this is going to equal-- if
I could just copy and paste

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.640
it-- that up there.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.990
There you go.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.740
Then if you set the constants
equal to each other, and then

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.700
you could pick what the-- you
normally put the products on

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.130
the right-hand side
of the equation.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.620
So I'll take these and divide
them into this, and I'll

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:14.970
divide that into that, and
you're left with KF/KR is

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:23.540
equal to the concentration of
ammonia to the second power,

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.080
divided by the concentration
of hydrogen to the third

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.730
power, times the concentration
of nitrogen.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.310
And you could call that the
equilibrium constant.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.100
And there you have it.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.130
A pseudo-derived formula for
the equilibrium constant.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.790
It's all, at least in my mind,
coming from common sense, from

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.490
the probability that if you have
a small volume, things

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.690
are actually going to react.
