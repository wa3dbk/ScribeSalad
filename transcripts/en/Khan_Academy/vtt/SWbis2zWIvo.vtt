00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.240
We know what an orthonormal
basis is, but the next obvious

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.160
question is, what are
they good for?

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.100
And one of the many answers to
that question is that they

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.670
make for good coordinate
systems or

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.560
good coordinate bases.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.630
For example, the standard
basis, or the standard

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.270
coordinates-- Let me write
the standard basis in Rn.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:38.160
So if we're dealing with Rn--
So the standard basis for Rn

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.310
is equal to-- Well, I could
write it as e1, e2, and all of

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.280
that, but I'll actually
write out the vectors.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.580
You know, e1 is just 1 with a
bunch of 0's all the way.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.780
And this is going to be n 0's
right there. e2 is going to be

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.600
0, 1 with a bunch of
0's all the way.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.590
And then you're going to go all
the way to en, which is

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.550
going to have a bunch of 0's.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.510
And then you're going
to have a 1.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.270
The standard basis that we've
been dealing with throughout

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.280
this playlist is an orthonormal
set, is an

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.275
orthonormal basis.

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:23.490
Clearly the length of any
of these guys is 1.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.870
If you were to take this guy
dotted with yourself, you're

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.410
going to get 1 times 1, plus a
bunch of 0's times each other.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.690
So it's going to
be one squared.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.560
It's going to be 1.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.210
And that's true of any
of these guys.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.380
And clearly they're
orthogonal.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.695
You take the dot product of any
of these guys with any of

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:38.870
the other one's, you're going
to get a 1 times 0, and a 1

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.970
times 0, and then
a bunch of 0's.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.070
You're going to get 0's.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.590
So they clearly each
have lengths of 1.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.790
And they're all orthogonal.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.740
And clearly, this is a good
coordinate system.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.570
But what about other
orthonormal bases.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.210
Obviously this is one specific
example I need to show you

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.080
that all orthonormal bases
make for good coordinate

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.620
systems. So let's say I have
some set, some orthonormal set

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.000
of vectors.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.870
So this is v1, v2, all
the way to vk.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:34.250
And it is an orthonormal basis
for some subspace V.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.810
And this is a k-dimensional
subspace, because you have k

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.140
basis vectors in your
basis, or you have k

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.290
vectors in your basis.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.730
Now let's experiment with
this a little bit.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.160
I'm claiming that the coordinate
system, with

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.410
respect to this, is good.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.920
But what does it mean
to be good?

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.460
I mean, the standard basis is
good, but, you know, that's

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.070
just because we use it and it
seems to be easy to deal with.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.300
But let's see, when
I say good in this

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.060
context, what do I mean?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.090
So let's experiment.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.670
If I say that some vector x is a
member of V, that means that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.400
x can be represented as a linear
combination of these

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.890
characters up here.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.690
So x can be represented as some
constant times v1, plus

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.150
some constant times v2, plus,
you know, the ith constant

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.850
times vi, all the way, if you
just keep going, all the way

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.690
to the kth constant times vk.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.110
That's what being a member
of the subspace means.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.775
The subspace is spanned by these
guys, so this guy can be

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:42.270
represented as a linear
combination of those guys.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.525
Now what happens if we take the
dot product of both sides

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:48.400
of this equation with vi?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.830
So I'm going to take vi, I'm
going to dot both of these

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.250
sides with vi.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.430
So I get vi, dotted with x, is
going to be equal to what?

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.990
Well it's going to be-- we could
just put the constants

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:07.190
out --it's going to be c1 times
vi, dot v1, plus c2

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:16.720
times vi dot v2, plus all the
way to ci, times vi dot vi,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.899
and then you keep going,
plus all the way to ck,

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.720
times vi dot vk.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.410
Now, this is an orthonormal
set.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.690
That means, if I take two
vectors that are different

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.340
than each other in our basis
right here, that if you take

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.140
their dot product, you're
going to get 0.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.980
They're orthogonal
to each other.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.560
So these are two different
vectors in our set.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.340
They're going to be orthogonal,
so this term is

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.990
going to be 0.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.690
It's going to be 0 times c1,
so it's going to be 0.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.580
This term is also going to be
0, assuming that i isn't 2.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.250
Let's just assume that.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.375
This term over here, let's
assume that i isn't k.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.480
It's also going to
be equal to 0.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.610
So all of the terms are going
to be 0, except for the case

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.820
where v sub i is equal to, well,
in this case, v sub i.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.410
Except for the case where
this subscript is

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.810
equal to that subscript.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.420
And then what is v sub
i, dot v sub i?

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.100
You know, orthonormal
has two parts.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.560
They're orthogonal to each
other, and they're each

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.850
normalized, or they each
have length 1.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.340
So v sub i, dot v sub i, dot
with v sub i is going to be

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.630
equal to 1.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.950
So this whole equation has
simplified to v sub i-- which

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.620
is one of these guys, it's the
ith member of our basis set

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.290
--dot x-- where x is just any
member of the subspace --is

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.780
equal to the only thing that's
left over is 1 times ci.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.840
So it's just equal to ci.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.710
Now why is this useful?

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.300
You know, we were just
experimenting around, and we

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.570
got this nice little
result here.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.800
Why is this useful in terms of
having a coordinate system

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.650
with respect to this basis?

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.910
So let's remind ourselves what
a coordinate system is here.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.160
So if we wanted to represent
the vector x, which is a

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.100
member of our subspace, with
coordinates that are with

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.050
respect to this basis of the
subspace-- Right, a subspace

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.910
can have many bases,
but this is the

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.400
basis that we're choosing.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.990
So we want to write x with
respect to the basis B.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.960
What do we do?

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.250
The coordinates are just going
to be, the coefficients on the

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.830
different basis vectors.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.710
This is all a bit of review.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.350
It's going to be c1, c2, we're
going to go down to ci, and

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.550
then you're going all
the way to ck.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.040
You're going to have k terms,
because this is a

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.070
k-dimensional subspace.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.570
Now normally this is not such
an easy thing to figure out.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.295
If I give you some vector x-- I
mean, we've seen it before.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.470
Well, if you have x represented
in B coordinate

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.460
system, then you can multiply
it times the change of basis

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.830
matrix, and you can just
get regular x.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:10.610
But if have regular x, and you
need to find this, one, if C

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.660
is invertible, then you can
apply this equation right

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.020
here, which isn't
always the case.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.645
This is only if C
is invertible.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.880
And, first of all, C will not
always be invertible.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.750
If this isn't a square
matrix, then this

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.740
isn't going to apply.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.590
So this is one way that if I
give you your x, to get your B

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.040
representation of x.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.730
But if C isn't invertible, then
you're just going to have

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.740
to solve this equation.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.690
You're going to have something
on the right hand side here.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.780
You're going to have a change
of basis matrix.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.320
And then you're going to have
to solve that equation.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.960
You know, for an arbitrary
basis, that

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.690
can be pretty painful.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.730
But what do we have here?

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.210
We have a very simple solution
for finding the different

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.030
coordinates of x.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.930
So this is the same thing as
being equal to-- c1 is just

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.950
going to be equal to my first
basis vector, dotted with x.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.930
We say ci is just the ith basis
vector dotted with x.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.170
So c1 is going to be the first
basis vector dotted with x.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:20.570
c2 is going to be my second
basis vector dotted with x.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:25.640
And you're going to go all the
way down to ck is going to be

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.060
my kth basis vector
dotted with x.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.930
And let me show you that this
is actually easier.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:37.720
So let's do a concrete
example.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.260
I want to leave this
result up here.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.760
Let's say that I have
two vectors.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.640
Let's say that v1 is
the vector 3/5.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.290
Let me write it this way.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:57.180
Let's say it's 3/5 and 4/5.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:06.690
And that v2 is equal
to minus 4/5, 3/5.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.640
And let's say that the set B is
equal to-- It's comprised

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.460
of just those two vectors,
v1 and v2.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.460
Now, I'm claiming, or I'm about
to claim, that this an

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.340
orthonormal set.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.370
Let's just prove it
to ourselves.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.990
So what is the length
of v1 squared?

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.260
Well, that's just v1
dotted with itself.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:40.550
So that's 3/5 squared, which
is 9/25, plus 4/5 squared,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:46.740
which is 16/25, which is equal
to 25/25, which is equal to 1.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.170
So this guy definitely
has length 1.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.760
What is the length
of v2 squared?

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.500
Well, it's going to be
this guy squared.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:00.380
Negative 4/5 squared is 9/25,
plus 3-- Sorry, minus 4/5

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.870
squared is plus 16/25.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.500
And then 3/5 squared is 9/25.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.070
And, once again, the length
squared is going to be 1, or

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.290
the length is going to be 1.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.470
So both of these guys definitely
have length 1.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.130
And now we just have to verify
that they're orthogonal with

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.600
respect to each other.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.940
So what is v1 dot v2?

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.570
It's going to be 3/5
times minus 4/5.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:32.610
So it's going to be minus 12/25,
plus 4/5 times 3/5,

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:37.180
which is going to be plus 12/25,
which is equal to 0.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.510
So these guys are definitely
orthogonal with respect to

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.770
each other, and their lengths
are 1, so this is definitely

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:47.460
an orthonormal set.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.910
And so that also tells us that
they're linearly independent.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:11:04.580
So let's say that my set B is
the basis for some subspace V.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.410
And actually, it's not a-- We
don't even have to say that--

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.320
it's the basis for R2.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.350
It's a basis for R2.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.960
And how do we know it's
a basis for R2?

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.940
I have two linearly independent
vectors in my

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.950
basis, and it's spanning a
two-dimensional space, R2, so

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.880
this can be a basis
for all of R2.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.100
Now, given what we've seen
already, let's pick some

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.320
random member of R2.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.480
So if we pick some random member
of R2, let's say that x

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.990
is equal to-- I don't know, I'm
just going to pick some

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.040
random numbers --9
and minus 2.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.120
If we didn't know this was an
orthonormal basis and we

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.550
wanted to figure out x in B's
coordinates, what we would

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.730
have to do is we would
have to create the

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.690
change of basis matrix.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:05.110
So the change of basis matrix
would be 3-- let me write it

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:13.392
like it would be-- 3/5, 4/5,
minus 4/5, and then 3/5.

00:12:13.392 --> 00:12:18.780
And we would say that times my B
coordinate representation of

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:25.530
x is going to be equal to my
regular representation of x,

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:29.020
or my standard coordinates
of x.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.720
And I would have to solve this 2
by 2 system, and in a 2 by 2

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.190
case it's not so bad.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.960
But we have this neat tool here
for orthonormal sets, or

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.810
orthonormal bases.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:44.410
So, instead of solving this
equation, we can just say that

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:52.700
x represented in B coordinates
is going to be equal to-- let

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.620
me scroll down a little bit--
it's going to be equal to v1,

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.510
which is this guy right
here, dotted with x.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:05.610
So it's going to be v1 dot x.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.160
And then this guy right here is
just going to be v2 dot x.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.770
And I can do this because this
is an orthonormal basis.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.322
And what is the equal to?

00:13:14.322 --> 00:13:16.660
x is 9 minus 2.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.800
If I dot that with v1,
I get 9 times 3/5,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:32.160
which is 27/5, right.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:44.300
9 times 3 is 27/5, plus minus
2 times 4/5, so that's minus

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.240
8/5, right.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.650
Minus 2 times 4/5
is minus 8/5.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.790
And then the second
term is v2 dot x.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.010
So v2 dot x.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.000
I get 9 times-- let me scroll
up a little bit-- 9 times

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.970
minus 4/5, that's minus 36/5,
plus minus 2 times 3/5, so

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:13.950
that's plus minus 2 times
3/5 is minus 6/5.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.730
So the B coordinate
representation of x, just

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.430
being able to use this property
right here of

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.400
orthonormal bases, is equal
to-- What is this?

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.610
27 minus 8 is 19/5,
and then minus 36,

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.140
minus 6 is minus 42/5.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.150
Not a pretty answer but, you
know, we would have had this

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.730
ugly answer either
way we solved it.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.670
But hopefully you see that when
we have an orthonormal

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:44.900
basis, solving for the
coordinates with respect to

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.990
that basis becomes
a lot easier.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.220
This is just an example in R2.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.760
You can imagine how difficult
it could be if you start

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.760
dealing with, you know, if you
start dealing with R4 or R100.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.020
Then all of a sudden solving
these systems isn't so easy,

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.380
but taking dot products are
always fairly straightforward.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.530
So earlier in this video when I
said, orthonormal basis, you

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.520
know, what are they good for?

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.440
And I said, you know, standard
basis is good.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.800
That these are good coordinates
systems. You've

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.990
used it before.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.600
You know, I didn't really put
a lot of context around what

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.300
it meant to be good.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.900
But now we see one version
of what it's good for.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:23.850
It's very easy to find
coordinates in an orthonormal

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.570
basis, or coordinates
with respect to

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.610
an orthonormal basis.
