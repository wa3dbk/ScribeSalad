00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.750
We now know how long the object
is going to be in the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.500
air, so we're ready to
figure out how far

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.860
it's going to travel.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.030
So we can just go back to kind
of the core formula in all of

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.140
really kinematics, all of kind
of projectile motion or

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.690
mechanical physical problems,
and that's distance is equal

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.940
to rate times time.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.310
Now, we're talking about the
horizontal distance.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.170
So our distance is going to be
equal to-- what's our rate in

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.060
the horizontal direction?

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.960
We care about horizontal
distance traveled, so our rate

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.550
needs to be the horizontal
component of the velocity, or

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.190
the magnitude of the horizontal

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.400
component of the velocity.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.430
And we figured that out
in the first video.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.540
That is s cosine of theta.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.440
So let's write that
down right here.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.610
So our rate is s cosine
of theta.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.850
And how long will we
be traveling at

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.420
this horizontal speed?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.240
Well, we'll be going at
that speed as long as

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.460
we are in the air.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.780
So how long are we in the air?

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.630
Well, we figured that out
in the last video.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.600
We're going to be in the air
this long-- 2 s sine of theta

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.210
divided by g.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:29.870
So the time is going to be
2 s sine of theta over g.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.170
So the total distance we're
going to travel, pretty

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.320
straightforward, rate
times time.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.160
It's just the product
of these two things.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.230
And we could put all of the
constants out front, so it's a

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.940
little bit clearer that it's
a function of theta.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.730
So we can write that the
distance traveled-- let me do

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.360
that same green.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.670
The distance traveled as a
function of theta is equal

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.790
to-- I'll do that
in this blue.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.460
This s times 2s divided by g
is-- I'll do it in a neutral

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.020
color actually.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.220
This s times 2s divided by g is
2 times s squared over g.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.440
So 2s squared over g times
cosine of theta

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.110
times sine of theta.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.450
So now we have a general
function.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.830
You give me an angle that I'm
going to shoot something off

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.540
at and you give me the magnitude
of its velocity, and

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.860
you give me the acceleration
of gravity.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.620
I guess if we were on some
other planet, who knows?

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.350
And I will tell you
exactly what the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.180
horizontal distance is.
